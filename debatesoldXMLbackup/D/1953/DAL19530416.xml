      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention had been directed to the publication by the Stationery Office of a brochure entitled &ldquo;Some Statistics of Wage Earnings and Hours of Works in 1951&rdquo;<Col N="157" /> and the introduction which describes in brief the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, and if he has noted the closing sentence of paragraph (c), page 6, headed Trade Disputes which states that an arbitration award is, of course, binding, and if it is his intention to withdraw from circulation this official publication and to explain to the International Labour Organisation the reasons for such withdrawal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the fact that there is obviously something inconsistent in a branch of the Taoiseach's Department issuing an official publication which declares that awards of arbitration boards are binding while at the same time the Government responsible for the issue of that publication is acting in a manner in relation to the Civil Service Arbitration Board Award as if that award was not morally binding on the Government?</P>

    <P>Following negotiations with representatives of the Irish Dental Association, proposals with a view to a resumption of dental benefits were made by me to the association on the 5th March, 1953. The association informed me on 16th <Col N="159" /> March that these proposals would be placed before the council and the profession, and that I would be acquainted of their decision.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state the reasons for the cancellation of the cheap fuel scheme in Dublin, and if he is aware that the withdrawal of this scheme now will cause great hardship and loss to old age pensioners, the unemployed, blind persons and widows and orphans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The summer fuel scheme was introduced in 1943 as a temporary measure to ensure that fuel would be available for necessitous persons at a time when it was scarce and difficult to obtain.  That position no longer exists and fuel is now plentiful.  The summer scheme was never availed of to the full extent and the number of persons availing of it has fallen substantially in recent years.</P>
      <P>In Dublin the average weekly number of recipients fell from 20,440 in 1947 to 3,098 in 1952, indicating that there was no longer any substantial demand for a scheme during the summer months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I might say that this legislation was promoted by the hospital governors because they find that the financial position of the hospital is such that, unless additional revenue is obtained, they will be unable to carry on and the hospital will be obliged to close down.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to empower the governors to admit a certain number of patients who will be nominated by local authorities and for whose maintenance in the hospital the local authorities will pay at an approved rate.  This involves an amendment of the hospital's charter and the making of new by-laws.  The by-laws must be approved by the three judges specified in Section 3 or by any one of them.  They must also be submitted to the Minister for Health with a request that he should lay them before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not restrict the governors as to the number of local authority patients whom they will accept.  This number will be specified in the by-laws, but in the course of the discussions at the committee, a figure of 30 per cent. was mentioned, and the representative of the hospital <Col N="166" /> gave an assurance that such a limitation would be applied by the governors. In the light of that assurance a judge, before whom by-laws might be placed for approval, would have difficulty, I am sure, in approving them if they provided for the admission of any higher percentage of local authority patients.</P>
    <P>It is not unlikely that experience will prove that unless a higher percentage than 30 is admitted and paid for as proposed, the revenues of the hospital would not be sufficient to enable the governors to carry on, and if they were to be limited to this percentage the whole object of the Bill would be defeated. I think, therefore, the House should place it on record that, while it would like to see the public charitable character of the hospital maintained to the maximum practicable extent, there would be no objection, if at any future date the governors find it necessary on financial grounds to admit more than 30 per cent. of local authority patients, to their doing so.</P>
    <P>There should, of course, be no effort to force the governors to accept a greater number of local authority patients than they wish to admit, and what I am now proposing would not in any way interfere with their discretion in that respect, but I think it would be very unwise to restrict them should the financial position of the hospital require that a higher number than the 30 per cent. mentioned at the committee should be admitted.</P>

It is feared that the judge who will naturally read the proceedings of the Special Committee and discussion in the Dáil may feel bound not to permit them to go beyond the 30 per cent. I made the same statement in the Seanad and by making it here the judge will see that the Seanad and Dáil have approved of it, which should be sufficient.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to delay the House very much except to remind you, Sir, and the House that I put certain questions to the Minister last night to which I feel the House should get an answer.  Before doing so I would like to make one comment upon something I said last night which might be taken as a reflection in any way upon Deputy Briscoe.  I had no intention of making any reflection whatever on him.  In the discharge of his public duty perhaps he acts with greater regard to the correct thing than many of his Christian colleagues. What I meant to convey was that the majority of the Deputies in this House accepted the direction of Christian teaching in their public and private conduct, and I would leave it at that. It was just a statement of fact.</P>
      <P>The Government Party has not changed in the conduct or in the handling of public health matters since 1945.  In 1945, everyone who opposed that Bill was slandered and attacked; similarly, in the 1947 Act and to-day it is the same.  When it is not Deputies of the Fine Gael Party who are being attacked it is the doctors.  We have here the spectacle of Deputies in this House standing up and saying that doctors will not be allowed to do this and doctors will not be allowed to do that; doctors will not be allowed to dictate to this House.

There is no use in Deputy Burke or anybody else saying that they did not.  Everybody knows they did.  It is strange that every time that somebody opposed Fianna Fáil they must be slandered by Fianna Fáil and that has been done in a most vigorous fashion.

      <P>In my opinion, this Bill will certainly increase their financial resources to a very great extent.  Therefore, when the doctors object to it and oppose it, there must be some good reason.  They must have a valid reason that in conscience they <Col N="170" /> cannot accept it.  Of course, Fianna Fáil would never give them the credit for having a conscience at all.  Nobody has a conscience except those on the far side of the House.  Of course, once Deputy Cowan goes with it, it makes it perfect.  Fianna Fáil will accept Deputy Cowan's philosophy, Deputy Cogan's philosophy and Deputy Browne's philosophy so long as it is in agreement with the Fianna Fáil policy, but let them once change in the slightest degree from what Fianna Fáil thinks and then they are the dirty dogs they were the day before.</P>

Everybody knows the bishops, as the teaching authority in this country, in October, 1947, wrote that letter to the Taoiseach; yet we were not told about it. They did it, as I said yesterday, in the discharge of their duties.  We cannot now ignore what they did in 1945, 1947 and in 1951.  You cannot say that these things never took place.  They did; they are on record and we must know what is the decision now on the matter.</P>

      <P>In conclusion let me say that in my opinion the health of the people of this country can be improved mainly by raising the standard of living of the people, by increasing the amenities of the people <Col N="172" /> both in town and country but particularly in the rural areas so that our people can have a decent livelihood in their own country and in that way eliminate a great deal of the need both for hospitalisation and medical services because no country or no person ever got health out of a bottle, no matter what the druggists may say.</P>

      <P>It never came out of the bottle.  It came out of the good sound food of the people.  In my opinion the Minister should not proceed with this Money Resolution but should now withdraw it, and give us a full and proper statement of his proposals on the introduction of a Health Bill that will meet with the requirements of all sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The health scheme for which we are asked to pass this Money Resolution has been denounced by one side of the House as not meeting the requirements of our people, while, on the other hand, the Bill has been applauded as if it were the last word in perfection so far as health legislation is concerned.  I do not propose to engage in any denunciation of the Bill nor do I propose to waste time by showering on it praises that it does not deserve.  I intend instead to approach the matter from a realistic angle, to contrast the provisions of the Bill with the present standard of our health services to see whether, tested against that background, the Bill and the scheme provided for in the Bill are worthy of support.  Our attitude towards health services is this.  We know, the whole House knows and the poorest citizen in the country knows, that our present health services are entirely inadequate for the requirements of our people.  Everybody knows that there is scope for enormous improvement in our health services&mdash;in our hospital services, specialist services, clinical services, dispensary services and the whole variety of services which are essential to the protection of health in a modern community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> Nobody will attempt to deny that our health legislation has grown up in piecemeal fashion, that to-day it is an inelegant patchwork quilt, that the most urgent need before we can weave any useful pattern through it is to coordinate the existing services, to get one common pattern of health services with a view to combining them in the most efficient and comprehensive manner possible so as to serve the needs of all our people but especially to serve the needs of those whose cheque books do not permit them to utilise the best medical and surgical treatment available in the country. That is our main approach to the problem of our health services.  Above all, we take our stand on the basic principle that nobody in this country should be denied the best medical and surgical attention because of inability to provide the wherewithal to secure that medical or surgical attention.  That is the spirit, therefore, in which we approach this Bill and it is against that background that we want to contrast the Bill with the present situation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I do not think this Bill is worth an enormous amount of praise because I think the Minister has permitted, whether under pressure or by a deliberate act of his own or of the Government, the importation into the Bill of sections which I think do violence to the intelligence of the people and which, I think, put certain people in a most unfair position vis-à-vis the position of others under the Bill.  I think it is humbug to pretend that the Bill is an ideal or satisfactory piece of legislation.  It is not; not that I think it merits any full-blooded denunication either.  I want to approach the Bill from the point of view of what it does in fact without getting into the realms of theory, on the one hand, or dogma on the other.  I think the Bill does very useful things but my complaint is that it does not do enough and what it does is not done comprehensively. Where it does some useful things, the approach is made in a niggardly cheeseparing fashion which, I think, takes from the merits of the Bill.  If the Minister could see his way to reverse that type of approach and to approach the matter in a <Col N="174" /> courageous manner, we could fashion here through this Legislature, a piece of health legislation of which many of us would be entitled to feel proud.</P>
    <P>Now let us look at the Bill so as to keep Deputies from getting too idyllic about it.  Some people claim they are supporting this Bill because it abolishes the means test.  It does nothing of the kind.  This Bill does not abolish the means test.  This Bill imposes a means test and in some respects it is imposing a means test for the first time.  Let that be clear and let there be no attempt to gloss over that particular fact.  This Bill imposes means tests for health services that were not there before.  In case anybody should doubt this, there is a special section in the Bill which says that if, in the course of your declarations as to your means, you make a statement that is not correct you can be brought before the courts and punished severely for making a declaration calculated to get you over the means test which will be imposed by the regulations made under this Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the big deficiencies of the Bill in my view is that no general practitioner services are provided.  I think that is a fatal flaw in the Bill.  I think it is a great mistake that we do not approach the problem of our health services by providing general practitioner services for our people.  Let me say, because perhaps I should have said it earlier, that our approach to the health services was to put the whole business on a contributory basis, the worker paying his share of the contribution; the employer, who should be concerned for the welfare of the worker, paying as well; and the State, as the general provider of essential social services, weighing in with its contribution, so as to put the thing on a basis on which there would be no means test and everybody would get a service, not at the discretion of the county manager, not at the discretion of the Minister and not at the discretion of a local authority but because he was an insured contributor and entitled to these benefits as a matter of right.</P>
    <P>I would wish that this Bill had contained a provision for a general <Col N="175" /> practitioner service because, as every Deputy knows, it is at that point that the greatest expenditure on health, so far as the ordinary man and woman are concerned, arises, the great problem of the ordinary working man having to go to the doctor night after night, paying for every visit, or sending the wife or the children to the doctor. If that process is to continue for two or three months there is a pretty hefty bill to be met at the end of the period. Every Deputy is familiar with the kind of case in which hardworking decent people striving to make ends meet find their whole domestic economy crippled by the fact that ill-health has overtaken one or two members of the family and that the bills to be paid for medical attention are completely outside their ability to pay.</P>
    <P>This Bill is deficient inasmuch as it makes no provision for general practitioner services.  The answer may be made: &ldquo;If there is something wrong with you, go to the hospital,&rdquo; but that is not the remedy.  Nobody says that is the remedy or would think of suggesting to-day that the general practitioner should be eliminated and his place taken by the house-surgeon of a city hospital or of a hospital in a provincial town or rural area.  It is a fatal flaw in the Bill that we have not provided a general practitioner service and I am not concerned as to who pays the practitioner, whether it be the State or the local authority.  I am concerned only with making sure that the ordinary decent working man or woman or their children should have access to the best medical attention, either free, if they cannot pay, or at charges within their ability to pay.</P>
    <P>Let us look now at other sections of the scheme offered to us and for which we are asked to vote this money.  In Section 13, provision is made whereby regulations are to be prescribed by county councils with regard to the making available of certain services to four categories of people.  I need not go over the whole four categories&mdash;I will take one as an example.  Under the Bill, a person insured under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, can be made <Col N="176" /> liable to pay up to 42/- a week for hospital services.  What does that mean?  Who drafted a section of that kind?  If the man is a single man, he gets 24/- a week when he is ill from the Department of Social Welfare, and yet this legislation says that a local authority may draft regulations requiring him to pay up to 42/- a week out of his 24/- a week sickness benefit.  Somebody ought to have sent us an explanatory memorandum telling us how he is to do that&mdash;how he is to pay 42/- a week out of 24/- a week sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>If he is a married man with a wife and at least two children, the maximum sickness benefit he receives is 50/-a week and we have a clause in the Bill which permits a county manager to charge him up to two guineas a week out of his 50/- a week, simply because he has had the bad luck to fall ill.  How is he to pay 42/- a week out of 50/- a week?  Who is to collect it from him? Who suggests he can pay it?  Yet we are going to pass a Bill of this kind in which we ask the ordinary insured man, the roadworker, the agricultural worker, the docker, the tradesman, the builder's labour, the generality of the people one meets in shops and offices throughout the country, to pay up to two guineas a week out of 24/- a week, if they are single, or two guineas a week out of 50/- a week, if they are married.  How can it be done?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will somebody tell us in what way it can be done?  I accept what Deputy Cowan says&mdash;it cannot be done.  It is absurd on the face of it to suggest that that kind of person ought to be asked to pay up to two guineas a week.  We may be told that it is &ldquo;up to two guineas a week, but it will not really be two guineas.&rdquo;  Who is going to decide that?  Is it the House?  Not at all.  Is it the county council?  Not at all. It is going to be decided by the county or city manager in each county or city, and I am not prepared to trust the county managers or city managers to approach this problem in a humane way, nor should we give them power to decide what charges they will fix for every citizen in their area, if that unfortunate citizen or his wife and children <Col N="177" /> are compelled to undergo hospital treatment.</P>
      <P>The Bill puts into the hands of the county manager the right to charge up to two guineas a week to an agricultural worker who, when ill, has to keep a wife and half a dozen children on 50/-per week.  Bear this in mind: under the Social Welfare Act and under the provisions of the National Health Insurance Acts, any person who was a member of the National Health Insurance Society for three years prior to becoming ill was automatically entitled to hospital treatment.  He got that free of charge and is getting that free of charge to-day, but when this Bill passes the county manager may try to screw two guineas a week out of his pocket, out of the 24/- or 50/- a week. That is what we are doing in this Bill if we give the county manager the reins which he is getting in this Bill, the reins and the whip which he will use, if some curb is not put on them before the Bill passes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly satisfied about it.  I know at present the way in which county managers try to recover the cost, or portion of the cost, of hospital treatment from workers in respect of themselves or any members of their families who are treated in hospital in conditions which do not entitle them to free treatment under the social welfare code.  I have seen cases in my own constituency&mdash;other Deputies know of them in theirs&mdash;in which county managers sought to recover sums of money in respect of the maintenance of the wife of a worker or the children of a worker in hospital, and if Deputy Cowan has not had that experience in Dublin he is, believe me, very lucky.  Everybody with any experience of local authorities knows that, so far as provincial local authorities are concerned, the county <Col N="178" /> managers get out after people to recover from them whatever they think they can pay in respect of the maintenance of their wife or children in a hospital.  That is possible under this Bill unless we make provision before the Bill passes to curb the unlimited powers the county manager is getting.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be argued that under this section a worker who is at present entitled to free hospital treatment under our social welfare code has no assurance that his wife and children will get free hospital treatment at present.  That is true.  He has no guarantee that he will get free hospital treatment for his wife and children. Everybody knows that the wife and children in such circumstances can in a great many cases secure free hospital treatment because of the fact that they come into a category of persons who are not just able to pay. In such circumstances they may go into a voluntary hospital and the voluntary hospital will treat them free of charge because, on examining the means of such persons, they discover <Col N="179" /> that there is no hope of getting payment from a person earning £4 or £5 a week with a wife and four or five kiddies to keep.  It is absurd to imagine a person of that kind having to pay.  They cannot pay their way when they are healthy much less pay for their wife and children when they are in hospital.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, the wife, the children and the husband can be required to pay up to 42/- per week if the county manager is allowed to formulate regulations which are approved giving him the power to charge up to that sum.  We sought to amend this particular section.  I do not claim that even the amendment was perfect, but we wanted to argue one aspect of the case, that all this treatment in hospitals should be free.  So far as the insured worker is concerned, he has got no spare money to pay hospital fees.  He is not able to pay his way to-day having regard to the high cost of living and the present wage rates. If I were asked to give any advice to any worker when this Bill passes, I would say: &ldquo;If you have to go to hospital, you had better go.  If your wife and child have to go to hospital let them go by all means.  If you have got to choose between buying food, clothes and providing shelter for your wife and children, provide them with the food, clothes and shelter and let somebody else look after the hospital account.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people have no money to pay hospital fees and they should not be asked to do so.  I would like to see the section in this Bill which enables a county manager to charge fees to such persons completely deleted.  Unfortunately, a ruling of the Ceann Comhairle, which I do not question, deprives us of the opportunity of moving any amendment to that section but this Bill has now got to be faced against the background that it is not now possible to amend the section unless the Minister moves to delete it or unless it is defeated on a free vote of this House.  We are opposed to the section.  We are opposed to putting on these unfortunate people an obligation <Col N="180" /> to pay hospital fees on a formula devised by the county manager and with the resources behind the county manager to collect these fees from such unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>There is other evidence of cheeseparing and niggardliness in this Bill. There is, for example, the contribution required from certain persons with over £600 per annum in order to qualify for benefit.  That is humbug.  I do not know how many people it is estimated will pay that.  I cannot imagine it will be very big.  How is it going to be collected?  Who is going to collect it or will machinery be set up to collect it?  I do not know but it looks to me to be just a subterfuge. It is not just worth the trouble to collect £1 per year from the small group of people who come in under this section of the Bill.  It has no meaning as far as the finances of this measure are concerned.  That does not seem to stand the test of sanity and ought to be deleted, because nobody in his sane senses would expect that a contribution of that kind was essential to the operation of a scheme of this kind.  The Minister ought to get that out.  It does violence to honest thinking and sanity and it ought to be got out as soon as possible because it is a miserable little contribution in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>We have another approach to the Bill.  It is said that certain mother and child services will be made available for the mother and child up to six weeks.  When the child is seven weeks it cannot get any such treatment at all. Does anybody believe that there would be such a profound change in a child's life between six and seven weeks or between six and 16 weeks?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  I am in favour of carrying the child on to 16 years.  Amendments we made with that object in view have again been ruled out of order.  Why limit the provision of that attention to a child of six weeks?  We sought in this Bill to extend it from six weeks to six years.  At six years the child would presumably go to school and would then be picked up under the school services which will <Col N="181" /> operate as fully as if the child never went to school and always remained under six weeks.  In that way the child would get these services from birth to six years and when it went to school it would be picked up under the school services and carried on until the child left school.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to follow the question of morality with the Deputy.  Why limit the provision to children under six weeks?  The child is born with an illness and can get treatment up to six weeks but when it passes into the seventh bang goes the child's free treatment and the parents will be liable to pay.  Who was it who decided that six weeks was a reasonable period?  I see no reason for it. There are mothers and families whose conditions are the same in the seventh week as they were in the sixth week. On what assumption is this based?  The Minister ought to amend the Bill.  We cannot do it because of the ruling of the House.  We sought to do it but were prevented.  We sought to carry the child on and entitle him to these services until the child went to school when he would be picked up and carried through to adolescence by the school services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I come to school services one thing is perplexing in this Bill.  Certain services are only provided for those going to the national school. Why is it limited only to those going to the national school?  The economic position of some families might be such that it would be difficult to distinguish whether their children went to a vocational school or a national school.  Why are those going to a vocational school to be denied the treatment?  Why are those going to the secondary school to be denied school medical services?  The Christian Brothers run a number of secondary schools throughout the country to which ordinary working class children go.  If they go to these schools in the future they will get no school medical services.  Why are they being denied <Col N="182" /> that?  Why are the Christian Brother boys being denied school medical services because they are going to the secondary part of the school?  Why are they being denied these services if they go to any other school?  Are the boys always to stay in the national school?  If a boy can manage by his talents or the strivings of his parents to get into a secondary school at a low fee, is he to be denied the medical services that would be provided if he went to a national school?  What is the reason for these limitations?  These are serious blemishes in the Bill, blemishes which the Minister ought to remove.  The cost of removing them would be relatively small having regard to the total cost of the entire measure.  I think that the Minister ought to make a courageous approach to the problem with a view to eliminating these serious defects from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the regulations and the county manager.  As I have said, nothing that has happened in this country since county managers were first appointed has instilled in me any respect for the county management system.  In many respects, I think it is a tyranny.  It deprives the ordinary man or woman elected to a local authority of the opportunity of expressing his views on a whole range of subjects on which he is much better qualified to speak than many county managers.  When it comes to a sympathetic understanding of the people's needs, I prefer all the time the collective judgment of the county council, no matter how it is composed politically, rather than trust an individual, and sometimes the intolerant judgment of a single county manager. I am opposed altogether to giving the county manager the power to administer or frame these regulations.  I think that if these regulations are to be framed they should be framed by the local authority.</P>
    <P>We have an amendment in to the Bill seeking to make the preparation of the regulations a reserved function so as to restore, in this field, the right of the local authority to have some say in the fees which the local citizens will <Col N="183" /> be required to pay for hospital treatment. I would like to go further than that.  I think that a scheme of this kind has to be as democratic as this House can make it, because I do not think that a scheme of this kind works out in the long run to the advantage of the potential beneficiaries if it is operated on lines which tend towards the concentration of power in a small number of managers.</P>
    <P>I would like to see, and I shall strive on the Committee Stage of the Bill to create a kind of local health committee as part of the county council machinery, the committee to be composed either of the whole county council, or a sub-committee of it, with a tie-in of medical advisers and administrative officers, such as the county manager, the county medical officer of health, the county surgeon and perhaps a practising doctor and a nurse, with a view to giving to that body the power not merely to prepare the regulations but as well the administration of the entire health services in a county.</P>
    <P>I think that a committee of that kind could work well, and that it could supervise the hospital, surgical and public assistance services and the dispensary and clinical services.  In my opinion it could do the work much more effectively than it can be done in the hands of a county manager.</P>
    <P>I think that the old boards of health, in their own way and in their own time where they were efficiently run, did much more in the matter of our health services than has ever been done by concentrating the power of administration in the hands of the county manager.  I think that if a scheme of this kind is to be operated in the rural areas, especially, that there is need to establish a local health committee which should have the power of drafting regulations and the power of approving of regulations.  It should also have the power of administering the various health services which operate in the county&mdash;hospital, clinical, dispensary or surgical or any other type of service.</P>
    <P>I think it is essential, in a Bill of this kind, that we should have some democratic <Col N="184" /> control.  That is all the more necessary because of a peculiar section which the Minister has put into this Bill.  The Minister has put in Section 63 which says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nothing in this Act or any instrument thereunder shall operate to enable the Minister to direct the giving of any service or benefit to any individual person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that, so far as the individual citizen in the County Kildare or in the County Dublin who applies to the local authority for certain facilities under this Act is concerned, the decision as to whether he will get them in the long run depends on the writ of the county manager.  If the county manager is in a difficult mood or views the matter from his particular angle, the ordinary citizen may find that he will get no benefits.  The county manager says that he is not to get them, although this House wants to provide them.  The Minister is taking power to say, if the county manager dares to decide that he will not give a service: &ldquo;That is no business of mine; it is no part of my job to make sure that you get the service,&rdquo; even though this House is being asked to pass this Bill, to provide these services for the people and the money for them as well.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the county manager should be put in that czar-like position if the local people want to get the benefits which this House thinks they should have.  I do not think that the county manager should be put in the position of being able to withhold them from the people.  We have, therefore, the situation that if the Bill goes through in its present form and if the Dáil votes the necessary money, its operation is to depend on the whim of the county manager. If the county manager withholds a service from a particular person, are we to be told that that is no business of this House, and that it is no business of the Minister for Health who is charged with responsibility for the health of the nation?</P>

      <P>There must be some <Col N="185" /> reason for this particular section in the Bill.  I want to make sure that the ordinary citizen, the man with no power, no wealth and, perhaps, even no education, that if he wants a service he is entitled to get it.  If there is a clash between him and the fellow administering the machine, I am on that fellow's side, and I want to make sure that he will get justice.  The only way we can ensure that he will get justice is by making the Minister responsible. The Minister can then be questioned in this House if he fails to take the necessary steps to ensure that the county manager discharges his duty.</P>
      <P>In any event, I want to try and insert that provision, that in the compilation and administration of the regulations, and in the administration of the health services locally, there ought to be a democratically locally elected committee. Frankly, I want to put a curb on the county manager.  I want to make sure that the ordinary people who are represented on the local authority through their local representatives will have some say in the administration of these services, for the financing of which they are going to be asked to raise a very substantial sum of money. I do not think there is anything undemocratic or unreasonable in that.  I think we are quite entitled to say that a Bill of this kind ought to be administered not merely with democratic control at the top&mdash;I shall deal with that in a moment&mdash;but, especially, democratic control at the point where these services impact on the daily lives of the ordinary man and woman and particularly on the daily lives of the weakest and most helpless section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Health Act of 1947 there was a provision for the establishment of a National Health Council, and while the powers of that council and its functions were not too clearly defined, I was, nevertheless, interested in ascertaining what the National Health Council, as established under the 1947 Act, had done.  Such inquiries as I have been able to make have not thrown much light on the activities of that council. It had a pretty large membership.  So far as I could gather it met once or perhaps <Col N="186" /> twice.  My informant said that he knew it met once since 1947, but he thought it might have met twice.  It has no functions in the matter of meeting, unless required to do so, to tender advice to the Minister for which he must previously have asked.  I think it is a perfect cod to put a section in a Bill providing for the establishment of such a heavy-weight body as the National Health Council when one finds that it meets once in six years or perhaps twice.  I do not know who was responsible for killing this baby at birth.  Obviously, its life was not looked on with too much enthusiasm by those who could make it operate.</P>

      <P>I would like to see a council of this kind established.  I do not know whether it is intended to kill this and to allow its fate to be unwept, unhonoured and unsung, or whether it is proposed to put life into a council of this kind.  Quite frankly, in connection with this Bill, forgetting about the 1947 Act, I think some kind of health council should be created at high level; that it would have some obligation to meet on its own; that it should be consulted by the Minister and asked for advice from time to time on any matter on which he needs advice; that the wisdom of issuing regulations in a particular field or of taking this line or that line in a medical or surgical field might be referred to the council for consideration and review, not in an urgent case because we might find it necessary to act speedily but, once the action is over, the wisdom of the action or the prudence of the action or the efficiency of the action might be examined by a council of that kind.</P>
      <P>I think there is a case for the establishment of a council that will function on its own, meeting regularly, say every month or every quarter, having some kind of organisation which can get all the information it requires.  Let it meet in a spirit of goodwill and a desire to help and give all the advice it can to the Minister.  Let the Minister require from it all the help he thinks it can give him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its constitution is important.  I do not want to see it loaded with doctors or doctors in embryo.  I want to have on that council the influence of the ordinary Pat Murphy around the country, the ordinary intelligent man who can contrast things, not against an entirely medical background, but against the realities of life in Ireland in 1953.  I would like to see a relatively small body of that kind constituted with such technical and professional assistance as you can get, and with quite a number of common-sense individuals renowned only for their ability to give a sound judgment in certain circumstances.  If these were tied together and got some official benediction a scheme of that kind ought to work and could give us some kind of <Col N="188" /> democratic advice at top level, drawing from the people knowledge which will be used in framing regulations and in framing approaches to problems and, at the other end, a democratic council, a committee, such as the health committee, composed of the members of the local authority, again with some kind of professional tie-in, so as to make sure that both at top level and bottom level, where the thing is conceived and where the thing is delivered, there will be a democratic approach to the administration of these services.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that our attitude is that we are willing to give this Bill a fair trail and approach the problem from the standpoint of trying to remove from the Bill the blemishes and the imperfections that are obvious even to anybody who is enthusiastically in favour of a Bill of this kind.  I do not think anybody in the Fianna Fáil Benches will deny that there are these imperfections in the Bill to which I refer but we ought to be trying to get rid of them.  One day this Legislature will get rid of them. We ought to do it to-day.  There is no reason why we should perpetuate these imperfections.  We ought to launch this Bill with as few imperfections as possible.  We have an opportunity on the Committee Stage of removing these imperfections and I hope the Minister will approach the matter, not in the spirit that this is the last word, but in the spirit of doing what appears to be sensible having regard to the reasoned objections which have been put up against some aspects of this Bill.  I hope the Minister will remove these objections on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Above all, I hope the Minister will endeavour to get some kind of democratic control in the administration of these health services at the citizen level.  If the Minister will undertake to examine the Bill understandingly and in a spirit of courageous approach to the problems of our health services on the Committee Stage, we may well release for the benefit of the public an instrument very much better than we are discussing to-day.</P>
    <P>At all events, we are prepared to give the Bill a trial.  We could be <Col N="189" /> much more enthusiastic about the Bill if it were a better Bill but it has its blemishes, its faults and imperfections. We will try between now and Fifth Stage to have some of them removed. I hope that those who think like us will also exercise their pressure and influence in the same direction.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we are not denouncing this Bill.  We think a full-blooded denunciation is not, on the merits of the Bill, justified.  Nor are we going to shower any praises which again are unjustified.  We contrast the Bill with the realities of life.  It is in that spirit that we look at the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister when replying to this debate, if he is going to speak again, and during Committee Stage, will indicate that the problems which we have pin-pointed in this discussion will be examined sympathetically with a view to the eradication of the blots on the Bill as at present drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the attitude that has been adopted in this House towards this very important legislation.  I am disappointed that the main Opposition Party, in connection with a Bill which is designed to improve the health of our people, should try to create trouble and to misrepresent the Minister for Health. I regret the suggestion that has been made that certain members of the medical profession were slandered.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that responsible public representatives should stoop so low politically as to try to put over on this House that there is something in this Bill that is not in it at all.  One would imagine by their approach to this matter that the Minister for Health was an unapproachable tyrant. I do not understand what members of the Opposition desire to gain by that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say now to the members of the medical profession who have been writing on this subject&mdash;some of them friends of mine&mdash;that even at this stage it would be better a thousand times if they would meet the Minister for Health, who has always been a courteous, kindly Minister, anxious to co-operate with all sections of the <Col N="190" /> people who are anxious to co-operate with him.  He has never insulted or turned down anybody.</P>
    <P>A responsible Government or political Party will not introduce legislation unless there is urgent demand for it on the part of the majority of the people.  It is understandable that certain sections may be affected by this Bill.  Some people may not understand the Bill and may fear that it will affect them.  I say to the doctors and surgeons who are critical of this Bill that the door is still open for them to come and discuss it with one of the most democratic Ministers that this Parliament has ever produced, a man who does not want to say anything hard against anybody.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition referred to the liberty and dignity of our people.  Is the system of red tickets conducive to the liberty and dignity of our people?  These are the things we have to understand here. There is very little liberty and dignity about these things we have witnessed all over the years.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal about the expenditure under the 1947 Act, but it has more than justified itself as far as T.B. is concerned.  The section in that Act which provided for an allowance for those suffering from T.B. succeeded in doing one thing&mdash;to a small degree, and to a great degree in some cases, it succeeded in putting the men or women suffering from T.B. at mental rest while they were undergoing treatment.  That provision is showing good results to-day and in a very short time we feel that the drive that has been made will show still better results.  We all know, even before coming into public life, that numbers of our people were not treated properly in their young days and were neglected in their older days and are now permanent invalids.  We have institutions which are monuments to the neglect of our people over the ages.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why responsible and intelligent representatives should try to draw a red herring across some piece of legislation that will improve the health of our people without degrading any section.  The doctors have been brought into this argument, but <Col N="191" /> I do not see why they should be brought into it at all.  The doctors are there to give advice; they can go to the Minister and do all the things I have mentioned already.  I have spoken to individual doctors and I have many doctors good friends of mine; they all say this is a good measure&mdash;I am not mentioning any of their names&mdash;and they say that the Minister for Health has met courteously any of them who went to him.</P>
    <P>What is the Fine Gael Party going to gain by misrepresentation of this kind?  Why have we to trifle on a Health Bill on which all sections of our people here, no matter what their political views, should be as one and should say to themselves: &ldquo;We have a job of work to do here and we will try to make this legislation as perfect as possible&rdquo;?  We all agree that these things cost money but if, as a result of this House voting money for this Bill, it pays dividends inside five or ten years in improving the people's health, then we have made a good capital investment.  I tell the Fine Gael Party now that if they think they will succeed in causing bitterness between a very noble profession and the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, they are barking up the wrong tree.  We have enough friends outside yet to see that misrepresentation will not go over.</P>
    <P>Our dispensary services need a good deal of improvement.  No body of medical men have worked harder for our people than the dispensary doctors. They have been hard worked, often overworked, and often badly paid&mdash; some of them, depending on the districts they are in.  A number of our dispensaries are not what they should be.  Some need to be taken down, others need to be built up; and proper services are necessary.  We hear another gentleman bringing in a thing that I definitely think should not be brought in.  We all have our feelings here, our outlooks on Christian principles and Christian philosophy and the beliefs which we all cherish.  I do not see why anyone should use this House to bandy across it the names of our religious leaders, saying they have <Col N="192" /> given this, that or the other decision. I do not know anything that has been said against this measure.  We in this Christian State&mdash;and let me say that for all our Party&mdash;had hoped to improve the people's health without being misrepresented by people who cannot state that they are friends of this country or friends of the Christian principles we stand for, but who come along and bring a red herring across this House and allege that we are anti-this or anti-that.</P>
    <P>The ideal we are aiming at is to make this Bill as perfect as possible, to improve the health of our people as best we can and to make this a State fit for Christian souls to live in.  To people trying to misrepresent us and cause trouble I say: &ldquo;Even at the eleventh hour, change, as the people will not stand for that stuff at all and do not believe in it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Norton's fears about county managers, I do not share his view.  The experience I have of some of the county managers&mdash;those in the City and County of Dublin&mdash;and of the intelligent outlook of some of the officers trying to improve the health of the people and the hospitalisation in some of the places we are controlling, is that they have a far more enlightened outlook and a far more charitable outlook in trying to improve the lot of the unfortunates under their charge than a number&mdash;I am saying this even against some of our public representatives&mdash;of those who were elected by the people of this country to look after these people as they should.  I say that without fear of contradiction.</P>

      <P>It is with a certain amount of timidity that I follow such a distinguished and knowledgeable medical man as the Deputy who has just spoken and who has left the House. He not only knows all about what is best for the health of the country but what has improved the health in certain aspects.  He knows more than that, however.  He knows what is in the mind of every one of the doctors, even though the doctors express their minds very vehemently and very differently from what he interprets as being the minds of the doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not standing up here as an advocate of the doctors, but there is one thing clear to everyone in the House, that in the most emphatic and in the most unanimous way that ever was heard of in medical history the medical men as an organised professional body are against this measure. They are not against this measure because it affects their material interests.  There has been no squabble so far between the medical profession and the Minister in regard to fees, salaries or remuneration.  The controversy between the Minister and his Department and the organised medical profession in this country is that the <Col N="194" /> medical men, the workers in the hospitals, the workers in the districts, the people who have to deal with the human beings lying in bed in their homes or in the hospitals believe that this Bill does not meet the requirements of the present situation.  They believe it is a bad Bill and they believe it is a Bill which will be detrimental to, instead of assisting to improve, the health services.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy, I am opposed to the Money Resolution sincerely and conscientiously because I believe we are not entitled, any of us who are free Deputies, to impose this huge burden of new taxation and increased rates on the community in order to achieve what: chaos and disorganisation in the medical services of this country from top to bottom.  I am opposed to this Money Resolution because never in my experience of a quarter of a century here as a Deputy did I ever see a Bill more covered with camouflage, more shrouded in fog, more fraudulently and dishonestly presented to the public.  This Bill has been presented to the public with an amount of expensive political propaganda costing tens of thousands of pounds to raise hopes in the breasts of the people which anybody conversant with the situation existing knows must be dashed to the ground, shattered in pieces.</P>
    <P>How did the Minister introduce this Bill?  If you read any one of the Minister's speeches inside or outside this House in relation to the Bill what was the gist of his speeches?  All the grand hospitals that are to be built, £17,000,000 worth of new hospitals, all the new dispensaries that are to be built, the child welfare clinics and the improved inspection of children.  What has this Bill to do with any of them? If we want those things and want them badly and urgently it is because of the negligence of the Minister and his Government for 20 years back.  The building of hospitals was part of the programme since the Hospitals' Sweepstakes were established 20 years ago. Legislation with regard to child welfare clinics and all that kind of thing was there before the State was born. The dispensary system has been there <Col N="195" /> since 1864.  School medical inspection has been in operation since the earliest date of this State.</P>
    <P>But what has happened under the Minister and his predecessors, his pals and his chums in the Fianna Fáil Government? Every one of these services has been starved.  You have the same dispensaries as you had 50 years ago. You have the doctor and the midwife and the Minister's Department preventing them from getting a substitute for a midwife if she is sick because they will not give enough to pay for the lodgings of her substitute.  The public health services are starved. School children are only inspected once in four years because an extra doctor or nurse cannot be got to carry out the inspection.  The job which should be done every year is only done every fourth year as the Department refuses to sanction any extra assistance for the work.  But not one of these things requires this Bill.  All that is required to expand or extend the facilities inside the dispensary service or the public health service is a little more of a liberal outlook, a little more of a sensible outlook, a little more of a health outlook from the Minister and his Department, and this Bill, which is calculated to produce nothing but strife between the Department of Health and the organised medical profession, is featured and presented to the public as an essential instrument for the building of hospitals and the provision of the services I refer to.</P>
    <P>These services have no connection with this Bill.  This is a political Bill, a Bill dictated by political expediency, a Bill that the Minister dare not put in front of Dáil Éireann in the presence of Deputies in all its ugly nakedness. It must be camouflaged with all this fraudulent propaganda as if it were going to do things which the Bill is not required to do at all and which should be done without the Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us get down to the Bill.  The health of people in any country is of the utmost importance and the people who know most about health and the health requirements of the people are undoubtedly the medical profession, the medical profession working in the <Col N="196" /> hospitals and the field.  Yet here you have a Health Bill drafted from beginning to end with every representative of the medical profession locked outside the door.  At the end of a period of acute controversy and bitterness, the Department and the medical profession were locked together, locked together, sitting down together with a common mind to make proposals for the better health services of the people of this country.  Doctors from all over Ireland were working there week after week, busy men travelling to Dublin every week and sitting down with the officers of the Minister's Department, working towards success and towards producing a really workable Bill which would be in the best interests of health and at the same time not too severe a penalty on the ratepayers and taxpayers who, the Minister's leader says in one mood, are already crippled with the extra weight of taxation.  Those doctors and those officials were working towards accomplishing something.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes along and takes up office and before he knows what they are doing or whither they are driving he scatters the lot.  He locks the doctors out, takes away the clerical assistance and he says to the doctors: &ldquo;If you like to keep working yourselves I will consider the results of your efforts.&rdquo;  If those medical men were looking for a row and if they were the kind of contemptible politicians that the Minister has labelled them as being, playing politics around sick bodies, they would have been peeved at treatment of that kind and they would have chucked the job of work. The Minister tells them to go outside and work along on their own.  He tells them that: &ldquo;As soon as you have a scheme or some proposals to offer I will consider them.&rdquo;  The doctors continued to work.  They continued to travel to Dublin week after week.  They got advice and information from the greater part of the world and they worked out a scheme.  This was the scheme the Minister had promised to consider.  After months of labour they worked out a scheme and they sent that scheme to the Minister on a particular night.  The second next day they got the Minister's Bill and his <Col N="197" /> White Paper.  That is the consideration their scheme received.  That is the consideration the doctors received from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Now, we have Deputy &ldquo;Specialist&rdquo; Burke referring to the Minister as the most democratic and the most benevolent Minister there ever was.  He will consider any proposals that are made. Why did the doctors not go to him? The doctors are there all the time. There is one thing they do not want; they do not want strife and rows.  They merely want to get on with their work and see people getting better instead of dying.  One would almost be led to believe it would be inside their minds and in their hearts to give advice to any Minister that would not be in the direction of achieving success in the practice of medicine.  The doctors advice is there.  Their voices will not be listened to.  If they put up anything awkward to the Minister, then they are no longer doctors; they are just contemptible politicians, playing politics around health and more concerned with fees than with their patients' well-being.</P>
    <P>That is the attitude of the Minister and that is the reason why we are in the mess in which we find ourselves to-day.  That is why this Bill is thoroughly unacceptable to the medical profession.  They believe it is unworkable, laden down with false promises and stirring up hopes that can never be realised.</P>
    <P>What is all this propaganda of the Minister's?  Let us take it little by little.  The Minister can be very wacky at times.  He can be very lazy at other times and he can be very dumb on occasions.  He is supposed to have studied this Bill very, very profoundly over a number of months. He is supposed to have gone into all the aspects of the Bill, both on the health side and on the financial side. Why does he come before Dáil Éireann now with the whole financial side of the Bill a complete secret? How many Deputies know from the Minister's statement how much any section of this Bill will represent in pounds, shillings and pence?  All they know is that for every 1/- the Minister <Col N="198" /> pays, the ratepayers will pay another. The furthest the Minister can be drawn towards giving any picture of the cost is that it will represent something like 2/- in the £ on the rates.</P>
    <P>Imagine a man who has been a Minister of State for the best part of 20 years and a Deputy of Dáil Eireann for 30 years saying that a Bill such as this will represent 2/- in the £. If the Minister knows anything about health&mdash;I doubt if he knows very much about it&mdash;he must know that if one takes two counties of equal population the health expenses in each county will be approximately equal.  In the poorer county they will be a little bit more. The Minister must know, too, that 1d. in the £ in some counties will only bring in £500 or £600, while in others it will bring in £2,000 or £4,000.  When he talks about 2/- in the £ does he mean the poor counties will only get one-eighth of the services that the wealthier counties with the same population will get?  Of course, that was merely a way of evading an answer to a question that should have been answered in so far as representatives of county councils are concerned.</P>
    <P>I asked him what was his estimate with regard to the farmers under £50 valuation.  They were to go into hospital. First of all they were to be free, but later on there was a fee of two guineas per week.  That was represented as a tremendous boon to these particular people.  I ask the Minister what income he had got from such people over any completed year in the past.  That information would give one an idea of what the cost of that service would be and what the benefit to these particular farmers would be.  What answer did I get?  Away back in last October I was told that it would be too much labour to find the answer to that question, to find out the valuation of farmers that had gone into hospital.  I told him from my own experience that, through any county council office, you could get that information&mdash;anybody&mdash; in an hour or less.  In my public work as a doctor I had very frequently to go to the county council office to get the valuations of 30 or 40 people scattered throughout the country.  But no, it would take too much time.  I pointed <Col N="199" /> out that, in the admission book of the hospital, their occupation was there and their address was there.  In the rate-books across the way, made out in electoral districts, the names of the people were there alphabetically.  A few minutes would get the valuation. I waited three months.  I put down the same question again.  No answer could be given: he had not the information. The only way you could arrive at an estimate of the cost of this Bill either to the ratepayers or the taxpayers&mdash;and that was one of the big factors in the Bill&mdash;would be to find out in back years approximately what the income was from such people.</P>
    <P>Then we come along to the side with regard to maternity&mdash;to the &ldquo;free maternity service for all.&rdquo;  We asked: &ldquo;What is your provision for that?  How many maternity beds have you in public wards?  Are they sufficient to meet the requirements that are there at the moment?&rdquo; I got two answers in the same day&mdash;absolutely incorrect&mdash;with regard to the number of beds.  Even when I tried to correct the Minister, according to his previous answer, he stuck to his guns and said that there were 150 more beds in public wards than are actually there.  I put down the question again a week or two later and I got back the correct reply&mdash;the one I told him was correct.  That is an example of the slovenly way in which the build-up of this Bill has been done.  Everybody who has been in touch with medicine knows that there are grossly insufficient maternity beds in the public wards of this country at the moment.  It is a disgrace, particularly in our cities, how few beds there are for maternity cases. Every leading man in that line of medicine for years back has been referring to the shortage of beds and referring to the fact that the infant mortality rate is, to a great extent, due to the fact that the mothers and the newly-born infants can be kept in a hospital for too short a space of time.  They have to be turfed out of the beds to make room for others.  Yet, in that situation, we have the Minister proposing to throw those public wards open to every woman in the <Col N="200" /> country in childbirth.  How can it be done?  You cannot put more water than a pint into a pint bottle.  If you inject more into it then you shift some of what is already there.  If you invite people who in the past made provision elsewhere to queue up for the public wards of our maternity hospitals, you can only do it by excluding the poor&mdash;and it is insufficient for the poor as it is.  There is no other way of doing it.  Yet the propaganda is that every woman will have her baby in a hospital.  Sixty-six thousand births a year and 954 maternity beds.</P>
    <P>In the County Kildare, which has a birth rate of 1,000 a year, there are eight maternity beds&mdash;and you are going to invite many many more to queue up for those beds.  The propaganda and the speeches give the impression that every woman will have a hospital bed, or any that desire or require it&mdash;and they pay £1 a year. What is the heading of the advertisement? &ldquo;Free Choice of Doctor&rdquo;.  When you read closely into it, what do you find?  You find that they have no choice of doctor at all.  You find, in fact, that they have no doctor at all.  They have their babies at home if they cannot get into hospital.  A doctor will only be called&mdash;read the brackets&mdash;&ldquo;(if required)&rdquo;.  In other words, if the midwife is up against it, if there is subnormality or something peculiarly difficult, then and only then will that unfortunate woman get the service of a doctor.  How many women outside realise that that is the position under the Bill?  &ldquo;Free Choice of Doctor&rdquo; has been featured.  We had the brochure and the picture of the lady in a bed in a beautiful hospital with a little cradle beside her and a beautiful child in it.  You have no beds.  You have no cradles.  You have not even the doctor except in a very exceptional case.</P>
    <P>I said that the Bill was fraudulently presented.  It is unfortunate that health legislation in this country has got so deeply involved with political controversy. Political controversy tempts a Minister&mdash;he is only human&mdash;to engage in exaggeration, in misrepresentation and in propaganda.  This Bill, such as it is, is deep-deluged and hidden away <Col N="201" /> by the amount of false propaganda that is there.  You have farmers up and down this country reading the speeches. They think: &ldquo;Oh, if I am under £50 valuation I shall get medical attendance free.&rdquo;  He will get medical attendance if he is sent to hospital and only if he is sent to hospital.  He will get it in the hospital then for two guineas a week.  A very big proportion of the farmers under £50 valuation are men under £15 or under £10 valuation. Those people are not paying two guineas a week at the moment: they are not charged that amount.  But the Minister refuses to give the figure.  Was a Bill ever presented to this House before that would put an imposition of upwards of £1,000,000 a year on the taxpayers and a minimum sum of 2/-in the £ on the rates of the country without the Minister showing how that money would be expended and what return the people would get for the expenditure?</P>
    <P>We heard from the Minister himself that, as things are, something more than one-third of the population of this country come within the dispensary category, the low income group.  When you add to that the people insured under national health insurance, these two bodies together make up 40 per cent. of the community.  Everything that is in this Bill, they have at the moment and they have it free.  The Bill does not give them anything more. All the lower income group and insured people have at the moment everything that is in this Bill.  Pass this Bill and what will happen?  You have more people feeding out of that dish.  The dish is not any bigger, but you have more people feeding out of it and there is less for them, so that those in the lower income group, with regard to hospitalisation of one kind or another, in regard to attention of a medical man in his district, are obviously going to get less.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the people in the next income group, the people who are taken in up to £600 a year.  Where do they come into this Bill?  If there is one class crying out for aid and attention in this country it is the people of the middle income group, the people <Col N="202" /> over the dispensary level, we will say, £900 or £1,000 a year in the case of families.  These are the people who want assistance when illness strikes them, when they have to go to hospital or if they are having a baby.  That person's wife will go into a private hospital and be there for a few weeks; nurses and hospital alone will come to 12 or 14 guineas a week; there is a bill of £60 or £70 to be met.</P>
    <P>These are the people who really require assistance.  If the Minister was out to assist these people he would not drive them into a public ward where they merely push out of that ward another poor woman.  If that public ward is going to cost, by way of rates and taxes, four guineas a week, we will say, he could give the four guineas a week to anyone, poor or rich, towards their maintenance in a private ward or in a private hospital. It would not cost the taxpayer any more but it would be of assistance to people in the middle income group or what is called the white collar group. That was done in the past.  It is left out of this Bill.  You are going to ensure in this Bill that anybody who pays by way of rates or taxes above the lower income group will be financially induced by the new payments they will be called upon to make to queue up for a bed in the public ward for the beds that are at the moment, entirely insufficient.</P>
    <P>Is that good health business?  Is it in the better interests of health of either poor or rich?  Why not the other?  Why not aid them irrespective of their wealth?  Why not say: &ldquo;If they require hospital assistance we will assist them to the tune of whatever it may be, say, four guineas a week?&rdquo; That would be a genuine gesture showing you were thinking of the white collar workers and people of that class. Why would it not be done?  The answer is this, that the Minister knows very well that all this talk, this fraudulent propaganda, of providing for mother and child, irrespective of income group, is thoroughly dishonest but that that Bill will have to be in operation for some time before people realise the dishonesty and fraud of the whole measure.  The beds are not there.  The <Col N="203" /> provision is not there and the services are not there.  What is there is the political propaganda and the false promises.  It is the most disgusting bit of attempted legislation that I have ever come up against in my life. It is pure shiftiness from beginning to end, a refusal to give any information.</P>
    <P>Other sounder schemes were condemned by the Minister and his colleagues because the financial details were not given.  What details are given in this?  The Minister ambles in here and tells us that the £1 a head for the maternity business is going to bring in approximately, he says, 50 per cent. of the total cost of that end of the scheme.  What does he reckon the total cost of that end of the scheme will be? How many does he reckon will pay the £1 a year when they know what they get for the £1 a year&mdash;the services of a midwife, and a doctor only if required, and a bed in a public ward if there is room, number one, and if those below them in social status are not demanding it in front of them.</P>
    <P>How can any one of those get into a public ward when, as I say, there are in the neighbouring counties, eight, ten or 12 beds, and birth rates of 1,000 and upwards.  Would it not be better to be honest with the people?  Health is not a matter to trifle with.  It is the last thing around which this political game should be played.  The Minister, belonging to the profession to which he does belong, should be the last man to go in for that kind of thing, but he goes ahead on these lines.  The doctors can tell him nothing.  The doctors can teach him nothing.  The doctors know nothing about the health of this country. He locked them outside the door and when he has his Bill through and when it is the law of the land, he will talk turkey to them.  Then he will tell them what they must do.  In the meantime, we have all the hurried talk of the politicians, no compulsion, free choice of doctor, if required.</P>
    <P>No compulsion?  Are you going to compel your dispensary men to work this Bill whether they like it or not? Will they be compelled as part of their job?  Will the voluntary hospitals be <Col N="204" /> starved of funds if they do not toe the ministerial political line?  Will there be compulsion on the hospitals, compulsion on the dispensary doctors?  If there is not compulsion, if they are left as free agents and they feel conscientiously that this is a bad Bill, not of service to the health of the country, that with a little bit of discussion between the Minister and the profession a really sound measure could be produced, and they say: &ldquo;We will not participate in a sham.  We will not co-operate; we will not volunteer to work.  We will just do our job the same as ever before,&rdquo; then where is all this free choice of doctor; where are your participating doctors?</P>
    <P>Would not any businesslike Minister, sitting over any important Department, who was a responsible Minister first and a cagey politician after, get in touch with the workers in the particularly big field that they were going to affect by their legislation?  Do you think his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, if he intended to carry out a revolution in the building industry, would do it without discussion with all those most closely concerned and with life-long knowledge and experience of that trade?  Does he think any one of his colleagues would go gom-acting the way he has gone, playing politics in regard to hospitals? In effect, he says: &ldquo;These people who have to run hospitals, who spend half their lives in hospitals, have nothing to teach me; I have nothing to learn from them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Words fail me in denouncing the insanity of this particular effort of the Minister.  It is going to produce one thing; it is going to produce chaos up and down this country.  It is going to produce chaos in the health services.  It is a kind of chaos that could be avoided, a kind of chaos that should be avoided.  The organised profession are more interested in health than ever the Minister was. They are not interested in politics; their whole life is devoted to health. They want a sound health scheme. They are crying out for better health services.  Material interest is completely subordinate to them but they <Col N="205" /> want to be able to contact the Minister in his Department, to be listened to, not to be assembled just once and told: &ldquo;We shall consider that; go home,&rdquo; and never assemble again. They do not want to talk to a figure on top of a pedestal.  They want to sit down and talk this over with the departmental officers concerned, to work out a scheme and to advise. Above all they want to ensure that they are not to do their work in future as Civil Service driven officials, rather than medical attendants attending the poor and others.  The terror of their lives is writing out papers, documents, returns.  The man who is away travelling on the road by night and by day, when he comes back to his house at night, is to be put sitting down to make out returns, to fill up books, yearly, weekly and monthly returns and ledgers.</P>
    <P>The efficiency of a doctor is judged&mdash; I know that myself&mdash;at headquarters by his efficiency on paper, not by his efficiency in the hospital or in the bedroom of the sick.  The fellow who makes returns can bury them in plenty; he is efficient; but the man who works at home conscientiously, who does his job, worries about his patients, who visits the bad cases once or twice every day, who goes out at night if he wants to take a night temperature&mdash;that is the man you will never get filling forms.  The dread of every doctor's life is to be ridden by officials.  That is one of the things they dread in this Bill.  They want the Minister to be a buffer between the man practising his profession and others.  They want the Minister to be advised by people who understand the work at the periphery and not just the work at the top.  They want a real advisory health council, not a sham council, not a council that will be convened once in a couple of years by the Minister and then packed off.  They want a council of doctors and others who have a direct day-to-day experience of health problems, hospital conditions and so on, a council that would give them the right of assembly under their own steam and the right to approach the Minister, and the Minister only, and to advise the Minister <Col N="206" /> with the right to make an annual report.</P>
    <P>They ask to have that reproduced down the country on a smaller scale in the different health areas and not to be left entirely in each administrative area under any gauleiter such as a manager.  We have good managers and we have bad managers.  We have very successful managers who understand the peculiar problems of professional work.  We have others who think that, because they are managers, they are super-everything&mdash;super-engineers, super-doctors, super-everything else.  They do not want that kind of thing, but that is what the Minister lays down.  I am not advocating a medical council; neither does the profession. They want a council that groups doctors with public men, representatives of the county councils or the general council of county councils, people such as Red Cross workers, people interested in social work of one kind or another.  If a peculiarly medical problem came up, then if the council thought wise they could refer that to a medical sub-committee.  Is there anything unreasonable in a scheme like that?</P>
    <P>Even at this stage I believe that a generous approach to that suggestion would launch the Minister's Bill in a better atmosphere of harmony and understanding than it is likely to get otherwise because if he conceded that much, enough trust, faith and confidence would be generated at such a council, around these medical men, for everybody in the practice of medicine to believe that once they were free to get and to give advice, to meet and study various problems, then the other difficulties in the Bill would be surmounted in time.</P>
    <P>I have only one further word to say and I am saying it as a representative of the City of Cork.  That is that I deplore that Deputy McGrath, the Lord Mayor of Cork, the first citizen <i>pro tem</i> in the City of Cork, should have made use of this Assembly, the nation's Parliament, to launch a slanderous attack on the surgeons, physicians and others who labour day after day in Cork's voluntary hospitals. <Col N="207" /> Cork unlike Dublin has not had that immense development of private hospitals. There are few private hospitals in Cork.  Many well-to-do people have to go into public wards or go without hospital treatment.  The vast majority of the beds are occupied by poor people and the surgeons and others do their work around all these beds equally skilfully.  If one person who can well afford it gives the doctor a fee, is the doctor not entitled to live just as much as the plumber, the carpenter or anybody else?  The Deputy went further in his jeering and sneering to say that they pressurised patients to get money out of them.  I do not represent Cork in the dual capacity that he does but I am familiar with conditions in Cork. I am familiar with the people of Cork, familiar with the hospitals in Cork and I spent more time in Cork hospitals than ever he will spend.  I am familiar with the professional men in Cork, and that was as foul a slander as could be uttered against a very decent, highlyrespected and well-liked body of men and women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Norton, I welcome this Bill with reservations.  It is not anything like what I should like to see produced, but we cannot at all times get the things done that we would like to see done.  The type of health services which I personally would like to see introduced here would be somewhat similar to what we had hoped to see introduced two years ago during the regime of the inter-Party Government. Two years ago, the Government which I then helped to support directed the then Minister for Health to bring in a mother and child scheme.  The direction of that Government to the Minister concerned, Deputy Dr. Browne, was to bring in a mother and child scheme without a means test, and, on the orders of and in consultation with his colleagues, Deputy Dr. Browne set about that task.  I do not intend to repeat what happened.  Let us say that that bitter period should be forgotten, but it is essential for us to know what the views of certain political Parties in the House were at the time and to contrast those views <Col N="208" /> with those which they have expressed here in the past two days.</P>
      <P>At column 760 of the Dáil Debates, Volume 125, the Taoiseach, then Deputy John A. Costello, in a letter to the then Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Browne, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I can assure you that immediate steps will be taken to dispose of any financial matters which may be outstanding in regard to the proposed service, on the understanding that the objections raised by the Hierarchy have been resolved.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He went on&mdash;and this is very interesting&mdash;to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Indeed, I may say that to my mind the financial questions which may remain outstanding are altogether insignificant and susceptible of speedy solution once the larger issues raised in the correspondence from members of the Hierarchy are settled.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The view, as expressed in that statement of the then Taoiseach, was that Deputy Dr. Browne, as Minister for Health, had the blessing of his colleagues in the Cabinet in going ahead with proposals for a mother and child scheme without a means test, provided Deputy Dr. Browne got over certain difficulties with the Hierarchy.  Let us contrast that viewpoint with the statements made here by Deputy Costello and members of his Party yesterday and to-day.</P>

      <P>I am convinced that the measure before the House is only a shadow of that which would have been introduced by the inter-Party Government at the time, and I am perfectly convinced that this measure as it stands is one which must present very little difficulty to those people who are concerned with the moral aspects of health, and so forth.  The scheme is only a shadow of that which we had hoped to see introduced but the significant point is that, even though it is only a shadow, it is meeting now with worse opposition than the scheme which Deputy Dr. Browne had hoped to introduce two years ago.  At that time there was no question about the financial implications. The Leader of the inter-Party Government told Deputy Dr. Browne that &ldquo;immediate steps would be taken to dispose of any financial matters which may be outstanding&rdquo;.  To-day one of their big cries is the cost&mdash;&ldquo;we do not know what the cost is going to be&rdquo;.  I wonder on what are they really basing their opposition?  I do not dispute the fact that they are entitled to criticise the measure and oppose it but I should like to know how genuine is the criticism.</P>

      <P>We have 379,000 holdings in the country and of that number we have in Connacht and the three counties, Kerry, Clare and Donegal, a total of 107,000 holdings under £10 valuation.  Out of these 107,000 holdings in the congested areas, 55,200 are under £4 valuation.  Is it suggested by Deputy Costello that the farmer with a valuation under £10 will, under this Bill, be expected to pay for hospital treatment, for the maintenance of himself or his wife or family? I want the Minister, if he does not mind my saying so, to make reference to that point when he is replying.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to repeat the fact that the West of Ireland is a very poor area economically.  It would be just too bad if there was any truth in the suggestion of Deputy O'Higgins that the impact will come much heavier on the people in those small-holdings in the West than on those who live in the Midlands and in the richer parts of the country.  My interpretation of the Bill at any rate is that it will be a great help to the people who live in the West of Ireland and in the congested areas outside the West.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a long discussion by Deputy Norton on a contributory scheme.  We also had a White Paper issued by the I.M.A. dealing with the contributory scheme.  Do those people know anything about the West of Ireland and the rural areas?  How do they propose setting up contributory schemes in counties like Galway, Mayo, Donegal and Kerry?  Would not the most sensible proposition in regard to these areas be to have a form of contribution through their rates?  If we accept what the Minister's advisers gave us that the maximum charge in counties like Mayo, <Col N="211" /> Galway, Roscommon and Sligo, when this health service is in operation, will be 2/- in the £, then we can get down to brass tacks.  I understand that is the maximum.</P>

That is £1 per year for hospital and specialist services for the entire family group. A farmer with a £20 valuation will, on the same basis, pay £2.  I think that is the most equitable system you could have.  The farmer, whether he be big or small, will pay in proportion to what his valuation is.</P>
      <P>To be quite frank, the reason why I spoke on this measure at all was because I heard the Leader of the Opposition speak yesterday about the farmers under £50 valuation driving round in their Chryslers.  I would like to see Deputy Costello or Deputy Donnellan who, I am sure, will follow on the same lines as Deputy Costello, tell the farmers of County Galway that the men with a valuation of £50 and under who are driving round in Chryslers do not deserve to come under this Health Bill.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's voice is a bit too deep to bray but there are a few Deputies behind him who are good at braying.  I will go away from the small-holdings and get down to the question of treatment.  I suppose I will not be misrepresented again with regard to a statement by Deputy O'Higgins.  He harked all the way through his speech on the question of public wards.  What is the position to-day with regard to T.B. treatment? We have a sanatorium in Castlerea.  It is one of the finest in the British Isles.  In that sanatorium, whether your valuation is £50, whether you are a shopkeeper who can afford a Hudson or a Chrysler or whether you are a small farmer or labourer, you will be provided with beds side by side and get the best specialist treatment that can be provided by the State.  There is no outcry about going into that type of public ward.</P>
      <P>What is all this worrying about, this wish on the part of a certain group of this House to drive a wedge between the different sections of our community by suggesting that the poorer sections of the community will be deprived of their treatment or beds if this measure goes through?  This talk about shortage of beds is complete codology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish.  In 1948 and 1949, when the first big drive came for treatment for T.B., there were very few beds available.  There were very few sanatoria available but when a drive came behind that service the beds became available, sanatoria became available and specialist treatment became available.  Let us not fall at the first fence.  The beds were provided for T.B. and they will be provided for these services as well.  I cannot understand the mentality of any Deputy who suggests that we should <Col N="213" /> have a different type of treatment for one patient as against another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies on the opposite side of the House have said that the Minister gave them no intimation of what the cost of this service was going to be.  Some went further and said that the country could not afford it.  I want to know what is the value placed on human life by the Opposition.  Are we going to put a cost on saving a human life?  Because a person has not enough to pay the specialist and comes into a certain category, has he got to die because the country cannot afford to pay for his treatment?  Is that the outlook?  It is most beneficial to expend money on health services and especially on preventive services.</P>
      <P>At the present time in the sanatoria they cater for T.B. patients.  We have the services of excellent specialists&mdash; thoracic surgeons.  Those men perform highly skilled and delicate chest operations. It does not matter whether the patient has one penny or is worth £1,000 both get the same skilled treatment from these surgeons but there is no extra fee charged for one patient as against another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man comes to Dublin and needs a brain or throat operation the surgeon or whatever specialist is involved carries out his own means test on this particular individual and his bill is based on what he can fleece him for.  I am in possession of bills from surgeons which I can produce to this House. Last week, one of them put a statement in the paper dealing with this health service.  In regard to a throat operation he carried out in connection with a small-holder down the country a fee of 100 guineas was charged.  Why could not that surgeon be satisfied like his comrades in the sanatorium and T.B. services?  All because the real opposition to this comes from Merrion Square.  The real opposition to this measure comes from a small group.  As <Col N="214" /> far as the general practitioner or the dispensary doctor down the country is concerned he is not against this measure and he is going to work it.</P>
    <P>One of the attempts made by the last speaker was to try and sow disunion, create chaos and cause dissatisfaction amongst those doctors.  When the time comes to arrive at what they will be paid for their services, I have no doubt whatever that many of their salaries will be increased.  The trouble is that a few at the top have all the cream at the moment.  Some of that cream will disappear and it will be more equally distributed.  At the present time the cost of private treatment for unfortunate sufferers has sometimes meant that a family has been beggared for three or four years trying to pay off the expenses involved. This Bill will mean that for such people there will be a sense of security and freedom from worry.  That will certainly be so in the case of the small farmer, his wife and family.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons why I am supporting the Bill even though I do not believe that it goes far enough.  I do not want to be too critical of the Opposition in connection with their attitude to the Bill.  Some of them have mentioned the cost involved. That reminds me of what I read of discussions that took place in the Dáil some 25 years ago on the question of employment.  As regards the responsibility of providing work, some of the speakers in this House at that time said that the responsibility lay on the individual himself, that the State had no function and no responsibility whatever as regards providing employment for people.  In other words, that if a man could not get work&mdash;well&mdash;he could starve, and the State had no responsibility for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept Deputy Giles's withdrawal.  The only thing I would like to say is that if some of the people who utilise their position in the Dáil to make remarks of that kind would make them outside the House, I would have great pleasure in dealing with them.  They have not the courage or the guts to make them outside where they could be dealt with.  When they do, I assure the House that there will be no more statements of that kind made inside or outside the House after I have dealt with the individuals concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to the attitude of Fine Gael on this Bill, I believe that the whole build up of it is to give them an excuse of backing out in view of the fact that Labour is supporting the Bill.  There is one important point that I would like the Minister to consider. I would like to see him give it sympathetic consideration.  It is an idea that was behind some of the amendments to the Bill which unfortunately but correctly have been ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle.  I refer to the charge of £1 in connection with the mother and child service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that charge should be remitted, and that the service should be completely free to all mothers, irrespective of means.  Personally, I do <Col N="217" /> not think that, if the charge remains, it will be worth very much to the Exchequer when a deduction is made for the administrative cost of collection. In view of that, I hope the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to the point which I am making that this charge should be remitted. In my opinion, the net result, so far as the Exchequer is concerned, will be nil, or almost nil, when allowance is made for the cost of collection.</P>
    <P>There is another point, on the same aspect of the Bill, which I would also ask the Minister to consider.  I refer to services rendered under the Bill where the responsibility for payment lies with the county manager.  That is a very thorny problem.  My view is that the members of this House who should contribute to this debate in a big way are those who are members of local authorities because they have a great deal of experience in connection with the functions discharged under the Managerial Act.  On this particular matter, I personally would prefer if the power that is to be exercised by the county manager were in the hands of the local authority.  As far as the county managerial system is concerned, the successful functioning of the Bill will depend, to a large extent, on the type of manager who is administering it.  The administration of these health services will impose a big responsibility on some people who, perhaps, may not be suitable for the position.  I make that statement without desiring in any way to cast any reflection on a number of county managers whom I know, and with whom I have been associated.  I think that these points that I am dealing with would perhaps get more sympathetic consideration and be looked at in a more considerate way if the power of decision lay in the hands of the local authorities and not in the hands of the county manager.</P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by saying to the Minister that I differ completely with his Party on many aspects of their policy.  I have never at any time been described as a supporter of Fianna Fáil.  I can be looked upon as having been in the past, and as being in the <Col N="218" /> future, one of their strongest critics.  I will say this much, that they deserve congratulations for bringing in this health scheme.  We can see now, in view of the attitude adopted by the main Opposition Party, that when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dr. Browne, was there, it was God help him if he had got any further with the Bill he had in mind; that they would have found some means or other to sabotage it before it was implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy Dr. O'Higgins indirectly urging the medical profession not to work this scheme, I want to assure Deputy Dr. O'Higgins that, as far as the ordinary medical practitioner in the rural area is concerned, he is most anxious to be given an opportunity to work such a scheme as this, because the dispensary doctor knows that it is an improvement in health services and that he will benefit under it.</P>
      <P>I have been speaking to dispensary doctors who, before this Bill was circulated, were anxious that the proposals in the White Paper should be implemented. Many of them are very much in favour of the scheme.  I admit that the specialist element are doing their best to throw cold water on the proposals and they have, to a certain extent, through the public Press and otherwise, given the impression to the ordinary man in the street that all the doctors in the country are 100 per cent. against this Bill.  That is not so.  In every district one will find medical men who are willing and anxious to work this scheme because they know it will benefit their patients and themselves.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that we could have a better scheme, that this Bill is not everything that he would like to give to the people.  That is understandable because in a scheme such as this, one very important factor is cost. We as a country cannot shoulder a medical scheme with the sky the limit in the matter of cost.  That is impossible. We must produce the best scheme possible having regard to our capacity to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened yesterday to Deputy Costello's speech.  He seemed to have a different scheme of health in mind. <Col N="219" /> He did not get down to details.  He built a castle in the air and said it would be better than the scheme we are now discussing.  Personally, I would have been very interested to hear the finer points of that scheme. It was not going to cost anything like this one would cost.  It would be much cheaper.  Yet it would confer on the people far better services than would be given under this scheme.  I hope that sometime we will get the blue print of that scheme.  The Deputy just painted a shadow.  The Irish people do not like chasing shadows.</P>

      <P>Although the Fine Gael Party have made up their minds, at a very late hour, to go all out against this Bill, very contradictory statements have been made from the Fine Gael Benches.  Deputy Rooney said that the Bill was revolutionary, that it would cost too much.  Some of the other speakers said that we were not going far enough.  Somebody else said that we had nothing new in this, that all the services provided for in the Bill are there already.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said that it was just a case of making more people eat out of the same dish.  We must remember that extra millions of pounds are being spent to arrive at the scheme outlined here and that, therefore, what is in the dish will be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins disparaged the means test.  He said that there was a means test and there should not be. In the next breath he said that hospital treatment should be more or less subsidised, that £4 a week should be paid to everyone and that the wealthier people could pay anything over and above that that would be required to get them into private wards.  That is <Col N="220" /> again drawing a line between the wealthy and the poorer classes.  I do not think anyone will agree with Deputy O'Higgins when he says that these services should be made available to people who have incomes of £1,000 a year.</P>
    <P>For my own part, I am very much in favour of the section in this Bill which makes free medical service available to farmers.  Heretofore, even small farmers had to pay very large sums when there was a case of sickness in their homes.  I know one case of a farmer whose valuation is about £4, where the doctor attended a pneumonia case.  He paid 32 visits and his bill was £32.  This small farmer had to sell one of his cattle to pay off that bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an amendment tabled which was ruled out of order.  I do not propose to deal with it, but I would like to make an appeal to the Minister to amend the section on Report if possible, so as to make the Bill retrospective in respect of the entire period in which the officers concerned are in the employment of his Department.  As I understand it, the Bill will affect those officers only as and from the date on which it is enacted, but I think that carries with it a right to 50 per cent. of the period previously served.  I think those officers are entitled to 100 per cent. of the period of service they have given.  They are not very highly paid officers, many of them, and they are doing very important work.  It will be agreed generally that over the years they have carried out their duties efficiently and well.  Since we have gone so far as to give them the right of establishment&mdash; rather belatedly, no doubt&mdash;and now they have sufficient time to enable them to get their pension rights, we should go the entire distance.</P>
      <P>It may be said that this would involve a very considerable amount of expense, but I understand that calculations have been made which show that there will be no expense to the Exchequer for a certain number of years and that even over the entire period, if this section is amended so as to give these men 100 per cent. establishment rights for pension purposes, the total cost to the State would not be more than £20,000 over 20 years, which would probably be the maximum length of time that the pension would be payable. The Minister should consider this matter sympathetically and see if it is possible to amend the Bill on Report Stage and give these men their full rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister made an error in stating the number of persons <Col N="222" /> affected, when he was speaking here on the 28th March, I understand that there is only one officer with over 36 years' service, that there are only five or eight&mdash;the type before me is not good&mdash;with over 20 years' service, and only 48 with over 15 years' service.  It will thus be seen that the extra expenditure will not come to be met for a considerable number of years and it will not be very severe.  In a matter of this kind we ought to be just to our own servants, particularly in this Department, where we have a large number of young men giving very efficient and satisfactory service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly this is a unique occasion in this House, because I find myself <i>ad idem</i> with Deputy Cogan.  My fear on this occasion is that the Minister may be building up unconsciously what will become an aggravated grievance subsequently. Deputy Cogan has made a reasonable case and if the Minister cannot do it by a retrospective clause in the section, at least he should consider setting aside some fund that might be paid out by way of gratuity to make up the loss of years effected by the Bill.  The Minister is already well aware, from his former capacity as Minister for Education, of what arose over the various types of Orders in connection with pensioned teachers and the difficulties that ensued.</P>
      <P>In this particular case, I think we could recognise the worth of the foresters to the State by such a gesture as this.  I know it involves expenditure, but the ultimate expenditure might be smallest initially and might prevent this subsequently developing into an aggravated grievance of a section of the community that deserves very well of the State.  As Deputy Cogan rightly points out, whatever about the amelioration of the rates of pay of these people in recent years, many of them have spent long years in this service rather inadequately remunerated and the older the forester is the greater his contribution has been to the national effort of forest building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might consider doing something in the Seanad rather than <Col N="223" /> now.  My attitude to the Bill is that, in so far as it is a step forward and is establishing these people, I have no desire to impede its progress.  If all stages of the Bill are given by this House now, the Minister might consider, before the Bill goes to the Seanad, eradicating what might be a distorted and exaggerated grievance subsequently.</P>
    <P>The only complaint that we can find, in the main, from people who are interested in this Forestry Bill and the only communication I have got from people interested in it, is that they are a little bit conscious that this brings down the axe too severely on the people who merit the most consideration. Where young people are involved in this service, they have sufficient years before them to make up whatever might have been lost in pension rights by virtue of this measure, but where the period of service involved runs over 36, 30 or 25 years, the person now affected cannot make up the gap of years.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly urge on the Minister, in the light of the reception that the Bill has been given generally in the House, in the light of the unanimity there is on this long overdue right being accorded to these foresters, that he should try to work out some solution to the question of what grievance might be created through years of service that would not count to the credit of the person, by virtue of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Both Deputy Collins and Deputy Cogan have made a reasonable plea to the Minister and I would like to support it.  This Bill goes a certain distance towards rectifying some of the grievances which some foresters have.  The Minister will agree that, so far, the foresters have been the cinderella of the State services.  I welcome the Bill, but I hope the Minister will be able to give effect to the proposal made by Deputy Cogan and Deputy Collins.</P>

      <P>I am sorry it was ruled out of order.  Even though it may be out of order for a private Deputy to move this amendment, I mentioned on the Second Reading and would like to repeat now that the Minister should introduce an amendment himself to give effect to what Deputy Cogan's amendment was designed to bring about.  When all is said and done, the charge on the Exchequer will be very small.  From a calculation I have made, I can safely say that the effect of this amendment would not amount to an annual charge of more than £1,100. None of that will fall due for payment in the ordinary way before six or seven years and it is a charge which will disappear according as the retired foresters drawing pensions die.  The number of foresters is very small.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been welcomed on all sides of the House.  It has been acknowledged for quite a long time that the establishment of these foresters was necessary.  I need not go into the reasons but one of them is that it will give a sense of security to that section of the State service. From my own experience I can say that above any section of the Civil Service they are giving the best value to the State for their money.  They display genuine enthusiasm in their work and they like to see this particular branch of State activity developed to its fullest.  As we have gone 95 per cent. of the way by putting them on the same basis as other State servants, I think we should go the other 5 per cent.; in fact, I do not believe it is even 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>On the 4th March the Minister, in reply to a question, gave me certain figures about the number of foresters and their period of service, as reported in column 2040 of the Official Report for that day.  On the 26th March, when the Minister was replying to the debate on the Second Reading, he gave figures which seem to be completely at variance with the figures given to me in reply to my question. I was wondering if the Minister was accurately reported on that occasion. As reported in column 1322 of the Official Report for the 26th March, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" />&ldquo;I do not think any case will arise in which existing officers will have less than ten years' service.  According to the statement I have here most of these officers have fairly long service; 14 officers have service of at least 40 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the reply to my question on the 4th March there is only one officer forester given with 30 years' service or over.  According to the figures he gave on 26th March, 59 have service of between 35 and 40 years.  There is something wrong here.  The Minister then said: &ldquo;30 have service between 30 and 35 years; 26 have between 25 and 30 years; six have between 20 and 25 years; two have between 15 and 20 years; and four have between ten and 15 years.&rdquo;  I wonder if there was a word omitted from that sentence?  According to that statement most of these officers have fairly long service.  I wonder should it have read &ldquo;will have&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Will have&rdquo; was what I meant although I may not have said it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister was referring to the period of service which the officers will have.  Without the word &ldquo;will,&rdquo; the statement is completely at variance with the reply to my question.  The amount of money involved is very small.  I should like if the Minister would let us know if I am grossly incorrect when I say that it would not amount to more than £1,100 a year when the maximum number of foresters whom the amendment was designed to benefit would come to receive pension.  I think I am correct also in saying that no charge will fall on the Exchequer before six or seven years and that after a period of 20 or 25 years that £1,100 would have completely disappeared.  For that reason, I would impress on the Minister that this Bill is an excellent one and I am sure will be hailed by the foresters as being something they were long looking for.  It is a measure of justice which they have received at long last, but it will have a flaw in it if the Minister does not amend it along the <Col N="226" /> lines of Deputy Cogan's proposal which was ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that the House shares my views that the forestry service and, in particular, the foresters' grades, are giving good service to the country.  I am glad, also, that the House feels that the present measure is a token of appreciation of the feeling of the Legislature that this service is deserving of recognition even to a greater extent than the Bill provides. In view of the eloquent and humane representations which have been made by the Deputies who have spoken in favour of extending the scope of the provision for recognising past service, I should be very glad, indeed, if it were possible for me to hold out hope, which I feel I cannot, unfortunately, do, that it might be possible for me to introduce an amendment to better the provision that is being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that for those who have been a long period in the service and who may be retiring in a comparatively short period of years, the question is of importance.  The more service an officer can get and the more of his past service is reckonable for pension purposes, obviously the more security he will have when the time comes when he must retire from active work.  The reduction which takes place at that time is, of course, very serious particularly in present circumstances. It is true that the imposition on the State would not be very great from the point of view of expenditure.  The liability would not be very significant for a long time to come.  It is not, however, really a question of expenditure which the granting of the additional service would necessitate; it is the general principle of how far back one should go.  Unfortunately, having gone into his matter very carefully and having tried to achieve the best I could for the foresters, I have not been able to get over the obstacle that it is the universal practice when unestablished public servants are being established to give them half the previous unestablished service.  I am not the only Minister concerned in this matter.  There are, of course, unestablished civil servants <Col N="227" /> in other Departments, very much larger numbers than are in question in this measure.  It is only natural they will feel that the foresters have done rather better than they have done so far.  It might also be argued that they are doing better than some of those who have been established in the recent past.</P>
    <P>I have been compelled to defer to the view that the same general principle should bind all these cases of unestablished public servants who are coming on to the permanent staffs.  If we change the rule in respect of one group, no matter how small that group may be, there is no doubt that a precedent will be created and that precedent will have to apply in all future cases.  The Ministers concerned will have to meet representations and arguments that something more is being done now for a particular section than was done in the past for other sections with even greater claims.</P>
    <P>That is the position and much as I regret it, I cannot hold out any great hope that it will be possible to introduce an amendment along the lines suggested.  The matter has been considered over a fairly long period and has been discussed very fully with the foresters themselves.  I think they understand the position.  I will not go so far as to say that they can understand it from the point of view that I am now expressing.  It is only natural they should press their claims and take advantage of this opportunity to try to get the best terms possible.  I think I have explained to the House the difficulty in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not find myself in agreement with the Minister when he uses the argument that certain unestablished civil servants would feel they would have a similar claim if the proposed amendment were adopted. When we examine the situation we find that the foresters were not established from 1930 up to the present time.  They were established under some previous legislation about which I am not too clear at the moment.  We are now taking a definite step under this Bill to bring a certain group into line.  Had <Col N="228" /> the foresters been established 20 or 30 years ago there would now be no necessity to press the Minister on this matter.  All we are now asking the Minister to do is to make up for lost time, because some of the older foresters will definitely not get the benefit of the long period of service they have given.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is correct to say that other Ministers would, as a result of this suggestion, have to carry out an overhaul in their respective Departments. I do not think any parallel can be drawn between the particular group with which we are now concerned and other unestablished civil servants.  We are trying to tie up the loose ends now and I think we should make a complete job of that.</P>
      <P>I can sympathise with the Minister when he approaches the Minister for Finance or the Department of Finance in relation to this matter.  I know quite well the arguments that will be put up against it.  I know the battle the Minister will have to fight but in bringing in a Bill like this he should go the whole way.  I am sure the Minister fought a good fight but I appeal to him now, between this and the Report Stage, to renew the fight in order to give this small group the fullest advantage of the long and faithful service they have given.  I do not think that is an unfair demand.</P>
      <P>I do not want the Minister to think I am urging him to do something that I myself would not be prepared to do if I were in his position.  I would fight very, very hard with the Department of Finance to get this concession and I would not accept the argument that other Ministers would, in turn, make the same demand on behalf of their unestablished staffs.  I think the Minister would be quite safe in rejecting that argument from the quarter from which he is most likely to meet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a very big problem.  All we are anxious to do is not to deprive these men of the benefit of the long and faithful service they have given. If the Minister ties up this little loose end the Bill will be a complete success.  It can be easily remedied on the Report Stage provided the Minister <Col N="229" /> takes the matter up with the Department of Finance and insists on the concession being granted to the foresters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is an exact parallel between the foresters affected and the other unestablished civil servants in other Departments. In the Forestry Branch there is a certain classification of workers, a clear-cut and definite classification, who have not been established in the Civil Service so far.  I am sure that there are large numbers of temporary civil servants in other Departments. Their employment is of a temporary nature.  Even when they have been employed for a long period and their work might be said to be of a permanent nature more or less they have difficulty in becoming established. Their position is somewhat different from that of the officers affected by this Bill.  Here you have men who have been specially selected and specially trained for a definite office, it being clearly understood from the very outset that their position would be permanent.  It was only through some shortcoming in previous legislation that they were left out.  In addition, there is this difference from other civil servants.  A forester is a productive worker.  Some people have described civil servants as &ldquo;drones&rdquo;, &ldquo;parasites&rdquo;, and so forth. I do not think that that description is accurate but certainly it could not be applied to the forester.  If we were to take into account the value of his work, the acres of land which have been planted under his direction during his years of service, it would so far exceed the value of his pension that the pension would be only a bagatelle.  Therefore, I think you can put such workers into a special class from other civil servants&mdash;and, in saying that, I do not intend any disparagement to other civil servants. Many civil servants are in the position of being unestablished by reason of the fact that they were taken on for what promised to be a short period but that period became so extended as to entitle them to become established. If the Minister examines the <Col N="230" /> Bill again before it goes to the Seanad he may find that there is a clear distinction between these civil servants and other civil servants.</P>

      <P>While thoroughly appreciating the difficulties that may be created even by virtue of a seeming precedent, I should not like to argue that if the Minister were to be retrospective in this legislation it would not be considered to their benefit by other sections of the Civil Service.  I can appreciate that.  Could the Minister have resort to a device whereby he could create a fund under this Bill, by a slight amendment, that would enable him, in lieu, to give a gratuity in respect of unestablished service?  The main defect is that these people, through no fault of their own and because this legislation did not come within a certain period, are going to lose years of service.  If the Minister could get over it in that way he would not be creating the type of precedent which he fears.  I think it would meet what Deputy Cogan, Deputy Blowick and myself have in mind.  Our fundamental aim is to try and get for these people a security when they retire to which we feel they are entitled in view of their service. Would the Minister consider this point between now and the time he takes the Bill to the Seanad?  Would it be possible to create some kind of a fund that would enable him to give a certain gratuity in respect of unestablished service to these people when they retire?  I think that that would completely meet their claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is impracticable.  I have never heard of it.  I can imagine at once the reactions of the Minister for Finance if, having settled reluctantly or otherwise the terms of superannuation for some class, you then come in by the back door and look for a gratuity in cash.  Of course, there is a gratuity at the end, according to the length of service.  It is part of the superannuation code. The lump sum is roughly one-thirtieth: that would mean that 30 years' service would give one year's salary as gratuity, in addition to pension.  It is the usual difficulty that we would like these things to be perfect but, circumstances <Col N="231" /> being what they are, I am afraid we have to keep in line.</P>
      <P>I should like very much to see if I could do anything further but, really, I do not feel, after the examination that the matter has got, that I would be fair to myself or to the House if I suggested there was any hope.  If there is any hope, or if I think there is any opportunity, certainly I will try to improve matters.  However, I am afraid that, at the present juncture, and in connection with the present Bill, there is really not very much hope.  A large number of persons may feel that in this particular case something special is being done which is not being done for them.  We have these people in every Department of the State.  While I am on one side of the fence and the Minister for Finance is on the other, I have to be conscious of the fact that the Minister for Finance is being bombarded by all these still unestablished persons &mdash;hundreds of them&mdash;in all the different Departments.  No matter what we may say here about the importance of forestry or the good work the foresters have done, you cannot expect these people to see that.  Moreover, there are good opportunities in the forestry service.  It is a permanent service obviously.  The opportunities are going to improve.  About half the inspectors in the Forestry Branch have been foresters.  When a young man is trained and gets into the forester grade, if he has the ability and particularly if he has a university degree and a reasonable knowledge either of the science side or the engineering side that would help to make him a valuable person on the inspectorate, there is every probability that, in due course, he will become an inspector.</P>

I fail to see how the Minister is linking up the case that we are pressing now with that of civil servants who are still unestablished. When all is said and done, they have come into the State service knowing exactly the terms and conditions which apply.</P>
      <P>My final word now is to ask the Minister not to close the door altogether but to give us an assurance that between this and the Report Stage he will have another look into the matter and, if the proposal of Deputy Cogan, Deputy S. Collins and myself is not acceptable, see whether there is not any other way in which he can amend the position for the sake of the few for whom we are pressing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to explain to Deputy Blowick quite frankly and honestly, I hope, that under the Agricultural Act, 1931, a few foresters had service remunerated out of special funds which entitled them to the particular benefits conferred by that Act. My recollection of the Department, with which the Deputy is as familiar as I am, is that we had the same difficulty about officials of the old Congested Districts Board.  There was a distinction in regard to the eligibility for superannuation between the former officers of the old Congested Districts Board and those of the Land Commission, and the thing could never be straightened out because, while there were large numbers of people in other Departments who were not able to make that particular case and to say: &ldquo;In the Department in which I am working there are people who are doing the same work that I am doing who are going to get, because of the technical fact that they were entitled under previous legislation, better superannuation terms than I am going to get&rdquo;, that is not the case with other unestablished people, but the fact that they are unestablished is there and I am afraid I have no way of getting over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forester class are a special class, but look at all the people in subordinate posts who, for all I know, may be <Col N="233" /> made pensionable later on.  I would not be at all surprised if at some time in the future all permanent subordinate employees of the State were made pensionable.  That particular class is very conscious of the fact that their employment may be of just as permanent a character as that of those particular grades we are picking out under this legislation.  I have every sympathy with the Deputy but I am afraid there is very little prospect.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In pages 30 and 31 to delete Section 37 and substitute a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Save as provided by this Act no officer, soldier or horse shall be billeted on any citizen without his consent.</P>
      <P>(2)  All statutes and laws authorising, prohibiting or regulating the billeting of officers, soldiers or horses which are in force at the passing of this Act are hereby repealed.</P>
      <P>(3)  When the Defence Forces, or any unit, formation or part thereof are on active service the owner or occupier of premises shall, if ordered to do so by an officer on active service (who is hereby authorised to give such an order) provide:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  lodging and food for officers and men;</P>
      <P>(b)  stabling and forage for horses of the Defence Forces;</P>
      <P>(c)  garage accommodation, fuel and oil for mechanically propelled vehicles of the Defence Forces;</P>
      <P>(d)  such other accommodation, materials or service as the said officer may order him to provide;</P>
      <P>during the period specified in and in accordance with the terms of the said order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  There shall be paid to every person who provides accommodation, food, forage, fuel, oil, materials or <Col N="237" /> service for the Defence Forces in compliance with an order duly given in pursuance of the provisions of this section such amounts as may be prescribed by regulations made, under this section, by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>(5)  Regulations made by the Minister with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance under this section and for the purpose mentioned in this section may, in addition to the matters specifically mentioned in this section, provide for any matter or thing ancillary thereto.</P>
    <P>(6)  If any person contravenes (by act or omission) an order given by an officer pursuant to the provisions of this section he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a period of 12 months or to a fine of £100 or at the discretion of the court to both such imprisonment and such fine.</P>
    <P>(7)  Every regulation under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling such regulation is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 28 days on which such House has sat after such regulation is laid before it such regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to anything previously done under such regulation.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>This is rather a large-looking amendment though it is simpler than it looks. I propose in the amendment to delete Section 37 of the Act and to substitute a completely new section for it.  It is of considerable importance for this reason.  The Act, as before the House now, makes provision for the billeting of soldiers during a period of emergency on the occupiers of premises, and it further provides that occupiers of premises will provide stables for horses, forage for horses and garages for cars.  There are other matters in the section to which I will draw attention later.  The principal objection I have to the section as it stands is that it does not provide specifically that the <Col N="238" /> owners or occupiers of houses will be bound by law made by us to afford these facilities under conditions that this House will lay down in legislation. The section which I propose to delete and which is in the Bill does nothing more than to empower the Minister to make such regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 37 says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) (a)  The Minister may, from time to time and at any time, make such regulations as he thinks fit&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  requiring the occupiers of premises to provide, during a period of emergency, lodging, attendance and food for members of the Defence Forces;</P>
    <P>(ii)  requiring the occupiers of premises and of livery stables to provide, during a period of emergency, stabling and forage for horses of the Defence Forces;</P>
    <P>(iii)  requiring the occupiers of premises and garages to provide, during a period of emergency, garaging for mechanically propelled vehicles of the Defence Forces;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Obviously, that is a very considerable interference with the rights of the ordinary citizen.  It is an invasion of the rights of the ordinary citizen and where it is proposed to make such an invasion it is my view&mdash;and I should contend very strongly for it&mdash;that the invasion should be validated by specific provisions in an Act passed by this House.  Simply to say that the Minister will make regulations to do these things is in my view no safeguard for the public.  In my view that is something that should be objected to in this House.</P>
    <P>The section goes further and says that if any person contravenes, by act or omission, any regulation made under the section&mdash;that is any regulation made by the Minister&mdash;such person shall be guilty of an offence under the section and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £20. It provides, of course, for payments for lodging and attendance under this section, which payments are again to be set out by regulations.  Then it says that where regulations made by the Minister oblige members of the Garda Síochána to do anything in connection <Col N="239" /> with such regulations, the regulations will be made with the concurrence of the Minister for Justice, which shows how serious these regulations can be, as they affect the individual citizen.</P>
    <P>Then there is the safeguarding section on which the Minister I am sure will rely, and which sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling such regulation is passed by either such House within the next subsequent 21 days on which such House has sat after such regulation is laid before it, such regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to anything previously done under such regulation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will contend that there is a safeguard there, that the regulations will be laid before the House and that the House may annul them if it so wishes.  Of course, it is obvious that the House never annuls a regulation such as that.  The annulment of a regulation such as that could conceivably lead to the fall of a Government, and it is very unlikely that the Party that is in power as Government will be put out of office simply because of a regulation which the Minister makes and lays on the table of the House.  The function of the House in regard to such a regulation is to annul it, and if it does not proceed to annul it the regulation becomes a law which affects everybody in the country.  I think it is a fundamental principle that every citizen ought to know the law&mdash;at least the law should be available in such a form that he can readily ascertain what it is.  If we pass an Act here containing about 400 sections dealing with many things affecting soldiers, officers and citizens, I feel that it is only right that the provisions relating to billeting and the obligation of citizens in relation to billeting should be specifically set out in the Act, that it should be stated in the Act that there is an obligation on certain citizens to provide certain <Col N="240" /> prescribed facilities, such as billeting, for the forces, and that if a citizen fails to do that, he becomes guilty of an offence.  I think that is how it should be done, and the introduction of a section such as this by the Minister, just giving himself full powers to do anything he likes by regulation with the citizens of the country, is something that is objectionable in principle.</P>
    <P>Billeting has been provided in this country since the Act of 1923.  It is interesting to look at the Act of 1923. As I said before on other occasions, this Act was based on the old manual of military law and on the Acts that govern the military forces in Britain. The sections in that Act, although taken from very old British legislation, at least did specifically prescribe what the obligations of citizens were. There are quite a number of things in the Act, of course, with which one would not agree, but nevertheless the fundamental obligations of the citizen were specifically prescribed.</P>
    <P>There are in the Act itself some very interesting regulations relating to billeting.  Some of them are rather amusing, but the old British code endeavoured to give the protection to which I refer to the citizen.  They did describe what had to be provided for the Defence Forces.  They prescribed the meals that had to be provided for them.  The soldiers had to get breakfast, a hot dinner and supper on each day.  For breakfast they had to get 5 oz. of bread, a pint of tea with milk and sugar and 4 oz. of bacon.  That applied to this country during the emergency.  The hot dinner consisted of 12 oz. of meat, before dressing, 6 oz. of bread and 8 oz. potatoes and other vegetables.  Supper consisted of 5 oz. of bread, a pint of tea with milk and sugar and 2 oz. of cheese.  Then there was a provision that where an officer or soldier was not entitled to be furnished with a meal, the officer or soldier was to be provided with candles, vinegar and salt, allowed the use of a fire and the necessary utensils for dressing and eating his meal. They went into that elaborate detail in the old Acts relating to billeting, and <Col N="241" /> they did so because there was the conception that, if you were going to interfere with a citizen by law, you should prescribe how far you would interfere with these rights.  In this section, as I say, the Minister suddenly takes to himself power to make such regulations as he likes relating to persons who are obliged to provide billets, transport or stabling.  Rates of pay were to be provided for them, and a number of other matters in relation to it.  I propose in this amendment the insertion of a new section which, to some extent, follows the old law, while simplifying it, and, I hope, modernising it.  The new section starts off with the first proviso as in the old Act:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Save as provided by this Act no officer, soldier or horse shall be billeted on any citizen without his consent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the correct approach to it.  The second sub-section sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All statutes and laws. ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of old statutes and laws still in existence apparently.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... authorising, prohibiting or regulating the billeting of officers, soldiers or horses which are in force at the passing of this Act are hereby repealed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then there follows the positive section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the Defence Forces, or any unit, formation or part thereof are on active service the owner or occupier of premises shall, if ordered to do so by an officer on active service (who is hereby authorised to give such an order) provide:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  lodging and food for officers and men;</P>
    <P>(b)  stabling and forage for horses of the Defence Forces;</P>
    <P>(c)  garage accommodation, fuel and oil for mechanically propelled vehicles of the Defence Forces;</P>
    <P>(d)  such other accommodation, materials or service as the said officer may order him to provide;</P>
    <P>during the period specified in and in <Col N="242" /> accordance with the terms of the said order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the first thing that is limited is billeting and the requisitioning in that way of materials and so on is limited to a period when the Defence Forces are on active service.  In the old days when soldiers had to walk, there was possibly necessity for billeting and for some of the billeting laws we had at the time, but nowadays an army, and certainly an army in this country as we have understood it for 30 years, in peace time, carries on its back its own billets&mdash;the &ldquo;bivvies&rdquo;, tents or whatever else they have.  They either carry them or they are brought forward by transport, so that in ordinary circumstances there is no necessity for the provision of billeting.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in time of emergency such as we understood an emergency and as we understand an emergency in the future, the portion of the Defence Forces we will have moving will be able, from its own equipment and its own resources, to provide for its own accommodation, and there are no circumstances I can visualise in which a substantially large force would be billeted in a rural area.  As to whether, in case of an emergency, the responsible Army authorities would billet them in a town or city would be a matter for the competent military authority on the spot and I want to say nothing about it; but from our own recent experience of war close to our shores, we know that it is not in a village or town or city that large forces will be billeted, unless for the purpose of defence, in which case certain special provisions will be made.  I can understand that, on active service, certain small units of the Army may have to be limited and I have made positive provision for that in the section I have read.</P>
    <P>The subsequent sub-sections which I propose follow to some extent, or are in line with the law as it is at the moment or with the Minister's idea&mdash; that there shall be paid such sums as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, in respect of such billeting; that anyone who contravenes the law shall be subject to an <Col N="243" /> even heavier penalty than the Minister proposes; and that every regulation which in fact relates to payment and ancillary matters will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and may be annulled in the way provided by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The substantial difference between what the Minister proposes and what I propose is that I propose to limit billeting to active service, to provide specifically in the Act that it is the law that a citizen will be bound to billet a soldier, officer or horse when the Defence Forces or part of the Defence Forces are on active service, and on active service alone; whereas the Minister proposes that every citizen can be obliged to billet the Defence Forces when the Defence Forces are mobilised in a period of emergency, and a period of emergency is capable of a very wide interpretation under the Act.</P>
    <P>It is of considerable importance that in regard to laws which impose penalties on our citizens, we should make these positive laws here and should not allow them to be made by regulations prescribed by the Minister.  I see no necessity for that at all and I see no necessity for quite a number of the provisions in relation to billeting, in view of modern advancement.  For that reason, I ask the Minister to accept this amendment and to agree to the insertion of this new section.</P>

      <P>This is another of the sections which was discussed at length by the Special Committee and in regard to which I came to the conclusion that we had more or less satisfied Deputy Cowan on this question of billeting.  He was not objecting to billeting, but he was objecting to billeting by regulation.  That was my impression and when the matter was put to a vote, Deputy Cowan was, I think, in a minority of one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see a whole lot of difference between billeting on active service and in peace time.  They are both, as the Deputy stated, an invasion of the rights of individuals, that is, if the individual objects to anyone <Col N="244" /> being billeted in his house.  As I pointed out in the course of the discussions on other sections, however, it is quite on the cards that the people would be rather inclined to welcome the troops to be billeted on them rather than to object, because they would be paid for the billeting of the troops and, as I said at the time, they would be friendly troops and not the troops of an invading force.</P>
      <P>The desire not to limit billeting to active service is merely foresight.  It is merely looking forward to the possibility, which has never yet arisen to my knowledge, of the necessity, either in a period of peace time or in a period of emergency, for billeting troops. There is no reason in the world why provision should not be made in that respect.  As I say, it has never operated yet and it is quite possible that it never will operate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Captain Cowan talks about the invasion of an individual's right but in sub-section (3) of his own amendment he says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When the Defence Forces or any unit, formation or part thereof are on active service the owner or occupier of premises shall, if ordered to do so by an officer on active service (who is hereby authorised to give such an order) provide:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  lodging and food for officers and men;</P>
      <P>(b)  stabling and forage for horses of the Defence Forces;</P>
      <P>(c)  garage accommodation, fuel and oil for mechanically propelled vehicles of the Defence Forces.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He also in the course of his remarks referred in a belittling manner to the fact that we were including in the section a sub-section which would provide that the regulations would be laid on the Table of the Houses of Parliament but in sub-section (7) of his amendment he states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every regulation under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling such regulation is passed by either such House within the next <Col N="245" /> subsequent 28 days on which such House has sat after such regulation is laid before it such regulation shall be annulled accordingly ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the same thing.  There is practically no difference in regard to our approach to this question.  I think that the only difference between Deputy Cowan and myself is whether it should be done by giving the details in the section of the Act or done by regulation. It is my opinion that the regulation arrangement is the more satisfactory. That is the opinion of the military and civilian authorities who jointly examined this Bill.  They came to the decision that this was the most suitable manner in which it could be done.  The section, as it appears in the Bill at present, is practically the same as that under which the regulations which operated during the emergency were made.  These regulations are not now operating, but the military authorities believe it is desirable to include enabling provisions for them in the Defence Bill.  We went through the emergency period and, as far as I am aware, we did not have to utilise the section in any way in order to billet soldiers in the house of any citizen although I know they were welcomed everywhere they went.  I am pretty certain that large numbers of people would have much preferred to provide them with accommodation rather than that they should have to billet, as they did, in their own bivouacs.</P>
    <P>I only mention that to show that the relationships which existed between the Army and the people were of a most friendly and cordial type.  Far from regarding this as an invasion of their rights, I think the people would have welcomed the troops.  In view of the case put up to me by the military authorities, I could not accept Deputy Captain Cowan's amendment and I would have to stand over the section as it is in the Bill at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a feeling that this power, whether it be exercised by regulation or by the Act, is really one of a wide permissive nature as distinct from one that is, in fact, really operative.  Frankly, Deputy <Col N="246" /> Cowan's proposed section vis-à-vis the Minister's seems to me to be a case of tweedledum and tweedledee.  I cannot see much of the suggested necessity arising at all.  As we are well aware, the military are well dispersed in barrack and camp accommodation. As pointed out by Deputy Cowan himself, formations, when on manoeuvres or during a period of an emergency, carry their own bivouac accommodation and their own camp equipment.</P>
      <P>I feel that this is mainly an archaic and permissive section, and I do not think that there is any danger of interfering with the rights of the citizens. I feel, like the Minister himself, that throughout the years the relationship between the people and their own Army has been considerably strengthened. If billeting becomes necessary owing to a threat or if an internal situation develops that calls for active service, we will find, as we found in the past and particularly during the last emergency, that the people will give their fullest and most willing cooperation to ensure the comfort of our own Army.  We will also find, as the Minister suggested, that the Irish people will ensure that no act of theirs will in any way transgress upon the respect due to the soldiers of their Army.  Finally, in the main, where officers or men were billeted on private citizens through necessity, it was not unremunerative for the people who were so fortunate as to get them billeted on them.</P>
      <P>I have no strong views on the issue raised by Deputy Cowan as to whether this should be specifically enshrined in the Act.  I cannot see any real difference between the section that permits the Minister to do it by regulation and the section proposed by Deputy Captain Cowan.  I think the limits that will be necessary either by regulation or the limits that will become necessary if Deputy Cowan's amendment is accepted are far wider than, in fact, will ever be necessary. I take this to be a general permissive section, and I think it would not be any practical improvement of the Bill if the amendment were accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the question simply this, to regularise and control the procedure that may, unfortunately, become necessary in certain circumstances? No one wants to do this kind of thing, but it has to be done, and if it has it will have to be done, if you like, in unpleasant circumstances.  Is it not, surely, better to provide for that now than to leave it to the compulsion of these circumstances later when action might be taken in not the best way?  There are two things to be considered when you are dealing with things of this nature.  One is that it would be futile and foolish to try and over-provide by tying it up with legal niceties.  The fact is that if you are acting under the compulsion of necessity, and were tied up with legal niceties, well then, I am afraid the legal niceties would have to go.  It is desirable, therefore, in these circumstances that the situation should be, as far as possible, controlled and regularised.  I think that the Minister's provision, taking these two conflicting requirements, is probably the better one.  Very frankly, I cannot lend my support to Deputy Cowan's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one regret, perhaps two regrets.  One is that in my early days, I spent quite a lot of time in studying the principles of individual freedom and liberty.  Perhaps I grew up in a school that is not understood nowadays.  I am concerned with this in so far as it is an invasion&mdash;I think we all admit that it is an invasion&mdash;of the rights of the citizen. It is regrettable that when we are dealing with a matter affecting the citizen&mdash;not the soldier but the citizen &mdash;we have nobody in this House to bother their heads about the citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister brings in his Bill and says this is the advice given to him by the military authorities.  The three Deputies who have been speaking on this Bill have had practical experience of the operation of military law, but we are going beyond military law here. We are going into law that affects the ordinary citizen, and it is a great pity that there is nobody in this House who is interested just in &ldquo;John Citizen.&rdquo; Deputies elected by the citizens of the <Col N="248" /> country say: &ldquo;To hell with John Citizen; let the Minister make any regulations he likes and take any number of soldiers he likes, and if they do what they like, the Minister says let them be brought up in the courts and be punished.&rdquo;  I think it is regrettable that we should be in that position.</P>
    <P>I admit that where there are certain provisions in this that relate entirely to military administration, one could understand Deputies with experience of military administration being the only ones participating in the debate. I wonder, in Britain, say, how a section such as this would be considered? How many members of the British Parliament would say: &ldquo;Oh, it will not be operated against the citizen; we will leave it there to the goodwill of the Minister for the time being.&rdquo;  My belief is that very few of them would say that.  As the Minister has said, I fought this out at the Special Committee, and I was in a minority of one.  There were seven of us present, and six voted to let it stand.  I voted against it.  If I think it is wrong, it is only right that I should still fight it here.  The Minister says that I propose an invasion of rights.  I do, but at least I would have it deliberately set out in the Act of this Parliament what rights, and in what circumstances, those rights could be invaded.  I limit it very specifically to a period and to a place where a section of the Army was on active service, and on active service only.  There is a limited invasion, but it is prescribed not by regulation but by law.  The Minister says that I provide for such a laying of regulations before the House.  I do, but the regulations that I provide for in my amendment are regulations relating only to payment to citizens and to ancillary matters.  There is a very big difference between that provision and the provision which says baldly that the Minister may make such regulations as he thinks fit and at any time.</P>

The positive part of the section is that <Col N="249" /> there may be billeting on active service, where necessary, and that if there is that billeting regulations relating to payment may be made by the Minister and approved by the Minister for Finance.  It is only such regulations, dealing with payment and ancillary matters under that section, that are to be laid before the House, and these may be annulled.  There is a very substantial difference between my amendment and what the Minister proposes.  There is a very big difference between the regulations which the Minister may make and the regulations which deal only with payment and ancillary matters.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Health Bill, 1952&mdash;Money Resolution (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Before moving to report progress, I had pointed out that it is my opinion that the ordinary medical practitioner is willing to operate this scheme but that very severe pressure was being brought to bear on the people from the top and that the country was led to believe that the medical profession, in a 100 per cent. way, was against this Health Bill. From what I have heard in discussing the Bill with some of these doctors, I can assure Deputy Dr. O'Higgins that that is not the position.</P>
      <P>There is one very important new section in this Bill, that dealing with chronically disabled people, people disabled from birth or people rendered disabled as a result of accident, who are not able to work or to provide for themselves or their families.  Treatment will be provided in the case of children and young people and they will be trained in some suitable profession. In the case of older people benefits will be made available.  The very large number of such persons one finds in any district is surprising.  They are really deserving cases.  Under existing legislation they are not entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance because they are not able to work.  The only benefit available to them and their families at the moment is outdoor relief or home assistance.  That was always very distasteful to Irish people as it smacked too much of the British régime in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very distasteful thing that is <Col N="251" /> being got rid of is the red ticket.  A person entitled to free medical service who required the services of a doctor had to go to the warden and collect the red ticket and then produce the ticket to the medical officer.  In very many dispensary districts that I know of the doctor looked down his nose at the red ticket and, if he was called late at night, made all sorts of excuses and usually postponed his reluctant visit to the following day.  A Deputy on the Opposition Front Bench said that the only change contemplated in the Bill is a change in colour in the ticket. That is absolutely untrue.  The patient or his representative will not have to go to the warden and subsequently to the medical officer on every occasion that the services of the doctor are required. He will be given a card. That is a very common thing in national health insurance and other social services.  These tickets have become an accomplished fact and people do not object to having to produce tickets or to fill forms.  It will not be a ticket.  It will be some kind of card or form.  We cannot very seriously object to adding another to those already in the possession of persons entitled to benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  It is misrepresentation, therefore, to say that only the colour of the ticket is changed.  The whole system, thank God, will be changed.  It is a system that was crying out for change.  It is ridiculous that a person entitled to free medical service should have to go to the extremes that such persons have had to go to get the services of a doctor.</P>
    <P>I know many rural areas where quite a large number of people were paying national health insurance where red tickets ceased to have any effect, where the vast majority of the people were not eligible for red tickets and those who were eligible for them were afraid to approach the medical officer with the red ticket.  They postponed asking for the ticket as long as possible.</P>
    <P>Another point&mdash;it is not a new one&mdash; is the extension of the school medical service.  That is the key to the improvement of the health of the people.  That is where the health problems should be tackled.  It would be well to have an <Col N="252" /> advisory service or at least to make pupils of both national and secondary schools realise the importance of good health.  They should be instructed on the importance of good health and the methods by which it can be attained and safeguarded.  That is not included in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The extension of the school medical service will mean that, where minor defects are discovered, immediate steps will be taken to remedy them.  Defects which can be regarded as minor in children, if neglected over a long number of years, may entail hospital treatment, operations and so on, thereby placing a very heavy burden on our hospitals and on State finances.  It is by nipping in the bud these ailments, ills and deformities which will be detected through the school medical service and by remedying them at that stage in the life of the citizens, that we will be taking the greatest step, first, towards cutting down on those ailments and, secondly, towards cutting the amount of money necessary to cure them when they have taken root from childhood.</P>
    <P>Regarding school medical service as it is now run, no one can take exception to the manner in which it is carried out.  It applies only to national schools at the moment.  No one will take exception to its extension in the national school.  Its extension to the secondary schools is something new and it may be that there will be some objection to having secondary school pupils undergo a medical examination.  I cannot see that there should be any serious objection to that.  I know from experience that it works successfully in the national schools.  The only thing about it is that the medical inspection or examination occurs only once a year, which is not often enough and an extension there in the national school is desirable and urgently needed.  I am very glad it is being extended to secondary schools.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, Fine Gael seem to be giving moral support to the medical profession.  It has been suggested by the upper five in the medical profession that the medical profession will not work this scheme, and through the medium of this House they are being <Col N="253" /> backed up by Fine Gael in that attitude. A Civic Guard who recently required a specialist service for his wife and who was not able to pay the 120 guineas sought by the specialist and who therefore had to forgo making specialist treatment available to his wife, will not like Fine Gael's attitude in opposing every section of this Bill. There are many in that profession and in every other profession throughout the country who will not like their attitude.</P>
    <P>We admit that this Health Bill does not do everything that we would wish it to do.  We would like to see in some concrete form the scheme which Deputy Costello left very much up in the air at the conclusion of his Second Reading speech on this financial motion.  We would like to see that scheme and we would like to know the cost of that scheme.  As Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said, we would like to know if it is going to cater for the £1,000 a year people; we would like to know if it is going to cut out the farmer with his £50 valuation and his Chrysler car. These are things we would like to know about it.  In this Bill we are improving on existing health services, extending them and adding to them. The cost of doing that will be a matter which will worry us and worry the Government when framing Budgets in the future.  Deputy Costello started off by saying that he would like to know what the Government's scheme is going to cost.  We would like to know what his scheme&mdash;which is supposed to be so very much better than this one&mdash;will cost.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that the people should not be deprived of the benefits in this Bill.  The Bill should go through quickly, but that does not mean that at any time in the future any Government is prevented from improving on it.  That can be done.</P>

      <P>This debate has been remarkable in its way for the fact that those members of the Fianna Fáil Party who have spoken so far&mdash;and in particular the Independents who support the Government who have spoken in this debate&mdash;have directed <Col N="254" /> their remarks almost entirely, not to the motion or to the Bill but to a vilification of the Fine Gael Party. Every unworthy motive that could be imputed to this Party has been hurled at us.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the Deputy, he devoted a fair part of his speech to the Bill, and I will not say that, comparatively speaking, he was unfair in whatever criticisms he offered to the Party here&mdash;comparatively speaking.  The Deputy would need to be born over again, of course, to stoop as low as some of the gentlemen Deputies of this House have stooped in this debate&mdash;gentlemen Deputies, some of whom were born and reared far from the poor law system and the red ticket, Deputies whose only concern with the public health, according to their speeches, is to poison the minds of the people against a particular political Party, Deputies who feel that they are free and ought to be free to come into this House to hurl insults at this Party and at individual members of this Party, to pour out vilification, deliberately to twist and misrepresent&mdash;deliberately so &mdash;what is being said, and to go so far as to invent statements and attribute them to people on these benches&mdash; statements which were never uttered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the gentlemen who, when one hits back, start to squeal.  I do not like personal abuse.  I detest personal references, but I have never made any secret of this either inside or outside this House, that when I am unfairly attacked I am prepared to hit back and to give at least as good as I get. I am entitled to resent being lectured by certain members of this House who are themselves entirely to blame for the present position in this country, vis-á-vis our medical services, and for the fact that we have not a much better medical service in operation in this country before to-day than is set out in this Bill.  They are entirely to blame because of their own pigheadedness and because, through arrogance, they took to themselves all the knowledge and all the virtues.  I had to sit here yesterday and listen to Deputy <Col N="255" /> Dr. Browne spitting venom at members of this Party until the very air here was almost poisoned by it.</P>

I ask for no greater liberty than that. Deputy Dr. Browne, because he knew more about medicine and medical services than all the doctors in Ireland and because he knew more about the moral law than the Hierarchy, would not give us the Bill we could have had. If he had, we would not be discussing this Bill to-day.  Deputy Dr. Browne, in his venom and bitterness and spleen against this Party, is backing a Party which he does not believe in for a moment.

The Deputy displayed bitterness and spleen against this Party.  Listening to him yesterday, I was wondering whether one should be filled with pity for him or disgust at him.  The Deputy's present state of mind and his outpourings are due to the fact that he knows he made a cardinal blunder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not a bit amused and neither am I.  I have listened to many speeches made in recent months on public health and public health services.  I have read many letters and there is only one &ldquo;Simon Pure&rdquo;; we are opposing this Bill according to Deputy Dr. Browne and others because of a handful of doctors in Merrion Square.  What is the allegation?  Are we being bought by them?  Is it suggested that they control so many votes that it would be worth our while?  Perhaps some of us can speak with more personal experience of the medical services here and the red ticket system than many of the Deputies who grow so indignant about it.  Some of us were not born with silver spoons in our mouth and some of us could not be brought to Merrion Square.  Some of us when we needed medical services&mdash;and we did need them at certain stages of our lives&mdash; were glad to have a red ticket and the services of the dispensary doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies now want to put the whole <Col N="261" /> future of the medical services here into the hands of the county manager and it will be the county manager who will determine the type of medical treatment the average citizen is to get. Some of the Deputies who have been talking like that here during the past two days would not go to the county manager to-morrow if they required medical or surgical treatment.  They would go to some of the men on whom they have poured so much scorn and to whom they have attributed such base motives.  That kind of tripe is, of course, all right for outside consumption by what were described on one occasion here as &ldquo;a lot of neurotic old women of both sexes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I thought some of the members of the local authorities in the Fianna Fáil Party would have spoken here and would in the brave way in which Deputy McQuillan did have stood foursquare for whatever this will impose on the rates in each county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be surprised at how much freedom he will get to speak here.  I will undertake not to interrupt him even once.  I want to hear the Deputy on that point.  We were told by previous speakers that we were being asked to give the Minister a blank cheque.  Actually we are being asked to give the Minister two blank cheques, one on the Central Fund, the other on the local authorities.  Deputy McQuillan, I think, misunderstood the Minister if he understood the Minister to say that he would guarantee that the impact on the rates for the full implementation of this scheme would not be more than 2/- in the £.  I want to be fair to the Minister.  I do not think the Minister said any such thing.  Was it not made clear in so far as anything was made clear during the Minister's visits throughout the country to the various county councils that, varying from one county to another, this might impact on the rates 2/-, 2/6, 3/-and <Col N="262" /> 3/6 in the £&mdash;and the full implication of it could take the impact on the rates to 5/- in the £?  If all the additional services&mdash;buildings, beds and personnel&mdash;that would be required fully to implement this scheme were to be found then it will not stop at 5/- in the £.</P>
      <P>Are Deputies going to go down and stand over that and support it and explain it in their own constituencies as bravely as they do here?  It is all right for Deputy McQuillan to pass it over by saying that 2/- in the £ on a small farmer with a £10 valuation is only £1 a year and to go on to explain the services which he believes a farmer will get for that.  Of course, he is not going to get those services at all.  May I remind Deputy McQuillan that that extra 2/-, 2/6, 3/- or 5/-, or whatever it may be, will have to be paid by every rated occupier in this country whether it be an old age pensioner inhabiting a thatched cottage, a farm worker, a road worker, and so forth?  Of course, our view on this matter is sought to be twisted. It is said that we are opposed to spending the money.  We are opposed to spending the money on this scheme because it will cost, both centrally and locally, something in the neighbourhood of millions of pounds, and because, under this scheme, people will not get and cannot get value for that money.</P>

He showed clearly <Col N="263" /> many major defects in it and where it will operate to the disadvantage of certain classes of the people.  I should like to ask the Deputies who were present in the House this evening when Deputy Dr. O'Higgins was speaking what they thought of that speech.  I think that any Deputy, unless he is completely blinded by prejudice, will have to agree that that speech was impressive.  It came from a man who obviously spoke from practical experience. It came from a man who had a lifetime of experience as a dispensary doctor and as a county medical officer of health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that it was not a speech that had not a political approach in certain aspects.  I should say, in fairness to the Minister, that he was out of the House for the greater part of the speech: he cannot be in the House all the time.  I think that Deputy Dr. O'Higgins examined the Bill, its possibilities, what it could do and what it could not do.  He gave us a picture of the existing services in the country and how they operate.  He gave us a picture of the hospitals we have in this country and of the number of beds that are available there.  I thought it was a very impressive speech.  I thought that Deputy McQuillan who spoke after Deputy Dr. O'Higgins would have adverted to it. He only adverted to it very slightly. As a matter of fact, I was more than <Col N="264" /> disappointed to hear Deputy McQuillan say, on a matter like this that is supposed to be of some importance, that the only reason he decided to speak was because&mdash;he alleged&mdash; Deputy Costello said something about farmers under £50 valuation riding around the country in Chrysler cars. Again, at the risk of being sneered at, I want to say that I want to see a first-class medical service in this country. I know the old medical services in this country.  I am old enough to have been, for a period before their abolition, a member of an old board of guardians.  My knowledge and experience goes back to that time.  I had myself, in my upbringing, to take advantage of the poor law medical service and the red ticket: I know something about it.  For a number of years I acted as a warden issuing red tickets and I know something about it.  No Deputy in this House could use words stronger than I should like to use to denounce the dispensary service in this country and the so-called dispensaries in this country.  We do not need this piece of machinery to deal with that or to remedy it.  We do not want this expensive machinery or this blank cheque.  We do not want a mere change of a red ticket for a white card.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham allowed his enthusiasm to run away with him when he said that, under this Bill, we were changing the whole system.  We are doing nothing of the kind.  The Minister himself does not even pretend to do it.  What we are trying to do and what we are insisting on doing is to proceed to build up a medical system in this country, at the same time refusing point-blank to seek or accept the assistance of the only people who have real practical and technical knowledge &mdash;if I may use the word &ldquo;technical&rdquo; in this respect&mdash;of the medical services and their operation in this country. Every Deputy who has spoken from the opposite side of the House, and the Independents who have spoken, is an expert who considers that the doctors know nothing about it.</P>

      <P>I want to repeat that it is the county manager who will decide, and I also want to repeat that the Deputies who intend to vote for that would not put themselves or any member of their families in the hands of the county managers if they were <Col N="266" /> seriously ill.  Those of us who have experience of it over a long number of years know quite well that county managers being, if you like, even overscrupulous with regard to their responsibility to the local authority and to the Minister will not sanction sending a particular patient to a hospital.  Let me put it the other way, that a doctor dare not take the responsibility even in a case of emergency of sending a patient to a hospital in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or elsewhere in case the county manager would subsequently refuse to sanction the payment or to be responsible for the expenses.  That has happened, and there is no Deputy in this House who has any knowledge of local authority work who does not know that what I am now saying is true.</P>
      <P>We are asked to pass this Resolution committing this House to provide an unspecified sum of money out of the central Exchequer.  In the passing of this Resolution we are asked to give the Minister the power to impose on the local authority the responsibility for an unspecified amount.  I would not be frightened of the cost if I thought the people would get value for it.  I am perfectly satisfied that under this proposed machinery they will not get value for it, and that neither this particular Bill nor any other Bill can be operated in this country fully and successfully and to the benefit of the people without the co-operation and the goodwill of the medical profession.</P>
      <P>It is sheer nonsense for Deputies to be saying&mdash;and if they are trying to cod the people outside they ought not to be trying to cod themselves&mdash;that all the doctors in this country except a few in Merrion Square are in favour of this Bill.  I venture to express the view that the Irish Medical Association represents and speaks for far more medical men in this country than a few doctors in Merrion Square.  We will not get over it by a cheap sneer at the ten, I think, misguided physicians in the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  Some of them are very eminent men.</P>

If the members of this House are to have their ills and ailments, such as they may be in the future, attended to and confined to a scheme such as is set out here and subject to the approval of the county manager, there will be fairly frequent by-elections and that in itself might not be a bad thing either.

We heard the Leader of the Opposition deliver a long and violent speech in regard to this Bill.  He pounded the desk and thumped the seats; he thundered against the Bill but when it was going through the House he could only whisper a faint &ldquo;No&rdquo; against it and whispered so faintly that even the Chair did not hear him.  But apparently he decided to come into this House and endeavour on one side to capture as much support as he could from those who are opposed to the Bill throughout the country, and on the other side to try to placate the Labour Party.  Thus he twisted, wriggled and turned right through his speech.  He made no coherent statement and he gave no coherent reason why he would go into the Division Lobby to oppose this motion.  He evidently thought that by a great display of sound and fury he could impress this House just as he makes an impression on simple jurymen who see him and hear him only once.  We have heard and seen him so often that we see the hollowness of his thunder and lightning and the utter and complete insincerity of his remarks.  He said he was opposed to the Bill, not because of its cost to the ratepayers and to the taxpayers, but every member of his Party who spoke in this House attacked the Bill because of its cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to approach this debate with a sense of responsibility. I am trying to point out that the whole of the arguments of the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;and we must treat him with respect as the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;futile though they may be, must be treated as if they were advanced in a responsible manner.  Deputy Costello said that he is against this Bill on fundamental grounds, but through the whole length of his speech he set out no fundamental issue upon which he is opposed to this Bill.  Therefore, he failed to submit any fundamental objection to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to say here and now that, unlike Deputy Costello, I am not trying to placate the Labour Party or any other Party.  I want to say that I have an objection to this Bill on one fundamental issue and that is that it is tending to extend the sphere of State influence over the lives of our citizens.  It is tending to advance Stateism further than it has ever been advanced.  On that issue, and on that issue mainly, I am against the Bill in addition, of course, to the question of its cost which I think could be avoided if we were to approach this whole question in an entirely different way. There are too many people, far too many people, at the present time dependent on the State for their very existence, too many people eating out of the hands of officials and eating out of the hands of politicians if you like. That is what it amounts to.  I think that our approach to socialistic legislation of this kind should be to limit the number of people who are depending upon State services for their existence and to increase the number of people who are depending on their individual efforts, upon their own industry and thrift, for their food, their clothing, and the medical attention that they require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> It may be said, of course, and has been said, that at the present time one-third of the population of this State are in the position of depending completely upon the taxpayer, the ratepayer and the public authorities for medical treatment.  People say that since one-third of the people are so dependent and can manage to survive on that type of service, there is no reason why it should not be applied to the other two-thirds.  I join issue with those who advance that viewpoint.  I say that instead of having one-third of our population depending upon public funds for medical treatment, we should seek to release some portion of that one-third from that position.  We should seek so to raise the real standard of living of our people that more and more people would become independent of State aid in regard to medical treatment.  I think that is the fundamental approach we should make to this Bill.  What advantage is there in subjecting an ever-increasing number of people to dependence upon State services for medical treatment?</P>
    <P>Fundamental it is also that every citizen of this State, whether he be rich or poor, is entitled to the best medical, institutional and surgical treatment that can be provided.  If a multi-millionaire and a tramp are knocked down on the road by a motor car, I hold that both of them should be taken to hospital and given equally good treatment, first-class treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the position which should prevail, as far as we can manage it.  It is better to make that clear because there have been suggestions that there are pauper beds, and pauper treatment for one section and another type of treatment for another section.  I say that if that exists anywhere it should be eliminated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question then is how to finance that treatment and it is on that issue that I differ with the Minister.  The proposal in this Bill <Col N="271" /> is that that first-class treatment should be financed to a larger extent by the general taxpayer and by the ratepayer. Again, the suggestion is made that the means test should be removed completely from public health services.  I think we had better get our minds clear as to what we mean by the abolition of the means test.  Those who advocate the abolition of the means test are mainly those who want to establish a socialistic system of administration in this State.  They do not say that we must abolish the private ownership of property; they do not say that we must abolish individual enterprise because they know that these things are reasonably popular but they go another way about it.  They say that we must abolish the means test. They know that once you completely abolish the means test in regard to the supply of essential requirements, you abolish private ownership of property, the individual ownership of enterprise and everything that is connected with free society.  A campaign for the abolition of the means test all along the line is a campaign for the complete abolition of human liberty, the complete establishment of what is described as the Welfare State, or what is better known as the slave State.  It is part of a general campaign for the socialising of all industry and of all means of livelihood.</P>

    <P>No Deputy has approached this matter in a reasonable way and sought to give sound reasons why the means test in regard to medical treatment should be abolished.  If, as Deputy Morrissey pointed out, the person has had the experience of being rescued from serious ill-health through the skill of hospital nursing and surgical and specialist treatment, surely the first person to pay for that service is the person who has received the benefit of that treatment and who has been restored to health, provided he has the means.  If, as I said, a tramp and a multi-millionaire are knocked down on the road, they should both receive first-class treatment, but while the tramp could only thank those who rescued him and brought him back to health, the multimillionaire should be expected to contribute reasonably to the hospital and <Col N="272" /> to the doctors who have treated him.</P>
    <P>That principle should prevail right through our medical services.  If a man has the means, why not let him pay? What is wrong in asking the man who has sufficient wherewithal to pay for treatment to pay the entire cost or a portion of it?  Once you accept that principle you accept the means test.  I do not think there is any alternative and I do not believe for one moment that there is any alternative to a means test in regard to medical treatment and many other things.  People will go on to say that, once you establish the abolition of the means test in regard to medical treatment, you have thereby established a case for the abolition of the means test in regard to food and clothing.  Logically, if a person is entitled to free medical treatment, without regard to means, he is equally entitled to free food, free clothing and free everything else, and you are moving directly towards the slave State in which everybody is fed, clothed and medically treated by the State and in which all the means of providing for these is collected from them by the State.</P>
    <P>That is the fundamental issue upon which I am opposed to this Bill. Instead of proceeding further along the road towards socialised medicine, we should call a halt and should endeavour to establish a greater measure of independence and self-reliance amongst all sections of our people.  I say that without suggesting for one moment that I am satisfied with existing health services.  I am not satisfied that the dispensary system we have at present is proper to a Christian community.  I believe that, whether a man is in a position to pay for medical treatment or not, he is entitled to meet his medical adviser in reasonably worthy surroundings. The dispensary, to start off, should be modern and up to date and every county council will agree that that should be so.  There is at the moment an effort being made in that direction and it is an effort which should continue.</P>
    <P>Let us have, right from the dispensary to the very top, the very highest and most expensive form of treatment, at least as good treatment for the poor <Col N="273" /> as for the rich.  That should fundamentally be our policy with regard to medicine, medical treatment and all forms of health services; but let us ask those who can pay to pay and give to those who cannot pay that service absolutely free.  Let us give it free to those who cannot contribute anything whatever to the health services.  That is the only reasonable way to approach this question.  If we are to go further and do as has been suggested, give free medical services to those who can afford to pay for them, we are taking a step that will eventually lead to a demand for free clothing, free food and free everything by every section of the community who can afford to pay for them.  That is a policy into which I do not think the House should allow itself to be rushed.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the views expressed by Deputy McQuillan, Deputy Dr. Browne and others.  They are motivated by humane motives, but they do not realise, I think, the dangers inherent in the policy they advocate.  It is always very easy to advocate and almost establish a case for bad legislation by citing hard cases. Hard cases, we are often told, make bad law and that is true in this respect as in others.  Cases have been cited of comparatively poor people, people in the middle income group, who have had to pay very high fees for medical and surgical treatment.  That will happen occasionally.  On the other hand, I could cite instances of men in the same group who have received the highest form of specialised treatment and who have been charged very moderate fees.  I have known cases of specialists who have spent hours and days treating particular patients and who have charged only a nominal fee, so let us not condemn the medical profession because of one particular case.</P>
    <P>Let us weigh the whole issue carefully. If we do that, we will find that the medical profession on the whole try to implement the means test in a fair and reasonable way.  They try to be lenient with those in poor circumstances and collect from those who, they believe, are well-to-do, higher fees.  Whilst that means test operated by the medical profession, by the <Col N="274" /> voluntary hospitals and by the freelance specialists of the present day may not always be equitable and fair, it will on the whole be found, on examination, to be just as equitable and fair as any means test operated by a public authority, a county council, a county manager or the officials of the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Amongst the arguments put forward by Deputy Costello against the Bill was one which I would not for a moment advance and which I do not think any serious opponent of the Bill would advance.  It was that this Bill would not receive the co-operation of the medical profession when it is an Act.  I think that statement is a slur upon the medical profession as a whole.  I think that when this Bill becomes law doctors, no matter how much they resented it or opposed it when it was going through, will endeavour to implement it conscientiously and faithfully in the discharge of their duties.</P>
    <P>Doctors sometimes find on the operating table patients whom they may not personally like but that does not ever influence them in the slightest degree in giving those patients the benefit of their specialised skill.  In the same way, when this Bill becomes law, I am quite sure that the medical profession as a whole will endeavour to make the best of it and implement it to the best of their knowledge and skill.</P>
    <P>Another argument used by Deputy Costello which I resented was his contention that the contribution of £1 for the persons in the higher income group was a fraudulent subterfuge to get over the moral objection to a free-for-all scheme.  In other words, he was suggesting that the Irish Hierarchy would be bamboozled in some way by this proposal.  I think that is a highly offensive reference to the Irish Hierarchy.  I do not think that it would be possible to mislead or confuse our Irish Hierarchy in relation to a moral question, and I refuse to accept that unworthy suggestion of Deputy Costello.</P>
    <P>I think that he could have made a good case against this Bill, but he failed to do so.  He failed not because <Col N="275" /> I think he lacked the ability&mdash;we will all concede that Deputy Costello is an able man&mdash;but because he wanted to placate in some way those doctrinaire socialists of the Labour Party, Deputies Norton, Larkin, and those other men whom he felt he might have to try and co-operate with again in an attempt to form a Government.  He was playing politics in his speech right from the beginning to the end. Because he was, he makes, I would say, a complete hash of the case which he was called upon to make against the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a case against the Bill on the lines which I have indicated&mdash;a case that we have gone far enough already in regard to socialised medicines, socialised welfare services and socialism of every kind in this country.  We have got to turn back from that course.  A case can also be made against the Bill on the ground that services of this kind are becoming too expensive.  There are too many people depending upon State aid of every kind and too few people paying for those services through their industry and toil.  Under those two headings a reasonable case could have been made against the Bill and a reasonable case could be made against it.  I think that reasoned argument would be far better in dealing with a matter of this kind than the type of personal abuse in which Deputy Morrissey indulged.</P>
    <P>I think there is no reason why anyone should go out of his way to attack Deputy Dr. Browne or Deputy McQuillan for the case they put up. I disagree with both, but at the same time I think they were sincere.  I think they are absolutely sincere in putting their case forward, and I think they put it forward in a reasonable way.  Not alone do I consider that health services have become too expensive, but I feel very strongly against the system by which 50 per cent. of the cost is imposed on the local rates.  Some people will say that local rates are as fair a system of taxation as general taxation.</P>

      <P>That is an opinion but it is an opinion upon which we can afford to differ.  It is a question upon which I differ very, very strongly from Deputy Mac Fheórais.  I think that rates are a form of direct taxation and are levied upon people irrespective of their means.  Very often you will find the person with a very small yearly income bearing a very high burden of direct taxation in the form of rates.  It just shows how out of touch some leaders of political Parties are when we had Deputy Costello asserting that there are farmers in the country with less than £50 valuation driving around in Chrysler cars.  I have never seen a Chrysler car in rural Ireland owned by a farmer under £50 valuation.  Any cars that may have fallen into the hands of farmers are cars that have been rescued from the dumps of various garages, old Fords and baby Fords dating back to 1936. These would be the cars that Deputy Costello mistook for Chryslers.</P>

      <P>I think that the chief Opposition Party&mdash;Fine Gael&mdash;would have done themselves more justice and this House more justice if they had approached this Bill in a more serious way and put up a more reasonable case against it.  Had they done so they might perhaps&mdash;I do not say they would&mdash;have converted the Government to their point of view, but they approached the matter in a purely narrow political way, trying to capture as much support as they could from those who are against the Bill and at the same time trying to placate the Labour Party, who are in favour of it. They endeavoured to pursue in this House those two absolutely contradictory and mutually destructive policies and, as a result, they have made no case, so far, against the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I have made the foundation of a case against it mainly on the ground that it is an advance in the wrong direction.  It is a departure from self-reliance and independence on the part of our citizens.  It is a step in the direction of State socialism and State medicine.  I think there are <Col N="277" /> many things which we can do to improve the health of our people irrespective of and outside this Bill.  I agree, of course, with a free-for-all service in respect of T.B.  That was an argument that was used very strongly in favour of this Bill.  When you are dealing with infectious diseases you must seek by every possible means to curb and eradicate them.  But, in regard to the ordinary ailments to which human flesh is heir, I think it is better leave every citizen to pay his way if he can afford it, and if he cannot, then by all means go to his rescue with all the resources at your command and give him all the services that are at the disposal of the State.</P>
    <P>I was rather sorry that Deputy Larkin did not intervene in this debate. He was one of the few who did speak on the Second Reading of the Bill, and on that occasion he made a reasonable case in support of it.  He based his case not on political catchcries or on personal abuse, but on the solid conviction &mdash;on sincere conviction, I think, as far as he was concerned&mdash;that we ought to have a completely free-for-all socialised medical service in this country as a first step towards a completely socialised society in this State.  I think anyone can respect a man who believes in a policy of that kind and is sincere about it, but I have no respect for men who, like Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Costello, try to face both ways, and at the same time try to cover up the futility of their arguments by personal abuse and by studied rancour, bitterness and hatred.</P>

      <P>The only reason why I have risen to speak is because of Deputy Cogan's intervention. I have no intention of defending any particular person in this House on this measure, because the Labour Party stand on it is the Labour Party stand and no more.  I did listen carefully to Deputy Cogan.  Having listened to him for 20 minutes, I must say that I do not know whether he is for or against the Bill.  I know whether he is for or against Deputy Costello, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party, but still I do not know whether he is for or against the Health Bill.</P>

      <P>I know how he is going to vote.  He is going to vote against the Bill because the Government majority is assured by the support of the Labour Party.  One can recall the many serious measures that went through this House in the last 12 months, notably the Budget Resolutions, and, because Deputy Cogan thought that the Government might fall, he consequently voted for all the Resolutions contained in the Budget. He is perfectly safe in voting against the Health Bill because he knows that the Labour Party, certain Independents and other Deputies are going to support this measure.  Therefore, he can be a Simon Pure.  He can go down to Wicklow and say that on moral grounds or economic grounds he protested against it and can talk about consistency.  His consistency is very well linked up with those who support the Government.</P>
      <P>I was amused to hear Deputy Cogan talk about the furtherance of State control.  One would imagine that there were no qualifications required for the receipt of State assistance or local authority assistance in the case of people who are unfortunate enough to have to have recourse to either.  One must be a widow in order to get the widow's pension, one must be unemployed to receive unemployment assistance or unemployment insurance benefit, and to receive any type of medical assistance or medical benefit one must be sick.  People in this country, no more than in any other, do not take pleasure in being sick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every argument that I have heard Deputy Cogan make in this House over quite a long period has been an argument against the Welfare State. He is very tender when he is handling Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan.  To other Deputies, to members of the Labour Party, he attributed base motives to-night because they go out full-blooded in favour of a health scheme, one better than that which is before us.  Deputy Cogan said that there are too many people depending on State assistance.  He has often said that before.  When he says that there <Col N="279" /> are too many people depending on State assistance then, by inference, he means people who are unemployed, people who are sick or who have injured themselves, widows and orphans and the like, but Deputy Cogan never complains about the State assistance that is given to the farming community. I am not against the State assistance that is given to the farming community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan talked about means tests.  He speaks sometimes in favour of means tests and of how necessary they are, but if there is a premium, or a subsidy, to be given to the agricultural industry, it is given to the fellow with five acres of land and equally to the man with 5,000 acres.  I do not see much justification in that.  As regards the State assistance which is given to the people who ordinarily receive it under the Department of Health or the Department of Social Welfare, there are very strict qualifications which, first of all, have to be complied with.  For that reason, I do not think we should allow ourselves to be scared by Deputy Cogan or by people who talk in the same strain about State interference and of the advance towards the Welfare State.  As long as our people need assistance, whether it be in the form of cash or medical or hospital treatment, I say that there is still room for improvement.</P>
    <P>While this measure does not fulfil everything that our Party would desire, we do say that it represents an advance, however small, on the health services that we have at the moment. One would think, according to Deputy Cogan, that it was a pleasure for people to be sick.  He said that there could be malingering.  A doctor very soon discovers whether a patient has a cancer, ulcer or is suffering from T.B. A person does not pretend to have these diseases merely for the purpose of going into a hospital bed and of being attended by nurses and doctors. Even as regards this Bill there are certain qualifications laid down.  These health measures apply only to persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, to persons whose means are less than £600 a year, and to farmers whose valuations are £50 a year or less.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> My complaint about our health services and their administration is that the people representing the ratepayers on the local bodies have never been generous enough.  I would be prepared to subscribe, to some extent, to statements made in this House by some members of the Fine Gael Party, that if the medical services we have at the moment were administered to the utmost extent which the law allows, we might not need a Bill of this kind at all.  We have seen during the last month or so, in practically every county, where, when the county manager, no matter what some of us may think of him, asked his local authority for a certain sum of money for roads, houses and health services, there was a cry from the two big political Parties for a cutting down of the rates, thus denying the people the services and the employment they require.  We all know that the medical services of the country could be in a far better position and could be administered to a much fuller extent if those elected to our local bodies faced up to their responsibilities and did what they are charged with doing as members of a local authority&mdash;by providing the services they are allowed to provide under the different Health Acts which have been the law over many years.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Norton said to-day, while we approve of this Bill and of the principle of it and welcome any advance that is in it for the prevention and cure of disease, we still feel that it contains many defects.  We trust that the Minister will recognise that before the Bill leaves the House and will try to remedy them.  The objections raised by Deputy Norton to-day cannot be denied.  If the Minister wants to make this a better Bill and to obtain greater approval for it in the House and if the ordinary members cannot amend it in Committee he should take steps to remove the objections that have been pointed out.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise, as Deputy Norton did, the importance of taking from the manager certain functions which he has, if you like, by default in this Bill.  There are reserve functions for a health authority or a county council. These reserve functions must be <Col N="281" /> specified but, by reason of the fact that certain functions of the health authority are not embodied in this Bill, they must be functions of the manager or executive functions.  For that reason I would appeal to the Minister, as did Deputy Norton, to consider the setting up of a health authority, if you like, the reintroducion of the old board of health.  That board or a committee similar to that board would be in a far better position to advise the county medical officer of health, the county surgeon or the various medical people concerned as to the best way of interpreting this Bill and of administering the various parts of it in their functional areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also raised the question to-day of the contribution of £1 to enable certain people with incomes over £600 to participate in certain parts of the scheme.  I submit that that is pure fraud and subterfuge.  The Minister in all decency should cut out that particular sub-section altogether and should not have any charge because the charge of £1 is so nominal as to mean nothing.</P>
    <P>Another point which was raised and to which we subscribe is the care of infants up to the age of six weeks. Anybody knows that up to the age of six weeks one cannot say that the baby is out of the danger period.  The child who is born with an ailment or who contracts an ailment within one, two or three weeks of birth does not automatically shed the disease after six weeks.  It is considered to be a baby up to two years of age.  If the Minister would not make it six years he ought to consider making it something like two or three years.</P>
    <P>These are matters which would be better discussed on Committee Stage. I merely rose to refute some of the suggestions that Deputy Cogan made and to warn the House, although I do not think the House needs any warning, to have no regard whatever for any of the warnings that Deputy Cogan may give the House about State interference or progress towards the Welfare State.  We have quite a long distance to go in this House with regard to social services and measures of this kind before we can become <Col N="282" /> annoyed or before Deputy Cogan can become annoyed about having set up in this country any type of socialist or Soviet Government.</P>

      <P>I intend to be very brief.  If it were not for my opposite number, Deputy Morrissey, I would not have intervened at all.  Deputy Morrissey seems to think that everybody is afraid of losing a few votes in his constituency.  That is his idea in saying that members of local authorities are afraid to get up and express their views.  I have expressed my views at the county council, when we were opposed by the Fine Gael members.  It was no surprise to me yesterday to hear the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Costello, attacking this Bill although on the Second Reading it passed without a word.  I am sure that during the Recess Deputies met local people, especially Fine Gael members on the county councils, who said: &ldquo;You have let us down.  You never raised a word. We made a great fight against the Minister at meetings in the country.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I did not hesitate in voting for the increase of 2/- at the county council meeting.  Neither will I hesitate in voting for the Money Resolution here. I know the needs of some small farmers in my constituency.  They are not the farmers of £50 valuation that Deputy Costello mentioned as driving Chrysler cars.  Last Sunday a small farmer of about £20 valuation asked me if the Health Bill had gone through yet.  I told him that it had not.  This man had had a serious operation.  He was removed to a private hospital.  On coming out he was presented with a bill for £100.  Such a person finds it hard to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>I am not one of those who would abuse the Medical Association.  I know that the doctors are a decent body of men.  The doctors that I have talked with have never raised this question with me.  I do not set out to abuse anyone or to indulge in personal abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague Deputy Morrissey seems to have a great fear of the county managers.  I have had considerable dealings with the county manager for my area.  At any time that I approached him in connection with a <Col N="283" /> person who could not afford to meet hospital expenses I always received a very fair hearing from him.  The county manager is a human being and knows the needs of the people. Deputy Morrissey need not worry one bit.  I am not a bit afraid of losing votes in my constituency.</P>

      <P>This Bill is only a shadow of what was promised to the people.  The ratepayers of Dublin have to pay their share of the cost.  The moment the Minister demands 2/-towards its cost to be put upon the already overburdened ratepayers in the City of Dublin up will go the rent of every room-dweller in the city.  In the case of the occupier of a single room, who can afford to pay only for a single room, the rent will go up by 2d. or 3d. There is no use in humbugging the people and telling them they are getting something for nothing.  There appears to be a desire to put that over on the people.  There appears to be a desire to induce the people to take sides one way or the other.</P>
      <P>Take the case of the young man who has purchased his house recently or who has built it under the Small Dwelling (Acquisition) Act and who is getting certain remission of rates for a number of years.  That young man is going to be faced with an increase by this Government of 2/- in the £ on his rates in the City of Dublin.  The Minister has not told us what it is going to cost.  I say the cost should be borne by a national Government out of national funds, through the Minister making available the sum necessary to carry it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened in Dublin City? Every time we see a new hospital opening in the city or county, it is handed over to the municipal authority, which has to accept nearly all the expenses, I think, of running it.  It is a good thing that the hospitals are provided, but the expenses are not paid from the proper authority, the national Exchequer.  Dublin Corporation has 30,000 tenants and they will have to pay for this Bill, while many of them <Col N="284" /> will not need and will not ask for any benefit from it.  Many wise people hope it will never be necessary for them to undergo long terms of sickness or surgical treatment and they will get no benefit from the scheme. They will hope to enjoy good health and get good employment at decent wages to keep themselves and their families without needing to avail of any provision under this Bill.</P>
    <P>A Bill like this has been promised for the last three or four years, and it has to get a start somewhere.  It is just one step in the proper direction, but it requires at least 100 amendments. I am going to support it, I am going to vote for the Bill, for the purpose of helping the various groups here to amend it and make it a decent Bill worthy of an Irish Parliament.  If one votes against it and it chances to be defeated, there is no opportunity of improving it, and it will be held up for another year or two.  I am hopeful that the Bill will be improved and that it will help the sick or surgical patient, who sometimes lives in dread of the bill of expenses that will be presented to him when he gets better. A week or two before he gets better, there is a means test to find out how much he can afford to pay.  He cannot get better under those circumstances.</P>
    <P>When the Bill passes this stage&mdash; because of Deputy Cogan's speech, it looks as if the Bill is assured a passage &mdash;it will require about 100 amendments, and I will support the suggested amendments in every division that takes place here.  However, the Bill will get a start.  I earnestly hope that the amendments will be carried, but we know that amendments are not usually accepted, or are accepted only in a few cases with very bad grace. I cannot see the Bill being approved other than by the acceptance of some of the amendments the Labour Party has promised to put down.  I am earnestly hopeful that when the Bill does pass and also when a new Government comes in, we will have a Bill that will meet the requirements of the people without crushing the already overburdened ratepayers of the City of Dublin.  By ratepayers I <Col N="285" /> do not mean only those with big properties or owning big shops: I am thinking of the people in this city who rent ordinary tenant dwellings and who will get a bill increasing their rents maybe by 3d. or 6d. a week to meet the Minister's demand on the corporation for 2/- towards this scheme.</P>
    <P>I see nothing much in this Bill.  The Minister and others have talked about changes and about dropping the red ticket.  I have a good recollection of the red ticket.  It is certainly a system that ought to go, but what are we going to get instead?  If we are not going to have a red ticket, we will have a white ticket and what is the difference between them?  There will still be forms to be filled in, telling about a person's means and the earnings of the family.  Because of that, I see little change in the system under this Bill. I am hopeful that the country will wake up and give us a change of Government and that the inter-Party Government when they get back will bring in the measure that they promised to the country some time ago.</P>
    <P>I am supporting the Bill because I believe it can be amended and will be amended.  I am satisfied that the Minister will accept a few of the amendments.  Even then, it will not be a Bill such as was promised to the people.  Never do they hope to get the Bill that was brought out with a glorious flourish of trumpets, which was going to give them a free-for-all scheme.  There is a means test in almost every section of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a question I would like to ask.  It must not be thought that Deputy MacEoin is the only one who wants to know whether there will be any objection made to this Bill by the Church authorities and organisations and by their journals that wrote against the last Bill.  Are the things that they wrote about withdrawn?  Has the Minister satisfied the Church authorities that there is nothing wrong in this Bill, nothing they can object to as being seriously wrong?  Not one member of the House has said yes or no to that question yet.  Has the Bill been accepted by the Hierarchy as <Col N="286" /> meeting the requirements of the general teaching of the Church?  I am putting that point forward to get some information from the Minister, as no member of his Party has said yet what the position is.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is assured of a majority, I earnestly hope that the Labour Party will press every amendment to a division and give us an opportunity of improving this shadow of the Bill that was promised to the country.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate, I imagine the Minister will agree, that the discussion on this Money Resolution has not been conducted in a less acrimonious atmosphere.  Unfortunately not merely for this House but for the country generally and for the health services, this whole question of health services seems to have become closely involved with sharp political issues.  It is a pity that such an intolerant attitude should have been adopted in approaching the whole question.  We here in this House should readily recognise that we are not by any means qualified to express categorical views on every subject under the sun, that we often would benefit by discussing objectively problems such as this and by taking advice, or by listening to the advice offered and examining it to see on what basis it rests.  Listening to the debate, it occurred to me that valuable suggestions were made by Deputy Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party and also by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.  I do not know whether the Minister was in the House when both Deputy Norton and Deputy Dr. O'Higgins spoke, and whether he detected what I considered to be the basis for a possible agreement with regard to the whole health question. Deputy Norton suggested that the National Health Council, which has been in existence for some years but was not availed of, should be tied in with this Bill or at least with the health services which the Bill provides and given at least some statutory advisory function.  If I did not misunderstand Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, he suggested that a proposal of that kind would go a long way to meet some of the objections which were being made against the Bill.  It does occur to me <Col N="287" /> that we should, at this stage, in a calmer atmosphere, seek to find general agreement on a proposal of that kind.  No doubt even then there will probably be a great many points of disagreement in regard to the detailed provisions of the Bill, but I would think that the Minister would himself welcome at this stage some basis upon which a modicum of agreement could be found on the future development of the health service.</P>
      <P>I know that probably in the first instance the provisions of this Bill were largely a matter of political expediency. But, irrespective of the original reasons which prompted the introduction of this Bill, I would hope that the Minister would appreciate the value of seeking to get some basis of agreement among all Parties in the House and also of the medical profession outside and other bodies interested in social matters generally.  As I said before, I do not think any of us can claim to be the sole fountain of wisdom and knowledge in the country and therefore that we should welcome the assistance of outsiders in helping us to provide the best possible medical services.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will have an opportunity of examining carefully the proposal Deputy Norton suggested and also the echo which I seemed to find in the statement made by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins to-day.  The difficulty, of course, about a measure of this kind when you get into the arena of acrimonious discussion is that one is inclined to lose sight of the main possibilities and the main objectives. It would be a mistake if that were done in the case of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains a great many provisions that are good and necessary. On the other hand, I think that the general approach to the question is unsound.  In my view, the most fundamental question in regard to the improvement of our health services depends upon making available the physical facilities required.  This Bill does not approach that question.  It is agreed on all sides that the number of beds in hospitals is inadequate for present wants.  It is agreed on all sides that our dispensaries are in many respects a disgrace to the whole <Col N="288" /> medical service.  It is agreed on all sides that we have not got the clinics which are required to administer a proper health service.  As I said, I think we ought not to make the mistake in matters of this kind of devoting too much time to the consideration of the theoretical aspect of the scheme instead of approaching it from a functional angle.  I feel that the passing of a health service scheme of one kind or another in this House is to a large extent a waste of time unless we are prepared to make available the physical facilities required to implement it.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I was rather shocked to find that within a few weeks of the publication of the present Bill an announcement was published in the papers that the Minister had abandoned the plans for the building of a maternity hospital in Limerick. That paradox illustrated to my mind one of the vices of the present situation, that we are spending a lot of time here discussing a theoretical Bill for the provision of maternity services while, on the other hand, we are apparently cancelling the building programme for a new maternity hospital.  The thing just does not make sense.  As far as the provision of medical services is concerned, as far as the provision of maternity services is concerned, I am sure the people of Limerick would much rather have a maternity hospital than a theoretical scheme on paper.</P>
    <P>Likewise, one gets complaints the whole time as to the inadequacy of some of the existing public hospitals in the country.  You also get demands the whole time for the building of additional hospitals in different parts of the country.  Again, there, it seems to me that the objective should be to provide the physical facilities first and then begin to worry about the scheme if one finds that the scheme is necessary in order that the hospital beds should be occupied.</P>
    <P>The only principle involved, in my view, with regard to the provision of health services is the lack or inadequacy of means and never to deprive any citizen of the best medical services that are available.  But, of <Col N="289" /> course, that principle cannot be given effect to unless the facilities are actually available.  We may talk until the cows come home about the need for better medical services, but, unless we provide the hospitals, the clinics and the dispensaries we will not be able to give those better health services.</P>
    <P>Probably Deputies on both sides will agree that at the moment, for some reason which is not apparent, persons who are entitled to sickness benefits are not receiving them or are only getting them after an unconscionable delay.  That is a matter that can be remedied, but it is certainly something that shakes one's confidence in the effectiveness of State services.</P>
    <P>Our health services at the moment are completely inadequate.  They require considerable improvement.  I am not satisfied that this Bill will improve them to the extent it is suggested by those who support the Bill.  I am not one of those who quarrel with the expenditure of money for the provision of proper medical services.  I do not mind how much those services cost because I believe it is our first duty to make such services available to our people, and I want to ensure that the money spent on health services will be spent for the benefit of our people.</P>
    <P>We are discussing here a Money Resolution for the implementation of this Bill.  So far we have all failed to extract from the Minister any detailed analysis of how much he estimates the implementation of the Bill will cost. I want to again emphasise that I do not raise this question because I think we should cheesepare on health services. I raise it because I want to know where the money we propose to expend will go.  I want to know how it will be utilised.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of talk here about the medical profession, the doctors and their advocacy against this Bill.  I have a shrewd suspicion that the people who will receive the bulk of the moneys it is proposed to make available by this Financial Resolution will in fact be the doctors.  I would like to know how much we are about to make available to the medical profession.  The Minister should be in a position to tell us <Col N="290" /> that unless he is deliberately avoiding that issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have made some estimate of the cost of the services that he proposes to provide.  I would like the Minister to give us an estimate&mdash; I think it is important that he should do so and my attitude in voting on this Money Resolution will be guided by the information made available by the Minister in his reply&mdash;of the total cost of the services to State funds and the total cost of the services it is proposed to provide which shall be paid for by the local authorities.  These are the two main heads.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell us what his estimate is as to the amount of money which will be paid (a) from State funds and (b) from local authority funds to the medical profession, be they specialists or ordinary practitioners. I would like the Minister to give us likewise an estimate of the amount of money which will be provided by local authorities for institutional treatment and the amount of money which will be provided from State funds for institutional treatment. I would like the Minister to give us an estimate of the money which will be provided from State funds for dental and ophthalmic services and the amount that will be provided from local authority funds for the same services.  I would like the Minister to give us the amount of money which will be provided for maternity cash grants, the amount of money which will be provided for specialist services and the amount of money which will be provided for maternity services.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister did not embark on this scheme without forming some estimate of the cost of each of these services under the headings I have enumerated.  For that reason I think it is not unfair to ask the Minister to give us these particulars.  I am anxious to secure them because it is from these estimates the House will best be able to judge the value of the services it is proposed to provide.</P>
    <P>The Minister quite fairly said in the House yesterday that the lower income group will get little under this Bill that they have not got at the moment.  I would like the Minister to <Col N="291" /> give us an estimate&mdash;I am sure he has made such an estimate&mdash;of the exact cost of providing services for the lower income group, the middle income group and the higher income groups under each of the headings that I have enumerated.  I do not want to tie the Minister to the estimates he gives us. I appreciate that there will be flucuations, and that many factors may in fluence the cost of these particular services. I can appreciate that the estimates the Minister may give us will only be rough estimates, but I think the House and the country is entitled to have these estimates because they will to a large extent enable us to judge whether or not the provisions of this Bill are worth while.  I have a shrewd suspicion that if these estimates are produced they will reveal that in the main the bulk of the moneys provided will find its way into the pockets of the doctors.</P>
    <P>I know from friends of mine in England that, on the whole, the doctors on the other side have done extremely well out of the health services.  I have no objection to the House providing moneys for the medical profession if it is necessary but if the alternative is to be the provision of moneys for the medical profession as against the provision of additional hospital beds, as against the provision of dispensaries, as against the provision of clinics, I would opt in favour of the provision of beds, clinics and dispensaries.</P>
    <P>I do not think&mdash;again I want to repeat this so that there will be no question of misrepresentation&mdash;that we should put a ceiling on the amount of money which it is necessary to spend to improve our medical services generally.  On the other hand, I think we should be careful of how we spend that money so that we will get the best result possible for the people.  Let us take extreme examples, if you like. You may often have to face the alternative of whether you should cut down on State expenditure that provides employment and produce a situation where you have 90,000 people unemployed or whether you should refrain from providing health services that are not absolutely necessary at that time. These are decisions that we have to <Col N="292" /> make in this House but, in order to make these decisions, we have to have the basic information available to us.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with one of the suggestions which Deputy Norton made to-day&mdash;the suggestion that the National Health Council should be tied in, in an advisory capacity, with the health services provided by the Bill.  I think that such an arrangement has operated satisfactorily in England.  I do not see why it should not operate here.  Whatever acrimony may have developed between the medical profession and the Department of Health, whatever unwise provocation may have been given by either side, ultimately it is quite obvious that some solution, some <i>via media</i>, will have to be found and some basis of cooperation between the medical profession, the Department of Health and the local authorities.  It would be much better to do it at this stage and to do it in a way that will avoid further acrimony than to allow the situation to become worse.</P>
    <P>The other suggestion made by Deputy Norton&mdash;a suggestion which I think is eminently wise and which would improve this Bill very considerably&mdash;is that the health services should be administered locally as far as possible through a county committee of health &mdash;a committee, I suppose, somewhat similar to a vocational education committee. I think that there is a danger in leaving the administration of the health services entirely in the hands of bureaucrats.  The whole trouble that we have had in a lot of these discussions on the health services has been due to the feeling that bureaucratic dictatorship is the solution for everything.  Frankly, I am afraid of too much bureaucracy.  I am afraid of it, particularly in services of this kind which require flexibility.  It is really not immediately that the evil results of bureaucracy will show themselves; it will be after a fairly long period of time.</P>
    <P>You will find that the tendency would be for the administration of the health services to become more and more the prerogative of civil servants and bureaucrats and to become hemmed in with all the top-heaviness <Col N="293" /> and red tape which, unfortunately, surrounds most of the work of Government Departments.  The establishment of local health councils, county committees of health&mdash;call them what you like&mdash;would, I think, tend to prevent the tendency towards bureaucracy which is inevitable in the Bill as it stands.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will give Deputy Norton's proposals in that respect very serious consideration.  It would, I think, make the Bill much more acceptable to people generally throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As I said before, some parts of this Bill are good.  On the other hand, I am afraid that the Minister has resorted too readily to the application of rigid means tests rather to an adherence to broader principles.  I can see that there will be a tremendous amount of difficulty in determining what constitutes a public assistance or low-income group person.  I can see that there will be considerable difficulty in determining what constitutes a person in receipt of a family income of less than £600 a year.  At first, the figure of £600 per year may sound big but, on examination, it is quite a small figure.  It means that&mdash;take Dublin, for instance&mdash;probably in a household where two persons are earning, they will exceed the £600 a year ceiling and will not, therefore, come within the provisions of the Bill.  I think that that ceiling should have been increased very considerably.  I always thought that a ceiling of that nature should be in the region of £1,000 a year if you are having it on the family income ceiling.</P>
    <P>The provision which enables a local authority to make available services free or at a nominal charge for persons who are suffering from a long or expensive illness is, I think, a good provision.</P>
    <P>I would rather have left the provisions of the Bill in a more flexible position in regard to the means test. I can appreciate the difficulties in administering any legislation which is flexible.  The only way in which it could be administered satisfactorily from that point of view would be by a local health committee.  I do not think it would be wise or feasible to <Col N="294" /> leave a matter of that kind entirely at the discretion of some official.  The official must have guidance.  A great many matters come into play&mdash;local circumstances of one kind or another&mdash; and it is very hard for an official to determine this question.  I think the combined wisdom of a local committee would have been much more satisfactory.</P>
    <P>While there are a great many provisions in the Bill which I dislike thoroughly, I propose to support the Bill because it does provide some things that are good and some things that are necessary.  Cash maternity benefits are essential and overdue but I have considerable doubt as to whether I will vote for this Money Resolution at all unless the Minister is prepared to make available to the House the information which I have sought.  It is unfair to ask this House to vote for Money Resolutions of this kind without giving any indication of the estimates which the Minister must have made and must have in his departmental files.  It would be the height of irresponsibility for a Minister to embark upon a scheme of this kind without having those estimates.  As I have indicated before, I want to have these estimates because I believe they will be the best guide the House can have as to the worth of the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Most Bills of this nature depend largely on the way in which they are administered.  It would be a good indication of what the Minister hopes to be able to achieve if he made available to us the payment he expects to have to make in a full year in respect of each of the different services I have enumerated.  I repeat I have a very strong suspicion that, when all is said and done, with all the fighting between the doctors and the Irish Medical Association, it will be found that the bulk of the money which this House will provide will find its way into the pockets of the medical profession.  I have no objection to the medical profession being paid, but if I have to choose between making a couple of million pounds available to the medical profession and making a couple of million pounds for building of hospitory <Col N="295" /> tals, I will choose the building of hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I already had an opportunity of making a speech on the Second Reading.  I do not propose to take advantage of this although it has turned out to be a Second Reading debate.  I want to touch upon the question of the Money Resolution, the cost and one other item mentioned in the course of this debate.  I feel that Deputies, whether they be on the Opposition or the Government side, who are asking the Minister to give them information in the way of a loose estimate of the cost of the services to be provided under this Bill are being very innocent and very naïve for the reason that I do not think the Minister has, at the moment, the slightest idea of the type of service he proposes to provide.</P>
      <P>That situation flows from the Bill itself.  The Bill is not a statement of health principles at all.  It is, in fact, an indefinite series of regulations which can limit the type of services that will be made available.  I frankly feel the reason the Minister is not prepared to commit himself is that he does not yet know how little he is going to get away with.  The more you read the Bill the more you see that every possible loophole has been put into the Bill to make it possible to reduce to the minimum the service to be provided and, where services are being provided, to secure the highest possible charge that can be extracted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party has indicated its support for the Bill but at the same time has not commended it.  The main defect I personally see in the Bill is its complete lack of any kind of philosophy or social approach to health questions.  The charge has been made that the Bill has been introduced mainly as a political manoeuvre. Leaving that to one side, I think it is correct to say that the Bill has no kind of social or philosophical approach to the people's health and that it is a purely utilitarian attempt to meet what has become a very popular question of widespread interest because of the manner in which it has attracted <Col N="296" /> comment during the last few years. Whether the Government feel they will receive support for the introduction of this Bill or not I do not know but it seems to me that the Bill is here only because they feel there is sufficient public pressure in respect of health matters to require that some step, however meagre, should be taken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>And the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  We also know from experience that the operation of this Bill will not be in the hands of the local authority but in the hands of managers and the managers, in the final resort, are the officers of the Minister.  That is one of the objections I have to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that aspect of the matter the outstanding feature is the application of innumerable means tests right through the Bill.  I have no objection to that if that is the approach, that when a sick man or woman is going along to receive necessary and urgent attention for some physical disability, they have got to be examined for their means first.  If that is the approach, that is all right. However, it seems to me in regard to this essential question of health we are refusing to apply principles that we are applying in other walks of life and with which I will deal later.  The only point I want to make at the moment is that while I am voting for the Money Resolution it is not on the basis that I agree in regard to the amount of money that is entailed, because we are completely in the dark <Col N="297" /> as to what is going to be the final outcome of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The more I read the Bill the more I notice its very careful drafting and the very careful manner in which powers have been taken under every possible section to maintain saving clauses by regulation.  The type of institutional service will be determined, the type of special service will be determined, the class of persons to be granted these services and those to be excluded, whether these services are to be given in one or another institution, what the charges are to be, the various groups of persons to come within the various scopes&mdash;right down the whole of the Bill we have nothing but a series of regulations.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate and in the literature from the doctors there were many references to bureaucrats. I was surprised that even Deputy MacBride fell into that particular trap. The interesting thing about bureaucrats, so far as the civil servants are concerned, is that whatever bureaucracy we do have comes from the top, from the Government and the Ministers. Every one of us knows that a bureaucrat is not a peculiar kind of animal that always exhibits the same traits.  Bureaucrats differ in their approach.  There are good and bad bureaucrats, and I think Deputy Briscoe will agree with me that in many respects, so far as the City of Dublin is concerned, especially in regard to health, we have the advantage of having some good bureaucrats. In other parts of the country they have the opposite experience.  It applies equally to Ministers and Governments and when we find that certain measures are being administered in a way to which very often we object, and to which we are frequently opposed, we do not start to look at the bureaucrat; we start to look at the top where policy is decided and from which instructions are given to the bureaucrat to operate that policy.  We have no better example of that than the social welfare system recently introduced under which we have had a mass or regulations issued; as a result of which the whole scheme has been twisted out of all recognition.  You cannot <Col N="298" /> blame the officials for that because policy is decided at the top.  That is why I say that it is to be regretted that nowhere in this Bill does the Government or the Minister tie themselves definitely to certain accepted principles in regard to health matters. They are leaving themselves completely free to deal with vital matters by regulation and to decide how subsequent policy is going to be applied.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Second Reading debate I mentioned that we in the Labour Party were generally supporting this Bill and that we hoped to introduce amendments.  We have already discovered what has happened in that regard.  We put down a number of amendments but half of them have been ruled out of order so that our opportunities to improve this measure, as we would like, will be rather limited. In the course of the debate certain viewpoints have been put forward in justification of the opposition to the Bill.  I can quite understand a member of the House being completely opposed to any effort to improve health measures at all on the ground that improved facilities should not be granted to ordinary people.  I could quite understand an objection to the Bill on the ground of costs and lack of equipment but the objection I do not understand has come outside of this debate and has come particularly from the doctors.  They seek to justify their opposition to the Bill, and to the health scheme on which it was based, on the ground that it introduces what they call a system of socialised or State medicine.  That is the basis of their approach to the proposals contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In speaking on the Second Reading debate I paid tribute to the doctors. I am not going to withdraw that tribute now.  I still think that the medical profession render a greater service to the community than any other profession we have.  That does not apply to every individual doctor nor does it apply to the professional associations but, in general terms, it is correct and it is a tribute in which we all gladly join.  I should like to say however that a most regrettable feature of the debate on the Bill and <Col N="299" /> of the whole discussions that have gone on in regard to health matters in the last three years has been the way in which the whole situation has been bedevilled so that the one section of the community with whom we should be most concerned&mdash;sick persons and persons liable to be sick&mdash;have been completely lost sight of.  The situation has been completely bedevilled and I want to say that no greater responsibility for that complete confusion and bedevilment of the situation rests upon anybody than upon the doctors themselves.  It has happened because in the presentation of their opposition to the various proposals for a health scheme they have embarked upon such an unbalanced, exaggerated and intemperate campaign that it is difficult for their closest friend to find any justification for that attitude or to support them in their view.</P>
    <P>A document has been circulated to Deputies which has been issued by the Irish Medical Association and which is entitled &ldquo;The White Paper on Health Services.&rdquo; It starts off with the statement: &ldquo;State Medicine is bad Medicine.&rdquo;  May we ask why it is bad medicine?  Why should State medicine which will be administered by the same doctor as would attend a private patient be bad medicine?  Is it to be taken that a doctor who would prescribe medicine for a private person in his own house will not have the same concern for the interests of his patients if he is employed by the State, the municipal authority or the local authority and that the tenets of professional conduct of doctors will undergo some change when they are administering State medicine?  Is that the best way to approach this problem?</P>
    <P>Further, they go on to show in the introductory paragraph that they are completely confusing their professional responsibility as persons charged with the custody of the welfare of the community with their personal and private positions.  They are perfectly entitled to protect their private and personal interests, but in doing so they should not try to &ldquo;kid&rdquo; us and fool us into the belief that they are concerned only with the welfare of the <Col N="300" /> private citizen.  I think anybody who reads this paragraph will agree that the statements contained in it are completely exaggerated and are put forward in an attempt to confuse the whole situation.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government White Paper, if adopted, will mean a great step forward in the control of medical services by the State.  It would be foolish to suppose that, while your doctor may worry about this trend, it is none of your affair.  A State stranglehold on the practice of medicine places the whole structure of family life in the same immediate peril.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In what peril are we placing family life because we make greater provision for the health of the family through the State?  Are doctors going to be a menace to family life, because we provide them with increased facilities to carry out the duties of their profession in regard to families?  I know that many of them will agree that the present facilities are so limited and the present equipment of hospitals so inadequate that it is very difficult to provide even post-graduate courses and that, with the limited facilities at their disposal, they cannot do their best.  If, therefore, the State steps in in an effort to provide the very best equipment that modern medical science can offer and makes it possible for the patient to take advantage of that, does that mean that we are imperilling family life?</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In exchange for heavier taxation, loss of privacy and chaotic services, you will be deprived of the very keystone of your individual liberty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the working man and woman condemned to live in a tenement room in one of the bad slum quarters of Dublin, can preserve their individual liberty to die of some curable or preventable disease; they are to preserve their individual liberty rather than be afforded the best medical service that can be given by the medical profession.  If these facilities are to be made available, not <Col N="301" /> merely to the individual citizen but to the members of the medical profession themselves, is the individual citizen to refuse to avail of them and the doctor to refuse to operate them?  Is there anything more fantastic than that kind of approach to this problem?  Right down through this whole document which was publicly circulated and which was specially addressed to Deputies we have this mass of exaggerated statements, many of which I would say are untruthful.</P>
    <P>The document goes on, on another page, to put forward a number of points in regard to what the White Paper offers.  Point No. 1 says: &ldquo;Treatment only in public wards of hospitals,&rdquo; and point No. 8 says: &ldquo;End of assistance to insured persons for private or semi-private maintenance in hospitals.&rdquo;  What is the Medical Association concerned with? Is it concerned with the persons who are able to pay for a private ward or with the sick person who has to be treated, whether in a private or a public ward?  Is the person in the public ward entitled to the same treatment as the person in the private ward?  Reading this document, it seems as if our main concern should be to ensure that certain groups of citizens will still be able to continue to take advantage of the private or semi-private ward, but that we are not to bother about the people who have to go into the public wards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but if the Deputy has read this document, as he probably has, he will see that it is quite clear that, in the eyes of the medical profession, there is something very degrading in being in a public ward.  It is about time they changed their outlook.  Number 2 is &ldquo;The birth of your children in public maternity wards&rdquo;&mdash;again, the same approach. I do not know whether that is medical snobbery or ordinary class snobbery, but it is not something which should come from men who are charged with professional responsibility.  The next is: &ldquo;Your doctors ordered around by lay <Col N="302" /> officials&rdquo;; and another, &ldquo;The red ticket goes and a &lsquo;coloured card&rsquo; comes in.&rdquo;  On the opposite page there is: &ldquo;Your doctors know your health problems better than the bureaucratic planners.&rdquo;  I suggest to the doctors that they should bear this in mind, that for many years the question of the health of the people has largely lain in the hands of the doctors. They have known more about health problems than anybody else. May I suggest also, that whatever progress has been made in bringing the advances of medical science to the masses of the people, in giving them access to the professional training which has been made available by the community to the doctors, has not been the outcome of any great effort on the part of the doctors or of the profession, but of the effort carried on by progressive laymen and women in all political Parties and all walks of life? If we are to judge by the approach of the doctors to some of the simple questions that all members of the House have to concern themselves with, their record is not very good.  In our voluntary hospitals for many years, the doctors have largely determined the attitude of these hospitals to their nursing staffs and to their young doctors.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the leading members of the Irish Medical Association take any pride in the status which ordinary nurses were given for many years in this country, the conditions under which they had to work, the salaries they received and the treatment accorded to them, which meant in many cases that the young girl going into a hospital found herself in an atmosphere more like that of a jail than a hospital.  In the case of the young doctor who graduated, who walked the wards, receiving £30, £40, or £50 a year, were any protests made by leading members of the profession against that degradation of their own profession and of the ancillary nursing profession which our girls entered?</P>

    <P>I, personally, have no knowledge of any such protests and I am aware that time after time any efforts made to improve radically the general over-all treatment of sick people by giving proper status to the nursing profession, <Col N="303" /> and even a proper status to the medical profession itself as a whole and not to the individual members, has been the outcome of a gradual progressive outlook which has more and more been acquired by the general mass of the citizens and particularly the more progressive individuals, who, from time to time, inevitably form public opinion.  Doctors should bear that in mind and should realise that whatever views they may have on this Bill, or whatever the general approach to the health question, those of us who are concerned to get a more enlightened approach to health problems are doing the job that the doctors should be doing.  To the extent to which we succeed, the doctors as a profession will be able to live closer to their professional responsibilities, to give better service to the community and, in turn, the members of the community who require the services of the profession will be able to receive it in the form in which the doctors should be the first to insist it should be extended to every sick person.</P>
    <P>On the question of State medicine, I want to close on one note, particularly as Deputy Cogan is here.  Everybody seems to object to State medicine and socialised medicine.  So far as I can see, the objection is always that so long as I am getting something out of the State, it is all right, but so long as the other fellow is getting it, it is all wrong.  Is there any section of the community getting more from the State than the farmers, and contributing less?  We are dealing here with a section of the community who, because of their health problems, are in most immediate need.  I should like to put a very simple question: if to-morrow a house goes on fire in the City of Dublin and a member of the Civic Guard is passing by, do we not expect that Guard to go into the house, and, at the risk of his life, rescue the people in it?  Before he goes in, does anybody expect that he should apply a means test, that he should be asked to check on the income of the people and see whether they are in a position to pay for a private fire service or policeman?  Is it not the same with regard to the sick person?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> As I said on Second Reading, whatever principle we decide on in respect of the financing of the health scheme, it should not be a principle which places a civil servant or an official of the local authority with an official form in his hand, at the door of the sick room and which demands that, before the sick person can have the doctor whose services he requires in, a means test must be applied.  There are other ways of doing it, and there are ways of securing that the members of the community make their contribution to the financial cost of the health services on the basis of their means, their income, their general financial standing.  It should not be done in the way it is being done&mdash;a way which means that if a person requires a doctor to enter the house and see a sick child or other member of the family, he must first see if there is a 10/- note in his pocket.</P>
    <P>Equally, it should not be done in a way which means that, before a person can go into a hospital to receive specialist service or even to receive the services of a general practitioner, his means must be investigated and that the first condition of service is not his need for medical attention but his ability to pay.  We can deal with that in another way.  We have done it in large measure in respect of social security and the same principles could be applied.  I still feel that those who are raising the cry, particularly the doctors, and basing their objection to the health scheme on the question of State or socialised medicine should bear in mind that all the progressive legislation that has come before this House and other Parliaments in this generation was met with exactly the same outcry&mdash;that the State was interfering too much, invading the privacy of the home, and that the individual citizen should be able to provide these services for himself and that we should not support an extension of State influence in private life.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants the State to interfere. Everybody will agree that it would be preferable if every man and woman were able to support themselves by their own industry and able to provide all the services they require for their <Col N="305" /> families&mdash;proper houses, proper education, proper medical services and proper opportunities in life&mdash;but they are not, and, until there are, as Deputy Cowan lectures the Labour Party continually, radical changes in the system of society that we have, the ordinary individual citizen is not going to be able to provide these things.  Therefore, the community has to step in, as it steps in in regard to the provision of a State military force to protect the community, <Col N="306" /> a State police force, a State post office, State education, State agricultural schemes and even State tariffs for the industrialists and carries burdens which are greater than the individual citizen can bear.  I see no moral objection to that.</P>
