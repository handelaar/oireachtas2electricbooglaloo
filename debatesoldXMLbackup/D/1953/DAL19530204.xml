      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="2" /> With your permission, A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together, by making a general statement on the position.</P>
      <P>On the 18th December last the Tánaiste and the Minister for Agriculture discussed, with representatives of the milk producers' organisations, the claims submitted by those organisations for increased milk prices.  The producers' representatives asked for an early decision.  They were promised that the Government would give immediate consideration to the matter, but it was made clear that the necessary examination would take some time to complete.  By letter, on the 9th January, the Minister for Agriculture informed the producers' organisations that, as the Government's consideration of the claims had not yet been completed, he would not be in a position to announce their decision for some weeks.  Later, in a public statement, the Minister promised that the decision would be available before the end of January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was in these circumstances that the producers' organisations, without awaiting the decision, attempted to force the Government's hands by withholding <Col N="3" /> supplies.  It must be obvious to all that no Government, conscious of their responsibilities to the community as a whole, could yield to pressure of this nature.  It has been made clear to the producers, therefore, that there can be no question of the Government resuming consideration of their claims so long as the present stoppage persists.</P>
    <P>The withholding of supplies has a serious effect on the national wellbeing. Milk and its products are important and essential items in the nation's food.  They are also an important source of income to the farmer.  No one can afford to contemplate with equanimity any interruption, however brief, of the work of so important an industry.</P>
    <P>In determining the price for milk, the Government has to act as arbiter between producers and consumers.  It is not an easy matter to arrive at an equitable judgment on the competing claims.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the consuming public, the Government must consider the effects on the cost of living of increased prices for milk and butter.  If the producers' claims were conceded, they would bring the price of butter to over 5/- a lb., increase the price of milk in Dublin and Cork by 1¼d. a pint, add over £5,000,000 to the community's food bill and increase the cost-of-living index by 4.6 points.  Those who make these demands seem not to realise how adversely their industry could be affected by inability or unwillingness of the public to maintain consumption at such a cost.  We might easily find ourselves again in the position in which we were when export bounties and subsidies had to be introduced to maintain the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to prove that the Government are not unsympathetic to the industry.  I have already referred to the bounties and subsidies paid to the industry from 1932 onwards, and I need only add that one of our first actions on resuming office in June, 1951, was to increase the price of milk.  In their recent consideration of the problem, the Government were <Col N="4" /> fully aware of the difficulties created for the producers by increased costs and were taking these into account. They will necessarily take them into account again when consideration of the matter is resumed, that is, when the obstacle created by the present milk stoppage is removed, as we hope it soon will be.  The stoppage is no less harmful to the producers themselves than it is to the rest of the community.  We hope that the producers will recognise this and, by resuming supplies, take the step necessary to bring the present situation to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the cumulative and very varied dangers that are in the situation as it actually exists: in view of that, on the one hand, and on the other of the reiterated statement, even by way of formal advertisements on the part of the strike committee, that they are prepared to enter into negotiations or to submit the question to arbitration, does the Taoiseach not consider that it would be wise and vigorous action on the part of the Government to jerk the situation back now to negotiation level so that the issues at any rate of the present dangerous situation might be faced in negotiation, and so that the House here would be given an opportunity of feeling that the situation had been brought back, in whatever way, to negotiation level at the present time? The Taoiseach will understand that much of the material which has been given by way of answer is open to long discussion and long judgment, but I think that what is not open to any long consideration is the fact that a dangerous situation exists and that the Government could make a contribution to, as it were, stopping or arresting that by entering the negotiation stage straight away, even if that were only confined to a consideration between themselves and the strike committee of the dangers of the present situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards arbitration, the Government is the arbiter, and necessary so, in view of the issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="5" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not holding to arbitration.  I suggest negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it, therefore, that the Deputy is satisfied that arbitration, as it is called by some people, is out of the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so satisfied about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am and the Government is, too, I think.  The next question is with regard to negotiation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are you satisfied that arbitration is out of the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because if we have a great deal of arbitration, then the Government, on behalf of the community, has to foot the bill.  We have got the responsibility, and we intend, as long as we are here, to act up to our responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The next thing is in regard to negotiation.  The Tánaiste, as was pointed out in the answer, with the Minister for Agriculture, met representatives of the producers.  They put their case before them.  They were informed that it would get immediate consideration.  That consideration was being given, but it was necessary, in view of the position that the Government is in the matter, to get the fullest possible information and to foresee as far as possible the results of any judgment that would be given. We wanted to give the judgment on its merits and in the interests of the community.  Now, whilst that was being done, a pistol is put to the heads of the Government.  Nobody can carry on negotiations or carry on a proper examination under such circumstances. The moment the people give up putting the pistol to the heads of the arbiter, then we can proceed with further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not understand that the present situation is growing in danger and that the community generally are being caught in a very very difficult situation, first and foremost from the point of view of the milk and, in the second place, from the point of view of a clash between the Government and a <Col N="6" /> fairly widespread section of the people? In a clash like that the ordinary people will suffer in every aspect of their lives.  Does the Taoiseach not consider, in view of the fact that it was thought possible that a judgment on this matter could be given by the end of January, that the situation could be judged by the Government saying: &ldquo;Sit down at a negotiation table again and we will discuss the danger of the present situation and any other matter you may wish to discuss&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We fully realise the dangers to the community whenever there is action taken by one section of the community such as is being taken by the milk producers.  We understand it thoroughly and it is in the interests of the community, so that such action will not in any way be successful, that we have to stand.  We have to stand in the interests of the community and I am saying now that the judgment that will be given, as it will have to be given ultimately by this Government anyhow, will be the same judgment as would have been given by the end of January if there had been no strike. We are not going to be influenced in one way or the other by it.  We have got to maintain the public position, which is that the Government is put in the position of being arbiter between different sections of the community on a very important matter for them all.  If the consumers to-morrow were to try voilent action what would the producers think?  We have got in this matter to stand firm on principle and that is what we are doing.  That does not mean that we are not fully alive to the dangers but we are also fully alive to the dangers that would occur if we were to give in to demands of this sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that on last Monday this developed further and all the creameries in East Cork refused to accept milk? I am making an appeal to the Government to look after the people whose milk would have been sent to the creamery, people whose cows had calved or were on the point of calving, who would be sending the milk next week.  I appeal <Col N="7" /> to them to look after those people and to see in what way they will be compensated for a loss in the creation of which they had no hand.  Surely the Taoiseach should be able to do something. In 1946, I think, he refused subsidies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making an appeal to the Government.  The Government has made an appeal to the people, who, like other sections of the community, ought to be interested in the maintenance of order and the maintenance of good government.  We are asking the people who are acting in the manner in which they are acting&mdash; violently, unjustly in some cases&mdash;to behave and to permit this thing to be done properly.  Which of the appeals do members of this House think ought to be listened to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not consider it possible to indicate the Government's decision in regard to the initial question?  As I understand the position, the issues are now as to when the Government will give its decision. Would it not be better from the point of view of everybody concerned if the Government were in a position to give its decision now so that the issues would be clearly understood and knit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a point of view which occured to myself but any decision given under those circumstances would not appear&mdash;as it must appear&mdash;to represent the situation properly.  It would appear to be a judgment that was influenced by this strike.  I have said that it would not be so influenced, but there would be people who would say the opposite.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true. The letter and the statements of the Minister for Agriculture were that there would be a decision given by the end of January.  In one case it was said that the decision would take some weeks.  Then later, the Minister pointed out that it would be by the end of January, but ten days or so before the end of January we have this strike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before this House is used as an arena to call for turning the Guards on the farmers of this country, may I not ask the Taoiseach, if this strike is brought to an end, is it not manifest that, in regard to part of the claim, a settlement could be arrived at without any serious difficulty and, in regard to any part of the claim where settlement is not agreeable between the parties, does not justice demand that the farmers of the country shall have access to no more than every worker has access, every industrialist has access, that is, arbitration on the validity of their claim?  If the Government will say: &ldquo;In so far as we can arrive <i>ad idem</i> on any part of your claim, we shall settle it forthwith.  In regard to any part of your claim which we cannot see our way to grant, we acknowledge your right&mdash;the same, but no more than any other section of the community has&mdash;to arbitration and the award submitted to the Dáil for its action thereafter,&rdquo; surely this strike can be brought to an end in the morning and, whoever is involved in it, a situation will be arrested which could develop into an utterly deplorable one. I want to remind the Taoiseach, for I feel sure that in this he agrees with <Col N="9" /> me, the farmers are a stable element in this country and they are decent men.  It would be a disaster if they were driven into a course of violence which would reflect no credit on the agricultural community and is as foreign to their nature as anything could conceivably be.  In the name of decency in our own country, surely this House is capable of taking some step now which could end this danger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were a means of ending this situation surely every side of the House would be glad to see it ended.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider the proposition I am now making to him and in 24 hours a very grievous matter will be ended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the suggestion that we turned the Guards on the farmers of the country, every farmer with common sense knows that what the Guards are doing is protecting the elements of the community who are being attacked by some elements which pretend to be farmers and may not be, as far as some of us know, farmers at all.  The Guards have to protect the community.  That is one of their primary functions.  With regard to the suggestion that this matter could be brought to an end within 24 hours, I cannot see how the whole thing could be settled in 24 hours.  But this situation could be settled if the people who started this inconsiderate, ill-considered, foolish action, would stop it and allow the tribunal which was set up, the tribunal that is lawfully entitled to come to a decision, to do it, namely, the Government. As to the question of arbitration on every possible thing that comes before the Government, where will it lead to?  What are the Government to do?  Are they immediately to surrender all functions in regard to the safeguarding of various sections of the community?  I do not think you can do it.  Those who ask for it know perfectly well where it would lead to.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to say that I do not understand what the Deputy means by mediation.  So far as we are concerned, any citizen in ordinary circumstances has access to us.  That is one of our functions.  If there is a serious matter that a citizen <i>bona fide</i> wants to communicate to us, it is always possible for him to do it. There is no need for any mediator. The question is a judgment and a decision with regard to the price of milk, and that judgment has to be given by the Government without a pistol at its head.  Otherwise any decision of the Government will be questioned by one party or the other.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose <Col N="11" /> to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the unemployment figures have increased in recent weeks. There is, of course, always an increase in the Live Register in January, but the increase was greater this year than last year.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental aim of the Government's economic and social policy to create conditions favourable for employment.  In addition, the Government endeavour, within the limited sphere available to them, to provide employment on constructive works to the extent permitted by the resources of the community.  The sums being spent this year on the land improvement scheme, hospitals, road grants and special employment schemes are substantially greater than last year.  The number of new schools now being erected and of major school improvement schemes in progress is greater than the corresponding figure 12 months ago.  Employment on arterial drainage in January, 1953, was greater than the corresponding figure last year. A Supplementary Estimate is being introduced to maintain employment in afforestation.</P>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to say that the increase in the unemployment figures is causing the Government concern. They are watching the situation carefully with a view to providing remedies where possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether there was any inquiry by his Department into the finances of the Dublin bus services before or during the discussions that resulted in the recent increases in bus fares and the shortening of the stages in 1952 and if he is aware that the increased fares will mean an additional burden to be added to the high rents paid by tenants of houses in the outlying districts and will have a detrimental effect on the proposed building of houses in these outlying districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The board of C.I.E. is empowered by Section 20 (2) of the Transport Act, 1950, to fix, demand, take and recover such charges as it thinks fit for the services which it provides.  The board has also the statutory obligation, imposed on it by the 1950 Act, to conduct the undertaking so as to secure that revenue should be not less than sufficient to meet the charges properly chargeable to revenue.</P>
      <P>The charges to be made by C.I.E. were covered by the Prices and Charges (Standstill) Order, 1951, made on 2nd January, 1951, but by direction of my predecessor as Minister for Industry and Commerce, dated 17th April, 1951, all rail, road and canal charges for passengers and goods carried by C.I.E. were removed from the scope of this Order.</P>
      <P>The position is, therefore, that I have no statutory function in this matter, which is one solely for decision by C.I.E., and the question of discussions or of the holding of a departmental inquiry does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy may not have seen the official announcement of the board that the increases in rates and fares were made necessary by reason of increased costs of which the most important is increased wages, which it is estimated <Col N="17" /> will involve increased outgoings to the extent of £534,000 per year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the last portion of the question in which I asked is he aware of the detrimental effect the increased fares will have on the building of houses for the workers of Dublin. There are now no sites available within five miles of the city.  Sending workers five miles away while the present extravagant fares are charged, even for transporting children to and from school, will have a detrimental effect on house building.  Would the Minister not approach the authorities concerned and point out to them that the people of Dublin should not be expected to carry the railways of the whole country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain increased charges have a detrimental effect on everybody.  In this particular case, however, a substantial increase in wages became payable to the company's staff.  I do not think it will be held by anybody that that increase was not justifiable and obviously the money wherewith to pay that increase must be got from transport users.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Question Nos. 12 to 19 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised by An Bord Fáilte that the costs of acquisition and development of the properties at Tramore cannot be segregated in the form sought in one of the questions.  The cost of erecting and equipping the hydro was £35,535.  The cost of the pitch-and-putt course was £1,000 and the cost of the boys' club (lands and buildings) was £2,700.  I am informed by An Bord Fáilte that separate figures cannot be provided for the cost of developing the site prior to the erection of the hydro or for the cost of the casino.  The total net expenditure on acquisition and development of all the properties, after making allowance for revenues received, was £84,550.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disposal of the properties at Tramore had been under consideration by my predecessor following a recommendation made by the Tourist Board in December, 1950, that all the board's properties should be disposed of as quickly as possible.  So far as Tramore was concerned, the Tourist Board recommended in January, 1951, that they should negotiate a sale with the local directors of Tráigh Mhór (Tramore Development) Teo., but the matter had not yet been decided when I resumed office in June, 1951.  When I came to consider the general policy to be adopted for the further development of the tourist industry I decided that the board's recommendation that the properties be disposed of should be accepted.  As regards the method of disposal of the properties at <Col N="21" /> Tramore I recognised the risk that sale by public auction might result in the properties being purchased and used for purposes not connected with tourism, or possibly detrimental to the development of Tramore as a tourist resort.  It was only with hesitation that I eventually decided to direct that the sale should be by public auction, and then only on condition that suitable legal safeguards could be devised against diversion of the properties to uses not connected with tourism.</P>
    <P>I was later advised that the properties could be sold by way of lease and that a restrictive covenant could be inserted in the lease but that this would not be an absolute safeguard as the enforcement of the covenant, should the need arise, might ultimately have to depend on the outcome of legal action in the courts.  It was also pointed out that the inclusion of a restrictive covenant would probably affect the yield from the sale.</P>
    <P>On the 30th May, 1952, An Bord Fáilte reported to me that they had received an offer from the local directors of Tráigh Mhór (Tramore Development) Teo. to purchase all the properties for the sum of £20,000 to be paid over a period of years.  Tráigh Mhór (Tramore Development) Teo. is a company which was incorporated on the 3rd July, 1945, at the instance of the Tourist Board with the general object of promoting and developing the resort of Tramore. The directors were appointed by the Tourist Board and included members of the Tourist Board and local directors.  The company undertook the commercial management of the properties at Tramore.  An Bord Fáilte, in forwarding the offer received from the local directors in May, 1952, indicated to me that, since January, 1951, they had had in mind the position of the local directors and their interest in the future of the properties. They stated that these local directors had, for several years past, taken a deep interest in the general scheme for the development of Tramore as a tourist resort and that they had been regular in attendance at meetings of the company at Tramore and had declined to accept any fees for their services.  An Bord Fáilte also made the point that <Col N="22" /> the Tourist Traffic Bill then before the Oireachtas provided for the encouragement of resort development by local companies and provided for financial assistance in such cases.</P>
    <P>I considered the matter afresh in the light of this communication from An Bord Fáilte and came to the conclusion that the development of the properties in the interests of tourism was more likely to be achieved by negotiating a sale on satisfactory terms to the local directors of the company than by taking the risk attendant on a public auction.  I was also influenced by the fact to which An Bord Fáilte had adverted that the disposal of the properties in this way would be in consonance with the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Bill.</P>
    <P>On the 21st August, 1952, An Bord Fáilte reported to me that there had been further discussions with the local directors of Tráigh Mhór (Tramore Development) Teo. as a result of which the local directors had submitted a firm offer to purchase the properties for £20,000, payable in cash, and had given an undertaking that the properties to be acquired would be developed in the interests of tourism.  An Bord Fáilte stated to me that they were satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, and in particular to the requirement that the Tramore properties be developed in the interests of tourism, it would be preferable to accept this offer and not to proceed to dispose of the property by public auction.  In the light of this recommendation from An Bord Fáilte, and after consultation with the Minister for Finance, I indicated to An Bord Fáilte that I was prepared to agree to the sale of the properties on the basis proposed if, after further negotiations, the local directors could not be induced to improve on their offer.</P>
    <P>On the 1st October, 1952, An Bord Fáilte reported to me that, as a result of further negotiations with the local directors, they had received a firm offer of £22,500 for the properties, subject to a lease rent for a term of 99 years, and that they were satisfied that there was no prospect of the amended offer being improved upon. <Col N="23" /> They indicated that Mr. J.A. Nugent and Mr. A.P. McClafferty, the members of An Bord Fáilte on the Board of Tráigh Mhór (Tramore Development) Teo., would retire when the sale was finalised on the basis proposed. On the 10th October, I authorised the acceptance of the offer subject to the inclusion in the lease of a covenant to ensure that the properties would be developed in the interests of tourism. The negotiations with the local directors were carried out by An Bord Fáilte and no auctioneer or broker was involved in the transaction.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Tramore Town Commissioners have expressed dissatisfaction that the properties were sold otherwise than by public auction and that they were not given an opportunity of acquiring them.  The town commissioners had been informed in March, 1952, of my original decision that the properties should be sold by public auction.  Later on, in September, 1952, and while the negotiations between An Bord Fáilte and the local directors of Tráigh Mhór (Tramore Development) Teo. were in progress, the town commissioners forwarded to me a resolution that action should be taken to put the casino portion of the properties into a suitable state of repair for An Tóstal and proposing also that the town commissioners should be represented on Tráigh Mhór (Tramore Development) Teo.</P>
    <P>The commissioners were informed in reply that I was then considering, in consultation with An Bord Fáilte, the arrangements which should be made to ensure that the properties would be maintained and developed in the interest of Tramore as a tourist resort and that when a final decision had been taken an announcement on the subject would be made by An Bord Fáilte.  This communication was acknowledged without comment.  I now understand that the town commissioners interpreted the communication to mean that no final action would be taken in the matter until an announcement had first been made by An Bord Fáilte.  That was not the intention, and it did not occur to me that there <Col N="24" /> could have been any misunderstanding in the matter.  The announcement of the sale of the properties was made to the Press by An Bord Fáilte on the 5th January, 1953, when the negotiations had been finalised.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, the only firm offers made for the properties were those made by the purchasers. I understand from An Bord Fáilte that they received inquiries about particular portions of the properties, but that no actual offers for them were received and that the board, in any event, were averse to selling the properties in lots.  No firm offer was ever received from the town commissioners. I understand from discussions I have had with representatives of the town commissioners that what they had in mind was not the possible acquisition of the properties by the town commissioners as such, but the promotion by members of the town commissioners, as individuals, of another local company for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the implication in the Deputy's questions that the sale of property must always be by public auction and that it is not open to a Minister to dispose of properties, or, as in the present case, to authorise their disposal, on the recommendation of a State board, by private treaty where he considers that course to be more expedient in the public interest. Sales of Tourist Board properties by private treaty were authorised by my predecessor at Portmarnock and Killarney in 1949, and I authorised a similar course at Bundoran in 1951. There are no grounds for believing that the sale of the properties at Tramore by public auction in one lot would have been more beneficial to the Exchequer or to the interests of tourism in Tramore.</P>
    <P>I am aware of no grounds on which an inquiry should be held and it is not intended to adopt the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Tánaiste's reply he said there was no offer made to An Bord Fáilte by the Tramore Town Commissioners.  Could the Tánaiste say under what circumstances An Bord Fáilte could receive an <Col N="25" /> offer when he himself previously gave an undertaking in the course of a public statement in Tramore that the property would be sold by public auction and that the Tramore Town Commissioners were waiting for an answer so that they might offer?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole business started long before that.  In my predecessor's time the representatives of the town commissioners were received in the Department of Industry and Commerce and informed the Department that they were interested in the future of these properties.  At that meeting the officers of the Department and representatives of what was then the Tourist Board were present.  They intimated they would be prepared to consider any proposal which came from the town commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no question of selling at that particular time at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated that the Tourist Board would consider any proposal. No proposal was in fact made, and it is clear that the town commissioners would not have had the legal powers to operate on the scale required for the purposes of these properties. As a matter of fact I met representatives of the town commissioners this morning, and they made it quite clear to me what they had in mind.  They intended the purchase of the property by the town commissioners, not as such, but that members of the town commissioners would as individuals form a company for the purchase of the property.  It was by no means obvious to me that one particular local company would have an advantage over the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the individual members of town commissions and other enterprising people in Tramore decided to establish a company for the purpose of purchasing the property, what guarantee has the Tánaiste that he would not have got more from them for the property, if they had an opportunity of bidding than from the concern that purchased it?  Does he now admit that he deliberately misled the people on the occasion of his visit to Waterford, <Col N="26" /> where he stated the property was going to be disposed of by public auction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I made no statement on this subject in Waterford, nor did I meet anyone in Waterford who was interested in this question.  The contacts with the town commissioners were effected entirely by correspondence. It is quite true that the position developed in this way.  The Tourist Board were always in favour of selling this property to this local development company which it itself had set up previous to my predecessor.  The matter had not been disposed of at the time I resumed office and I adopted my predecessor's decision that the property should be sold.  I decided it should be sold by public auction provided it was possible to effect an arrangement which would ensure that on sale it would never be used for any purpose other than the development of Tramore as a tourist resort.  That decision was changed subsequently on the representations of the Tourist Board and in consideration of the offer which they had received from the local directors which, I was satisfied, represented a larger sum of money than could have been secured at a public auction.  It was not obvious to me that at a public auction there would be, in fact, more than one bidder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if at any time prior to the offer being made An Bord Fáilte recommended to him that the property should be sold by private treaty and not by public auction, recommended specifically against public auction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tourist Board always were in favour of sale to this local company.  They never recommended any other course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not an answer to my question.  The other point I want to make is that the Minister makes the case that the reason he changed his mind from having the property sold by public auction and decided to have it sold by private treaty was because he was anxious that the contract would be so drawn <Col N="27" /> that the property would have to be used for tourist purposes.  Is the Minister aware there is no provision put into a contract of private sale that could not have been put into a contract for public sale?  There is no restrictive covenant which he could legally have put into a contract for private sale that he could not put into a contract for public auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I said so.  The Deputy misunderstands the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was giving that as the reason.  If that is not the reason for changing from public auction to private treaty, I must say I do not understand what it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason was that the Tourist Board, which had become An Bord Fáilte, pressed me strongly to adopt the course of sale to the company they had set up, urging that that course was not merely in the best interests of Tramore as a holiday resort but also in accordance with the terms of the Tourist Traffic Bill then before the Oireachtas which contemplated the establishment of local development companies at all resorts and also because of their view that the offer they had received from the local directors of the development company represented substantially more money than they were likely to secure in any other way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) whether his Department secured possession and paid full compensation due in respect of land at Dublin airport owned by certain persons; (b) whether these persons informed his Department that they were interested in the letting of these lands; (c) whether his Department gave them an opportunity to offer an acceptable rent for the letting; (d) the names of the persons to whom these lands were let and the letting price per acre and period of letting; (e) the number of acres concerned and the purposes to which the land will be devoted, and (f) the reason why the original owners were not afforded the opportunity to make an offer for the letting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Additional lands adjoining the Dublin airport to the extent of about 285 acres have been acquired or are in course of being acquired under the Air Navigation and Transport Acts.  The acquisition of 133 acres has been completed, full compensation has been paid in respect of this portion and possession has been taken of the lands.  No invitations were issued to the former owners to make offers for lettings, but some of them informed me that they would be interested in obtaining temporary lettings of their former holdings and some offers were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering how the lands could be let to the best advantage, I took account of the fact that a company <Col N="31" /> engaged in the production of dried grass for animal feeding was already under contract to maintain the flying field by growing grass crops there and have been given a letting of other lands outside the boundary of the airfield which were acquired some years ago.  It seemed to me that the most satisfactory arrangement to make would be to let the additional lands recently acquired to this company, and such letting at £7 per acre has been made for the 11 months ending on the 30th November, 1953.  It is a condition of the arrangement that any further lands which are finally acquired and come into my possession before the 30th November, 1953, will be included in the letting.  I am satisfied that the rent payable is a fair one and it is, in fact, higher than any offer made from any other source.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether the persons who previously owned this land were given an opportunity to offer a price better than £7 per acre?  £7 per acre for tillage land, the best land in County Dublin!</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state whether the Athlone woollen mills are likely to be put into full production in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question relates to the intentions of a private commercial concern.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a Dáil question by the Deputy on December 5th, 1951, I should like to see the Athlone woollen mills in full production again, and I have informed the company of my willingness to assist the company to this end in every way within my power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure the Minister is aware that that factory was <Col N="33" /> burned down nearly ten years ago and that since that took place little or no effort has been made by this company to reopen the factory and give employment to the town.  When I raised this matter two years ago when Deputy Morrissey was Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Minister stated that if he were in power and in office again he would make sure that that woollen mills would be reopened and put into full production.  Now that he has the chance back and is in power again, would he not agree that, if this company is not prepared to live up to its responsibilities, in view of the heavy and extensive unemployment that exists in Athlone and district, he should take steps to make this woollen mills a Government concern and run it by the State instead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the owners and managers of private concerns frequently inform my Department of their intentions.  It would be a bad principle, however, if I were to reply here in the House to questions regarding the management of private concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out that one of the reasons why this factory has not gone back into full production is that the people who have responsibility for it have bigger connections outside this country in Britain and are subject to outside influence and so they are not prepared to open it for manufactures here?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

Mar gheall ar é a bheith go gníomhach i ngluaiseacht na Saoirse, gearradh téarmaí príosúntachta air ó am go ham, rud a chabhraigh leis an easláinte a tháining air nuair a chuaigh sé amach sna blianta.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum which was circulated with the Bill will have given Deputies a picture of the matters to which the Bill relates.  It may, however, be helpful if I speak about the various provisions in a more detailed manner than it was possible to deal with them in the memorandum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> The Government have accepted the proposition that the rates of military service pensions laid down in the Acts of 1924 and 1934 should be increased in the light of the increases granted in the case of other State pensions.  The increases provided in the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950, have been taken as the standard, since they apply to other bodies of State pensioners, and, on that basis, a table of increases has been prescribed in Section 2 of the Bill.  Generally speaking, the increases will operate as from the 1st January, 1953.</P>
    <P>It is provided in the Act of 1924 that, where a member of the permanent force holds a certificate of military service, no pension will be paid to him until he has left the permanent force. The pension is then calculated on the substantive rank at that particular time or on the 1st February, 1924, whichever of those ranks is the higher. Because, however, of the proposed abolition of abatement of military service pensions by reference to remuneration from public funds, it seems only fair that the persons concerned&mdash; there are less than 100 of them&mdash;should have the opportunity of taking their pensions now if they desire to do so, and Section 3 provides accordingly.  It may be that some of them would prefer to wait until they have left the Army; an officer, for instance, who felt that he would be likely to receive further promotion and so, on retirement, have a higher military service pension, might regard it as being to his advantage to wait.  If there are such cases, I have no desire to deprive them of the rights they possess under the Act of 1924.  Where any person concerned wishes to take his pension before leaving the Army, he may have it as from a date not earlier that the 1st January, 1953, and it will be calculated on his substantive rank as on the date of commencement of the pension.  He will then have to exercise the option within three months after the passing of the Bill or the date on which he is awarded the certificate of military service, whichever is the later.  He cannot exercise it subsequently, and <Col N="44" /> having exercised it, he cannot subsequently alter it.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill has been included in an effort to meet a late request on the part of the Old I.R.A. associations.  It appears that, under the Acts of 1924 and 1934, it was open to a person employed in the public service at the time when he was rendering military service within the meaning of the Acts to choose to surrender his military service pension and to have the period covered by that pension included for the purpose of superannuation pension and allowances.  The method of calculation was an extremely complicated one and I do not intend to trouble the House with it now.  I understand that the vast majority of the people concerned opted to retain their military service pensions and that only 14 or 15 persons found it more advantageous to surrender their military service pension.  The request to me was that the provisions I have mentioned should be repealed so that it would be possible to count the periods in question for the purposes of both military service pension and civil pension.  I am sorry that I have found myself unable to meet that request in full.  I am, however, able to do something which, I hope, may be regarded as a compromise.  It is possible, I am told, now that the military service pensions are being increased and abatement removed, that some of those who gave up their military service pensions may find that, taking the long view, it would have been better for them not to exercise the option they did.  Accordingly, I propose to give them the opportunity of reconsidering their position.  This section will enable them to do so, and again each person concerned will have to take the decision for himself.</P>
    <P>If anybody changes his option, he will have to do so from the time of his original option.  He will, by doing so, be in debt to the State as on a current date, because the original exercise of the option meant that he got more by taking an enhanced superannuation than he would have got by taking his military service pension and lower superannuation.  In other words, he profited by making the original option <Col N="45" /> and will, therefore, have something to refund by going into reverse, even though the reversal of the option will mean an eventual financial advantage. Actually, I do not think there is much in it.  It may be, in fact, that nobody will wish to change his option.  As I have said, I have merely made it possible in response to the request of the Old I.R.A. associations.</P>
    <P>I now come to what I might describe as a hardy annual.  For years, successive Ministers for Defence have been extending the latest dates of application for military service certificates, and in the Act of 1949 people were given up to the 7th June, 1951, to petition for the re-examination of rejected applications made under the Acts of 1924 and 1934.  Nevertheless, late applications and petitions continue to be received, although it is difficult to understand why that should be so after all the opportunities given over the years.  I am now providing by Section 5 of this Bill for a further extension for petitions, the period being six months from the passage of the Bill. I also intend to make regulations providing for a similar extension of time for receiving applications for service certificates from persons who had not applied before the expiration of the previous time limit, that is, the 7th June, 1952.  I think that the House will agree that, after 28 years in the case of one Act and 18 in the case of the other, it is about time that everybody who feels he is entitled to a certificate should now set about applying for it.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill will get rid of a long-standing grievance&mdash;the abatement of military service pensions because of the payment of remuneration, pensions or allowances out of public funds or by a local authority. The first step in the mitigation of this grievance was taken in the No. 2 Act of 1945, and the Government have now decided to abolish abatement entirely. I understand that almost 1,800 persons will benefit by this course and I am glad that it has been found possible to accede to the many representations made by all parties and by so many groups.  It follows from the abolition of abatement under the Military Service Pensions Acts themselves that <Col N="46" /> military service pensions should no longer continue to abate or be abated by pensions payable under other Acts, and Section 6 also makes the necessary provision in this connection.</P>
    <P>I have, therefore, tried to meet the requests that have been made from time to time for the amendment of the Military Service Pensions Acts.  Abatement is being abolished; pensions are being increased; and I have endeavoured, as I said, to compromise to the fullest possible extent on the request that the same periods of time should count for military service and superannuation.</P>
    <P>There is another feature which I also feel I should mention and which, I think, is not always sufficiently appreciated. A military service pensioner who finds himself incapacitated through age or infirmity is no longer entirely dependent on his pension. Provided that his means are below the appropriate annual sum he is eligible for a special allowance, and these allowances, it must be agreed, have certainly helped to improve the lot of persons who gave service to the State and who have fallen upon hard times.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill.  Nevertheless, I believe it will remove a number of the outstanding grievances which have been expressed on behalf of the Old I.R.A., and I feel that the House will appreciate the position regarding the efforts which are now being made to deal with these claims.  Within the next couple of weeks, I hope to introduce an Army Pensions Bill.  That Bill will, among other things, provide for certain increases in wound, disability and other pensions and allowances payable under the Army Pensions Acts.  It will also extend the date of application for medals, thus rendering a large additional number of persons eligible to qualify for special allowances and will, in addition, effect certain improvements in the rates of special allowances.</P>
    <P>The cost of the provisions contained in these two Bills is estimated to amount to about £400,000 a year. Deputies will, I feel sure, agree that this is a generous sum to provide towards the removal of the grievances <Col N="47" /> so often referred to in this House.  It is a substantial amount, which may have to be added to in view of the possible effects of the extension of the date for petitions and new applications under the present Bill, as well as the further proposed extension of the date for medal applications.  As the sum which I have mentioned, together with the arrears, will have to be found in the forthcoming financial year, Deputies will, no doubt, agree that the taxpayer, the main source of our revenue, should not be further strained in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have reached the stage where we can view with dispassionate objectivity the purpose which these Bills serve.  While the Minister makes the case that a substantial sum of money has to be found to deal with the effect of this Bill and another Bill which he intends to bring before the House, I think he is still missing, in the very structure and fabric of these amending Bills, the basic principle that most of us now accept as regards pensions for people who have given service to the State. Fortunately, we have, in the main, arrived at unanimity as regards our anxiety to give decent recognition to all classes of people who served and suffered in any way to the detriment of their health while in the service of the State.</P>
      <P>Parts of this Bill commend themselves very earnestly to the House but I say that the Bill fails in its real objective.  I am not making that observation in a spirit of political criticism. I am making it with a deep feeling of regret.  I object to the constant badinage around this House of the conditions and sufferings of some of the people who have served this State.  I was hoping that this new measure might, once and for all, serve as a medium for finishing this constant round-about barrage from one side of the House to the other claiming substantial credit for doing things that for too long were left undone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My criticism of this Bill will not be by way of any suggestion of opposing it.  I desire to suggest earnestly to the <Col N="48" /> Minister that we might get together on the Committee Stage of this Bill, as we did on another Bill in relation to his Department, in an endeavour to get a kind of unanimity of decision in the House to improve the Bill and bring it to what we might describe as the optimum standard that we can reach to meet the demands of these people.</P>
    <P>There is one glaring, outstanding and howling injustice in this Bill and nobody is more aware of it than the Minister himself: it is that pensions in a certain range are limited to an increase of 50 per cent.  The very Act from which the Minister is quoting, and from which he is taking the line of increase, has no pensioner as lowly remunerated by way of pension as are some of the men who gave service to this State.  It is not my purpose to criticise what might have been the work of the referee or what justification there may be for the beggarly awards that were made to some people who were given certificates of service in the interests of this country from 1916 onwards.  I think the Minister is more than reasonable when dealing with problems in relation to his former comrades and former colleagues, but there can be no justification in the mind of any reasonable man for a Pensions Bill that will limit the increase of pension of men drawing as little as £8, £10, £12, and £14 a year to £5, £6, £7 or £8 a year while the same Bill will provide very substantial&mdash;and properly substantial&mdash;increases for people drawing pensions in much higher groups.</P>
    <P>In all earnestness I suggest to the Minister that he might use this machinery which he is now introducing to put a minimum level on any pension, irrespective of the certificate award. There is little satisfaction even in a 300 per cent. or 400 per cent. increase in pension for the man who has £8, £10, £12, £14, £20 or £30 a year.  I feel, and I am sure that the members of this House will agree with me if they view this matter in a dispassionate way, that the people in the very small pension groups are those towards whom our greatest effort should first be directed.  I do not think it is comparable that a person with a pension <Col N="49" /> of £350 a year might go to £445 when the unfortunate person with a pension in the very lowest range is limited to a maximum increase of 50 per cent.  I do not make that observation in any spirit of political advantage.  I am saying it to the Minister because I feel from my association with him on these problems, that he is as earnest as I am in wanting to right the wrongs. There is no doubt in anybody's mind that the greater element of hardship and the greater element of wrong, or of imaginary wrong, must exist in the lowest group of pensions.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see certain parts of this Bill become a reality.  I have been a constant advocate of the removal of that iniquitous clause of the Bill; I have been a constant advocate of finding, once and for all, a reasonable and rational solution of the root cause of this trouble.  The root cause of this trouble rests in the fact that, unfortunately, up to very recent years the question of military service and pensions and everything else was too much in a political atmosphere and too little in a rational atmosphere. Despite all the difficulties and the many problems that are arising in a general way, we can now, in this House, arrive at a reasonable state of independent criticism and independent constructive effort to deal with this problem which is becoming&mdash;as is inevitable by the passage of time&mdash;a diminishing one.</P>
    <P>I am most regretful about what is not contained in this Bill, that is, that some fund is not set aside by the Minister which would prevent us from witnessing, as we witness week after week, the appalling degradation and the appalling misery of some people who, in the extremes of their poverty or their difficulty, have to rely on the sending around of the hat to old comrades, or to those who might have sympathetic association with them, to enable them to accord adequate burial to some of those people who have given honourable and decent service to the State.  I should very much like to have seen in this Bill a provision whereby the Minister might have had at his control certain funds from which he could disburse moneys to enable the relatives <Col N="50" /> of some of our honourable dead to avoid the necessity of importuning the good nature of some people, and in many cases people in nearly as difficult circumstances as themselves, for the procuration of decent and adequate burial for some of our 1916 and Old I.R.A. men.</P>
    <P>To my mind, this Bill is a step in the right direction, though a warning note was sounded by the Minister that these two measures will cost £400,000. The Minister is in a different position from any other Minister in relation to this problem because this charge will be a diminishing charge.  The onward march of Sergeant Death himself, becoming more active in these ranks day by day, will reduce the charge on public funds.  I earnestly urge on the members of this House that, in considering this problem in its proper perspective, we should remember in a positive and specific way that no matter what contribution we may make to the last days of these people who are still left with us, it will be microscopic as compared to the contribution which they themselves made in their day so that we might have the right of any decision with regard to them to-day.</P>
    <P>I am dealing with this matter purely on the basis that I feel the Minister can improve this Bill.  With the kind of unanimous support and atmosphere that is now in the House, I feel that he can come back here to get the Bill enlarged to the extent that we can deal once and for all with those people. I think it is a degrading and an appalling thing that organisations representing the Old I.R.A., and that members of the Old I.R.A., whether pre-Truce or not, have for so long been mendicants in the Lobby looking for satisfaction from successive Governments. There is something indecent about that.  It is appalling to find that men who in all honesty and sincerity of purpose, served in those years have now become virtual beggars at the seat of whatever Government may be in power. I earnestly urge on the House that, in dealing with this stage of this code we should once and for all lift this out of the political arena and out of anything in the nature of a sop, and, instead, get down to the business around a <Col N="51" /> table, with representatives of all sections and Parties in this House, of finding out what are the outstanding difficulties, and what is the answer to the problem of bringing in once and for all not piecemeal solutions but one that will be effective as a final solution and so do justice to those who truly deserve justice from this House.</P>
    <P>I say with full deliberation that I can appreciate what the Minister's difficulties have been.  The dead hand of the Department of Finance is laid very heavily on this Bill, because nobody with the association and experience which the Minister has had in dealing with his own Department could have conceived the pension increases which are designed for the lower groups.  I do not believe, and if I did believe it I would be terribly disappointed, that these increases in any way reflect the Minister's honest opinion.  That is why I say to him in an earnest way that, with the considerable improvement possible in the atmosphere and spirit in which we can consider these problems to-day, we should try, in a positive way, to get this Bill enlarged, and so deal with all outstanding problems. I say that because the Minister knows as well as I do&mdash;so do all Deputies who are interested in this particular subject&mdash;that we will no sooner have closed the gaps which the Minister is closing in this Bill than there will be pressure in connection with others. That will only create more trouble for ourselves.  We are certainly not dealing with this problem in a reasonable way unless we try and tackle it now on the basis of finding a composite solution of it within this new proposed measure.</P>
    <P>In dealing with legislation of this kind, which goes through this House unanimously and with the blessing of us all, we have to contemplate what we can do in a situation where some of those people die leaving completely dependent widows behind them.  That is a facet of the situation that is not considered in this Bill.  It is one that causes me alarm.  We have to envisage the distress that there can be in a home where a surviving officer of the movement <Col N="52" /> for national liberation leaves behind him a destitute widow.  Is it not right, when dealing with another series of amending Bills to this code, that we should give serious thought to that question, and see whether it would not be possible, under the code, to ensure that so long as she survives her husband a widow would at least get sufficient to keep her off public relief or from virtual destitution?</P>
    <P>It may seem to members of the House that I am highly critical of this Bill.  I am not highly critical of it in this sense that I realise the Minister has been caught in an awkward position. He has had to do his best within what was given to him.  As I said earlier, we welcome certain facets of this Bill.  We feel that it deals with part of a problem that has been outstanding for a long time.  I seriously urge on the Minister that he will have the full co-operation and the unanimous support of this House in his demand for a little more if that little more is once and for all going to give us some kind of a composite solution of this problem.  I urge on the Minister that some funds be made available to ensure that this not very edifying practice of passing the hat around when former colleagues are gone might cease.  I urge on him that more consideration be given to the problem that has arisen in the past and will arise in the future, with regard to the widows of important and very distinguished soldier husbands.  There must be some consideration given to the pensions for those in the lower groups.  There will have to be some definite ruling on that.  Speaking from recollection, we succeeded in forcing Deputy McGilligan, when Minister for Finance, to make the pension under the Act passed at that time an irreducible £50, and that any pension that was less than £50 would be brought up to that figure.</P>
    <P>I do not know if that is possible under this Bill.  I certainly think that there was some weird essence of contempt, or some distorted sense of contempt, in the certificates of service that were granted to men who carried pensions as low as some of those men did.  Whatever heat may have been <Col N="53" /> engendered in the past, and no matter what may have happened 30 years ago, I think the time has now arrived for us in this deliberative Assembly to give to those people, during the years that may remain to them, the measure of justice which this House in its unanimous judgment thinks ought to be given to them.</P>
    <P>I am saying to the Minister, as I said to him when the Army Bill came before us, can we lift this pensions problem out of the forum of this House and, in a completely representative way, get around a table and use the very many sources of information that are available to the Minister in order to get a general view of the problem and arrive at a Bill that will make a decent contribution to a final settlement of this constantly repeated question of justice for the Old I.R.A.?</P>
    <P>I was not born in the days when this service was being rendered but it is full time that we should accept the responsibility of a debt that we owe to those people.  If it is possible for us as a Dáil at this stage of our national existence and independence substantially to help by a monetary contribution any of those who may be finding the stress and strain of existence difficult, we should do it, not in a niggardly way and not in a way that can be distorted into an act of unfairness.  We should do it in a way that will pay tribute to the service they have given and that will reflect our appreciation of that service and the effective part they played in making possible the Irish Republic of 1953.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to look at this Bill from a humanitarian and not from a political point of view.  I want to put considerations to the Minister which I hope will induce him to make another effort with the Government to improve the scope of this Bill.  In so far as the Bill increases military pensions, the Labour Party is strongly in favour of it and wholeheartedly welcomes it.  We realise at the same time that the Bill does not bring to an end the claims which have been extant for many years of Old I.R.A. organisations because there is still a feeling of disappointment and frustration and in many <Col N="54" /> respects a feeling of disillusionment among many members of that organisation that basically their claims have not been dealt with fairly.</P>
      <P>I do not want to accuse the Minister of acting unfairly in this matter.  I am quite sure that in this field he has as generous a heart as anyone in this House.  Notwithstanding the generosity of an individual Minister, it is not always easy to do the things one wants to do.  Therefore, I want to bring to bear on the Minister the viewpoint of the Labour Party in this House that steps should be taken to revise the Bill in a manner that will give a greater measure of satisfaction to those affected by it.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Bill provides an increase in pensions which do not exceed £100 per annum by 50 per cent. but it is a sobering thought that more than 80 per cent. of those who are in receipt of pensions receive less than £25 per annum.  Many receive pensions as low as £6 13s. 4d. per annum. An increase of 50 per cent. in the case of a pension of £6 13s. 4d. per annum will not make any perceptible impression in the matter of relieving economic difficulties.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that so many of those who have pensions are in receipt of such low pensions&mdash;80 per cent. having less than 10/- per week&mdash;there is a strong case for regarding this Bill from the standpoint of lifting the minimum pensions so as to ensure that there will not be minimum pensions as low as £6 13s. 4d. per annum and that there will not be such a number&mdash;80 per cent.&mdash;with less than 10/- per week.</P>
      <P>I do not imagine that it is a fair assessment of the people who served from 1916 to 1921 to say that any of their service, having regard to the risks they took, could be measured by a pension so paltry as £6 13s. 4d. per annum.  Certainly, if they had been concerned with their own safety and well-being and future economic outlook and had put that on one side of the scales, it would hardly have been measured by a pension of £6 13s. 4d. per year on the other side of the scales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I therefore want to plead with the <Col N="55" /> Minister that there ought to be an examination of the problem with a view to making a minimum rate of pension and getting away from these paltry pensions of £6, £7, £8, £10 and £20 per year and recognising frankly that, whatever other obligations this generation has to the past, it has one obligation, a debt of honour to those who fought in the national struggle from 1916 to 1921 and whose service in that struggle and whose sacrifices and endurance made it possible for us to sit in this House to-day and contemplate the introduction of this legislation. That is a debt of honour which this generation must discharge.  I do not think that any burden we can impose on this generation is too onerous for it to discharge if we are dealing genuinely and honestly with the legitimate claims of those whose sacrifices have enabled us to inherit this House and the measure of independence and the measure of freedom which we enjoy to-day to legislate for 26 out of our 32 counties.</P>
    <P>I plead therefore, first, for a lifting of the pensions, particularly of the lower rates of pension because I think some of the rates are insulting to the recipients.  I plead, secondly, for special recognition of 1916 service. Nineteen hundred and sixteen was an epoch which this generation must always regard as transcending every other experience that this generation has had.  It is probably the most glorious epoch and the most cherished epoch on which the nation can look back.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the assessment of military service pensions, one finds in respect of the ordinary volunteer who went out in 1916 and who went out as a volunteer in 1921, that the recognition accorded to that person in respect of 1916 service is utterly inadequate and bears no relation at all to the risks they took and the defiance of those men who made that epoch possible and who enabled a seed to be sown then which yielded a very generous harvest in freedom and independence in later years.</P>
    <P>I plead, therefore, for special recognition <Col N="56" /> of the claims of those who have 1916 service.  In so far as they were then 30 years of age they are 67 years of age now.  There cannot be many of them now living.  I do not think we would be straining the resources of this country&mdash;and certainly we have spent money on less deserving projects &mdash;if we were to recognise 1916 service and to accord a minimum pension of £100 per annum to those who have that service.  We should frankly recognise that service in that period and in the circumstances of 1916 was well worthy of such recognition.  I do not believe that any but the bitterest opponents of Irish independence and the concept of Irish independent nationality would offer the slightest objection to a proposal introduced in this House to provide minimum pensions of £100 per year for 1916 service.</P>
    <P>I plead too for another class of person, the man who may have £6 13s. 4d. per year as a pension and who is now approaching the age of 65 or 70, who is finding it, especially in present circumstances, hard to keep a job.  Certainly if he is out of a job he is finding it still harder to get one.  That person, provided he has a service certificate and a medal, may make a claim for a special allowance.  If he is lucky enough to be awarded a special allowance, he gets, I think, a maximum of about £120, subject to a means test. Anybody who has had experience of the means test in that respect knows that it can be a very microscopic arrangement.  There are people trying to see what source of income the applicant for such assistance may have. Before that person can get any allowance he must be certified to be incapable of providing sustenance for himself; in other words incapable of self-support. If he is proved to be incapable of self-support, then he may make an application for a special allowance and may get it, subject as I say to a pretty searching means test.  If he is lucky, he may get £100 a year.  If he has any income coming in to him, that will be subtracted from the £100.  My experience in this matter is not unique, but I have seen cases of men with I.R.A service obliged to keep themselves <Col N="57" /> and a wife on an income as low as £2 a week or even less in the form of an allowance.  If we recognise that a special allowance is necessary, if we recognise that it will represent the determination of the nation to ensure that those who served in its hours of travail should not be allowed to experience hunger and hardship in their old age, we ought to make that allowance a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>Will anybody attempt to say that £2 a week to-day is a reasonable allowance for an Old I.R.A. man to maintain himself and his wife, to pay rent, to buy clothes and food in the year 1953 when, from the Government's own figures, the present £ is only worth 8/- reckoned on 1939 values?  What we are doing with that man is giving him roughly 16/- a week in 1939 purchasing power and we are saying to him: &ldquo;Our recognition and appreciation of your services to the nation is such that we give you 16/- per week in 1939 purchasing power.  That is the admiration we have for your services.  Or we will give you 1953 £1 notes which will buy 8/- worth of 1939 standard and expect you to keep yourself and your wife and to have all the amenities of civilised living on such an allowance.&rdquo;  I think that is unfair, that the allowance is inadequate.  I do not think there is any Deputy on any side who will disagree with what I say.</P>
    <P>What we have to recognise, even though cost may be involved, is the debt of honour due by this nation, and especially by this House, to these Old I.R.A. men who have reached a stage of life where they are no longer capable of sustaining themselves by their own efforts.  I plead that such a man and his wife ought to get, if he is no longer able to work, an allowance of not less than £250 per annum.  I do not know how any man and his wife can live to-day in Dublin, Limerick, Cork or Waterford, or indeed any town or village, on anything less than an income of £5 per week.  We are dealing with a small group of people between 60 and 70 years of age, some of them perhaps turned 70.  It is a dwindling liability so far as the State is concerned.  We ought to be generous in recognising the claim of these people to a decent sustenance <Col N="58" /> in their old age.  The situation is not so bad where a person is able to earn a regular income from a job as a tradesman or artisan which is able to keep a man and his wife.  But when a man is no longer able by his own exertions to do that, surely it is only fair, if he has had national service, that the State should recognise a moral obligation to keep that person in conditions which would take some cognisance of our appreciation of his services to the nation.</P>
    <P>If some of these people had been at Dunkirk or in North France or on the African coast or in any other theatre of war, they would have got a pension substantially higher than we are paying. We ought to have as high a recognition of the services which our people rendered against odds much more terrifying than the odds against which those who have higher pensions fought. I think nobody in this House will question the grant of reasonable pensions to those who are no longer capable of sustaining themselves.  Nor do I think they will cavil at the notion of paying a special allowance of £5 a week to the Old I.R.A. man who is unable to maintain himself and his wife by his own efforts and exertions.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to put to the Minister is the position of those who apply for a special allowance.  The present Act in that respect, in my view, is unduly rigid.  It provides that a man may make application for a special allowance, but if, having sifted his means, the board concerned decides that he is not incapable of self-help or that his means are in excess of the minimum allowance allowed before he can be entitled to a special allowance, then his application is rejected.  No matter what economic ill may befall him in the following week or the following day, he cannot reopen that claim for another 12 months.</P>
    <P>I had a case some time ago in which a person made application for a special allowance.  He was unable to work but his wife was a cleaner and caretaker in a particular building.  The board took into consideration the wife's income and said to him: &ldquo;You are not eligible.  Your wife's earnings preclude you from getting a special allowance.&rdquo;<Col N="59" /> Two letters came to his house on the one day, one rejecting his own claim for a special allowance and another giving notice to his wife that her services were no longer required. That case could not be reopened for another 12 months.  That is an unfair provision.</P>
    <P>Under the old age pension code, if you can show that your means have decreased, you can instantaneously make a fresh application for an old age pension.  Why do we permit old age pensioners to make application for an increase in their pensions or people to apply for a pension when there is a change in their means and not permit the old soldier of the national struggle to do the same?  It is certainly unfair to say to a man: &ldquo;No matter how your circumstances may deteriorate, no matter what hardship has befallen you or how much circumstances have changed to your disadvantage, we will not look at your case for another 12 months.&rdquo;  That may make for administrative tidiness and may save work at headquarters, but it is not fair or just. It is not a human way of treating the people who have a claim and who will always have a claim on your consideration in the matter of treating them sympathetically.  The provision which provides only for an annual review should be amended and once a person can show that his circumstances have changed he ought to be eligible to renew his application for the special allowance.</P>
    <P>These are some points which I wanted to raise on the Bill.  I do not make these points by way of personal criticism of the Minister, whose sympathy in this matter is at least as high as mine or that of any other Deputy.  I want to put it to the Minister that this is a human problem, not a political problem.  I would not like to see it discussed in a political atmosphere or against a political background. I think there is goodwill on both sides of the House in the desire of every Deputy to give a fair deal, and it may well be a new deal, to the Old I.R.A.  If the nation has to bear the cost of doing that I do not think it will shrink from the task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>At the end of his introductory remarks the Minister referred, presumably in relation to expenditure, to further provisions for Army pensions.  I think his remark gives me liberty now to make an observation before I come to the specific matter contained in this Bill.</P>
      <P>When we come to deal with these further provisions following on from this Bill, I hope that the question of widows and dependents of Army personnel killed in the course of service will be treated on a basis which will meet their case.  It is not sufficient to treat the case of such widows and dependents on the basis of superannuation. We have made that case before.  We will, of course, have an opportunity when that measure comes up of controverting some of the statements made in the last debate we had on this subject.  I want, however, to take this opportunity of appealing to the Minister to look at that particular problem from the insurance point of view.  There are cases where an officer, N.C.O., or man has been killed in the course of his duty and the circumstances are such as to take those cases out of the run of merely ordinary pension and superannuation.  Such cases should really be considered on an insurance basis.  I hope that this matter will be treated in the way in which we have asked that it should be treated.  I shall leave the point now until such time as we know what the Minister proposes to do.</P>
      <P>Coming to the present Bill, we are still faced with the question of trying to do what can be done for those people who have given service within the categories catered for by this measure.  Sometimes in the past there was a certain resistance to measures of this kind but to-day everybody is agreed that the people who are the subject of this Bill should be treated as generously as possible and that their service should be recognised in a practical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been the limitation on successive Governments?  In the past there were some people who, overtly or otherwise, were not too keen to support I.R.A. pensioners.  If there are any such to-day they do not appear to <Col N="61" /> be very vocal.  To-day everybody seems to be agreed.  What is the obstacle to conceding all the claims and meeting all the points made?  The obstacle is obviously the question of finding the money.  Successive Ministers have been faced with the difficulty of financing these schemes.  It is quite obvious that the present Minister is anxious to be as generous as he possibly can in present circumstances.  The principal difficulty is, as the Minister has stated, that in all State outgoings the ultimate source of revenue is the taxpayer in one form or another.  It is all very well for Deputy S. Collins to talk about the dead hand of finance.  He will probably be one of the most vocal here when it comes to the live hand of finance trying to collect the money to run the country.  One cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all agreed that these people who serve the country are deserving of the best consideration we can give them.  The remarks made by Deputy Collins are a little bit one-sided. If we are serious in this we must grapple with the problem facing the Minister.  At least the Minister has introduced the present measure. The principal problem, as Deputy Collins knows, is that of finance.  That problem exists in relation to all State activities.  We will shortly have a Health Bill coming up for discussion and many of us will be somewhat staggered at the amount involved under the provisions of that Bill.  We have social services.  We have all sorts of expenditure voted here.  When a question of expenditure comes up here everybody vies with everybody else in asking to have the money voted, but when we come to the question of raising the money people are not quite so unanimous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not raise this matter on this particular Bill for the purpose of making an issue of the relatively small sum of money here involved compared with over-all State expenditure.  I raise the point so that we may come <Col N="62" /> down to earth and approach this subject in a practical manner.  Looking at it fairly and squarely, I think the Minister is to be congratulated in being able to make the provision he has made at the present moment in present circumstances.  From the point of view of the State we have a situation of considerable financial stringency in which it is extremely difficult to find the money for all the things for which it has to be found because of the many demands on State revenues.  Although the Minister has not been able to do what he would like to do if he could, I think he has done a great deal in present circumstances.  Deputy Collins' approach to-day is to say the least of it hardly objective.  We are all agreed on a number of points put forward by Deputy Collins.  We are certainly sympathetic to what he appeared to put forward as the activating motive.  Let Deputy Collins consider the matter now as a serious down-to-earth parliamentarian, and not merely as someone making a speech on an occasion.  If he does that, he will see that the Minister has done very well in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy Norton when he was a member of a Government was motivated by the same sentiments as he expressed to-day.  I am sure it was not lack of goodwill on the part of Deputy Norton and his colleagues that prevented his Government doing anything like this.  I think that point alone should be some answer to Deputy Collins'&mdash;I may possibly be wronging him&mdash;oblique attack on the Minister to-day.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton was a Minister in a Government in <Col N="63" /> which the Minister for Finance at the time gave this answer in relation to practically the same question; I am sure Deputy Norton was not prevented by want of goodwill at the time because I have heard him express on former occasions sentiments similar to those he expressed here to-day, and I ask Deputy Collins to realise that the Government has to face practical problems; it cannot just wave a wand and work miracles.  Here is the answer given by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, at column 1228 of Volume 117 of the Official Report on the 19th July, 1949, in relation to superannuation and retired allowances and this has a bearing on pensions:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The difficulty with having any minimum is that there is such a large class involved.  Some Deputies introduced the question of military service pensions.  They are not included in this for the reason that they were not, when given, supposed to be a gratuity intended for the maintenance or support of the beneficiary, but rather as an acknowledgment of service rendered.  They were never put on the basis of pensions, although the phrase was used in regard to them.  Of course, our military service pensions are very costly.  They cost nearly £400,000 yearly.  The average pension would be about £30.  If there is any minimum struck and if there is any question of bringing in a military service pensions hereafter&mdash;I am certainly against it at the moment&mdash; then, of course, such an increase as would ensure that no one would have less than £50 could be very costly. Even with the class I am dealing with at the moment&mdash;civil servants, Gardaí, R.I.C. and teachers&mdash;there are over 900 who are on the £50 and under scale.  However, before the legislation goes through I will have that considered but the cost is something which has to be borne in mind.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the paragraph from a speech by Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Norton's colleague in Government when they were both in Government.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Norton says, it is better to look at this objectively. Deputy McGilligan said they were not meant to be pensions but tokens.  That is what he has said in that statement, if the Deputy likes to read it.  However, we are agreed now that we are looking at it from the point of view of pensions.  The point I am trying to make is this.  There is a fundamental difficulty which was presumably the reason why the previous Government, the Coalition, was not able to do anything in the matter.  It is the reason why there was any difficulty in regard to this Government doing anything.  In spite of that, however, it can, at least, be said that the Minister, with the straightforward sincerity that is characteristic of him, has, obviously, very tenaciously sought to get the best measure he possibly could in the circumstances.  I believe he has succeeded in getting this and when one looks back on the history of the matter and the difficulties that obviously confronted other people who were interested in the past, as evidenced by that quotation, I think <Col N="65" /> the present Minister did very well for those people in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>I feel the Bill should be welcomed. That is not to say we should regard ourselves as having ultimately arrived at finality in anything.  My own view would largely coincide, as far as it would be practicable to do it, with the general view that was expressed by Deputies in this matter, but there are, as in many other questions, not so much two sides as practical difficulties in putting it through.  I would recommend that the House would put this Bill through in a spirit of commendation because the Minister has gone very far in it to meet the claims that have been put upon him.  It is unfair to make what I call the oblique attack &mdash;because it was not made directly&mdash; that was made by Deputy Collins.</P>

      <P>I was rather surprised by some of the language that was used by Deputy Collins.  I do not think it was language that should have been used in regard to the old comrades of the Old I.R.A.  This reference to mendicants is a reference that is objectionable and it should not be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has referred to one matter of which we all know: that in 1949, led by the present Minister, this House, almost unanimously, sought an increase in military service pensions from the then Minister for Finance and the then Government. The then Minister refused to grant one <Col N="66" /> halfpenny increase in military service pensions.  It would be wrong that that should be left out of the record, and no amount of windy rhetoric here will alter that fact.  When there was a change of Government we went to the present Minister and to other Ministers and there were deputations from the Old I.R.A.  There was a motion here from Deputy Keane which received unanimous support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>And there were no recriminations on either side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We actually sought the help of the Government in making increases in the military service pensions.  Undoubtedly there are, as Deputy Norton and Deputy Collins say, injustices in the military service pensions code, but those injustices are there because originally, in 1924, when the first Act was brought in, there was a mean attitude of mind in regard to the whole matter. The military service pensions code was born in a mean mentality in 1924 and it lasted from 1924 to 1934, when the new Government brought in another Pensions Bill.  Unfortunately they based it on the mean mentality of the 1924 Act, and if we have pensions as low as £6 13s. 4d. a year now the responsibility rests on the people who introduced, with their mean mentality, that type of pension in 1924.</P>
      <P>That is the foundation of the position we are in to-day, and I want to say right off the reel that when I read the White Paper of the Bill which was circulated by the Minister and which we are now discussing, my first reaction to that was: is it possible that the Minister has been able to make these improvements?  I was pressing for improvements but I thought, in view of the financial position, in view of the refusal over a period of almost 30 years to grant increases, that the increases that were in the Bill could not be in it. I think every Deputy should start off by congratulating the Minister on the steps he has taken and the advances he has made in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that there are pensions referred to that are miserable&mdash;contemptible would be the word I would use in regard to them&mdash;but what the <Col N="67" /> Minister has set out to do is to give 50 per cent. increase in those.  I agree that that is not sufficient&mdash;there ought to be a reasonable minimum pension&mdash; but it is not right for a Deputy like Deputy Norton, who was for over three years a member of a Government which refused to bring in even a 1 per cent. increase, to complain now when a 50 per cent. increase has been brought in.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a little bit of reason and common sense in our approach to a problem such as this. It is very hard to listen to the nonsense that we had from Deputy Collins when he got up to speak after the Minister had finished.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the view, not of Deputies alone but of many in Old I.R.A. organisations outside, that the minimum pension has not been approached in this Bill in a way that will remove causes of grievance, causes of objection and agitation in the future.  Now that the Minister has made such a serious effort to deal with the problem, I think he would find this House unanimous in supporting him in going so much further. I would like to make the following <Col N="69" /> suggestions, having dealt already with the suggestion that the minimum pension be increased.</P>
      <P>There are persons who have been left out of account in the legislation and I think they should not have been left out.  I refer particularly to the children of 1916 leaders, children who suffered so much and perhaps considerably through the sacrifices that were made by their parents&mdash;not only in 1916 but in the years preceding, in preparation for 1916.  I do not want to be more specific, as I think the Minister knows the cases that I have in mind.  Certainly, the children of those great men should receive special recognition from the State and I do not think anyone would raise any objection to it.</P>
      <P>I agree with what has been said in regard to the special allowances.  I think it was the Minister who introduced the special allowances provision first.  It is a very useful one and one that has not been sufficiently appreciated. I agree with Deputy Norton that the condition whereby it can be examined only once in 12 months makes for hardship and that provision should be altered.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to extend the time for a period of six months for new applications for pensions or petitions and perhaps for medals.  I think the Minister might leave that time limit out of it altogether.  It may be that something will turn up from some part of the world at some time, having heard nothing whatsoever about our legislation over the last 30 years. No great upset would be caused by removing the time limit altogether and letting any person at any time apply for a pension.  After all, there are only a few years to run, anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to bring my next point within this Bill, but I would like to mention it.  It is that service in the Old I.R.A. should count as service in the civil service, in the local government service or in any State service. In that way, the crediting of that particular I.R.A. service would assist in getting increased pensions for those people from the local or Government service.  It is only right that that should be so, because the person who <Col N="70" /> joined the State service at the time that another man joined the I.R.A. can retire at the same date as the I.R.A. man and receive a much larger pension. Credit should be given in all State services for previous service in the I.R.A.  I came across a particular case yesterday of a sergeant of the Garda who had been in 1918 his local company commander.  He served as an officer in the I.R.A. right up to the Truce.  He joined the Garda about the time they were established and had to retire under the age limit within the past 12 months on a pension of £3 15s. per week.  If, instead of serving in the I.R.A. and if, instead of serving in the Guards and reaching the rank of sergeant&mdash;a force in which he had a very honourable record&mdash;that man had served under a local authority, the Dublin Corporation, for instance, as the driver of a car, he would have a pension of over £7 per week.  That is unfair discrimination and it could be provided for by the provision I advocate of crediting pre-Truce service as service under the Government.</P>
    <P>I am glad, and I think everyone will be delighted, to see the decision of the Minister to abolish that provision in regard to abatement of pensions.  It was a pin-pricking provision.  Many Deputies have worked very hard for many years, interviewing many Ministers for Finance and Ministers for Defence, in an effort to remove that particular clause.  It is going now and we all should be very pleased and delighted to see the end of it.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties in regard to these pensions Acts is the matter of interpretation and only to-day I came across a case which completely amazed me.  Under the provisions of the Military Service Pensions Acts, a person is entitled to a pension on the basis of the rank he held in 1924, or if he was serving in the Defence Forces, the rank he had when he left the Defence forces.  He is paid on the higher of the two ranks&mdash;the 1924 rank or, if he leaves in 1953, under the 1953 Act.  That is specific and clear, but I came across the case to-day of a man serving in the Defence Forces in 1924 as a sergeant who, in 1935, was considered fit to be commissioned.  He <Col N="71" /> was commissioned in 1935 and served from 1935 until June of 1951 when he retired with the rank of commandant. When he applied for his pension, he was told&mdash;I have the letter from the Secretary of the Department of Defence here&mdash;that he is entitled only to his pension as a sergeant.  In my view, that is a cruel interpretation of the Act and I hope to prove it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is an accurate interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying it is cruel and I want to deal with it.  If a soldier in non-commissioned rank is to be commissioned, an extraordinary procedure grew up whereby he was discharged from the Defence Forces and was then commissioned.  I remember at the time discussing it and feeling that it was entirely wrong.  It is a good many years ago but I felt it was wrong and I opposed it.  I must say that I never foresaw the possibility of a case such as this arising.  I thought it ridiculous, because the service should be continuous and in fact is continuous, except for this fictional discharge.  This man is commissioned on a date in 1935, and, in order to be commissioned, there is what I can best describe as this fictional discharge on that day or the day previous.  He is then commissioned but that soldier has not ceased to serve.  I might put this to the Minister: If he is discharged, on getting a commission, that is the date of his discharge and he would be entitled to his military service pension as from that date.  As from the date of discharge, he is entitled under the Act, if he was discharged, to his pension from that date and should have been receiving it during all the period he was in the Army from 1935 to date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; the man who rejoins the Army who is entitled to a military service pension is entitled to receive it during his period of service in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case I am dealing with is the case of a man who applied for his pension and was told that he is entitled to a pension of £22 10s. a year as a sergeant.  He retired with the rank of commandant, having served from 1935 to 1951, 16 years, after his service as a sergeant terminated.  There is no break in that man's service and he is entitled to be paid his pension as a commandant.  If there is any doubt about the interpretation&mdash;I have described it as cruel but the Minister says it is a correct interpretation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps.  My view is that it is inaccurate as well as cruel, but I have not got the responsibility of interpreting it.  If there is any doubt about this, this is the opportunity to deal with it, and I ask the Minister to bring in the necessary amendment to correct the situation and put it right, so far as this officer is concerned.  I probably would have the right to bring in an amendment, though it might be ruled by the Chair as imposing a charge on public funds, but I could argue that with the Chair because I would say that my amendment was an amendment designed to remove doubts as to the interpretation. However, this Bill gives an opportunity of putting the matter right.</P>
      <P>I welcome the courageous decision of the Minister, after all the refusals we have had, to increase military service pensions, and I am sure the Minister agrees with the speakers who had said that the minimum has not been raised enough.  The Minister has his difficulties with regard to it, but, with goodwill on the part of every Deputy and with a unanimous appeal to the Minister and to the Government, we may be able to remove the objections which exist with regard to these limitations.  I hope that occasions such as this will not be availed of for the purpose of referring to our old comrades as mendicants.  They did carry the responsibility of establishing this State and they carried it proudly. There is no circumstance which, I believe, would make my former comrades mendicants.</P>

    <Col N="73" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanKeane" hpid="Mr. Keane Mr. Keane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keane</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start at the point of rendering unto Cæsar what is Cæsar's.  On the few occasions on which I approached the Minister in relation to these matters, he showed sympathy and consideration.  I am not going to say that he should not do so, as an old soldier, but I will say that it was always a pleasure to discuss with him anomalies which affected the Old I.R.A.  I take this opportunity to thank him personally for the manner in which he treated any representations made to him and upon the way in which he introduced the present Bill which, although it may not be a panacea for all our ills, represents another step in the right direction.  Like Deputy Cowan, I believe that the Bills introduced in 1924 and 1934 were measures introduced in a peculiar atmosphere and, if you like, were inspired by a somewhat unbalanced mentality.  I have an idea that they were both measures of expediency.  However, like the first stone that has to be laid before a house is built, they were the foundation for the other Acts.  Some of us tried to put in the damp course, and now, perhaps, we are trying to cover in the structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two matters which I should like to put before the Minister which he may find it possible to deal with by way of amendment on the Committee Stage.  However, my first duty, in fact I should say it is my first love, is to the 1916 men who at the moment are in the winter of their lives.  Most of us here are comparatively young men, and even some of us who were there in 1916 cannot say that we are yet in the winter of our lives, but there is no doubt that the majority of the men connected with the 1916 Insurrection are in the winter of their lives. I think that the Minister can afford to be more than generous with the few that are still left.  I do not believe that anyone would object to a proposal to increase their pensions by a very generous amount.  I do not want to make political capital out of this. The very few 1916 men who reside in my constituency do not even vote for me, but there is no doubt that, in the City of Dublin, members of the old Dublin Brigade who answered the call <Col N="74" /> on Easter Monday of 1916, after having been disappointed on the previous Sunday, are suffering under anomalies that many of us do not realise.  I would ask the Minister to review their cases with a view to ascertaining whether he can do anything to assist them substantially.</P>
    <P>Again, there are widows of Old I.R.A. men who have to be provided for under the Social Security Acts.  I have before my mind the case of the widow of Michael O'Donoghue, Ballygiblin, Mitchelstown, who was a small farmer, and what is known down the country as a country carpenter.  He left a widow and 11 children after him, and she is now in receipt of a widow's pension under the non-contributory scheme.  I think that the Minister could embrace cases such as that under his pension scheme so that the orphans of Irish soldiers might be brought up in a way that would conduce to their advancement in the future.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make a suggestion to the Minister with regard to applicants who appealed and the amount of whose pensions was actually reduced on appeal.  I am afraid that the reduction was not due to the board's ascertaining that these people had not the service upon which they were originally awarded the pension but was due to some sinister influence exercised by somebody who at one time or another was deemed to be a certifying officer.  Some of these certifying officers were very fine men, but more of them feathered their own nest and then proceeded to feather their friends' nests.  I made this statement on a previous occasion.  I have a case in mind, the circumstances of which I know personally and I asked the last Minister when he introduced his Bill in 1949, to take that case into consideration, but I met with an iron curtain. I hope there will be some flexibility in regard to that case under this Bill.  The man concerned was one of Ireland's soldiers who was there at any time he was wanted.  He underwent three hunger strikes as a guest of King George in England.  Unfortunately for himself, he may be a little arrogant at times.  We have a lot of brass hats who when they get a little authority do not exactly know what hats fit <Col N="75" /> them.  I am informed, though I cannot vouch for this personally, that an attendant in a mental hospital who applied and got service from the Pensions Board had that service deducted for superannuation purposes in the Department of Health.  I do not know if that is a fact, but I would ask the Minister to make some inquiries in regard to it.  I shall probably be able to give him more specific information at a later date.</P>
    <P>Four hundred thousand pounds looks a pretty big sum, but it must be remembered that since the first Pensions Act was introduced in 1924 there has been a big saving due to the fact that many of our old friends who were entitled to pensions have entered Valhalla, a saving which I would estimate at about £500,000.  If the Minister adheres strictly to the terms of the Bill, he may take it that due to the diminishing number qualifying for pensions every year, there will be a big reduction on the £400,000 which he mentioned.</P>
    <P>Every month and almost every week you will see accounts in the daily Press, the <i>Irish Press</i>, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and in the provincial newspapers of a soldier's funeral. I presume that that soldier carried his pension with him to the grave, and that he did not leave it after him to benefit anybody in this world.  I hope the Minister will give all the 1916 medals that are there.  I am very thankful for a 50 per cent. increase.</P>
    <P>I do not know the percentage who would be in receipt of pensions from £6 to £30, but I do think that these are miserable sums of money to offer to any man for service.  If service was assessed at £6 that would mean a half a year for officers and a whole year for non-commissioned officers.  I wonder if the Minister would grade these people up to a standard sum.  I do not want to suggest anything that would entangle the Minister in the tentacles of the octopus of finance, but if the Minister tried to get as much as he could he would not be doing a bad day's work at all.  I would ask the Minister to consider the case of the pensioners in <Col N="76" /> receipt of small pensions, and give them something that would help them to carry on in their avocations or rear their families.  I am very glad that you cleared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Perhaps if we had a Dáil composed of members who were not as conversant with the old days as we are we might get better consideration.</P>
      <P>The provision of medal allowances is a step in the right direction and I hope that when the Minister is drafting the allowances he will not be too meagre and will not impose upon applicants too many regulations such as those mentioned by Deputy Norton.  Deputy Captain Cowan introduced tactics which were not exactly clean.  We may not all have the same physical and moral courage as Deputy Captain Cowan.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;moral&rdquo; but this Bill should be discussed without any recriminations.  It would be futile for me to say that political kudos could not be made out of it.  I know very well&mdash;in this connection I include myself&mdash;that it is only human nature that when we get the chance we avail of it.</P>
      <P>A lot of the people who spoke were afraid to strike up to the time my motion was tabled.  I am glad that we have done a good day's work for those in receipt of I.R.A. pensions and that they will benefit as a result of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want frankly to congratulate the Minister on this Bill.  As one who has agitated for it for a <Col N="77" /> number of years, both in opposition and otherwise, I think that in the times that exist&mdash;times of financial stringency&mdash;the Minister has done very well indeed in the Bill that is before us. Admittedly, there are a number of points that we all might like to see improved but, taking the Bill by and large, I think that the Minister has succeeded admirably in the Bill before us.  He has dealt with a number of the grievances and anomalies that we have been talking about for years.  If he has not dealt with them in this Bill then they will be dealt with in the Bill that he has told us is to come in the next few weeks, matters such as the question of the special allowances, medals, the date of their issue and other things like that.</P>
      <P>Big points that have never been dealt with before were raised.  They were not dealt with.  I am sure that is not because the Minister would not like personally to deal with them but because of the fact that circumstances do not allow him to deal with them. The increases in pensions, as explained in the White Paper, are exactly the same as that given in 1949 by the Coalition Government to other pensioners. At that time an effort was made to have the Old I.R.A. men included and the Minister for Finance of the day could not see his way to do it. At that time there was not the same reason financially for not doing it as there would be to-day.  In spite of that, however, the Minister succeeded in doing very well.</P>
      <P>One matter which I am particularly glad to see ended under this Bill is that of the abatement of pensions. Deputy Cowan referred to it as &ldquo;pin-pricking&rdquo;. I think it was far more than pin-pricking.  It was a gross injustice to a number of men whom I know&mdash;a number of men who had their jobs even before the foundation of the Volunteers and who, because of the nature of their employment, were refused the pension which the board had awarded them for their service.  I think that that was an injustice and I congratulate the Minister on its abolition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to add my voice to the appeal which has been made here <Col N="78" /> to the Minister in regard to rejected claims for special allowances and the fact that they cannot be reopened for a period of 12 months.  It is a matter which might lead to administrative difficulties, but I believe they could be surmounted.  Undoubtedly it is a terrible hardship on a man who, owing to his bad circumstances, would be entitled to a special allowance but who has to await the elapse of a full 12 months before the matter can be reopened. Where it can be shown that an applicant's circumstances have changed from the time he made his prior application, I think it should be possible to have his case gone into again and the allowance granted.  As somebody said here this evening, it is not a humane way of dealing with such cases and, whatever the difficulties may be, I think they should be tackled and dealt with.</P>
    <P>The minimum pension was mentioned here.  I do not suppose that, because of financial difficulties, it would be possible to bring in minimum pensions at the present time, but, even if it were, it might create bigger difficulties than the present position. A sum of £50 a year was mentioned. You could have men who succeeded in getting ten years' service from the board receiving only the same as a man who gave only a couple of months. I consider that there would be big grievances on the part of people who were able to prove that they gave the real service and who would be getting only the same as a man who came in, maybe, only for a few months.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to congratulate the Minister and to express the hope that when better times come we shall be able to improve still further on certain aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as a step in the right direction to settle many of the grievances of the Old I.R.A.  I congratulate the Minister on keeping his word.  He told us he would bring in this Bill, and he has done so.  I cannot, however, congratulate the Minister on his efforts, because I am satisfied that he has left many things out of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are talking in this House about the claims of the Old I.R.A., <Col N="79" /> there is no need for heated discussion. I am sorry that heated discussion took place to-day.  Deputy Cowan alleged that Deputy Seán Collins said that the Old I.R.A. men are mendicants.  He did not say any such thing.  I heard what Deputy Collins said.  He said that the Government of the day were trying to make mendicants of the Old I.R.A.  That is altogether different from Deputy Cowan's version of what he said.</P>
    <P>We of the Old I.R.A. were held up to public contempt for a number of years because of the Pensions Bill.  I regret that a Pensions Bill was ever introduced.  We have had 30 years of the greatest amount of growling and fighting and of getting nowhere.  If a decent gratuity had been given to those who served in the Old I.R.A. or the Army&mdash;instead of introducing a Pensions Bill in 1924&mdash;I believe it would have solved our difficulties and ended our troubles.  That should have been given to men who fought on either side during the civil war, whether in the Army or in the Irregulars.  We see now the result of the introduction of that Bill in 1924. It has brought on this country 30 years of disunity.  I believe we would have had unity years ago were it not for that matter.</P>
    <P>In this Bill a fair measure of relief is given to the people with the bigger pensions.  Take my own case.  I am satisfied that the little relief I am getting is good.  What about the underdogs?  The Old I.R.A., like all underdogs, have not got the relief to which they are entitled.  Something will have to be done about the matter. Take a man with a pension of £6 a year.  There are thousands of them.  I know eight of them in my own company. Of what use is an extra £3 a year to them?  It is useless.  That is where I find that this Bill does not meet with our expectations.  I appeal to the Minister and to this House to make a better effort to relieve the lot of the underdog.  Those men who are drawing pensions under £1 a week have a genuine grievance and it should be remedied.</P>
    <P>When we were fighting for our <Col N="80" /> country we never thought of pensions. We never sought pensions.  They were forced on us because of the peculiar situation which existed in 1924.  At that time the civil war was over and the Army was being disbanded.  Some men were getting only a small pittance after having given service from 1916 to 1924.  They were quite right not to accept the pittance from the Government of the day.  As a result of all the commotion, the then Government had to do something and they brought in a Pensions Bill.  I am sorry that, instead, they did not give a decent gratuity.  When a new Government came into office in 1932 they took on where the previous Government had left off.  We have had Pensions Bill after Pensions Bill and pensions board after pensions board&mdash;and hundreds of cases have not yet been dealt with after 30 years.</P>
    <P>We of the Old I.R.A. who were the proud custodians of the nation's trust, handed a free nation to the younger generation and we now find that we are held up to contempt not only in this House but in the country.  There may be men in this House who say: &ldquo;I wish I never heard of an Old I.R.A. man.&rdquo;  I say to such men that we were the smallest band of men to free a country.  We did so with great sacrifice.  We saw our best comrades laid low before their time.  We saw the distress and the misery which many of those who survived had to endure. We saw their undertakings ruined and their careers destroyed.  Some embarked on the emigrant ship to Australia and elsewhere in order to eke out a living.  That is all that they got for striking a blow for the freedom of their country.  It was a sad and unfortunate state of affairs.  The grievances of the Old I.R.A. men still remain.  A man who has been drawing £6 or £8 a year will now receive only another £3 or so.  Do you think that that is just? Something will have to be done about it.  You will find that more Bills of this nature will be introduced either by the present Government or by the next Government.</P>
    <P>We do not want that.  We are asking the Minister to give us a Bill that will do justice to those men once and for all.  Something should be done <Col N="81" /> for those in the lower grades.  Justice has never been done to them.  They are in receipt of small pittances of from £6 to £20 a year.  I say they are entitled to £1 a week.  Give them that for the few years that remain to them.  Even those of them who joined the movement in their early years are now fairly well on, and if a man is entitled to a pension he should, at least, get £1 a week.  The small pittances they have do not represent the measure of justice to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>With regard to service medals, my opinion is that anyone who got one was entitled to a pension.  The reason why many did not get pensions was because they could not get the certificates required.  Some of the officers who could have given a certificate had died, while others refused to give the certificate which would entitle a man to a pension. Those men were given the medals but no pension.  I think that the medal should carry with it a gratuity.  The medal may be all right for a man who is 80 or 90 per cent. disabled because he has a special allowance.  I think that a man who gets a medal should be entitled to £100 in cash by way of a gratuity.  These are points I would ask the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>I would also ask that these military service pensions should be paid free of income-tax.  I know myself many men in Dublin who were out in 1916 who are in a bad way.  I have got appeals from them myself.  Something special should be done for them by way of a gratuity.  They would thus be saved having to go to the home assistance officer for help.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have this whole Bill reviewed so that it might go from this House as a measure that had the unanimous support of all Parties.  In that way justice could be done to the men concerned.</P>
    <P>As regards many of those who are in receipt of the top grade pensions, they do not mind whether they get any increase or not because they are now in big positions and are well off men.  They have done well for themselves. Some of them have more <Col N="82" /> money than they know what to do with.  They are not worrying whether their pensions are increased or not.  I am appealing on behalf of those who are in receipt of the lower grade pensions. Some of them are working on the roads and others are drawing home assistance.  They have never received justice, and are not getting it under this Bill.  Any man drawing a military service pension should not have less than £1 a week.  I believe that if the Old I.R.A. members of the House were brought together in a room in Leinster House they would be able to formulate a Bill that would give satisfaction to all their old comrades.  I suggest that the Minister should consider that.  I find, too, that many widows and orphans of some Old I.R.A. men are in a state of dire distress.  Some of those widows were left with seven or eight children.  I think special allowances should be paid in those cases.</P>
    <P>I must congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill.  I know that his hands were tied, due to financial considerations. In bringing it forward he had to fight his battle in the Cabinet, and he had some tough men to meet there.  We are not satisfied with the Bill, but we are satisfied that it represents a fair measure of justice.  It does not represent full justice.  I am principally concerned to see that something is done by way of amendment to step up the pensions of those in the lower grades.  It is a remarkable thing that, in all cases of this kind, it is the underdog who always gets knocked on the head first, last and all the time.  Those in the upper grades have no need to worry.  I know many of these Old I.R.A. men in the Midlands, and they are living in the most miserable circumstances. They are poorer to-day than when they left their homes as young men to fight for the freedom of the country.  I know, of course, that you will hear people ask: &ldquo;What have the Old I.R.A. to grumble about?&rdquo; They have this to grumble about, that justice was never done to them under the first, second, third or any other Governments that we have had.  Justice is not being done to them under this Bill either.  I want, however, to <Col N="83" /> give the Minister credit for bringing in the Bill and in making this effort in spite of the financial stringency of the times.  I suggest to him that he will have to go to the Minister for Finance again and tell him that we in the Dáil cannot accept his Bill, and that he will have to do something better.  I hope that on the Committee Stage we will be able to improve the Bill immensely, especially so far as the lower grade pensioners are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the financial provisions of this Bill, I feel there are Deputies on both sides of the House who are more competent to deal with them than I am.  Any criticism of them can, I think, best be handled by those who are in close touch with the people affected.  I am quite certain that the latter will be treated as generously as it is possible for the country to treat them.  In a general way, I would like to say that I feel that a minimum pension of anything less than £1 a week is of very little use at the present time, especially when we consider the value of money to-day.  I agree with Deputy Giles that, if any increases are to be given, they should go to those in the lower pension grades.  I imagine that they are the people who need the money most and would benefit most from any increase given.  As regards those on the upper scale of pensions, I gather from the general discussion that most of them are fairly well off in life, and that any increase would not mean much to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to deal with the machinery of the medical pensions board.  There is amongst a number of Old I.R.A. pensioners a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the operations of the board.  Generally speaking, one hears nothing but praise of the actual personnel, and that there is a tremendous amount of consideration given to the claims of men coming before the board.  They are treated well and courteously.  Every help and consideration is given to them.  But, somehow or another, limitations have appeared to spring up around the operations of the board.  It is with these limitations and disabilities that <Col N="84" /> I am particularly concerned.  One of the first points is in relation to St. Bricin's Hospital.  Apparently, when a man is brought back on an appeal for the first time, he quite commonly finds it necessary to be readmitted to St. Bricin's Hospital.  His difficulty is that he may be called to St. Bricin's and find that, due to the fact that the hospital is dealing with many outside interests other than his, he may be kept waiting as long as a fortnight before his case is dealt with. St. Bricin's deals with other cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I would not go against the ruling of the Chair but <Col N="85" /> my anxiety was to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there was grave dissatisfaction amongst many pensioners who have appealed under the enactments or who will appeal under this particular Bill for military service pensions and who find themselves subjected to inconvenience which it would be within the power of the Minister to eliminate.  However, I hope we will have a further opportunity of dealing with the many complaints which I, at any rate, have received under this particular heading.</P>
      <P>There is only one other point which arises.  In reply to a question which I put down recently concerning applications for reconsideration of military service pensions under the 1949 Act the question of acknowledgments arose.  I, and I think many other Deputies, were very surprised to hear that the Department had not continued the practice adopted by most other Departments of acknowledging applications received from pensioners.</P>
      <P>Most people appear to be satisfied that the Minister under this Bill has done all that he possibly could have done under the existing circumstances and I join with the other Deputies in congratulating the Minister on giving this obvious justice to those men who earned it so very dearly in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Deputies in congratulating the Minister on bringing in this Bill which, I think, has surprised most Deputies in so far as it proposes to give increases better than most Deputies anticipated. Those of us who know the Minister's desire and anxiety over a number of years to do something for that section of the community who rendered service to this country, the Old I.R.A., were not so surprised that he went so far, under present circumstances, to satisfy their demands.  As time goes on and as the legislators settle down to take a more generous view and more fully realise the importance of the work done by that Army, the Old I.R.A., we will from time to time get a more generous measure of unanimity and sympathy in improving the lot of these people.  As has been pointed out by the various Deputies who have spoken, <Col N="86" /> every year the number diminishes and anything that should be done would require to be done as soon as possible if these people are to receive the full measure of assistance which is justly due to them.</P>
      <P>I agree with those who believe that a more generous increase should be given in respect of the lower rates of pension.  I wonder if the Minister would yet see fit while the Bill is before the House to grant, say, 100 per cent. increase in the case of pensions up to £25 per annum?  Many pensions would fall under that heading. An increase of £3 6s. 8d. seems rather insignificant, while regarded as a percentage it is a fairly generous increase. When one remembers that in some cases the pensions are as low as £6 13s. 4d. per annum one realises how small a 50 per cent. increase will be.</P>
      <P>One of the things that I was particularly glad to see in the Bill was the extension of the time for submitting petitions and applications, particularly petitions.  The Minister in his opening remarks seemed to express surprise that there are people who have not submitted petitions or applications. One of the reasons why people have delayed or refused up to the present to submit petitions is the fact that when they originally applied and were turned down, they were so disgusted that they refused to apply even for a medal or to make any further approach to the Military Service Pensions Board in respect of their service in the Old I.R.A.  As time has gone on such people have come to realise that they should have submitted a petition and that as a result of the more generous outlook on the part of all sides of the House something worth while may be secured.  The Minister will find that there are quite a few people who did not submit petitions under the 1949 Act and that there are quite a few who will come along now with petitions.</P>
      <P>There was another reason for it which I will not mention because we desire to leave political matters aside as far as possible in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies welcome the proposed removal of the abatement clause that was in the original legislation. <Col N="87" /> While that does not affect members of the Old I.R.A. in Donegal as much as it would affect members in Dublin, where there are many such people in the public service, it affects us to some extent, and we welcome the proposed removal.  There are quite a few people in Donegal who are applicants for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit, and I want to impress upon the Minister the importance of considering the claims of such people whose small pensions are held against them in applying the means test in respect of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit. In connection with the removal of the abatement clause he might consider it wise on the Committee Stage to insert a section dealing with that type of case whereby the pensions of Old I.R.A. men would not be assessed in the means test when they apply for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  It would be of considerable help to many of these men throughout the country, particularly those who are in intermittent employment and have from time to time to seek assistance from the labour exchanges.</P>
    <P>There is another very important section of the Old I.R.A. whose claims or grievances have not been referred to so far by any Deputy, and with whom I have the greatest sympathy. I refer to those who applied for pensions and were border-line cases and who failed to secure any award or recognition for their services. It would look as if those cases are closed for ever and that these people, many of whom claim to have given as good service as some of those in receipt of pensions, have no redress whatever.  I would seriously urge the Minister to consider the cases of these men and at least allay their feeling of anxiety by making it known that their cases are not closed for ever.</P>
    <P>I have frequently attended funerals and listened to volleys fired over the graves of such men by their comrades, men who had neither medals nor pensions.  If these men had a record which justified their comrades turning out to accord them full military <Col N="88" /> honours, one would think they were entitled when alive to some recognition for the service they gave the country.  The Minister should allay the feelings of the men I refer to by announcing that, as soon as circumstances permit, they will get a chance again to submit their cases to some tribunal or board which will consider their cases with a view to granting them some recognition for their services.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to discuss the question of special allowances, but it was most encouraging that the Minister, in his opening statement, did point out that the special allowance will now be extended to persons other than those who received medals up to June, 1930, or whatever the date was.  By doing so, he will bring in many of the people about whom I am speaking.  Many of those people who failed to secure a military service pension have been awarded military service medals since the expiration of the period during which these military service medals carried a special allowance. By extending the time, I hope indefinitely, for the award of a special allowance to those awarded medals, provided that the holders of medals qualify in accordance with regulations laid down, the Minister will meet many of those cases I have referred to, but certainly not all of them.</P>
    <P>There is another way by which the Minister can satisfy the claims of these people, and that is by giving definite instructions to various departments, and particularly to county councils, that priority should be given in the matter of employment to members of the Old I.R.A.  I understand that some instructions to that effect were given to local authorities in the past.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall have an opportunity of discussing it I hope before the Minister's Estimate because the regulation to which he referred in his opening speech I hope will come before the House before then, and that will give us the necessary opportunity.  I should like to refer to the question of the smaller pensions to which other Deputies have already referred.  The Minister should consider amending this Bill on the Committee Stage to permit of an increase of 100 per cent. in respect of pensions up to £25 per annum.  That would not impose a very much greater strain on the financial resources of the country. If necessary, I am sure those who are in the higher categories would be prepared to sacrifice part of the increase proposed in order to help to bring the smaller pensions up to, say, £30 per annum.  The Minister has gone further than most Deputies believed he would go, but I believe that in this latest step in the code of legislation dealing with the Old I.R.A. we have not seen the last of such measures.</P>
      <P>I hope that this is but one step forward towards further advancement in the future and that the Minister, as time goes on, will see fit to look into every grievance of the Old I.R.A., with a view to bringing in legislation to remedy their grievances.  Judging by our experience here to-day, it is obvious that the Minister in doing so will have the support of every Party. It was encouraging to listen to the speeches made by both Deputy Norton and Deputy S. Collins, but I could not help regretting, when listening to these speeches, that when other measures of a similar nature were before the House away back in 1949 and 1950 these Deputies did not make then the speeches they made here to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure in so far as it is an improvement on <Col N="90" /> the existing military service pensions code.  In many respects it is a considerable improvement.  In particular, I welcome the decision of the Minister to wipe out through the medium of this measure that very objectionable section in the existing code dealing with abatement.  I was surprised to learn from the Minister to-day that that section applies to such a small number of persons.  I was under the impression that the number of persons affected by the abatement clause was far bigger than the number mentioned by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a considerable improvement in many respects.  To-day the Minister is in a much more fortunate position than he or any of his predecessors ever were in the past when the discussion took place here on a motion moved by Deputy Keane.  The Minister to-day received definite encouragement from all Parties to proceed along certain lines.  When he comes to reply I would like to hear from him his reason for not taking the unanimous advice of the House in regard to the provision of a reasonable minimum pension for the gradually disappearing number of people who are concerned in these pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that every Deputy received a copy of the circular issued on 31st January by the United Conference of the Old I.R.A. Association.  It seems to me, having listened to some of the speeches to-day, that all those who received the circular did not read it. Attempts were made to quote figures as to the number of persons in receipt of small allowances.  Now, I know one of the signatories to the circular personally and I know that he has had considerable experience in this matter. I know that these people would not be disposed to exaggerate or underestimate figures in relation to the number of persons in receipt of pensions of £6 13s. 4d. per year.  If the figures are wrong I have no doubt the Minister will correct them when he comes to reply because he has the correct figures at his disposal.  In one section of the circular issued by that association it is asserted that five-sixths of all the pensioners receive less than £25 per year.  Does anybody suggest that <Col N="91" /> £25 per year, with money at its present value, is a justifiable sum for the declining number of people who are entitled to receive or are in receipt of military service pensions?</P>
    <P>I do not know the exact number involved but it is a disgraceful state of affairs that these people should be in receipt of a niggardly sum of £6 13s. 4d. per year.  It has been suggested on both sides of the House that the minimum pension payable in certain circumstances should be not less than £1 per week.  I would like to hear the case against that.  I advised the Minister, and he was advised by Deputies sitting behind him, not to take the advice of the financial experts of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>I suggested that this was a question which should be taken up by the Taoiseach and his colleagues and on which a policy decision should be taken as to whether or not there was a good case for increasing the existing rates of pension.  Having reached a decision, the Government should then issue its instructions to the Department of Finance and the other Departments concerned to prepare amending legislation along certain lines.  I assume that has been done and that the limited amount of additional money now being made available is being made available as a result of the deliberate decision of the Government without interference from the hierarchy in the Department of Finance. I would like to think that is the position because that was undoubtedly the desire of every Deputy who encouraged the Minister here when the motion tabled by a private Deputy was under consideration on a former occasion.</P>
    <P>This Bill is justified on many grounds.  In particular, it is justified upon two grounds.  The claim for a minimum pension of £1 per week is justified on two grounds.  I am assuming that every member of this House is a decent, generous-minded Deputy in matters of this kind who would never attempt to justify, inside or outside the House, the payment of a pension of £6 13s. 4d. per year.  That pension might have been defended in 1934. <Col N="92" /> Compare the purchasing power of the £ to-day with its purchasing power in 1934 and one sees immediately that there is good cause, not alone for a 50 per cent. increase but for 100 per cent. increase on the miserable figure enshrined in the 1934 Act.  Not alone has money depreciated in value but the cost of living has risen.  The Minister must admit that.  There has been a 25 per cent. increase in the cost of living and the Minister could to-day make a good case for an increase in pensions on the increase in the cost of living apart from other considerations.</P>
    <P>I know the present Minister is a generous-minded man in matters of this kind.  I believe he would have gone much further had he been allowed to do so by his colleagues.  Deputy de Valera referred to financial stringency. Deputy Giles also referred to financial stringency.  All that is so much cod and boloney as far as I am concerned. If the Government and the majority of the members of this House can see their way to allow hundreds of thousands of pounds to be given to the shareholders of our Irish banks by increasing interest charges by 1 per cent. I think the people responsible for the foundation of our State&mdash;the Old I.R.A.&mdash;are entitled to even more than they are getting under this measure.</P>
    <P>Forget about financial stringency. The people who use that term do not understand its meaning.  The only people who understand it are those who have been thrown out of employment as a result of the operations of the policy of alleged financial stringency.  I think it is time we finished with that kind of talk.</P>
    <P>The Minister to-day referred to pending legislation dealing with special allowances and other matters.  I do not know why these matters are not included in this particular measure and I hope we shall not have to wait too long for the promised amending legislation.  I daresay that the Minister is aware&mdash;I was astounded to discover it&mdash;that, as a result of the coming into operation of the social security scheme and the consequential increased allowance provided under the national health insurance, the special allowances payable to men unfit to take up any kind of work have been considerably <Col N="93" /> reduced since the beginning of this year.  I do not go around looking for grievances.  I get enough of them without looking for them.  Last Sunday, in my constituency, a physically unfit man was presented to me whose special allowance was reduced from £58 to £45 10s. because he received a small additional increase in his national health payment.  I hope the Minister's promised further amending legislation will rectify that injustice, an injustice of which I have proof here.  I hope it will not alone rectify it but that these allowances will be increased instead of being reduced.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back&mdash;and I do not think any of us should, especially those of us who are a long time in this House&mdash;over the history of the Military Service Pensions Acts, dating from 1924.  Goodness knows, sufficient time has elapsed, almost 30 years, to have this question settled to the satisfaction of the small percentage of our citizens who made such sacrifices, sufficient at any rate to enable us to sit here in this House.  I never thought when I heard the Bill of 1924 brought in that I would be a member of this House in the year 1953 listening to and supporting further appeals for the men who should have been provided for properly in those days.  I agree&mdash;and my name is on the records of this House as having spoken at that time&mdash;that it was an unfair measure and it was amended several times afterwards. Over a long period of years in this House I have advocated the provision of pensions for men who could prove active service in the I.R.A. and that all men who held the same rank and gave the same kind of service should get the same pension for their pre-Truce service, nothing beyond that. Our respected President has asked for unity, and rightly so, on a recent occasion when he was unveiling a monument somewhere in Limerick.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to convince the person who got a pension of £6 13s. 4d. under the Act of 1932 that he was not unfairly treated compared to his colleague who was in the same section of the I.R.A., who had the same rank, who gave similar service and who has <Col N="94" /> a much higher pension under the Act of 1924.  I advocate, for the sake of unity, the levelling up of all kinds of pensions.  In that way we will give encouragement and satisfaction to many of the people who feel they have a grievance because of the differentiation as between the Acts of 1924 and 1932 and all the other amending Acts. You will give some inducement to those men who gave similar service in the same area and in the same circumstances to shake hands and forget the certain period that occurred in the history of this country following the acceptance and the adoption of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say that I know pretty well I am talking to the converted when I am talking to the Minister, and I am not going to take up any more time in connection with this matter.  However, I would like to give a friendly warning to my colleague, Deputy Cowan.  The only controversial note introduced in this discussion this evening, unnecessary in a discussion of this kind, was introduced by the lawyer Deputies who spoke.  I say to Deputy Cowan, my old friend and past colleague, and to those others who think with him now, think differently from what they did a couple of years ago, that whatever was done or left undone by the inter-Party Government&mdash;or as some of them prefer to call it, the Coalition&mdash;with their approval, they should be prepared to justify and not disown it. They voted for everything that was done during the period they supported the inter-Party Government.  I will give Deputy Cowan, who was a very active supporter of the inter-Party Government, and others credit for the fact that they tried to get other things done, but they have the same responsibility for the failure to get those things done as I have, and I have some responsibility.</P>
    <P>I give the Minister the credit which is due to him for what he has done on this occasion, for everything that is contained in this measure, and I hope the further legislation that he indicated in his opening speech will rectify some of the wrongs and injustices under which persons now in receipt of disability pensions and <Col N="95" /> special allowances have to suffer as a result of the coming into operation particularly of the social security measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems strange that in the year 1953 we here are debating pensions for veterans who enabled us to sit here.  It seems stranger still when we are told that some of those veterans who fought the might of an empire are being paid the magnificent pension of £6 10s. or £6 13s. per year.  These veterans are dying out fast.  Year by year they are dwindling away; week by week and month by month we hear of a funeral of some Old I.R.A. man.  The cost to the State is becoming less and I would appeal to the House, in the name of justice, in the name of freedom and in the name of the men who fought and died for Ireland, to give some reasonable pension to the survivors of that struggle.</P>
      <P>It is peculiar that Deputies on all sides of the House, and especially Deputies behind the Minister, have made appeals to the Minister to give a minimum pension of £1 per week to those I.R.A. veterans.  Knowing the Minister as we do, we know that his heart and soul are with that appeal. What is holding back the award? What is holding back the implementation of the request made by Deputies on all sides of the House to give those men the remuneration, or at least part of it, to which they are entitled?  I am afraid the previous speaker, Deputy Davin, has put his finger on it&mdash;the civil servant.  It is time that we let the civil servant know we are the bosses in this House.</P>

      <P>With the greatest respect I bow to the ruling of the Chair.  If the Minister is responsible he will have respect for the appeals of his own Party.  Every speaker belonging to the Party supporting the Minister has been in agreement that <Col N="96" /> those veterans are entitled to a reasonable pension.  We in this House are unanimous on that, and surely the Minister is not the only one out of step.  If he is and if he agrees and listens to our appeal then I would ask him to amend this Bill on the Committee Stage.  I have read the Military Service Pensions Acts of 1924, 1934 and 1949, and there is one thing that strikes me about them&mdash;they are far too political.  Too much attention is being paid to post-Truce and post-Treaty service and far too little attention is being paid to pre-Treaty and pre-Truce service.  Under the 1924 Act, if you served in the National Army&mdash;or the Free State Army, as it was then known&mdash;you got certain privileges. Under the 1934 Act, if you served in the Republican Army&mdash;or the anti-Treaty forces, as they were known&mdash; you got certain privileges.</P>

      <P>You were probably brought up to the level of the man who fought in the National Army.  But there is no mention, or very little mention, of the men who fought from 1917-1921, or those who fought in that period and then decided that the civil war was a political racket and that it was time that they got out.  Some of them, prior to the civil war and after the Treaty, went off to America.  Some of them went to the colonies of Britain. I heard very little said on their behalf, although they are some of the men who bore the brunt of the fight.  Far too much politics has entered into the Military Service Pensions Acts down through the years.  No later than the other day in the public Press we read a series of articles by a former I.R.A. leader.  They are uncontradicted statements, and as a result of what that gentleman said we learn now how leaders were selected in those days&mdash; in the beginning, particularly, they were not selected on merit but on what might be called the popular vote of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is most relevant, with the greatest respect, Sir. I say <Col N="97" /> that rank should not count in pre-Truce or pre-Treaty service, that all I.R.A. men who fought should be treated alike and should receive the same pension. I go further than that and say that it is the duty of the Minister for Defence to publish regularly a list of the names and addresses of pensioners and the amount of their pensions, to enable their former comrades to check on them and see if justice is being done.</P>
      <P>I wish to go further than some of those who have appealed for a minimum pension of £1 a week.  I say that any man entitled to a pension should get at least £100 a year.  We give the old age pensioner 21/6, but what about the old soldier who fought for the State, who made the State exist? £6 13s. 6d. per year&mdash;surely it is time that that was revised once and for all, to give them something reasonable to live on.  I understand that under former Acts if a person held an I.R.A. medal he became entitled in certain circumstances to a gratuity; and I understand that in recent times that gratuity has been wiped out.  I would appeal to the Minister that any holder of an Old I.R.A. medal should, if his financial position merits it, receive a gratuity at least to enable him to get medical attention or tide him over difficulties.  That is not asking too much.  I would also appeal to the Minister to ensure that every person with at least three months' pre-Truce service will be entitled to an I.R.A. medal and automatically an I.R.A. pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, people from Donegal and from Deputy Flynn's constituency, South Kerry, have to travel here to Dublin, and these veterans have to bring witnesses to come before the board investigating their claims.  Why are travelling vouchers not issued to them for that purpose?  If an I.R.A. veteran in receipt of a pension is compelled to go to a hospital, why is a travelling voucher not provided for him?  These are small matters, but they mean a lot to the man who is getting £6 13s. 6d. per year as a pension. They are things which deserve the Minister's consideration.  Knowing him as I do, I know that he has sympathy with these unfortunates. <Col N="98" /> Travel vouchers should be issued in these cases.  Finally, I would appeal to him seriously to treat all pre-Truce I.R.A. pensioners the same and give them all the same pension, and give no pensioner less than £100 a year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would appeal to the Taoiseach, to the Minister and to the leaders of the Front Bench on this side, and the leaders of the bench on the Labour side, not to break faith with their comrades in arms of the Black and Tan war.  They should think of them first, they should put them before Party politics, before the veterans of the civil war on both sides; and if that is done they will not be breaking faith with their own friends and comrades.</P>

      <P>I also welcome this Bill, but I cannot join in the congratulations to the extent that other members have joined.  I thank the Minister for taking one step forward, but there are many more steps to be taken if justice is to be done to the Old I.R.A. men.  Every Deputy, including those who gave praise to the Minister, has received a circular from the United Conference of Old I.R.A. Organisations, the Old I.R.A. Pensions Mansion House Committee.  It is signed by James Brennan and M. Cremin, the honorary secretaries of the two bodies.  They say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present Bill deals with military service pensions, and our committee were unanimous in expressing their grave dissatisfaction with it on two grounds.</P>
      <P>The increases proposed are in all cases inadequate, and this is particularly true of the smaller pensions. Five-sixths of all pensioners receive less than £25 a year.  Many of them have as little as £6 13s. 4d.  This last group is to be awarded an increase amounting to 1/4 per week, and the vast&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>that is not my word&mdash;&ldquo;vast&rdquo;&mdash;it is the organisation's&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;majority of the pensioners will be granted increases almost equally worthless.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These representatives of the men ask <Col N="99" /> us to support a list of amendments they are sending out.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept some of these suggestions and see that a reasonable increase in pension is given to these people who are in receipt of that miserable allowance of £6 13s. 4d. per year.  I know a man who served with the Minister, a man named Owen Meade&mdash;he gave me permission to mention his name on a previous occasion and I did so&mdash;who at one time had a pension of £90 per year for his services, and he must have given good service when he got that sum, but, as his children got small jobs, his pension was reduced until it was brought down to £9 or £10 per year.  I do not know what it is now, but everyone will agree that it is totally inadequate, and that it is very shabby treatment of a man who served in 1916 with the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I should state a definite case.  I ask the Minister if he will inquire with regard to a number of women who served in those days.  Some of these have very small pensions of £6, £8 and £10 per year and others in various places are in receipt of nothing, and I suggest that they are worthy of his consideration. One was a very prominent person in Dublin, and, while I am speaking of women of the Old Cumann na mBan and I.R.A., I might mention that to-day is the birthday of the late Countess Markievicz.  I was reminded of that by a friend of hers who saw the question I had tabled to-day with regard to the memorial to her.</P>
      <P>The recommendations put forward by these men are worthy of our consideration. I do not wish to read the whole document, but I think it unfair that their views are not read and recorded in our debates.  I have given a few extracts and in another portion of the document they say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Our committee are unanimous in agreeing that a pension awarded to <Col N="100" /> anyone with proved service in the war for the establishment of the Republic should not be less than £50 a year and they are confident that it is within the competence of the Government to devise a scheme of graded increases based on such a minimum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other paragraphs, they set out various suggestions and wind up by submitting a series of amendments designed to meet their objections.</P>
    <P>They are not satisfied with the Bill. The vast majority of them will get an increase of 1/4 per week and in the case of those who got £200 per year to buy their requirements, with the cost of living as it was at that period, that £200 is now reduced in value to £86 per year.  The goods which they could buy with that sum in 1940 are now worth only £86.  In view of the big increase in the cost of living and the reduction in the value of the money they got, I suggest that these provisions are worthy of reconsideration. A certain amount of thanks is due to the Minister for making the step forward, but many other steps are required before the people who served this country, and served it well, in days gone by will be satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy to speak in general terms on the question raised by this Bill.  It is no trouble to any Deputy to talk in a general way about justice for the I.R.A. and to urge that the claims of the I.R.A. should be met.  Many Deputies seem to have a confused idea as to the basis of entitlement to pension under the service pension code and the difference between service pensions and disability pensions which are generally known as Army pensions under the Army Pensions Acts, and in seeking to make a case for higher pensions under this measure, have cited cases which fall to be dealt with under the Army Pensions Act.  The case is being made here that we should have a basic figure and that no man who is entitled to a pension should get any lesser sum. I cannot find any cause for that plea. Men who served in the I.R.A., who gave a certain type and class of service which meant much to them, in that it <Col N="101" /> created difficulties for them in their careers, are entitled to a greater amount of compensation from the State than the person who barely qualified for a service certificate.  The minimum upon which a service certificate is granted is that a person had what was termed some time ago as one major engagement and general service.  That might not have involved his leaving his work or going away from home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>With general service added.  The basic Act under which this pensions code is operated was passed in 1924 and, fortunately or unfortunately, it provided for payment on the basis of rank.  The difficulty which faced the Administration which came to deal with pensions in 1934 was that fact.  They had necessarily either to abolish ranks and the system of grading on ranks under which these men enjoyed their pensions, or introduce a similar provision in the 1934 Act.  It is all very well to speak now of the abolition of ranks and the levelling up or down of the amount of pension a person should receive per year.  If you proceed to interfere on these lines, there will be many protests made that we are breaking faith with men already in receipt of these pensions.</P>
      <P>The basis of entitlement to a pension under the 1924 Act, as pointed out by Deputy O'Donnell, was service in the Defence Forces of the Provisional Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to Deputy O'Donnell that service with the I.R.A. during the civil war period was not, under any circumstances under <Col N="102" /> the 1934 Act or any other Military Service Pensions Act, a basis of entitlement to a service certificate and to a pension.  The Act of 1949 passed by the previous Administration set out to deal with cases that were rejected under the previous Acts.  During the passage of that Act through the House I pointed out that when a case was resubmitted to the Referee, and when he made his decision, the applicant had no further redress.  I am making the plea now that when a case is resubmitted for further examination to the Referee, and when he arrives at his decision, if that decision is rejection, or a decision against the applicant, the Minister should give the usual notice notifying the applicant of the rejection of his claim, and give him whatever further facilities are necessary to submit any further evidence that he may desire to submit, so that the Referee can give further consideration to the case.  I do not know what was the then intention or what the previous Minister had in his mind at the time the last Act was introduced, but I am making that plea now to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in paragraph (b) of Section 6 of this Bill in connection with the suspending provisions under which entitlement to a military service pension will not interfere to the detriment of the pensioner when he has some other specific claim against the State, but I notice that, in so far as the calculation of a man's means is concerned in regard to his claim for a special allowance, that provision does not operate.  I make the plea now to the Minister that he should deal with that matter.  The basis of entitlement to a medal is much less than that of entitlement to a pension. A person to obtain a medal has only to show to the satisfaction of the person dealing with the matter on behalf of the Minister that he had at least three months' continuous service before the Truce, but where a man obtains a military service certificate and a pension, he has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Referee or to the Board of Assessors that he had service of a certain character.  When such a person comes to be dealt with under the special allowances section of <Col N="103" /> the Army Pensions Act, I do not think that the service pension should be regarded as means in dealing with the case.  I think that where the service pension is less than a certain specific amount&mdash;I would not care to go up to the higher grades of pension, but we shall take pensions, say, up to £150&mdash; and where a man has £150 or less as his service pension, that should not be reckoned as means when dealing with the special allowances case.  In many cases men who served with the I.R.A. were not property owners and when they reach the age of 70, when they are in indifferent health and qualify before the Army Pensions Board, i.e., the Medical Board for special allowances, they would have nothing else to live on except the service pension and the special allowance.  In my opinion service pensions up to the figure which I have mentioned should not be taken into consideration when dealing with the claims of these people for special allowances.  I may be creating trouble for myself in making that plea because the Opposition, I know, are quite at liberty to put down an amendment dealing with it.</P>

      <P>The Government or the Minister might oppose it.  I do not know.  I have not discussed the matter with anybody but I am putting it forward as a plea on my own behalf.  I do not think that there is anything further I can usefully add to this debate.  I am confining my remarks solely to the Bill before the House.  I am not dealing with the provisions of the Army Pensions Act or the Disability Pensions Acts.  We shall have the new Bill which has been announced by the Minister dealing with disability pensions later, and the questions that have been raised in connection with special allowances and disability pensions can be dealt with when that Bill comes before the House.  I feel that this measure is a step in the right direction, that it is right and proper to increase the amount of pensions payable at the moment.  I feel that the section dealing with the amendment of <Col N="104" /> Section 20 of the Act of 1934 and Section 8 of the Act of 1924 which abated the pensions of some Old I.R.A. men is long overdue.  I do not know whether the Minister should not go further with the amendment of Section 20 of the Act of 1934.  I refer to sub-sections (2) and (3) which are applicable to a small number of men who were employed in the Civil Service and other employments, and were still serving with the I.R.A.  Even though they might be employed full-time in their offices during the day, they would be operating full-time during the night or for half the night with the I.R.A. So far as their option is concerned to claim their pension rights either from the Civil Service or from the I.R.A., I could not make up my mind on that matter, but I think a matter that should be considered is whether it is proper to deny a man the right to claim a pension under the two codes, to one of which he might be entitled as a servant of the State in the public service, and to the other of which he might be entitled for the time he devoted to active service in the I.R.A.</P>

      <P>I regret that the Minister is still persisting in dealing with this whole problem piecemeal.  It is a pity that when a Bill like this is introduced, the Bill which should accompany it and which we are promised, is not brought in with it, so that we could have an opportunity of discussing both Bills together and see, as it were, where we were going.  It is quite clear that some Deputies are not fully <i>au fait</i> with all the aspects of the military service and disability pensions codes.  Some of them become considerably confused.  I am surprised at a Deputy like Deputy Hilliard who, I suppose, has more experience relating to the pensions code than anybody else in this House, he having been a member for a very considerable period of the Disability Pensions Board, in which he played a very honourable and noble part.  Let me say that while he was a member of that board he acted in a judicious manner and gave everybody fair play to the best of his ability within the code.  When, however, he asserts on this Bill that a person with one major engagement and <Col N="105" /> general service, qualifies for a pension, he is not correct.  The truth is that the Referee decides that in one brigade area a stump of an engagement of any sort in general service will qualify.  I take it that Deputy Hilliard was talking about Meath.  In Meath and Leitrim one engagement will immediately render an applicant eligible for a military service pension.  In Longford it takes two or three, on the grounds that there were so many engagements you should have been engaged in them all if you were active. That may be fair, but it is not the general rule.  That is why I asked the Minister if he subscribed to the view put forward by Deputy Hilliard.  Whatever it is I am not cavilling at that particular thing except to say that it does create difficulties for everybody. I know that the Leitrim Brigade applicants, with much less service than the Longford Brigade applicants, can qualify where the Longford people do not, since Longford was regarded as active.  The same applies to Cork, Clare and Limerick.  The people in those areas have to have more engagements than one.  That is a certainty, and the engagements must be major ones.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may I think that this Bill does not meet the requirements of anybody.  It is true that it will be of considerable value and of great help to a number of people and for that reason I welcome it.  To a person like the Minister, Deputy Hilliard, perhaps, or myself, £60 a year is a considerable lift.  It is a fairly big sum of money to get.  I cannot see how we are going to defend giving the Minister, Seán MacEoin or anybody else who has a military service pension £60 per year and giving to Johnnie So-and-So, who has one major engagement, as we are told, for general service £6 10s. per year to make his military service pension amount to the princely sum of £9 5s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I think that the Minister should have approached the problem as I would have approached it and established a minimum.  There should be a minimum rate.  I said until I was black in the face at various times that the minimum pension of the Black and <Col N="106" /> Tan who joined the R.I.C. on the 1st day of July, 1921 and who served in the Depot for 11 days to the Truce and was demobbed in November, 1921 was £52 per annum.  He never fired a shot and never risked anything.  At least the most insignificant member of the Forces should get the same recognition as he got.  It was argued, of course, that Britain was a wealthy country and could pay but the truth of the matter is that nobody at any time in this House ever regarded the I.R.A. as being worthy of any recognition at all.  Anything that was ever got for the I.R.A. was generally got through pressure.  It was never given following on demands. I am not going to develop that point. I said that when the Minister was doing this it would no doubt increase the cost considerably but, as I said before, it is a diminishing cost.  In ten years' time the roll call will be very low but it will be very high above as most of us will have passed on at that stage.  Therefore, for the ten years that are left even at this late stage and since everybody in this House is willing to do the right thing, the Minister should not be dominated by the Department of Finance in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that the cost of this Bill is £400,000.  What of it?  The dance-halls got that much of a remission of tax in the last Budget and there was nobody to kick about it, not even the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Nobody can oppose this Bill.  All we can do is to criticise it for what it lacks.  I would ask the Minister to bring in the disability pensions code before the Committee Stage and let us see it.  I appeal to him again at this late stage to remember the widows of the Old I.R.A.  It is all very fine to say that we have the social welfare widows' pensions and everything else. I admit that, but to receive something because of service rendered by their husbands would be regarded as an honour by the widows.  They should not be left as they have been in a number of cases.  Unfortunately our members and comrades were not all wise men.  They did not save much and did not make much provision for their widows and it often happens that when one of them dies a collection has to be made.  I shall content myself with <Col N="107" /> thanking the Minister for small mercies.  I am glad that the abatement section which should never have been in the Bill was taken out.  As I said before when that was going through this House there were very great difficulties and it was argued that persons in receipt of money from the State should not receive it from two sources at the same time.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to refer.  It was mentioned by Deputy Hilliard and I think it should be corrected.  He said that under the 1924 Act regard was had mostly to National Army service.  That is not true.  There is no difference in the provision in the two Acts in that respect.  Under both Acts you must have pre-Truce service.  If you had not established pre-Truce service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that if you had National Army service the other did not matter very much.  That is not true.  That is not correct.  Under the administration of the 1924 Act and under the 1934 Act for a time the same definition of active service obtained&mdash; the amount of time that you gave or the amount of time that was lost, as it were.  Under the 1934 Act the Referee&mdash;the late Judge O'Donnell, God rest him&mdash;interpreted a person on active service at one stage as a person who rendered dangerous or essential service, although that might not necessarily mean firing a shot.  That lasted for a considerable time and then, suddenly, it was cut off.  I only want <Col N="108" /> to establish that, in the 1924 Act, you had to have practically the same service as you had to have under the 1934 Act in order to qualify, that is, you had to have pre-Truce service.  It is true that, to qualify, you had then to have the addition of National Army service, and when the 1934 Bill was introduced that same provision was there.  That Bill was not amended in this House to that extent, but when it went to the Seanad the Minister introduced a provision that people with pre-Truce service only or members of Cumann na mBan should be included.  I am not making a debating point of it.  I want to clarify the position.</P>

      <P>That is all right. We can argue it out afterwards.  I think it would be better to do so outside rather than across the floor of the House.  I should prefer to treat the matter objectively here.  I welcome the Bill as far as it goes, but in my opinion it is not sufficient.  The Minister should not have allowed himself to be put off.  I admit that taxation is high.  I admit that the cost is great and that it is very difficult to advocate increased expenditure on anything.  When, however, the dance-hall proprietors could get £400,000 for nothing there is no reason in the world why that amount could not be got and doubled so that something decent could be done for the Old I.R.A. men who were comrades of the Minister as well as of some of the rest of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on this measure. The first point which I should like to make concerns the lower pension grade.  If at all possible, I think there should be some increase for men already in receipt of pensions of, say, £30 or £20 a year and under.  A 50 per cent. increase will not mean very much to men in that pension category.  I am hoping that this Bill is only the forerunner of legislation which will provide further increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> In his statement the Minister mentioned the introduction of legislation in regard to disability pensions and other matters.  Like Deputy Hilliard, I should like to make the plea in regard to service pensions that the Minister would introduce a section enabling the applicant to make a final appeal, within 21 days, to the Minister as well as to the Referee.</P>
    <P>The 1924 Act has been criticised, but it contains one good provision, and that is that the Referee could not decide a case on his own.  Unless he got at least one member of the board to agree with him, he could not reject a claim.  There is no such safeguard for the applicant in all the other Acts. On occasion, I have made representations to the Minister on behalf of people who were dissatisfied with decisions. I hope the Minister will do something about this matter.  I blame the late Minister for Defence for not embodying such a provision in the 1949 Act.  I was a member of the delegation which met the late Minister, and he assured us that such a provision would be incorporated in the Act so that the necessary safeguard would be there for the applicant&mdash;a safeguard similar to the one I mentioned in the 1924 Act.  Unfortunately, the late Minister did not embody that provision in the Act for, if he had, I should not have occasion to stand up here, in company with other Deputies, and make the case that under the present Act and under the present Pensions Board our men have no redress.  The decision of the Referee is final, and the Minister cannot intervene.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to be disrespectful to any person and, in particular, the Referee, I may say that I gave evidence before that court in Killarney and that the Referee interrogated and adjudicated at the same time.  He was the prosecutor and judge in the one instance and there was no fair play there.  It would not happen in any other country in the world that a judge would interrupt a witness and his counsel and take the case completely out of his hands and decide against him.  I witnessed such an event.  That is why I am asking the Minister, in a last-minute effort, to insert that necessary <Col N="110" /> safeguard for the applicant in the legislation which he has said he proposes to introduce.  As I have pointed out, that safeguard was contained in the 1924 Act, and if the Minister will incorporate it in legislation in the near future justice will be served and the applicant will have no complaint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  There is another point which I should like the Minister to consider when he is introducing legislation, and it is that the statements of Old I.R.A. officers who give evidence in these cases will be accepted and regarded as first-class evidence, and that no matter what has gone before in court or in any other place, or on the files, the Minister will give credit and first consideration to the testimony of these officers&mdash; brigade, battalion and so forth.</P>
      <P>With other Deputies, I have been approached by the organisation representing these men.  They have asked us to make representations to the Minister to the effect that, if at all possible in the near future, when legislation is being discussed or introduced, the Minister will have regared to that important point and accept that important principle.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the men and the people in Kerry whom I represent, I wish to thank the Minister sincerely for his courage in introducing this legislation which has long been overdue.  I would point out that some people who may criticise the measure and say that sufficient is not being done forgot all about this matter when they themselves were in office.  I would reply to Deputy MacEoin, who tried to put one over on Deputy Hilliard in regard to the 1924 Act, by saying that that was clearly an Act for National Army men. As far as I am aware, no man in Kerry got a pension under that Act unless he was in the Army.</P>

In conclusion, I hope, for the sake of unity and of all the men concerned, irrespective of what politics they have at the moment, that we will all try and see that they will get justice under the present administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister and congratulate him on making a good effort under this Bill to do something for the Old I.R.A.  The Minister has succeeded, during his time as Minister for Defence, in doing a good deal for the Old I.R.A.  I must thank him publicly in this House for the sympathetic hearing which he gave to numerous deputations of Old I.R.A. men that I brought to see him, off and on, over a long number of years, and for all he did to try and improve their lot.  Times are changing and we have to change with them.  What I mean is, that the men concerned are getting older.  As each year goes by, there will be fewer Old I.R.A. men.  Every year will bring its toll.  More of the Old I.R.A. men will be going to their eternal reward.</P>
      <P>In speaking here, I should not like to think that the old soldiers of Ireland would be made the subject of political debate.  I feel that I am speaking to the most sympathetic Minister for Defence that the Old I.R.A. have ever had, and that if it were within his power he would like to settle this question once and for all.  Unfortunately, the position we find in this House is that finance seems to interfere with a lot of decisions on many matters in this regard.  I am sure that the Minister himself would like to see that every Old I.R.A. man who struck a blow for Ireland would, at least, be sufficiently compensated by this State, and that this question we are discussing was settled once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been associated with a number of Old I.R.A. organisations, and I am certainly in favour of the <Col N="112" /> trend of thought which has found expressions here that there should be a minimum pension for all those men if that were possible.  I am not going to press the Minister too hard on that, because I feel that he has made an effort to do something right in this Bill.  I should like, however, to see that position brought about, if it were possible&mdash;that there would be a minimum pension.  I, with a number of other Deputies on all sides of the House, feel that a 50 per cent. increase on a small pension is very little.  In weighing up this matter, we have, of course, to take into consideration the number of border-line cases there are of Old I.R.A. men who have been turned down by the Pensions Board. We have listened to their grievances from time to time, and we are up against the position here that we have to ask ourselves what is best to be done in those cases.</P>
    <P>If it were possible to meet the expenditure involved, I would like to see the minimum substantially raised, notwithstanding the fact that the present Minister introduced the Military Service Pensions Act of 1945 under which he brought in the special allowance. That proved to be a godsend to a great number of Old I.R.A. men.  I know that any man who is in bad circumstances can, at least, take advantage of that special allowance.  Nevertheless, I would like if the Minister could, on the Committee Stage, see his way to increase the minimum allowance substantially above what it is at present.  I welcome the abatement clause because that was long overdue. In the case of men outside in commercial life with big salaries, or members of the Civil Service or of local authorities, or T.D.s, the pension was substantially reduced.  That was only fair.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned with the position of the widows and orphans of Old I.R.A. men.  It has been raised by other Deputies, and I should like the Minister to go into it.  There is another point I want to raise.  It has been put to me at a conference that I had with a committee representing men employed by a local authority or in the Civil Service.  This committee says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="113" />&ldquo;Our committee welcome the abolition of those unjust sections of previous Acts which penalised Old I.R.A. who are civil servants or local government employees by providing that their military service pensions should be subject to deduction or even total suspension.  But they note that sections are deliberately retained in this Bill which will compel civil servants or local government employees, on retirement, to surrender for the computation of their superannuation allowance, the years for which they were granted a military service pension.  This appears quite indefensible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are other points that I would like the Minister to consider.  In these cases, while a man is in the Service he can draw the pension fully, now that the abatement clause is gone, but when he retires his position will be different. In view of the fact that, after a few more years there will be very few Old I.R.A. men left, I think we should try, during our time at least, to see, if it is possible at all, that they will be dealt with honourably and justly.  I have no doubt that the present Minister for Defence will do that.  Again, I wish to thank him very sincerely for the great contribution that he is making in this Bill.  I know it is hard for him to do everything that he would desire to do, but at least he has made an honest to God contribution towards the solution of this problem.  We have felt for a very long time that something should be done about it&mdash;that is, an increase in Old I.R.A. pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill introduced by the Minister is generally welcomed by Old I.R.A. men all over the country irrespective of whether they are in receipt of the smaller allowance or the higher allowance that Deputy MacEoin mentioned.  Deputy MacEoin might also have adverted to the fact that it was the original Act giving pensions to Old I.R.A. men, the 1924 Act, that set the difference between ranks, officers and men.  It was unfortunate, and I always thought so afterwards, that there was any standard set as between one man and another in the Old I.R.A. The same basis had necessarily to be <Col N="114" /> followed in the 1934 Act.  It may be said that two wrongs do not make a right but there was scarcely any option but to follow the same lines in the 1934 Act.  The view has often been expressed since, that had there been a flat rate basis all the problems that arose in the interval would not have arisen.  I do not know if it is too late to go back now but if Deputy MacEoin would lead a campaign in that direction he would get fair support.  There would be a levelling down in addition to a bit of levelling up and you would reach a flat rate basis then with the moneys that the Minister is prepared to provide under this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be one of those who would support anybody in asking the Minister to accept such a proposal. It is generally accepted by the House and all sides of it.  I suggest that Deputy MacEoin is the one to lead off on that, not for any personal reasons but, if he gave a lead in that matter, representing the other side of the House, it would be welcomed, I am sure, by all the Old I.R.A. men.</P>
      <P>The proposals in this Bill will step up considerably the rate of pensions in the case of higher pensions.  The increase will be only a bagatelle in the case of lower pensions.  It is a wonder that some estimate has not been made before now as to the cost of commuting small pensions, the big majority of which are under £25 a year, giving the person in receipt of, say, £20 or £25 a year, 20 years' pension, or some such number of years' pension.  It would be of some advantage to them in their lifetime.  It would mean that they would have a lump sum which they could invest in something worth while that would give a better return than the small pension per annum would give.  I make that suggestion.  At some time in the future the Minister should consider that.  I believe it would be found in the long run to give better results to those Old I.R.A. men about whom we are all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The removal of the abatement clause in respect of persons in receipt of <Col N="115" /> moneys from the public services is welcome and is long overdue.  An effort was made in the early 1940's and the amount abated was reduced. The clause is now done away with, not before its time.  It should never have been in operation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the operation of the Military Service Pensions Act, several efforts have been made&mdash;the latest was the 1949 Act&mdash;to try to provide a solution to the problem of the many thousands who were left out and who could not or did not qualify under the 1934 Act or the 1924 Act.  The 1949 Act gave satisfaction up to a point but, as time goes on, we find that of those who go before the board the majority are not satisfied to-day any more than they were ten or 15 years ago that they are getting fair play.  I am not saying that they are not getting fair play.  Those applicants who were unfortunate up to now and who are appearing at the present time or who have appeared quite recently before that board are generally dissatisfied.</P>
    <P>Evidence has been given by responsible officers that it was believed and that there was evidence that showed that those applicants for service certificates measured up to the standard that should qualify them for a service certificate.  There is general dissatisfaction. I would support the suggestion of Deputy Flynn that even at this stage the Minister should amend the Act, if it is necessary to amend it&mdash; probably it could be done by regulation &mdash;by providing that at least one member of the board, if not two, should support the Referee in his decision. We hear of arbitrary decisions and of the Referee refusing to hear some of the evidence tendered.  If that is so, there is bound to be more and more dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that there is still a hard core of 15,000 to 17,000 men who appealed under the 1949 Act for rehearing and that the majority of those are being turned down, that the percentage getting through is very small at the present day.</P>
    <P>Up to 50 per cent. of the Old I.R.A. <Col N="116" /> men of 1920 and 1921 have gone to a better world.  Fifty per cent. of those who gave service in that period have gone off the pension list if they were ever on it and want a pension no more. There are about 15,000 to 17,000 left. The Minister has a big responsibility towards that 15,000 to 17,000.  If they can prove, through any number of responsible officers, whether one, two or three of a brigade or battalion, that they gave service measuring up to a certain standard, active service of whatever type it may have been, that they were essential units and gave service as active units of their brigade or battalion or whatever it may have been, in the year 1920 or 1921, they should get a service certificate.  It has often occurred to me that if provision were made either in the regulations or in the Act or by amendment to the Act that where a number of responsible officers were prepared to prove that any individual in the company or battalion had given certain service, that individual should, without question, get a service certificate.</P>
    <P>There should be a flat rate gratuity to cover the whole of those who are left who can prove service.  That, in my opinion, is the only solution to this problem.  Otherwise, it will be coming up here year after year and there will be dissatisfaction on the part of quite a large number of men who honestly believe that they are entitled to a military service certificate.  Any Minister who will come in here and provide a ready-made solution of that will have the blessing of a great number of people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will advert to the fact at this stage that satisfaction has not been received by that considerable group of Old I.R.A. men who are still to be dealt with and that, if necessary, the rules under which the Referee and the board act will be changed.  We have always been led to believe that the interpretation of these rules governed the whole determination of whether a man qualified or not in many cases.  As time goes on and as the cases become more difficult to decide, I do not think the rules should be as rigid as might have been necessary earlier on.  I think the Minister should bring in some amendments to <Col N="117" /> this Bill in Committee.  Under the 1934 Act, I think, the Referee was given powers which he had not under the 1924 Act.  Under the 1924 Act a member of the board, in addition to the Referee, I believe, had a right to decide whether a man should be rejected or get a certificate.  I think that such a system is essential at this stage.  From what I can hear from those who have gone before the pensions board in the last couple of years something like that is necessary. Otherwise you will have contention and dissatisfaction right through the country amongst small units of the best citizens this nation has known in this generation.  The Minister should provide some means to enable the 15,000 remaining cases to be dealt with and justice given to these men which they feel, rightly or wrongly, is being withheld from them under the present code.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill, which is long overdue. Even though it does not go as far as we would wish, especially in regard to people in receipt of small pensions, it is certainly a big improvement on the previous Military Service Acts.  I think the waiving of the abatement of pensions was very badly needed.  That matter was a source of great grievance since the first Pensions Act was brought in.  It was very unjust that, because a person was working for a local authority or a Government Department, portion of his pension should be abated while people earning far bigger salaries from private employers and in professional positions suffered no abatement at all.  That is one long-standing grievance which has been wiped out by this Bill.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies, I think that there should have been some fixed minimum pension, but I suppose the usual financial aspect overruled everything else.  When this Government tried to get finance for very deserving objects we have seen the criticism they suffered from the people on the opposite side of the House.  I hope that they realise that they are in part responsible for the small I.R.A. pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> I would ask the Minister to do something about speeding up the decisions in cases.  It is over 30 years since the service was rendered for which people are now looking for pensions, and although a new Act was introduced in 1949, a great many of the cases have not yet been dealt with.  Deputies have commented on the fact that each year the number of Old I.R.A. men is getting fewer and fewer, and therefore it is all the more necessary that decisions should be speeded up.  We have heard complaints about the board.  I personally believe that if the time is to be extended again for the reception of applications we should definitely have more than one board to deal with them.  The period of life for many Old I.R.A. men cannot be very long.  I heard someone saying that pensions should be commuted by giving a sum amounting to 20 years' pension.</P>

      <P>I think so.  I think it would be good value anyway.  I would impress on the Minister that whatever cases are outstanding should be dealt with within 12 months at the latest. This is the year 1953 and the last Act was brought in in 1949 and there are a great many cases still waiting.  I was also glad to hear from the Minister that he is bringing in a Bill to deal with people in receipt of special allowances. I am sorry he did not bring in that Bill first because these are the people most in need of it, and indeed very badly in need of it.  When the 1946 Bill was introduced it made more people happy than most Deputies realise.  When the last Social Welfare Bill was introduced and people were allowed to draw their full old age pensions and the special allowances were not taken into account as means I know that in the City of Cork anyway it was a very substantial benefit to those people who were in receipt of old age pensions and blind pensions.  Those who have not reached the age of 70 find it difficult to live on the present special allowance and I hope the Minister will not delay very long in bringing in that Bill.  When he brings in <Col N="119" /> that Bill, I hope he will do away with the 12-months' period before a decision can be reversed.  When a decision is given by those dealing with the special allowances there is no appeal for 12 months even though the decision was entirely wrong.  I hope that that period will be made as short as possible.  I appeal to the Minister to set up a couple of extra boards if necessary to deal with these cases and get rid of them once and for all.</P>

      <P>I agree with the last speaker and with Deputy MacEoin that it would have been far better and it would have been easier for us to discuss in this House the position of the Old I.R.A. men if the Minister had introduced an amending Bill with regard to disability pensions and special allowances, because in dealing with our constituents we find that a big number of people who are in receipt of military service pensions are also in receipt of special allowances or disability pensions in some form or another.  But, inasmuch as the Bill deals only with military service pensions, our remarks must be confined to that aspect of the matter rather than the other two aspects which I mentioned.</P>
      <P>Whilst many speakers have described the Old I.R.A. and its activities from about 1914 to 1921, the type of people who composed that organisation and the activities in which they engaged, and have criticised in different terms the treatment that has been meted out to them, I think it would be well at this point to remind ourselves of what the martyred leaders in 1916 thought about these men and of what they said about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We still have here with us a number of cynics who are both sarcastic and ironical in their remarks about the Old I.R.A. and the &ldquo;Young I.R.A.&rdquo; and who are very sarcastic and cynical about the treatment meted out to them by the last Government, by the Cumann Fáil Government and by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Listening to some of these cynics, one would think that practically every man in receipt of a military service or an Old <Col N="120" /> I.R.A. pension is in receipt of a big fat pension.  It may come as a shock&mdash;I think a necessary shock&mdash;to these people to learn that five-sixths of the people in receipt of these pensions receive only £25 per year or under. That should give the lie to those people who are wont to say: &ldquo;If they did anything for their country they are being paid well for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our criticism here is that they have not been adequately compensated.  It is our function here to impress upon the Minister and get him to impress upon his colleagues that in relation to the men who made sacrifices in the period from 1916 to 1921 there should be an extra effort now in 1953 to try to satisfy once and for all most of the grievances that have been ventilated by the different associations speaking on behalf of the Old I.R.A. and on behalf of those who gave service from 1916 right up to 1921.  I do not think any of us could quibble with or take exception to the manner in which these different associations have presented their case time after time to this Government, to the last Government, to the Fianna Fáil Government and to the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. They have been most moderate in their language.  In none of their submissions has there been any attempt at threats.  Their demands are reasoned and reasonable.</P>
    <P>I propose to quote now a statement made by the Commander-in-Chief in 1916 when referring to his colleagues in that glorious struggle.  When he signed the unconditional surrender in Easter Week he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I desire now, lest I may not have an opportunity later&rdquo;</P>
    <P>unfortunately he did not have an opportunity later&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to pay homage to the gallantry of the soldiers of Irish Freedom who have during the past four days been writing with fire and steel the most glorious chapter in the later history of Ireland.  Justice can never be done to their heroism, to their gay and unconquered spirit in the midst of peril and death.</P>
    <P>Let me who have led them into this, speak in my own and in my fellow-commanders' names, and in <Col N="121" /> the name of Ireland present and to come, their praise, and ask those who come after them to remember them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not throw that in the face of Deputy Traynor, Minister for Defence. Neither do I throw it in the faces of Deputy MacEoin or Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, two former Ministers for Defence.  I do not throw it in the face of any man who occupied that position. I throw that statement of Padraic Pearse in the face of every single member of this House.  I throw it in the face of every single member of this State.  I submit that we have not done justice to the Old I.R.A.  It is almost incredible to conceive that there are men who took that most unpopular stand in 1916 especially, men from the City of Dublin, from my own County of Wexford, from Cork and Galway, some of whom made the supreme sacrifice and all of whom risked death.  Yet, the meagre pension this country can afford to offer to those who survived is the niggardly sum of £25 per year.  That should sink in to the minds of the cynics amongst us to-day.  It should sink into the mind and heart of every person who quibbles at the provision of money in order that a little more adequate compensation may be given, especially to those who find themselves in straitened circumstances to-day, for the heroic sacrifices they made at that particular time.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin told us this evening that the scorned Black and Tan who served from July to November in one particular year has a minimum pension from his Government of £52 per year for coming over here to butcher, to bully and generally commit acts of atrocity.  I think it is high time we corrected the present situation. I think it is high time we made yet one more attempt to try to satisfy the demands of those people who served their country in those particular years.  It amazes us to discover that more than five-sixths of the pensions awarded are less than £25 per annum.  There are quite a number as low as £6 13s. 4d. per annum. Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Hilliard made very sensible and enlightening speeches.  Deputy Hilliard told us this evening that as far as County Meath <Col N="122" /> is concerned an applicant for a pension must fulfil a minimum requirement of one major engagement and general service in the I.R.A.  As far as Longford and Leitrim are concerned, the minimum requirement, according to Deputy MacEoin, is two or three major engagements and a certain length of service in the I.R.A.  A major engagement means to all of us an engagement in which a man definitely risks his life.  The compensation that this country offers to such a person is, in some instances, £6 13s. 4d. per year.  Yet we have people who would lead one to believe that those who served in the I.R.A. are to-day in receipt of big, fat pensions.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the Disability Pensions Bill and the Special Allowances Bill have not been amended simultaneously with the Military Service Pensions Act.  There are many people who are in receipt of military service pensions who also come under the provisions of the Special Allowances Act.</P>
    <P>In recent times some of those people have been treated very shabbily.  I give one instance of a man in my constituency who is in receipt of a military service pension, who also had a special allowance&mdash;I think it was about £40 or £50 per year.  He also drew national health insurance by reason of the fact that he was absolutely incapable of work.  This man's wife was very ill and she was ordered by the doctor to take pills or tablets which would cost around 15/- per week. She decided she could not get them. He had a son in the British Army who was making her an allowance of 5/- a week.  That, incidentally, was noted down in the assessment by the Department of Defence.  The son volunteered to pay her 10/- extra a week to enable her to get the tablets for 15/-.  Because he did that the Minister of whoever is responsible in the Department of Defence took into consideration that extra 10/- that was given by her son in England and as a consequence of that the special allowance was cut down drastically.</P>
    <P>I would like also to point out to the Minister&mdash;I did it some weeks before Christmas as well&mdash;that the Department of Defence has saved thousands <Col N="123" /> of pounds on the operation of the recent Social Welfare Act, and it must be known to every single Deputy in this House that these pensioners who are also in receipt of special allowances found that when their national health insurance was raised from 22/6 a week to £2 10s. a week their special allowance was cut drastically.  I can quote a case of a man whose national health insurance was increased to £2 10s. and who had a special allowance decreased to the extent of £49.</P>

Just to give an example of the opinions or the ideas that run through the minds of these Old I.R.A. men I refer to a letter which was written to me by a man from County Carlow.

      <P>Two of them were to patrol the roads armed with rifles.  These two men had an engagement, maybe they had not; at least they were required to shoot or were fired upon, but the eight men who left themselves open to the risk unarmed were regarded as being ineligible for a pension at all.  Active service is something on which the Minister has been asked to give an opinion or to define.  His predecessor was asked to do it.  The Minister for Defence before him was asked to do it, but there has not yet been from a Minister for Defence, in my time at least, any opinion, good, bad or indifferent, as to what active service should be.  It always seems to be a question of &ldquo;passing the buck&rdquo; by the various Ministers to the Referee or to the Military Service Pensions Board for them to determine what active service would mean in certain circumstances.</P>
      <P>The Minister is doing good on this occasion.  The Minister before him did good.  When the present Minister, Deputy Traynor, was Minister from 1932 to 1948 he made improvements. Every Minister of State in every Department since 1922 has made some improvements.  We are never satisfied. That is our job as Deputies, never to be satisfied and to ask for more and more improvements all the time. Whilst, as I say, the Minister has gone a certain distance in this particular Bill, I think that here, in the year 1953, when we can raise money for so many different things, when we can, as Deputy MacEoin says, remit taxes to the extent of £400,000 in respect of dance halls, surely we can do something similar or devote that money to Old I.R.A. men.  Surely if we could in the last Budget impose a tax and give to the cigarette or tobacco manufacturers of this country over £1,000,000, we could afford to give some of it or all of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Every person in the country is fed up listening to people on that side saying: &ldquo;We know what you did in three and a half years&rdquo;, or people on this side saying: &ldquo;We know what you did in 16 years.&rdquo; This is 1953 and we are entitled to ask the Minister and the present Government to do certain things and there is nothing to be gained either from the point of view of Fianna Fáil or any Party in the Opposition in talking about 1948, the economic war, the Treaty or going back to 1798.  There <Col N="126" /> is no point in talking about that.  The duty and obligation on this House, and especially on the Government, is to try to correct and improve the situation that we find in the year 1953.</P>
      <P>My last plea would be a similar one to that of Deputy McGrath, namely, for the widows of the pensioners. There are many such widows in the country who were to some extent dependent on the pensions of which their husbands were in receipt.  The Minister should consider especially those widows who, when their husbands died, found themselves in very bad circumstances.  I know many cases which I could name and I am sure the Minister knows some, too. Perhaps on the Committee Stage he could see his way to make some sort of provision for them&mdash;whether for a full pension, a 75 or 50 per cent. pension is another thing.  He should do something for them.  Many of the older Deputies know&mdash;I cannot say I do, as I was not alive in 1916&mdash;that the wives of these I.R.A. men underwent many grave hardships when their husbands were on the run or engaged in certain activities in that troubled period.  I would suggest that between this and the Committee Stage the Minister might explore the possibility of doing something for the widows of Old I.R.A. pensioners.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with other Deputies in paying tribute to the Minister for the introduction of this Bill.  As one who, over all the years, has been interested in improving the treatment of the Old I.R.A., I certainly welcome the Bill.  Everyone interested in the I.R.A. must pay a tribute to the Minister for Defence for this Bill.  It is a great source of satisfaction to me and, I am sure, to all members of the Old I.R.A. throughout the country, to find this House unanimous in its anxiety to do whatever can be done for the Old I.R.A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Mac Fheórais said just now, long enough there were cynics who thought that the Old I.R.A. were receiving some very special treatment. I hope the information now disclosed will finish all criticism from such <Col N="127" /> people.  It is true that all Governments have attempted to improve the lot of the Old I.R.A. man.  Circumstances obtaining at different times led different Governments to consider that they were doing whatever could be done at the particular time; and so, as time goes on, we have one Government after another improving the position in some respect.  Of course, in the meantime, we have some Old I.R.A. men passing to their eternal reward much too quickly indeed.  That very fact alone certainly means that some money is saved to the Department, and I hold that whatever is left in the Department of Defence each year should be allocated to the remainder for the few short years that they will be with us.  On that, again, the effort of the present Minister is a very creditable one.  This Bill before us removes a few very old sores that we have been very worried about over the years.  Whilst it does not go as far as we would like it to go, especially regarding the smaller pensions, the abolition of the abatement clause undoubtedly means a very big thing for many people.  It removes a great injustice that has been perpetrated on the Old I.R.A. since 1924. Surely no one will find fault with the removal of such a long-standing grievance.</P>
    <P>The extension of the time for applications, both for medals and for pensions, is very welcome indeed.  It may seem rather strange that, so many years after the passing of the Pensions Acts, there may still be persons here at home or scattered throughout the world who have not yet applied; but it has been proved year after year that such is the case.  I am one of those who believe that the time for application for a military service pension should never be closed to those entitled to it.</P>
    <P>As one with some experience of the working of the Military Service Pensions Acts since 1924, I do not believe that any board could do any more, beyond carrying out the terms of reference.  It is true that there are several ways of doing a job like that, but when we come down to brass tacks <Col N="128" /> the board is bound by its terms of reference and its rules.  I know that it is up to the Minister and the Government to change those rules, if necessary; but, such as the rules are, I feel that this board is doing a very difficult job well.</P>
    <P>Under all the different Acts and under the various boards there has been dissatisfaction and disappointment and I expect that, human nature being what it is, there always will be dissatisfaction and disappointment where persons make application for something like that, expect to receive it and fail to receive it.  Having experience of the different boards, I am satisfied they all have done a very difficult job within their terms of reference.  Until the board's hands are strengthened in that respect, we should not wrong them by making statements that they could do something that they have not got the power to do</P>
    <P>The suggestion made by the Lord Mayor of Cork, Deputy McGrath, is an excellent one&mdash;that, instead of permitting one board to sit for a long period of years, it may be possible to have another board set up to examine those applications.  That would give the Old I.R.A. some hope that these applications would be dealt with in our time. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned in November last, I had supported the idea of an amendment of the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  Other Deputies had dealt with reasons why there should be a new approach to the matter of compensation.  I said then and I repeat now that the provisions for a weekly payment under the Acts are entirely inadequate because of the increase in the cost of living in recent years and that the <Col N="129" /> compensation provided for the widow of a workman who is killed during and in the course of his employment is also entirely inadequate.</P>
      <P>One could waste a considerable amount of time referring to the inadequacy of the present legislation.  I do not know what the Government's view in regard to it is, but if this Bill, being a Private Members' Bill, is adopted by the House, I take it that, in accordance with the usual procedure, it will be referred to a Special Committee.  That Special Committee would be more competent than we are as a House to deal with improvements in that legislation, so that I will content myself with saying what I have already said on this stage of the Bill without going into any great detail this evening.  I hope the opportunity will be availed of to have the Bill referred to a Special Committee and that vital amendments necessary in the Workmen's Compensation Acts will result from its consideration of this Bill.</P>

      <P>Anybody will welcome an amendment of the Workmen's Compensation Acts, but I am not satisfied that the proposed amendment is sufficient to meet the case.  I wonder if the Minister would indicate early on that he accepts the principle of amendment of these Acts, and would be prepared to bring in the amendments in a Bill of his own, the Workmen's Compensation Bill which he contemplated introducing before leaving office in 1948.  I understand that the Minister had conversations, discussions and consultations with the representatives of unions, and in particular the Congress of Irish Unions, and that the executive of that body had expressed themselves perfectly satisfied with the Bill the Minister then proposed to introduce.  I think it would be a good thing if the Minister would indicate to the House that he accepts the principle and will bring in his own Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find some fault with this Bill.  I do not know whether the movers were concerned with immediate relief, and therefore approached it from a very modest point of view, but I think they are too modest and not doing sufficient <Col N="130" /> justice.  The House ought to know the position of the employer.  The employer in industry where workmen's compensation is necessary from the point of view of insurance pays a premium to an insurance company on the annual wages he pays, and the strange thing is that, as wages have risen over the years since the last amendment of the code, the premium to the insurance company went up, because of the increased wages paid, but the compensation to the workman did not go up at all.  It is fairly reasonable to say that the workmen's wages generally have gone up by something like 100 per cent. and that, therefore, the premium has gone up by 100 per cent., but the workman got nothing in all these years.</P>
    <P>There are good employers who, having seen that situation, did three things.  They paid the ordinary workmen's compensation premiums which kept the work people covered to the extent of the Act, but many of them realised that the time when an individual requires money more urgently than normally is when he is out of employment, due particularly to an injury received during the course of his employment, and because the working man with £8, £10 or £12 per week could recover only 50/- under the scheme up to the present, certain employers took out an additional policy which I describe as the second step.  For a small additional premium, they were able to insure their employees for full wages in the event of accident.  Then, there was the third step of the prudent employer taking out a policy to cover himself against a claim under what is called the Campbell Act or the common law, where a person is disabled in a different way from that involved in his being out for so many weeks.</P>
    <P>In the case of workpeople who meet with injuries in the course of their employment, who have to remain out of employment for a considerable period and who, during that time, receive less than they need for living requirements, I do not know to what extent the insurance premium would go up if that were to fall on the backs of the company under existing schemes.  I have discussed it with <Col N="131" /> insurance companies, and while they did give additional cover in what I call the second step at a very nominal rate, they feared that, if it were done generally, it would involve a danger for them, due to the possibility of malingering on the part of certain work people.  My experience over the past 25 years is that, while there might have been suggestions or cause for suggestions of malingering some time ago, our workers to-day have attained a great standard of honour and honesty, and, with the possible odd exception, I do not think that charge could be levelled against the workers in Irish industry.  If the Bill cannot give adequate cover, I feel that there should be a plea to employers to do what, as I say, is done by good employers.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising this Bill from the point of view of opposing it, but because I believe its sponsors have erred on the side of modesty, because of the urgency of the situation.  For instance, in regard to sub-section (2) of Section 3 which suggests that for 50/- we should substitute 90/-, I am sure Labour Deputies could argue better than I can that the amount should be 100/- rather than 90/- in view of the general increase in the wages.  I was hoping that the Minister would see his way to proceed on the lines suggested before in regard to a Bill which he had in mind himself, and we should try to make this increase as equitable as possible and make it fit the actual increase in wages.  Certain workers have received, perhaps, more than 100 per cent. of an increase in wages since 1939.  Others may have received less but I do feel that the amount provided as compensation under this Bill is not sufficient.  Again in regard to lump sum payments, which it is suggested in the Bill should be increased from £500 to £800, I could argue that the increased figure should be at least £1,000.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I am misreading Section 8 but I do not think it is fair.  I have personal knowledge of the case of a seaman, a member of the Irish Port Workers' Union who was very seriously injured abroad <Col N="132" /> while in the employment of Irish Shipping Limited.  This man was brought home and immediately his union proceeded to consider ways and means of making an application under the Campbell Act for compensation over and above 50/-.  The man meanwhile had no income whatever and he himself meandered, if I might use the word, to the offices of the Shipping Federation.  A form was produced to him and he was told that, if he signed it, there were three weeks' arrears of compensation coming to him.</P>
    <P>The poor man signed, took his £7 10s. and walked out.  Then he discovered he had signed away his rights to make a claim in the courts because he had neglected to see that he signed without prejudice.  I suppose the poor man would not know what these words meant and he certainly was not told. The man then came along to his union and the union told him: &ldquo;You have made an awful mess of yourself.  The only thing you can do now is to apply for the 50/- per week compensation.&rdquo; Apparently he had other advisers and he went to an independent solicitor. He took proceedings in court and lost his case.  Then the union proceeded and got him an award of 50/- a week, that award being for life, which obviously showed that he was very seriously injured.  The poor man then discovered that, having lost the previous case, he had to pay the costs and his 50/- was docked for two and a half years until the costs were met.  That is why I say that I am not satisfied that Section 8 is a sufficient safeguard.</P>

      <P>I am a layman and I am almost as ignorant of legal technicalities as the poor seaman to whom I referred, but I must say that there should be no phraseology providing that at the time of the acceptance of compensation the workman knew he had a right to take proceedings.  I say there should be no bar to his taking proceedings to recover his full rights. Justice should be done to the workman in all circumstances, and if the courts found that he was entitled to full compensation under the Campbell Act he <Col N="133" /> should get it.  He should not be left in a position where people can walk him into a trap and make him sign away his rights.</P>

      <P>It would be far better for this world, and for this community in particular, if the people for whom this Bill seeks extra facilities were given their rights removed from the courts of law as far as possible.  I hope the Labour Deputies will take what I say in good part.  Those of us who are employers know our workers. We get to know them and we want to live on the best of terms with them.</P>
      <P>If a working man or an employee of a concern in which I have an interest, a man whom I know very well and who I find does his job well, meets with a serious accident in the course of his employment I want to see that he gets his rights and that he will get his wages until such time as it is decided whether it is a permanent injury or otherwise.  Workers should not be expected to be familiar with all the intricacies of the law.  Even if they have unions to advise them, there are always tricky people who will try to catch them out where there are big sums involved.  In such circumstances they are likely to fall for terms of settlement which deny them their full rights.  That is why I say I am not too happy about Section 8.  If a man has certain rights under certain Acts of Parliament, I think these rights should be accorded to him without qualification and there should be no technical phraseology attached to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not seen the terms of the Bill which the Minister had previously drafted, but I am informed by certain representatives of various unions that there was a Bill drafted by the present Minister, that it was a comprehensive and adequate measure, that it took care not only of the workman in these claims but also envisaged the question of compensation for widows of workmen who lost their lives.  I do believe that in a Bill of this kind when we have an opportunity of amending the present Acts we should go as far as possible and be as liberal as possible and make <Col N="134" /> sure that there should be an adequate safeguard for working men who from day to day are open to serious accidents and that they can feel happy in the security of knowing that they will not be left as this poor seaman is left&mdash; I do not know what his family circumstances are&mdash;to exist on 50/- per week for the rest of his life, through a mistake in legal advice.  If a business man makes a mistake he has to pay for his mistake but if a poor workman takes legal advice and loses his case the legal gentleman does not pay for that mistake.  The poor man has to pay for it.  Deputy Cowan suggests this matter might be referred to committee. I would rather hear the Minister say that he expects&mdash;probably he will&mdash; to introduce a Bill here that will be as comprehensive as possible and that will satisfy not only those who represent working people but others who are equally sympathetic to the claims of these working people.  There is a responsibility on us to see they are removed from the position they have been in up to the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say at the outset that the view of Deputy Briscoe, who is a member of the Government Party, is to be welcomed?  Although it is a speech made by a member of the Government Party, we realise that it cannot be indicative as yet of what the official Government attitude will be to the Bill.  Deputy Briscoe's speech is to be welcomed, because what he said to us will be said by all good employers.  I would like to put it on record that Deputy Briscoe is not expressing what he thinks a good employer should say but he is saying it as a good employer himself, and one, who, in his own sphere, lives up to the advice that he gives to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who supports the Bill, I scarcely object in any way to the points made by Deputy Briscoe in respect of the apparent limitation of the Bill.  What he stated in regard to the workmen's compensation code is correct.  There can be no feeling of satisfaction in respect of that code by any decent, Christian man, workman or employer.  The code itself is not only complicated, difficult and beyond <Col N="135" /> the scope of the ordinary man to understand, but it is even frequently beyond the scope of clear explanation by the courts, members of the legal profession and trade unions, who endeavour to ensure that it will be administered in reasonable fairness to the worker.  Above all, the basis of the code is not to approach it from the aspect that Deputy Briscoe suggested, namely, that it is at times of sickness and physical injury the workman requires the greatest amount of sustenance and financial support, but on the contrary the whole problem of the injured workman is approached from the point of view of imposing upon him and his family the greatest amount of hunger and deprivation that can be legally imposed for the purpose of driving him back to work or compelling him to accept a lump sum settlement.</P>
    <P>Whoever may be the Government in power and whatever may be the views of political Parties, I do not think that any of us would stand over in public the basis of such a legislative code. Quite clearly there is an urgent and immediate need to review the whole approach that is at present enshrined in our legislation to the problem of the injured worker and his dependents.</P>
    <P>So far as the present code is concerned and even the present amending Bill before the House, I frankly do not like the particular code.  Like Deputy Briscoe, I think an effort should be made to take the welfare and the protection of the injured worker out of the atmosphere of the law entirely and that we should have it based on some form of State insurance related to the particular conditions and the relationship that exists between the workman and his employer and particularly in respect of the rôle of the workman in industry and his position as a producer of wealth.  From that point of view I think it is not unfair to say that, with the exception of good employers&mdash;and there are not many&mdash;the approach by employers on the whole is merely to give the injured workmen the barest minimum required by law, and the law as it stands provides the bare minimum against complete destitution.  That is <Col N="136" /> something which none of us in this House is prepared to stand over.</P>
    <P>So far as the present Bill is concerned, I think that those of us who support the Bill would have welcomed the decision of the Government that they were going to deal with this matter as one of urgency because it is urgent.  It will be recalled that only some months ago questions were addressed to the Minister in an effort to elicit some indication of what the Government's attitude was in the matter and whether there was any indication of legislation being introduced at an early date.  Nothing definite was forthcoming.  It is for that reason that the Bill confines itself exclusively to three of the most urgent questions that arise in respect of workmen's compensation and does not attempt to deal with a whole host of other questions that are also important and require consideration but are of such a nature as would probably require a review of the whole legislative code in respect of workmen's compensation.</P>
    <P>In so far as the main points of the Bill deal with weekly payments and, consequent on that, the question of lump sum redemption in respect of total or partial incapacity, the question of payments in respect of the death of an injured workman to dependents and further, the matter referred to by Deputy Briscoe, which is dealt with under Section 8, these are matters that those of us who have to deal with them day after day know cannot any longer be left hanging over without attention.  Whatever may be the decision that the Minister is to communicate to us on this Bill so far as the Government is concerned, it is essential to make one thing clear. Whatever may be the view of the Government in respect of a general review of the compensation code as a whole, it is physically impossible for an injured workman to continue to exist any longer on 50/- a week. If there is to be general amending legislation, whether it be to amend the existing code or introduce a new principle, there must be some immediate provision made to deal with the question of weekly payments.</P>
    <P>In connection with the present Bill, <Col N="137" /> it is important to bear in mind that, with the exception of Section 8, the only problem that is presented in the House is the one revolving around the question of weekly payments.  That is the basis which touches the question of the redemption of weekly payments by the payment of a lump sum.  It is also in the final analysis the determining factor in respect of payments arising from the death of the injured worker.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we consider the question of the adequacy of 50/- we will appreciate the main purpose of the Bill and why there is this expression of urgency on the part of all those who ask the House to give it support.  With regard to the adequacy of 50/-, I might recall&mdash;it has already been pointed out in the debate&mdash;that, when the 1934 Act was passed, we had the figure fixed at 30/-.  It is important to remember that although in the Act there is a percentage figure set down indicating a certain relationship between the weekly payment for compensation and wages, in actual practice, so far as 95 per cent of the injured workers are concerned, the figure that is to be considered is the 50/- at the present time, in the same way as 30/- before.</P>
    <P>If we start to consider the figure of 30/- in the provisions of the 1934 Act and then relate it to the conditions of 1953 we can apply some reasonable test.  In the Bill the main proposal is to increase the figure of 50/- to 90/-. Again, I think we cannot object to Deputy Briscoe's criticism that we have been too modest and that the figure should be higher.  I think we will also agree that you have to frame Bills in the conditions that present themselves and while we would be anxious to get much more, I think we would feel that we had made considerable progress if we could ensure that we would reach the 90/-.  There is still time to increase that figure by amendment.  There will certainly be no difficulty on this side of the House if such a proposal is set down.</P>
    <P>Our purpose in setting down 90/- was to try and not give rise to questions of principle but rather to say that if in 1934 a figure of 30/- was laid down in the Act of that date it is reasonable to <Col N="138" /> adjust that figure to present-day conditions. The basis on which we have done that is (1) that we feel that 30/- in 1934 was basically too small in itself, and (2) that there have since been increases in the cost of living and increases in wages.  In 1934 the figure of 30/&mdash;at least in Dublin City, for example&mdash;represented approximately half of what you might regard as the average wage for the labouring man. To-day that wage of 50/- or 60/- in 1934 has gone to between 120/- and 130/-.  But the figure of 30/-, which was then 50 per cent. of the wages, now has gone to 50/-, and that 50/- represents a much smaller percentage of wages than in 1934.  From the other angle of the cost of living, on a very rough calculation I think it is probably correct to say that the overall increase in the cost of living from 1934 to date would be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 130 per cent. or 140 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>1934 was the date of the Act.  Actually, I think that probably a fairer figure would be 150 per cent.  It is reasonable to ask that that 30/- should be adjusted to meet that rise.</P>
      <P>Even among those who support the Bill there are a variety of opinions as to whether we should have fixed the figure at 75/-, £4 10s. or £5, but in politics it is often a matter of securing what is possible and not what we like ourselves.  The door is open.  If the feeling of the House is that the principle enunciated by Deputy Briscoe is the proper principle there is still the opportunity of embodying it in the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the suggestion contained in the Bill is concerned to increase the figure in respect of weekly payments from 50/- to 90/-, there may be the viewpoint, to which Deputy Briscoe referred, of what effect it will have on employers, the working class and industry generally, and also how it will affect insurance companies.  In the first place, I think we should be aware that the actual cost of insurance premiums&mdash;and I am talking now of averages because it varies from industry to industry according to the risks that are involved&mdash;in respect of liability under <Col N="139" /> the Campbell code does not represent a very considerable item of expenditure for industry.  The nearest figures I could get were those published in the <i>Trade Journal</i> for 1947 and in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1951.  They indicated that in 1949, under the heading of &ldquo;Employers' Liability&rdquo;, the total premiums paid to both Irish and English companies amounted to £1,300,000.  Presumably, as Deputy Briscoe pointed out, as wages have increased since 1949 the total paid in premiums would now be somewhat greater.  Let us put it in round figures at £2,000,000.  If we relate that figure to the total wage bill of 1951, which is some £180,000,000, we see that the percentage is not very great.  But the insurance companies, on the whole, do fairly well.  Again, according to official figures, we find that in 1949, in return for the payment of premiums amounting to £1,300,000, the actual return received so far as employers are concerned in the form of claims paid and outstanding on that account amounted to some £700,000.  The amount absorbed by the companies on commission and management was £400,000.  Therefore, it is a fairly lucrative business for the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>Because of the system of calculating premiums, on every occasion on which there is an increase in wages the premium automatically goes up.  Despite, however, the increase in wages in 1948, 1950 and 1951, with their automatic increase in the premiums paid by employers, the only increase that has taken place in so far as the payments to injured workmen is concerned is the increase that took place in 1948 bringing the figure to 50/-.</P>
    <P>Therefore, from the point of view of imposing an undue burden on industry or on employers, I think it can quite clearly be held that even the figure of 90/- is not of such an order and can quite well be borne by industry generally even on the basis of the charges made by the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>The alternative to facing this problem of the inadequacy of the weekly payment and facing the possibility that industry, as it should, will <Col N="140" /> have to bear this additional burden is, in fact, to ask the injured workman to bear the burden himself.  When one recalls the difficulties that we meet with in everyday life one appreciates how difficult it is to explain to a workman&mdash;as I have had to do to-day&mdash;why it is that when he meets with an accident he drops, in so far as family income is concerned, from £7 to 50/-, and how he is going to live on that 50/-. One realises how impossible it is to get him to appreciate how that 50/- is arrived at and what the justification is for asking him to live on 50/- a week when he requires not merely normal sustenance but something in addition because of the fact that he is now sick and ailing.  There is the further difficulty of explaining that that is being paid to him not merely as a compensation for an injury but as a means to assist him to rehabilitation and recovery of his health and to getting back to work.  Of course, it is quite impossible and you cannot explain it. It is for that reason that I suggest that even though it might be argued&mdash;and I think that figures I have indicated show that the argument is very weak&mdash; that the proposal in the Bill to increase the payment to 90/- seems to represent a very considerable increase over the present figure, the alternative is to ask many hundreds of injured workmen each year to continue to exist on 50/- per week which, in present-day conditions, is physically impossible and no man should be asked to do it.</P>
    <P>In so far as the second point arises, that is, the question of continuing incapacity, if the argument is sound that 50/- is adequate as a weekly payment to sustain a man during his period of incapacity as a result of an accident, then it is equally sound when it comes to find the basis of calculation on which a workman is to have his weekly payment redeemed by the payment of a lump sum.  In fact the position is worse.  While a workman may be able to last on 50/- a week for three, four, five or six weeks, with each additional week that he is required to live on it the problem becomes more intense and more impossible of solution.  Everybody who knows the conditions of working-class life knows that there are certain limited resources that can be <Col N="141" /> called upon over a short period of a few weeks, but after a few weeks they become exhausted, and from then on the 50/- is the sole source of income. When one recalls that it is not infrequent to find a man compelled to exist on that weekly payment not for weeks or months but sometimes for years, and to rear a family on that limited sum, then I think that what I said in the beginning is correct, namely, that the basis of our code is not to assist the injured workman but, in fact, to compel him to return to work regardless of whether or not he has recovered.</P>
    <P>I recall a case that occurred some years ago where a man was compelled to exist for nine years on a sum of 35/- a week.  He was expected to rear a family, to support a wife and six children over that period of nine years on 35/- a week, and, by the way, he had been employed by a public concern.  Under our peculiar code, and because of the fact that we are depending on the insurance companies for the effective working of that code, the decision in that particular case was not the decision of the employer. In all these cases the decision is that of the insurance company.  In this case it gambled on that man not living so long because he had been very badly injured, and so believed it would be able to reduce the period of its liability.  Finally, after nine years, it redeemed the weekly payment by a lump-sum payment of £800 or £900. By the time that man had paid all his debts he had not a penny left.  That is how he was left for the rest of his life.  In the meantime some of his children had grown up.</P>
    <P>Finally, in respect of a payment arising on the death of an injured workman, I think there is only one point to be made.  In the week that this Bill was introduced in the House there appeared in the daily Press the report of a case of a workman in the City of Cork who met his death in the course of his employment.  The report stated that the widow and ten children of that man had been awarded a sum of £600.  I do not think any further comment needs to be made on that than to ask if any member of <Col N="142" /> the House, no matter what Party he belongs to or what may be his political view, would be prepared to stand over a position where a widow and ten children are to be expected to meet the outgoings of life on that sum: that the widow is to be expected to rear these ten children, and that the value to that family of the dead man is to be measured by a sum of £600 in 1953.</P>
    <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, it is very modestly suggested that, without interfering with the present system of calculating the lump sum in respect of dependents, we deal simply with the matter by multiplying the figures there by three, and so give a sum of money that will be better related to present-day conditions for those who are left, following the loss of the breadwinner.</P>
    <P>So far as Section 8 is concerned, I frankly agree with Deputy Briscoe in feeling that the ordinary workman should not be required to exercise his option.  It is something completely outside his capacity.  I think it would be impossible either for a member of the legal profession in this House, or for those of us in the trade unions, really to be able to explain to the average workman what is involved in trying to exercise that option.  I can see no reason why the court, in deciding as between a case coming under the Workmen's Compensation Act or other Acts, cannot take into review all the circumstances of a case and exercise on behalf of the workman the rights which will benefit him most.  If it is a question of common law, let him have the benefit of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is a question of trying to get the minimum, the essential, change at the moment.  In regard to the case to which Deputy Briscoe referred, that, in fact, is the case which necessitated the introduction of Section 8.  Since that case was decided those of us who have to deal with these matters have found that many other cases are now being prejudiced by that decision.  I know of some half-dozen cases where the circumstances are exactly the same, and because of the ignorance of workmen in accepting <Col N="143" /> compensation they are now prohibited from proceeding at common law to seek to secure the full benefits which should be available to them.</P>
      <P>The last case that arose I dealt with it personally myself.  This was a case where an injured workman, while lying in hospital, was visited by the agent of the insurance company.  He went into that man while he was suffering in hospital and got him to sign a receipt for the compensation.  Whether this House is going to stand for that kind of thing or not I do not know, but up to the recent decision of the Supreme Court it was possible to try to deal with that kind of case.  Now the door is locked.  The members of this House are the only people in this country who can unlock that door and so prevent a workman, who has been maimed and is suffering physical pain in a hospital from being subjected to such outrageous procedure as I have mentioned.  A man who has been seriously injured is incapable, because of his sufferings, from exercising ordinary reasonable judgment at that point, even if he had a knowledge of what the law is.  It is while he is in that condition that he is asked to sign his rights away, and it is only when he recovers that he realises what has happened. When those in a position to advise him have an opportunity of looking into his case, they then find that it is too late to do anything.  The House should not stand for that, and so should restore to them the freedom which they were able to exercise before on behalf of injured workmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This workmen's compensation code was first introduced, I believe, in 1897.  It is quite possible, I think, that, if it had not been brought in before the national health scheme and the unemployment scheme, it would have fitted into the social legislation which goes back to 1908.  That did not happen.  As a result, it has developed independently ever since. As Deputies are aware there have been many Acts since that time dealing with workmen's compensation. Nearly all of them have been brought in in order to improve, first of all, the <Col N="144" /> chances of the injured man getting his compensation and, secondly, getting better compensation.</P>
      <P>The latest review of this old fundamental question of workmen's compensation that I can lay my hands on is that by Sir William Beveridge when drawing up social legislation in England. He was looking at it, if you like, in a very theoretical way, and commenced by saying that the test in all these things is need.  He said he failed to see that the need was greater for the man who broke his leg at work than for the man who broke his leg in the street, and he was very much inclined to include workmen's compensation under ordinary sickness benefit in the social welfare scheme brought in in England.  He did, however, see certain objections.  One was that a person entering a certain occupation might think that it was a risky occupation and might, therefore, expect to be better compensated, if he was injured in that work, than he would if he had got injured outside his work.  Secondly, a man might claim that, if injured during his work, he was injured when under orders.  For that reason he finally came down to the recommendation that the first 13 weeks should be treated the same as ordinary sickness and after that, if the injury arose out of his employment, it should be treated on a more generous basis.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons that he gave for having the same for the first 13 weeks was in order to save the investigation in minor injuries, which was indeed an idea worth considering but, when the Government in England got his scheme they said that it would have to be investigated in any case when the 13 weeks were over, and they rejected that part of the Beveridge Report although thy accepted what he recommended practically entirely on social welfare, except for workmen's compensation and, as Deputies know, they made it a separate scheme under separate legislation.  I just mention that because it is the latest report that I have seen from any body who examined this thing fundamentally, as it were, in recent times.</P>

    <P>What have we to consider here?  If we were to look, as we should and <Col N="145" /> as we intend to, at this workmen's compensation in a comprehensive way, we should consider whether it should be made part of our social welfare code, that is, if you like that it should be nationalised.  As far as I can find out it has not been nationalised except in England.  I have been told that it is nationalised in one other country but I have not got verification of that yet but it is not a type of scheme that has been nationalised very generally as, say, national health and unemployment have been in many countries. Therefore, we have not very much experience to look for in other countries.  We would, of course, have the few years' experience that they have in Great Britain and in the North of Ireland that might give us some information in making up our mind whether we should nationalise workmen's compensation or not.  It is a matter that must be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put to the Minister one of the objections to nationalisation of workmen's compensation cases?  It is that where it is nationalised the employer is relieved of a certain amount of the onus which rests upon him to ensure the safety of his workmen, particularly where it is a question of employment which may bring about disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the employer has to pay compensation or to pay a higher premium to his insurance company, he has to take greater care. That is one of the problems of nationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, the employer would have to pay the premium to the State Department concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister quite got the point.  One problem that arises in nationalising workmen's compensation is that the employer at present has to provide certain measures to ensure the safety of his workmen in order that his insurance company will insure him <Col N="146" /> without charging him an extra premium.  Therefore, it is an additional safeguard as far as the workman is concerned because the employer, in order to reduce premiums and in order to get an insurance company to cover him, has to comply with certain minimum standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that matter could be looked after.  As a matter of fact, apart from this altogether, under the Factory Acts, these matters are supposed to be attended to by inspectors who are there for the purpose.  That part could be tightened up, if necessary. The second point then, of course, is benefits.  That is to a great extent, practically entirely, what we are concerned with in this Bill to-night.</P>
      <P>I should say at this stage that I had intended getting down to this question of workmen's compensation as soon as the Department had time to come to it.  Deputies will realise that, from the time that I took office until the passing of the Act early last year, all the higher officers were engaged in the preparation of that Bill and in seeing that it went through.  From the time the Act was passed until the implementation of the provisions of the Act was complete, the higher officers again were fully occupied.  As a matter of fact the Act was only fully implemented on 5th January, that is, the 5th of last month.  It was only then that we could say that we had completed the work that was entailed in the passing of that Act last year.</P>
      <P>Up to 5th January the principal officers in the Department were drafting the regulations that would be necessary.  Many voluminous regulations issued just in the beginning of this year.  These had to be drafted, considered and got out, and so on, and certain administrative action had to be taken to put all these various regulations into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That work was completed only on the 5th January.  I was getting many complaints, as I suppose every Deputy knows, from the country people, that they were not getting national health insurance on the proper day or not getting children's allowances at the <Col N="147" /> time that they should get them, that applications were coming in and receipts were not going out for a long time.  All the machinery was upset. It took some time to get that straightened out, and I was asked to leave it until the middle of January at least before requesting the officials to get on to another job.  I am told by the Department that things are now beginning to run smoothly and that they do not anticipate that there will be any further difficulties under the new Act that went through last year and we can find time to consider problems of this kind now.</P>
    <P>Benefit is one matter.  That is dealt with to a great extent in this Bill, and when I come to say a few words about the Bill we can talk about that.</P>
    <P>There is one point.  If we are all convinced, and everybody who spoke so far appears to be convinced, that higher benefits should be paid under workmen's compensation, the view that I would like to hear expressed is as to whether or not we should bring our ideas here more into line with the other social schemes, that is, that we should pay a higher benefit where a man has a wife and a higher benefit still where he has a wife and two children than we pay to the single man.  I think it would be a much better scheme to give the higher benefits to the dependents than to provide the higher benefits proposed in the Bill introduced by Deputy Norton.  That is a point for consideration.</P>
    <P>Another point that has been mentioned here by some Deputies is the very big amount of law that appears to follow workmen's compensation.  I do not know whether we can get over that or whether we can, in any future legislation, try to draft it in such a way as to rule out the possibility of the man having to go to court for a decision as to whether he is entitled to apply for compensation one way or the other.  But, no matter how we draft a Bill, it appears to me that there is always a possibility that there may be some dispute or contest out of it, and the case eventually goes to court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> We can lessen that of course as far as possible.  It was put to me, for instance, that it should not be necessary to go to court to prove that an injury arose in the course of employment; that if this were, say, nationalised and a claim came to the Department of Social Welfare and a man claimed that the injury arose out of his employment &mdash;I am presuming that he would get more if he succeeded in that than he would under ordinary sickness benefit &mdash;it should be sufficient to have an officer appointed to decide that issue. I do not know whether that would be satisfactory or not, but these are things which would have to be considered in connection with legislation dealing with workmen's compensation. There are many questions, therefore, that must be considered if we were bringing in an amending Bill.</P>
    <P>As to this Bill, I am afraid that Deputy Norton in introducing it did not give as close attention to the provisions which he put into it as he did, say, when he brought in the 1948 Bill. First of all, take the question of scope. There are certain exceptions, but, roughly speaking, those employed in manual labour came under the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934 as well as those who were working for an employer but not doing manual labour, if their salary was below £350 per year. In 1948, Deputy Norton, when Minister for Social Welfare raised that to £500. I do not know, but that was probably because that was the ceiling for national health insurance and unemployment insurance.  If so, the amount should now be £600, not £800.  In fact, I cannot see why £800 is put in.</P>
    <P>Even if the Deputy has not taken into consideration what the ceiling is for national health insurance and unemployment insurance and even if he takes it on the average wage or salary, the type of worker in an office who was getting £350 in 1934 was probably getting £500 in 1948.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  But is the person who was getting £500 in 1948 getting £800 now?  On that basis, Deputy Norton appears to have departed from what he had in mind in 1948.  He has not adhered to the social welfare <Col N="149" /> scheme or the level of wages or salaries.</P>
    <P>He has departed from what should be there if he were going on either basis.  However, the question of scope is not a very big matter and if we were bringing in a Bill I am sure we would not have very much dispute about that matter.  I do not know, however, why £800 is put in.</P>
    <P>Then take Section 3 which deals with the weekly payment under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  In 1934 that was 30/-.  The workman who got injured could not get more than 30/-, and he might get less.  If his wages were 30/-, he would only get 75 per cent of that. In 1942, under an Emergency Powers Order, that was raised to 37/6.  In 1948, when Deputy Norton was Minister, he raised it to 50/-.  As Deputy Larkin pointed out, 30/- was roughly about half a labourer's wage in Dublin in 1934 and 50/- was about half a labourer's wage in 1948.  That appears fair enough so that Deputy Norton as Minister in 1948 proceeded on what might be regarded as a normal reasonable basis, keeping it in the same relationship to wages throughout the country.  But, if he were following that in 1948, he is not following that now. He makes it 90/-.  We do not know why he does that.  Deputy Larkin made a very good case for that, I admit, and so did Deputy Briscoe, but they are making the case that we should depart entirely from the rates in the past and go more towards the full earnings of a man in connection with workmen's compensation.  That may be a very laudable opinion for any person to express here.  All I can say is that Deputy Norton as a Deputy has much more liberal views than he had when a Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of your desire to keep it friendly, will you remember that, according to figures furnished by the Taoiseach recently, it now takes 90/- to buy what £2 would buy in 1939?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about 1948. The Deputy was probably right when he considered in 1948 that it took 50/- to buy what 30/- would buy in 1934. As a Minister, he took a perfectly sane view of it.  If he continued to view things in that way he would probably, instead of 90/-, have put in, say, 65/-.  That is why I say Deputy Norton has a better outlook now than he had as Minister.</P>
      <P>As to the lump sum which is paid in the case of a fatal accident, that is a very involved business because it varies very much when the person is an adult and it depends on how many dependants he has.  It is very hard to give an example, but I think £600 is a lump sum anyhow.  In 1948, as Deputy O'Higgins pointed out when Deputy Norton brought in his Bill, he did not increase that.  Deputy O'Higgins also pointed out, when discussing this Bill some two months ago, that he and other Deputies pressed Deputy Norton to increase the benefit at that time in the case of fatal accidents and Deputy Norton refused.  I have not had time to read up these debates yet, but, as far as I remember, Deputy Norton said that there was a great difference since 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton said that in 1934 there were no widows' pensions. There were, of course, no children's allowances either.  He said that the widow, therefore, in 1948 was infinitely better off than the widow in 1934. Infinitely is used in its proper context <Col N="151" /> there because if she was getting whatever the sum was at that time in 1948 &mdash;I think 18/- per week&mdash;that was infinitely more than nothing.  Therefore, the Deputy was right in that, and he proved to the House and the House accepted the principle in 1948 that there should be no increase.  Deputy Norton advanced that argument as Minister for Social Welfare.  It was accepted by his own Party.  It was accepted by Fine Gael and, as far as I remember, it was accepted by Fianna Fáil.  I think we had no vote on it. We were a most reasonable Opposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton now comes along when both widows' pensions and children's allowances are improved and he multiplies by three.  Is that not a remarkable change on the part of a man who made the case here of a good conservative Minister in 1948, and stated there should be no increase? Subsequently he walks across the floor into opposition, and he says the figure should now be multiplied by three. Am I not right in advising everybody here who wants to get a better do for the workman to leave Deputy Norton in Opposition?</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin mentioned a case in Cork of a widow with ten children. That is a pitiable case but, remember, had that woman been a widow in 1934 in the same circumstances she would have got nothing.  Now through widows' pension and children's allowances she gets £3 12s. 6d. per week.  I do not say a woman with ten children can live luxuriously on that sum.  I do not want to be misquoted, but if one capitalises that it comes to quite a fair sum.  It has much more value than £600 when it is capitalised. If Deputy Norton was able to argue in 1948 along the line on which I am arguing now to the point of not raising the figure at all, he appears to be a different man now, and he says we should multiply by three.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very facile at mathematics.  We will come back to that sum.  I agree with the idea incorporated in Section 8.  I have not considered this matter very fully, but I think it is very wrong that a man who draws his 50/- a week because he may be hard up and very glad to get the money, and because he decides that he can carry on for a few weeks on that until he finds out how his claim will go, subsequently finds that he has no claim in common law.  That is very hard lines, and I think we should remedy that situation.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Briscoe that it should be done in such a way that there should be no necessity to appeal to the court to find out whether or not the man was aware of what he was doing when he signed this document. I think he should have an option and be able to choose either. There should perhaps be some limit to that.  Take the case of an employer whose employee meets with an accident and the employer pays him 50/- per week; I think the employer, too, has a right to know within a reasonable time whether the claim will be settled under workmen's compensation or under common law.  I think we must adopt the idea behind this clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as the employer has not got to pay twice there is no objection to the workman having complete freedom to choose his remedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  Perhaps we should put it that the employer must inform the employee of his rights under the Act.  I think we should incorporate this idea in Section 8 in any legislation we bring in.  When the Social Welfare Act was introduced last year we were in the happy position of having officers in the Department who had spent their lives dealing with sickness benefit, with unemployment assistance, <Col N="153" /> with children's allowances, with widows' and orphans' pensions and so on.  We had experts on all these aspects of social welfare.  Unfortunately we have nobody with an intimate knowledge of workmen's compensation. The only thing that was ever done in the Department in connection with workmen's compensation was to bring in Acts from time to time increasing the amount.  We have no experts on the administration side of workmen's compensation.  That is a handicap because when we come to consider whether the whole business should or should not be nationalised it is very difficult to get a complete picture since we have no officer with a practical knowledge of how workmen's compensation should be administered.  There are no books on the subject.  There are no reports from other countries. England has only adopted it in very recent times and, as far as I know, no other country has gone in for workmen's compensation on the basis of nationalisation.  We are, therefore, somewhat handicapped in studying the position, but we are studying it.  That is all I can say on the point at this juncture.  We should be able to decide as to the direction in which we will proceed and we should be able to make that decision probably before Easter. If we decide to go in for nationalisation it will take some time to prepare a Bill, have it passed through both Houses and subsequently implemented. It would be unreasonable to say that we would wait for that if there is now a good case for an increase in the rate of workmen's compensation and every Deputy who has spoken so far appears to think there is a very good case for it indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Simultaneously with considering whether or not it should be nationalised we are considering the rates, and I think we should be in a position to introduce our proposals before Easter. I do not think that will delay any improvement very much as far as the working man is concerned.  If we bring in legislation dealing with increased benefits it will have application at the beginning of a quarter.  It would be difficult to do it otherwise.  As far as I know, these things must be introduced at the beginning of a quarter. <Col N="154" /> We could hardly be expected to bring them in at the beginning of April but, if the Bill is introduced before Easter, it should be possible to implement it by 1st July without any great difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is assuming it becomes part of the social services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said we are considering the question as to whether or not it should become part of the social welfare code and at the same time we are considering the benefits.  If we did go on to nationalisation it would take too long to implement and it would be too long for men who are drawing these benefits, that do not appear to be adequate, to wait.  Therefore, if we are convinced that it must be done we should bring in a Bill&mdash;whether it is an interim Bill or a permanent Bill does not matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that question.  I want to make myself clear on this point before I leave it. Whether we decide to nationalise or not the net point is that a Bill to deal with benefits and those other points, like Section 8, would be ready&mdash; I do not say passed&mdash;before Easter. Whether it will be a permanent Bill or not does not matter because it will be permanent or it will be replaced by nationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride says if it is only a matter of considering the benefit it is a simple matter.  I do not think it is altogether a simple matter.  For instance, one point to which I would like to give some consideration&mdash;I do not say it will take a long time&mdash;is whether we should not bring it into line with our other social scheme by giving benefits to the dependents <Col N="155" /> rather than leaving it a completely basic benefit as it is at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Could that not form part of the permanent legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that should be considered at this stage before we go any further with workmen's compensation because it is easier to do it now, I think, than at a later stage.</P>

I am told this from the Department, that if dependents are to be brought in the insurance companies say they have no method of investigating these cases and it will be a costly procedure as far as they are concerned.  I have a suggestion to make on that point.  As we have the records of every insured person under the social welfare scheme we can supply any insurance company for a small fee with a certificate saying whether a man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister was discussing an interim measure to give him time for the next few months to consider the position as a whole. That would only involve a change of two figures, the weekly sum and the sum where the fatal accident occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It involves a little bit of consideration.  Deputies must be a little reasonable in this matter.  I was asked a question several times, whether I intended to deal with workmen's compensation, and the answer I think I gave was: &ldquo;No, not for the present.&rdquo;  I think I explained on a previous occasion what I explained to-night that the whole of the higher staff was fully occupied on the Social Welfare Act of 1952, first as regards <Col N="156" /> the Government, then putting it through the House and then in connection with its implementation, and that we would have needed more officers to get things going smoothly and more quickly under that Act. However, we could not help that, and it is only now that the Act is beginning to operate properly.  Therefore, there was not an opportunity until about a week ago of having this question considered, and for the last week I have had some of the senior officers considering this social welfare business.  I believe we will be able to get some scheme ready in the course of a few weeks.</P>
      <P>As Deputy MacBride and Deputy Norton are probably aware, there are other Departments very interested in this business.  The Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Finance are very interested. When we talk about nationalisation they would be very interested, and we must put our proposals before these Departments before we go to the Government and before we draft a Bill.  Those Deputies who were in the Government must know that nothing can happen in a few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not take a year. The Deputy knows we must go through that procedure.  It will not take a year.  We will have our proposals ready in a fortnight and the other Departments would take a week or ten days to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I do not agree that we should postpone any further the giving of increases in benefit and increases to the widows and orphans of the men who were killed as a result of accidents and I hope that on the next occasion when we are discussing this it will not be looked upon as a Party matter, that the Whips will be removed and we will have a decent discussion.  I do not agree with the Minister as to the effect of the benefit being increased to 90/-.  According to the present purchasing power of the pound 90/- to-day is worth only 34/6, and under the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934 the workmen got 30/- a week.  That indicates the genuine case of those who are advocating for increases in their benefits both for the man and for his wife.  I can quote a case&mdash;and it was published in the Press &mdash;where a carpenter was injured last October and left nine young children. They got the large sum of £600 and his wife got £186 compensation for herself.</P>
      <P>I hope when we are discussing this matter on the resumption of the debate that every member of the House, irrespective of what Party he belongs to, will face up to the problem and that we will increase the weekly payments to 90/- and also increase the lump sum payment.  I want to point out the inhumanity of some of the insurance companies, which is simply shocking.  A number of men had the 50/- a week stopped a week before Christmas and it was done for no other purpose than to force the men to a settlement of their claims.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dunne has given notice that, on the motion for the Adjournment, he wishes to raise the subject-matter of Question No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Taoiseach to-day:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whether he is aware that unemployment is widespread through the country; and, if so, will he state what steps, if any, the Government propose to take to provide work.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With your permission, I would like to read his reply:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am aware that the unemployment figures have increased in recent weeks.  There is, of course, always an increase in the live register in January, but the increase was greater this year than last year.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental aim of the Government's economic and social policy to create conditions favourable for employment.  In addition, the Government endeavour, within the limited sphere available to them, to provide employment on constructive works to the extent permitted by the resources of the community. The sums being spent this year on the land improvement scheme, hospitals, road grants and special employment schemes are substantially greater than last year.  The number of new schools now being erected and of major school improvement schemes in progress is greater than the corresponding figure 12 months ago.  Employment on arterial drainage in January, 1953, was greater than the corresponding figure last year.  A Supplementary is being introduced to maintain employment in afforestation.</P>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to say that the increase in the unemployment figures is causing the Government concern.  They are watching the situation carefully with a view to providing remedies where possible.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reply by the Taoiseach was most unsatisfactory, and that is why I decided to impose upon the House in this matter to-night.  Deputies have <Col N="159" /> said here, so often that it has become hackneyed, that unemployment is the greatest social evil we have to face, that the unemployed man, especially if he has a family, is in an impossible position in battling with the difficulties of life.  The significance that I see in the Taoiseach's reply is that he states he is aware that &ldquo;unemployment figures have increased in recent weeks&rdquo;.  The facts are that, since the present Government attained power, unemployment figures have increased unceasingly and unfailingly month by month, until now, almost two years after the achievement of power by the present Administration, we have 25,000 more people signing at the labour exchanges than we had before they took office.  That 25,000 more includes men and women who are entitled to register.  There is a vast number, as we know very well, in rural areas particularly, who do not avail of the opportunity to register, but who live from day to day in the hope of getting work.</P>
    <P>In the course of replies to supplementary questions, the Taoiseach added that he did not consider that this situation was critical.  If it is not a critical situation, it is hard to define the meaning of words.  We have not seen for almost 11 years as many unemployed as we have at present, in every trade that you examine.  Particularly in the last 12 months, since the advent of the austerity Budget of 12 months ago, every single trade and industry has been on the decline so far as the volume of unemployment is concerned.  So far as the ordinary person can judge, the entire situation can be traced to the policy of the Government, primarily in restricting credit, in making it impossible for persons who run businesses to expand employment, in making it imperative for them to reduce the volume of their employment, in making it difficult for manufacturers and those who need credit for the operation of industry, trade and business, to obtain money to carry on.</P>
    <P>This Government has succeeded within two years in bringing our people <Col N="160" /> back to a wartime condition.  Everybody is aware that the building trade in the City of Dublin is in a deplorable state.  It is hard to find words to describe the present condition of the building trade.  Three years ago there was full employment for building operatives in this city, houses were being built by the Dublin Corporation at an unprecedented rate; and that resulted not alone in full employment for skilled men and for builders' labourers but in the position that those who had emigrated to England had to be brought back and placed in employment here. These men have been thrown again on the labour market and are emigrating by the hundred.  We are informed by the representatives of the unions of skilled operatives that something like 500 carpenters alone are unemployed in this city&mdash;while there is a crying need for houses.  Is this an accident? Does this come about purely because of accidental circumstances?  No reasonable person will believe that.</P>

      <P>Can any Deputy representing a rural area deny that unemployment abounds in every rural area, that the small towns have queues outside labour exchanges such as have not been seen for a very long time?  A simple examination reveals that the greatest blow that has been struck by this Administration regarding employment in rural areas has been the cutting down of operations under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  From the time the Act came into existence there has been, on the part of the Party now constituting the Government, a spleen and a dislike concerning it, because it emanated from the Labour Benches, because it was beneficial <Col N="161" /> to the people of the rural areas. It is being killed&mdash;and what is the result?  We have thousands more unemployed in the rural areas than we had before.</P>

      <P>Regardless of what may be said by any of the representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party, these facts are well known to every member of the House.  Every Deputy meets unemployed men in this city and in towns throughout the country, asking them for work, to find them a job anywhere; and that applies more now than it has done for a very considerable time. What is the alternative?  The alternative is emigration, as there does not seem to be any hope for them.  It is perfectly plain from the reply made by the Taoiseach to-day that he has not examined the full implications of the position.  He said he was aware that there had been an increase in unemployment figures &ldquo;in recent weeks&rdquo;. There has been an unremitting increase every single month since the present Government came into office.  I think it has now reached the phenomenal figure of 86,000, living on the dole and on unemployment benefit.  That is the situation that I asked the Taoiseach and the Government to bend its mind to.  I do not think it can be described by any other word than &ldquo;critical&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In my own constituency, a constituency represented also by a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, in the town of Balbriggan, one can see queues outside the labour exchange there such as have not been seen before in living memory.  The same applies in Swords, Clondalkin and every other part of County Dublin, and it is repeated in every other county.  I want to know from the Taoiseach if there is anything more concrete than the few words we had from him to-day in his mind or in the mind of the Government.  Is there something more positive in store for these people who are suffering through unemployment at present?</P>

    <Col N="162" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I directed a question to the Taoiseach to-day similar in import to that addressed by Deputy Dunne.  My anxiety in this matter, apart from a dissertation on the causes which may have been the paramount reason for increased unemployment, is to find out if the Government contemplate any immediate measures to deal with the present calamitous state.  Many of the people who are in employment are in jeopardy. People are on part time as distinct from people who are fully unemployed. There is an extraordinary increase in the exodus of people from the country, and I urge on the Taoiseach, not in a spirit of embarrassing the Government, but of getting some immediate remedial measure for the people so affected, that the Government step in and put into effect immediately schemes which will absorb at least part of these unemployed people.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the ill-advised and ill-judged financial and economic policy of the Government is the complete root cause of what has happened.  We have the appalling situation that, in 17 or 18 months of office, a Fianna Fáil Government has been able to maintain and sustain an increasing rate of unemployment at the figure of 1,500 per month for its period of office.  The really violent impetus of that increase has come as a result of an ill-judged and ill-applied remedy for a financial situation which existed, in the main, in the imagination of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come here to-night to press the Taoiseach to realise that the cure for the economic ills of this country is not in over-taxation or restriction of credit, that the time has come for throwing over outmoded and outworn economic theories and for facing immediately the problem of keeping the primary factor in any production in any country at home, that is the labour personnel of the country.  In the ultimate analysis, if there is to be any expansion in production, and this Government is prating from morning until night about increasing production, that increase can only come from the strength and solidarity and co-operation of the human element.  I am urging on the Taoiseach that this <Col N="163" /> problem needs immediate action, lest we do irreparable damage to the country through the loss of more and more of not only our skilled tradesmen but of the youth of the country who are becoming conscious of the fact that there is no stability in employment and no permanency about the future under the economic policy of the Government and who are fleeing the land at a time when they might be of the best service to the State.</P>
    <P>When I deal with unemployment, I deal with it as a real live problem of which the Government must be completely conscious.  It is only they who can intervene now to provide remedial measures that will put these people into employment and arrest this extraordinary growth of unrest and uncertainty which is in our body economic. We know that, as a direct result of the cumulative effect of misconceived ideas as to trends in external trade, of misapplied directions by a Central Bank and of a calamitous and disastrous financial policy, that the country handed over to the Fianna Fáil Government, geared up for expansion, with more and more people going into industrial employment and being absorbed in employment by way of the building of houses and hospitals, drainage work and clearance work done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, that particular structure built up with deliberate care and fed by the investment of the capital of this country has been torn down in political venom and spleen.  No matter what satisfaction the Government may have got from that, they at least had an immediate duty to the people now suffering the consequences of their ill-judged action to take some steps to ensure that they will not be left in the appalling position of not being able to provide in an adequate way in difficult circumstances for their wives and families.</P>
    <P>This unemployment question is a question of a growing calamitous nature.  It is not a problem which needs any airy phrases or promises that the Government may do something in the future.  Something needs to be done within 24 hours and I now urge on the <Col N="164" /> Taoiseach, as head of the Government, to find some scheme forthwith, the putting into operation of which will ensure that we will keep at home in Ireland and put into work here in Ireland as speedily as possible as many people as possible, to reverse the appalling trend that has been constantly growing since the impact of the dead hand of his economic policy has been felt throughout the country.  Not only the cities and towns, but at times even the most remote rural areas have queues at labour exchanges which never existed before and we have arrived at the position that the figure of unemployment has reached the highest point in ten years.</P>

      <P>There are a couple of remarks made by Deputy Dunne to which I should like to refer at the start.  He said that I stated that the situation was not critical.  I think what I said was, when it was referred to as a major crisis, that it was not a major crisis but a situation which required the serious attention of the Government, a situation which gave the Government concern and to which the Government intended to devote the necessary attention.  It was suggested that the present unemployment was the result of Government policy and that the Government had restricted credit.  The Government has not restricted credit.  The Government has not been a party at any time to the restriction of credit.  The Government is held responsible for the Central Bank Report.  The Government had nothing to do with the Central Bank Report&mdash;nothing whatever.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government made quite clear what the basis of our policy was.  Our financial policy, in the first instance, was directed towards making ends meet here in this country, <Col N="165" /> towards seeing that expenditure and revenue met each other and balanced. We are told by Deputy Collins that everything was geared up.  The gearing we saw was a gearing up to get over a precipice.  That was the sort of gearing we had to deal with.</P>
      <P>We had, first of all, to deal with the financial question, to see that current expenditure was made to balance with current revenue.  When we brought forward that policy, we were told that we were taxing the people for tens of millions which were not required.  We shall see when the final accounts are prepared whether those who said that were right or whether I was right.  I said that my fear was that we would not be able to balance expenditure with revenue, even after the increased taxation had been imposed, that the expenditure was such that the revenue received from taxation would not meet that expenditure.  I am sorry to say that present indications are that it will not.  It is nonsense to suggest that we taxed the people for some £10,000,000 which it was not necessary to raise. No Government in its senses would incur the unpopularity of imposing taxes that were not necessary.  The difficulty was that everybody wanted expenditure on a large scale, but few were prepared to find the money to meet that expenditure.  That was our first problem, and it was the basis of our financial policy so far as taxation was concerned.</P>
      <P>We had then another problem, that our balance of payments were running at such a level that they were £61.6 millions on the wrong side, which meant that in a few years our net reserves would have been exhausted, and the country would have been changed from the position of a creditor nation to that of a debtor nation. Surely these were problems which had to be met.  It is suggested that we went further than was necessary, and that we did these things for the purpose of restricting employment.  That is just sheer nonsense.</P>

      <P>The Central Bank is an institution established to do certain things.  It was given certain freedom to report and it reported.  In my opinion, that bank reported against us in the past much more vigorously than it reported against our predecessors, not that they did it because they had any antagonism towards us but that they felt it was their duty to report in that way.  One of the happy features of the present situation for me is to see the conversion of some members of Fine Gael.  I remember the time when we were working in with the Labour Party, ours was a voice crying in the wilderness as far as certain things were concerned.  I am very glad to see their conversion in regard to some of these demands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of doing what it is possible to do.  Last year about this time there was a situation in which the increased unemployment existed, in the main, in the textile and clothing industries.  I have not got an analysis yet of the present <Col N="167" /> figures in regard to unemployment in the various trades.</P>
      <P>I have the December figures but I have not got the January figures yet. Last year, one of our chief anxieties was in regard to the textile and clothing industries.  The Government set about remedying that situation and did it very effectively by affording further protection to industries that were threatened with destruction by dumping and extra imports of goods in the preceding period&mdash;stockpiling. These industries were approaching a situation or were in a situation in which they were failing to give employment or to get sale for the goods which they were manufacturing.  We set about remedying that situation by the same measures by which we had provided employment in these industries originally.  There are some tens of thousands in protected employment as a result of the policy which the Fianna Fáil Government introduced and has steadfastly pursued.  We applied the same measures that we had applied so successfully from the time this Government was established.</P>
      <P>In the clothing industry, some 4,000 workers had been unemployed.  That number has been cut down to 2,000 as a result of the measures which we introduced.  I admit that it was not done in 24 hours.  These things cannot be done in 24 hours.  Similarly, in the textile industry, the number unemployed this time last year was about 2,000.  That number has been cut down to less than one-half&mdash;from 1,900 to, I think, 800.  The moment you are able to analyse the figures for unemployment you are able to take certain measures to remedy the position. Present indications are that the greatest amount of unemployment exitsts in the construction and building industry.  A good many reasons are given as to the cause of that unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not definitely certain what the cause is but various causes have been suggested.  One statement made is that in the rural areas&mdash;and it is a matter to which we have to look forward and about which we must take some measures&mdash;the requirements of <Col N="168" /> housing are gradually being met.  I saw some time ago that, as a result of a survey made in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, it was indicated that they had already erected the number of houses they want.  I am not quite sure of that but I heard something to that effect while I was away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrady" hpid="Mr. S. Brady Mr. S. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated that within two years the numbers required would be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard that it was stated somewhere that, if we are to maintain employment in the building industry, it will be necessary to turn to construction work of another character because the building of houses by local authorities or by private enterprise assisted by State grants accounts for only one-half of the forces employed in the building industry.  As I say, I have not yet made an analysis of the figures in regard to unemployment and if you want to adopt remedies to deal with the situation, the one thing you want to know is what is the cause of the unemployment.  We know what were the causes in the textile and clothing industry and in that case we set about applying the remedy as soon as the causes became apparent.  In the case of the building industry, once we find out definitely what is the cause we shall deal with it.  Someone has suggested that higher rates of interest for building loans operated to cause unemployment.  Others suggested that there has been some restriction of credit by the banks.  We are not responsible for anything of that kind. We have never said to the banks that they should restrict credit.  In fact, if there was clear evidence that they were restricting credit for some special reasons which we were not satisfied were in the general interest, we would immediately ask them to change that policy.</P>

I know it is said that high rates of interest <Col N="170" /> are being charged, but it has also been said that there were certain reasons that compelled that course from the point of view of the banks in order to safeguard their depositors.
