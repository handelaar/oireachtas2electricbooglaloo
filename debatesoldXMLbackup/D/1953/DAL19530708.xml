Is the Minister further aware that it was announced at Galway County Council that the cost of his muddle to Galway County Council was something over £600 ?  Is the Minister aware that the members of every other county council throughout the country have been informed that sums varying between £100 and £600 have been charged upon the ratepayers due entirely to the fact that the Minister and the Government could not make up their minds in time what they wanted to do?</P>

In Connemara, it was £168. In 1952, the highest net earnings in Connemara were £179 but in 1950 the highest net earnings were only £90 6s. in Connemara and £71 in Donegal, the reason being that the protection afforded to the tomato growers was removed by Deputy Palmer's colleague, Deputy Dillon.</P>

I addressed a question yesterday to the Minister for Industry and Commerce regarding the operation of the Safeguarding of Employment Act in the Six Counties as it affects Twenty-Six County workers, and the last paragraph of the Minister's reply would seem to indicate that there was in my question an insinuation that Six-County workers should be debarred from employment in the Twenty-Six Counties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to but it may be very long.  I should explain perhaps in order to help the Deputy and avoid the need to give a long statement of comparative figures that the purpose of this amendment is to cure a great number of anomalies which exist in the present scale of duties.  It will give a reduction in the incidence of duty at the lower rates of charge up to 3/- and will preserve as far as possible the existing incidence, but removing those anomalies throughout the whole of the scale to which I have referred.  The reason why it is <Col N="702" /> necessary to put down the motion is this, that once we get into what might be described as theoretical higher rates, rates of admission which will not obtain in practice but which might be reached in theory, such as 7/-, 13/-, 18/6 and 5/- there would be a slight increase in the incidence of duty.  I do not think that we are ever likely to attain these figures for cinema charges; but because of them it is necessary to put down this motion, as at those particular levels a theoretical increase of duty might arise.  It is necessary therefore in order to comply with the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann to put down this Resolution.  I would suggest that the other matters as to the comparison between the present scale and the proposed new scale might perhaps be taken on the section.</P>

    <P>This arises out of the usual provision which has become a normal feature of the Finance Bill to provide for the need for the repayment of moneys borrowed for voted capital services. The second part, paragraph 2, arises out of the need to give effect to the condition which formed part of the prospectus of the last National Loan that the stock of the loan would be accepted at par value in payment of death duties.  The third paragraph is simple in that it merely provides that the Minister may pay out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof the principal and interest involved in the issue of these securities.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) of Section 22 of the Finance Act, 1920, as amended by Section 5 of the Finance Act, 1944 (No. 18 of 1944), and as amended by Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1949 (No. 13 of 1949) (which relates to deductions in respect of dependent relatives), shall be construed and have effect as if &ldquo;one hundred pounds&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;twenty-five pounds&rdquo; and &ldquo;fifty pounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think it is quite evident that the time has come now for the dependent relative allowance under the Income-Tax Acts to be increased, and this amendment increases it from £50 which it is at the moment to £100.  I think at the same time that the Minister should also consider increasing the marriage allowance and in fact that all the allowances now allowed under the Income-Tax Acts should be increased.  I want to press the Minister to do that.</P>

      <P>I regret that I could not accept this amendment.  As the Deputy is aware, the allowance for dependent relatives stands at an order of £80 and is at least about one-third higher than it is in Great Britain. This proposal contained in the amendment would cost the Exchequer about £385,000 in a full year, and with the steps which we have had to take to balance the Budget this year it would be quite impossible to make a concession of that magnitude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the amendment, and I think that any Deputy will appreciate that the allowances under the income-tax code, particularly in face of rising prices, do require a constant review, and the matter mentioned in the amendment of the allowance in respect of a dependent relative is now quite inadequate in face of the falling value of money <Col N="705" /> and the rising cost of maintenance and matters of that kind.  The amendment is worthy of the Minister's consideration. He should make some suggestion to increase in some way the present allowance, which is completely inadequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year we granted very considerable reliefs to income-tax payers in various categories. We brought in an extended reduced rate relief, we increased the earned income allowance and we increased what is described as the age relief allowance also.  I would be very glad indeed to concede the principle involved in this amendment and to increase the allowance granted in respect of dependent relatives, but it is just not possible in our present financial circumstances to do it.  We cannot find approximately £400,000 in this year for the purpose.  We could only find it by taxing some other commodity, and I do not think any section in the House would wish to see the taxation increased on any particular commodity.  I think we will have to await the outcome of this year before this can be considered again.</P>
      <P>I should like to direct attention to a misstatement when I replied first to Deputy Dockrell.  I said that the relief here was at the rate of £80.  In fact, it is not, it is £50; but the income limit of the dependent relative is £80.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister can be serious in suggesting that the granting of this relief or the modification in some way of the hardship, as suggested in the amendment, is going to place a burden on the taxpayer of £400,000 or anything in that region.  We all know that this year and at the moment the Minister is proceeding to save £3,500,000.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that this relief should be granted, even if it is necessary to absorb portion of the £3,500,000 the Minister hopes to save this year. There is no taxation needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Money Resolution refers to this section and on this you can debate the general principle. As I have already said, the principle is, first of all, to give a more rational scale of duties with better and more logical gradations, to reduce the incidence of duty at the lower rates of charge up to 2/-, to maintain the existing incidence of duty on what may be described as the higher scale prices, up to 3/6d.  It will, in fact, preserve that incidence up to the point where the admission charge is 5/- and then the duty becomes slightly heavier, about 1½d. heavier.  When we reach 7/- a further point is reached and the incidence becomes slightly heavier.  At 13/- the same thing happens and at 18/6 again we have an increase of the incidence of duty.  Above 18/6 the incidence will tend to increase with the admission charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are practical difficulties in devising a practicable scale which cannot be overcome.  It is clear that, so far as admission to cinemas in this country goes, rates like 5/-, 7/-, 13/6 and 18/6 are not of any practical <Col N="707" /> importance; but because of the fact that if these admissions were ever charged there would be the increase which I have mentioned in the incidence of duty, it is necessary to put down the Financial Resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the interpretation <Col N="708" /> of this section is that where a town has had a population of over 500 at the latest census but that at the previous census the population was less than 500, then for the purpose of ascertaining the population of the town or village for entertainments duty you proceed by way of assuming that the town will have the benefit of whatever goes with the type of population which is less than 500 for two years from the 1st September, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The general purpose is that where a cinema has enjoyed exemption from duty by reason of the fact that, so far as the 1946 census was concerned, the population of the town in which it was situated was less than 500, it will continue to enjoy the exemption for two years as from 1st September this year.  The reason for that is this.  A very difficult problem arises because the area in which a census is taken sometimes varies and other changes may take place.  Institutions are left out all right, but there may be a large temporary influx of population and the population is recorded as it stands on one particular night.  I am hoping that before the two years have elapsed we shall find some more rational basis for giving a concession of this kind to cinemas in small towns and villages.</P>
      <P>There are no legal statutory administrative boundaries to these towns and, in some cases, it has been a matter for the convenience of the census-taker as to what area has been included in the town or village concerned.  That has led to certain very extraordinary anomalies.  In some cases, the population of a town or village has jumped from, say, 470 in 1948 to almost 600 in 1951.  That has been a fairly common occurrence.  In one case down in Wexford, Rosslare Harbour, the population, according to the census-taker, jumped from 496 to 572.  The figures, of course, did not represent any real increase in the population of the area.  They merely meant that the person who took the census included in Rosslare Harbour area an outside townland which had not been taken into account before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of this problem which I want to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="709" /> One has been adverted to by the Minister.  I have in mind one particular case, and I suppose it is typical of others which will be found elsewhere. In this particular small town with a population of less than 500, the only cinema, which provided a pretty poor living for the owner but did provide some amusement for the residents, particularly in the long dreary winter nights, had exemption from entertainment duty prior to the last census.  Then the last census was taken and, although nobody locally could discover any substantial difference in the town in question, its population shot up by over 100.  Nobody knows where they came from.  In fact, many people thought the population might have gone down because of emigration.</P>
    <P>I understand the increase in population was due to the fact that at the time the census was taken a number of turf workers migrated into the area. But, because they came in temporarily during the census, the local cinema owner, who was getting a very precarious livelihood from trying to run the cinema with a population of 500, now finds he comes under the scope of this section.  The town is now out of the category of having a population under 500 and, while he gets some temporary relief so far as this section is concerned, for the future he will have to pay 48 per cent. of his takings.  Not 48 per cent. of his profits, which might be understandable, but 48 per cent. of his takings will now be annexed by the State simply because at the time the census was taken a number of people were temporarily living in the town.  I think that is unfair.  I do not think it was ever intended that the calculation should proceed on such an adventitious basis.  I think there ought to be provision for review where there is a clearly explainable case for the temporary increase in population.</P>
    <P>Aside from that, I think rural Deputies will share my view that there is something to be said for making it possible for the small cinema proprietor to carry on in the very small town or village.  It is not <Col N="710" /> fair that his livelihood should be related to the sparsity of the population. It is not fair that the question of whether a cinema will be in the town or not should depend upon the paucity of the population there.  We ought to recognise as a matter of social policy that it is desirable to have cinemas in small towns and villages in order to provide some local entertainment for the people, as people will not stay in these places if there is not a cinema to provide entertainment for them.  People, will not stay in these places if their winter nights are to be nights of unrelieved bleakness and I think, as a matter of social policy, we ought to do whatever is possible to keep the cinemas in these small places as a social amenity for the people.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are doing it in the best way by the device set out here and which has been in our previous Finance Acts.  I do not think it is a matter of political approach.  I think it is a matter of social approach to the problem of people living in a small town or village.  I should like to see the Minister approach this from an entirely different point of view. For instance, in the case of some cinemas, I think the whole method of fixing a stamp to the admission ticket is an archaic arrangement.  It does not make sense.  It is certainly not fool proof and is capable of any kind of manipulation.  The revenue officials cannot properly supervise cinemas in small places.  It would be far better if the approach were that the proprietor of a cinema in a small town would pay an annual licence fee of say, £50 or £100, just as you pay a road licence for running a motor-car. Once you pay the licence fee you are free for the next 12 months.  That would obviate the necessity for constant supervision by revenue officials. It would mean fewer false statements in the preparation of returns and, at the same time, it would provide a cheap administrative method of getting whatever revenue the State as a matter of policy desires to get from cinemas in these places.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I think the Minister might without any real loss of <Col N="711" /> revenue, particularly if he has something in mind from the point of view of changing the method of assessing the duty in these cases, increase the figure of 500 to 1,000.  I do not think the loss of revenue would be very much.  If there is to be a change, let us have a change on some more rational basis than we have at present.  The figure of 500 was really an arbitrary figure when first put in there.  There is nothing more special about the figure of 500 than there is about the figure of 600.</P>
    <P>I am not making a case for the town or village with a population above or below 500 but, generally, for the really small places where it is desirable to keep cinemas for the entertainment of the population and where the provision of a cinema ought not to involve the possibility that the hopeful cinema proprietor will lose whatever capital he puts into the erection of a building suitable for a cinema and the purchase of the necessary gear and equipment for operating it.  I think we ought to work it on a better method than is enshrined in this section.  Then I think the Minister could without any real loss of revenue move an amendment to this section pushing the figure up from 500 to, let us say, 1,000, and let him in the meantime review the matter with a view to, generally speaking, providing better facilities for the operation of the cinema in the small town or village.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very anxious that these entertainments and amenities, or sources of entertainment which the rural people enjoy, should be preserved, but at the same time I cannot overlook the fact that over £1,000,000 is secured out of entertainment tax levied mainly on cinemas, and I cannot allow that sum to be eaten into by gradually increasing the population limit for tax-free entertainment. The whole difficulty, as Deputy Norton has said, is occasioned by the fact that under the Act of 1949 the qualification for exemption is the population at the last census.  It is, as I already said, a very imperfect basis, but I have not been able to think of any other, and in the meantime in <Col N="712" /> order that those persons who have enjoyed the exemption will not be any worse off by reason of the figures secured by the 1951 census, we are extending it for two years as from the 1st September.  We are extending the duty-free exemption which they enjoyed prior to the publication of the census figures.  In the meantime we can examine this, and see what we can do about it.</P>
      <P>I would not pledge myself at all to accept the proposal to bring the limit to 1,000, but that will be examined along with other matters.  If I did increase the limit from 500 to 1,000, I would then be told about the town that had a population of 1,100 or perhaps 1,500 and so on, and we would also have complaints.  Do not forget that to some extent people would say that if you raise this population figure too high people would be able to build larger cinemas outside the three-mile limit which would, by reason of the fact that they were getting lower rates and perhaps charging lower prices, be able to attract numbers from the cinemas in the small towns.  It is a problem which is not easy of solution, but we want to try and preserve the country cinemas.</P>
      <P>In regard to those which are situated in towns with populations exceeding 500, we are doing something in the new scale, to which the Dáil has just agreed.  This is an attempt to deal with the problem of the cinema in the village.  All we are asking here&mdash; and I think we should get it&mdash;is that we should be given a breathing space of two years in the hope that in that time we will be able to hammer out a better scheme than at present exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I bring this consideration to the Minister's notice?  Is it not the position that where a town has a population of over 500 the entertainment duty for a cinema in that town is exactly the same as that paid by a cinema in the City of Dublin.  In other words, in the case of the fellow running a small cinema in a town with a population of 501 in what might be described as a rural area, the rate of entertainment duty for that small cinema is the same rate that obtains in the City of Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, it will not be, Deputy, because rates of admission are lower and the incidence of duty on lower rates of admission is less burdensome than on higher rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in the matter is this: if a cinema in the City of Dublin, say, charges an admission fee of 2/- there is a certain rate of entertainment duty paid on that.  If a cinema proprietor in a small village wishes to charge the same fee he has to pay the same rate of duty.  He can only avoid the impact of the higher entertainment duty by keeping his cinema prices down to the very lowest level, and of course if that happens, you can understand the kind of comfort and entertainment you get where cinema proprietors try to run shows based on 4d. or 6d. admission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, what is the difference between the city and the rural area if the charge is 1/-?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few cinemas in Dublin that would afford great luxury at admission prices of 9d. or 1/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not disturb my argument&mdash;that the rate of duty for admission charges is the same as in Dublin for small areas throughout the country.  Obviously, there is something defective in the line of State policy that produces that inequality. I do not think it is fair that a fellow trying to run a cinema in a small place should have to measure up to the same standard of entertainment as a fellow in Dublin, nor do I agree that it is reasonable that he should pay the same rate of entertainment duty as a large and heavily capitalised undertaking in the city.  Perhaps the section in the Bill does provide a breathing space for those who are now operating cinemas in towns where the population is now above 500 but was below that figure at the previous census.  But again, the whole question of the levying of entertainment duty on cinemas of that kind is, I think, one which calls for early revision, unless you are <Col N="714" /> deliberately going to make war on the small cinemas because they cannot possibly hope to survive if these rates of duty are made operative once they pass the 500 figure nominally.  I wonder is it possible for the Minister to take power in this section either here or in the Seanad, whereby, when there are some artificial factors to increase the population such as migration into an area, allowance would not be made for the fact for the purpose of assessing the population of the town for the purposes of entertainment duty?  It is unfair that a temporary influx of people a month or so before the census is taken should operate to disturb the whole population figure in the town for the purposes of taxation under this section. If the Minister would take power to examine cases of that kind where there is clear evidence of artificial factors operating to increase the population of a town, it might help to remove anomalies which at present arise there and which the Minister admits himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not undertake to do anything more in relation to entertainment duty this year&mdash;anything more than I am doing.  It is true that an influx of population of that sort into a town might deprive the cinema proprietors of the exemption which they enjoyed under the law as unamended but with the section as we have it now they will continue to enjoy that exemption for at least two years.  On the other hand, we can also take this into consideration&mdash;that if there is such an increase in the population of a town and even though it were to be temporary as indicated by the Deputy, it is very likely that the cinema proprietor's business would benefit considerably. He may lose one way but he gains in the other way.  Whether he loses or gains, in the situation as it is now, he will continue to gain for the next two years, and in the meantime I would hope that the next Finance Bill will contain more satisfactory proposals for dealing with the problem of the country cinema.</P>

In order to prevent an abuse of the concession, it was necessary to confine it to persons whose only or chief occupation was farming.  It happens, however, that very large farms are run in connection with hospitals, schools and religious institutions. While it could not be said that their only or chief occupation is farming, nevertheless, as the tractors in these <Col N="716" /> circumstances would be used mainly for agricultural purposes, it is proposed to grant the reliefs set out in the section.</P>

      <P>Before Section 8 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>From and after the passing of this Act the duty of excise imposed by sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the Finance Act, 1920, shall be charged, levied and paid at the rate set out in sub-section (2) of Section 6 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, in lieu of the rate set out in sub-section (2) of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1952.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment for very obvious reasons.  It, in effect, asks that the last increase in duty on whiskey be remitted and that we return to the position as it was in 1950. The reasons prompting this amendment are that there has been a drop in consumption, a drop in production, a fall in employment and, above all, a fall in revenue.  The only possible defence that can be made for the imposition of a duty by a Minister for Finance is that it will secure increased revenue. If a heavy duty, in fact, results in a drop in revenue, then there is no justification whatsoever for such a duty.  If that drop in revenue is associated with a fall in employment and a considerable drop in production, then the case for remitting such duty should not require to be made in an assembly such as this.  We have every Minister and most of the Deputies going around this country preaching more and more production and saying that the only possible solution for our adverse balance of trade, for our unemployment and to check emigration, is increased production.  Here by an act of the Minister for Finance, well-intentioned at the time, we reduced production in hopes of increasing revenue but, after a year and a half's experience, we find that we have reduced production very, very considerably and that in addition we have reduced revenue by nearly £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any amount of artificial aids are <Col N="717" /> given in this country to stimulate and bolster up industries of various kinds. The necessity for industrial activity is obvious but most of our industries, or very many of them, are not native in the fullest sense of the word.  They are engaged in processing articles, the raw material of which comes from abroad.  The distilling industry, however, is native all along the line from the time the grain of barley goes into the soil until the finished article is consumed. The farmer gets his whack, the agricultural labourer gets his share, likewise the distiller and the employees of the distiller.  The transport people get their turn distributing the finished product all over the country and then the licensed trade proprietor and the assistants in that particular trade all draw their share from the industry.  All along the line, the product is Irish and the employment is Irish.  There is nothing foreign from beginning to end.  If by a tax we reduce the amount of production and at the same time reduce the revenue from that particular product, then it is time to lean back and examine the situation.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of this Bill, the Minister put forward the case that the reduced consumption and production were due to a withholding or a hold-up by the distillers, in hopes of some remission later on.  It is very difficult to believe that that would be done for such a very long period of time.  There was also a suggestion of advance buying.  I do not think there would be enough credit or money behind the licensed trade to engage in advance buying on the gigantic scale that would have to be done to account for the fall in production since the imposition of this second duty on whiskey.  The Secretary of the Distillers' Association published communications which appeared in the Press contradicting the Minister's assertion. There was another statement made by the Minister that Irish whiskey was being sold as Scotch whiskey.  That produced a contradiction by the Secretary of the Scotch Whiskey Distillers &mdash;a rather indignant one, because the suggestion, of course, charged them with illegal practices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> The fact of the matter is that the production and consumption of whiskey have fallen.  That means that there is a considerable drop in employment. There is a considerable drop in the distilleries' purchase of barley from the farmers.  In the distillery zones a permanent, regular and reliable centre for the sale of barley was the distillery and as a result of the reduced market, there is dislocation in the industry, in an industry that requires a chance and which has got very few chances. Markets are more frequently upset and destroyed than they are built up and maintained.  Here, for some peculiar reason, a Government that is supposed to be anxious for increased trade, increased production, increased employment, increased consumption for things native to the country such as barley, by a deliberate act imposes a duty that results in a drop in revenue, a drop in employment and a drop in consumption and production.</P>
    <P>A case, not a serious one, may be put forward by the Minister to the effect that anybody advocating a remission of this particular tax is advocating drunkenness or alcoholic excess in this country.  Every one of us deplores drunkenness.  Nobody has any use for the drunkard.  Anyone in the licensed trade will tell any of us that the drop in consumption is not because the drunkard is becoming a total abstainer. The drunkard will go without his meals and without new clothes rather than go without his liquor.  It is the rather abstemious man who used to take two or perhaps three drinks a day and reduced them from three to two or from two to one.  That is where the reduction lies.  That man was doing nobody any harm and he was doing himself no harm.  It was a little comfort in his life.  He cannot afford it now. There is where the economy is.  Whatever case the Minister may make, let him not attempt to make that case.</P>
    <P>The Minister's idea in imposing this tax was not to cure drunkenness or to make people more temperate.  According to his own calculations, when he imposed the tax he hoped to get an extra £1,500,000 per annum.  Instead of getting that much extra&mdash;I think the amount was £1,200,000&mdash;he actually got £400,000 less than he got with the <Col N="719" /> lower rate of duty.  I am advocating that he should return to the lower rate of duty and get approximately £500,000 more money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to take this opportunity of saying that I accept the statement made by the representatives of the Scotch Whiskey Distilling Association.  I have not been able to substantiate the statements which were made to me and which I made in this House in regard to the export of Irish whiskey and of Irish whiskey being sold as &ldquo;Scotch&rdquo;.  A considerable amount of Irish whiskey is exported for blending purposes. Much of it is immature whiskey which would not be sold here.  I am not prepared to go further than to say that it is exported.  Perhaps it may be blended elsewhere with Scotch whiskey though not sold as such.</P>
      <P>The second thing which I should like to do is to correct a misstatement&mdash; unwittingly made.  I think&mdash;by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.  We did not expect to get either £1,500,000 or £1,200,000 as a result of the increase in the duties on home-made spirits.  We expected to get something of the order of £750,000, which is a substantially smaller sum than that which the Deputy has mentioned.  It is quite true that we did not reach that yield last year.  As is well known there was a decline, an actual fall, in the revenue of a substantial amount.  I venture to say, however, that the reduction in the amount of whiskey cleared from bond was much greater than the actual reduction in consumption and that there was, as Deputy Dr. O'Higgins has reminded me, a substantial amount of forestalling over a period of a year.  I am glad to say that our experience in the first quarter of this year would appear to bear that out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister talking of this calendar year or of this financial year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of this financial year.  In 1950-51 the clearance in the first quarter was of the order of 166,000 gallons.  In 1951-52 it was 161,000 gallons.  Last year&mdash;1952-53&mdash;<Col N="720" /> it fell to 105,000 gallons.  To whatever cause that decrease may be ascribable, the fact is that the clearances this financial year have so increased by almost 50 per cent. so that, in the first quarter of this year, the clearance from bond amounted to 155,000 gallons or almost 50,000 gallons more than last year and very little less than in 1951-52, 1949-50, 1948-49 or 1947-48.  That is the position.  Apparently the revenue in 1952-53 suffered by reason of the fact that there had been excessive clearances in other years.  But now, when these unduly large stocks have been, shall we say, liquidated, the position is becoming normal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely they were always liquid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>They only went into liquidation in the first quarter of last year.  The position now would appear to be repidly reaching normal.  As I have said, the clearances have substantially increased and would indicate that our estimates for the revenue from the spirits duty in this particular year will be fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins dwelt on a number of aspects of the effects of the heavy rate of duty.  The Minister's figures show that last year there was probably some anticipation of an increase in taxation by reason of the increase in the number of gallons withdrawn for home consumption.  It was 87,990 gallons in the month of March last year&mdash;which was somewhat larger than that of February and January.  The kernel of the problem is the effect which a substantially increased rate of taxation is having on the distilling industry.  Over a number of years, the Distillers' Association have made representations to successive Ministers for Finance in regard to the serious burdens which the industry was obliged to bear.  While that case had considerable force &mdash; and figures were produced to show the effect of the increased rates which spirits were carrying&mdash;the Minister for Finance always countered with the reply that if an alteration were made the revenue would suffer.  That applied not only to the quantity of whiskey which was allowed for home consumption but <Col N="721" /> it applied with considerable force to any demand for a relaxation in the amount allowed out for export.</P>
      <P>The revenue returns for last year show that the arguments advanced in the past by the Revenue Commissioners no longer hold good because last year there was a fall in the consumption of home-made spirits by over 200,000 proof gallons, and a fall in revenue from all spirits of between £300,000 and £400,000.  Deputies on all sides have on numerous occasions expressed approval of the efforts made to develop and assist industrial expansion. If a new factory is opened, there is always a flourish attached to the ceremony.  The Minister concerned, if a Minister is invited, dwells on the importance of providing additional employment, on the improved prospects for the locality and on the skill and initiative of the promoters, and very many forms of protection have been provided by way of tariffs, quotas and State assistance of one sort or another.  These industries, if they offer the prospect not only of producing articles which we require at home, but of an export trade, receive commendation from all quarters of the House and from the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>Here we have an old-established industry, an industry which uses as its raw materials the produce of Irish farms, which provides Irish farmers with a cash crop, which not only ensures a type of agricultural production that should be welcomed but makes raw materials available for us, no matter how external influences may affect us, how trade may develop or how import prices of raw materials may change and which provides direct employment not only in the distilleries but on the farms, with consequential employment in transport and so forth.  It is an industry with a long established tradition of products of high quality which have not only maintained their place in the home market but have succeeded in getting a foothold abroad.  It is, I think, significant that a number of the smaller distilleries have seriously curtailed their production programme because of the effects of the present high rate of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> From time to time during discussions on this matter, reference has been made to the fact that the distillers have not availed of the opportunities that presented themselves and some suggestions have been made to the effect that they have not increased production.  I have some figures here which, I think, refute that suggestion.  They are figures for the production of home-made spirits and for stocks of home-made spirits in bond.  For 1943/44, the production of home-made spirits was 1,240,000 proof gallons; in 1944/45, 1,583,000; in 1945/46, 1,792,000; in 1946/47, 1,471,000; 1947/48, 1,263,000; in 1948/49, 1,840,000; in 1949/50, 1,975,000; and in 1950/51, the last year for which I have figures, 2,078,000. Stocks in bond for the ten-year period from 1942 to 1952 increased from 7,599,000 to 11,000,000 proof gallons. Each year showed some increase, and, in the ten-year period, there was an increase of over 3,000,000 proof gallons held in bond.</P>
    <P>It is only right to say that when the reduction in the rate of duty on beer and tobacco was granted by the inter-Party Government in 1948, the Distillers' Association made representations requesting a reduction in the duty at the time.  These representations were renewed during the subsequent years of the inter-Party Government, and, while it was not found possible to accede to them, it is true to say that there was an alleviation in direct taxation, as it affected the industry. Since the representations were made, the duty has been increased from 137/- per proof gallon to 176/- by the Budget of 1952 which is re-enacted and continued in the Finance Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>I believe that the problems facing the industry can only be surmounted by a reduction in the rate of duty, and I think the House will join with me in expressing the view that not merely should there be a reduction in the duty, but that the statement published by Córas Tráchtála in to-day's Press that there has been a reduction in the export of whiskey must give the House and the country serious concern, that this old-established industry should be facing a decline, a decline at a time <Col N="723" /> when feverish efforts are being made to provide more industrial development, to increase production and to provide employment.  I suggest to the Minister that the terms of the amendment should be accepted and that an alleviation of the present high rate of taxation is an essential prerequisite to the continued prosperity of this industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment, and I do so because I think the speech made by the Minister for Finance on the Budget this year is in itself a strong reason why the remission of taxation suggested in the amendment should be conceded.  If the Minister or the Government decided to embark on a crusade for the extermination of the Irish distilling industry, we could understand it as a line of policy.  If the Government said: &ldquo;We want to annihilate the distilling industry,&rdquo; it would be all right.  One might disagree with that line of policy, but at least one could understand the mental and psychological approach, but is that the policy of the Government?  What is the Government's policy in relation to the distilling industry?  As has been pointed out by previous speakers distilling is one of our oldest industries and one that gives considerable employment of a very valuable character. It is one of the few industries which employs a very high proportion of male workers.  It is one of those industries which to a very large extent is personally controlled, the type of industry which shows towards its workers a greater appreciation of craftsmanship and skill than operates in the public company type of industry where the incentive to invest money is governed largely by the dividends yielded rather than by pride in the products of the particular industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as distilling is concerned it gives considerable employment in the tillage counties through the growing of malting barley.  It provides a good cash crop for the farmer and it enables him to sell that crop to folk who on the whole pay pretty good prices for it and pay their debts regularly. It provides a good class of employment.  The employment consists <Col N="724" /> mostly of adult male workers and wherever distilleries have been established there has been considerable stability in employment.  In every one of the distilling industries trade union agreements have been implemented between the employers and the workers regulating wages and conditions and the level of the agreements reached is pretty high.</P>
    <P>So far as the value of the products is concerned, it represents a very high percentage of our total industrial production. So far as relations with the workers employed in the industry are concerned there has been a long period of industrial peace and a willingness to recognise that it is desirable to promote good industrial relations.  No figures produced to show releases from bond in the last three months can disprove the fact that the distilleries are now passing through a bad time.  A goodly number of workers have lost their employment.  A goodly number of assistants employed in public houses have lost their employment. A goodly number of farmers who had good contracts for the growing of malting barley in years gone by are not finding it so easy to enter into such contracts now.  Generally speaking, because of the increased duties imposed in the Budget of last year and continued in the Budget of this year, the distilling industry is now going through one of its most critical periods.</P>
    <P>If the Minister says that the purpose of increasing taxation on spirits last year was to raise revenue, then his efforts in that direction have been a failure because the duty yielded from the increased taxation was lower than the duty yielded when the impost was not so heavy.  The Minister hopes that he may make good some of the shortfall in revenue which he anticipated last year.  The Minister's guess last year proved to be hopelessly inaccurate. Indeed, this is not a field in which the Minister's guesses have been conspicuously successful.  I could quote&mdash;indeed, I will quote on the next stage of this Bill&mdash;some of the Minister's prophecies as to what he would get last year in respect of the increased duty on spirits.  The Minister, <Col N="725" /> of course, completely miscalculated the market.  Now he apparently refuses to see what every distillery and every publican in the country could have told him would happen, namely a considerable falling off in the consumption of spirits with a consequential falling off in the amount of duty.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of revenue I do not think the Minister will lose anything by accepting this amendment. From the point of view of encouraging distilling and helping the distilling industries I think the Minister would be doing a good day's work in accepting this amendement.  We must remember that distilling is really an all-Irish industry. The raw material is indigenous. All the processes associated with distilling are entirely Irish.  Distilling probably makes the least demands on the Department of Industry and Commerce for protection, for assistance, for guarantees or quotas.  Some industries which import commodities and merely make holes in them or undertake some slight fabrication are constantly looking for more and more protection and more and more assistance and because they are apparently influential enough they can get any kind of assistance they ask for.</P>
    <P>Here we have an old-established Irish industry which does not trouble the House or the public with its wails and its woes.  Yet, because apparently it can manage to carry on in this unexciting way from the point of view of public controversy it is singled out by the Government for the imposition of a heavy code of penal taxation, an imposition which must retard the industry and in the long run yield to the Exchequer substantially less.  I do not think that the Minister would in any way indent on State finances by accepting this amendment.  He ought to recognise now as a result of his experience in the past financial year that it was a mistake to put this new burden on the distilling industry with consequential additional unemployment in the industry and in the auxiliary industries and services associated with it.  A review of what happened last year should induce the Minister to recognise that there is no longer any justification&mdash;indeed there never was <Col N="726" /> justification&mdash;for the imposition of last-year's burden.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised in this amendment is a simple one.  It is based on an analysis of the reasonable way in which to raise revenue and what may be anticipated in the normal way from a too severe tax imposition. There is very clear evidence before the Minister in this particular instance that one can over-tax an industry to the deteriment of the anticipated financial yield.  It is quite obvious now that the Minister has over-reached himself and, instead of being able to maintain the level of revenue, he has reduced it considerably.  That would be unimportant if the issue involved had not serious consequences but in this particular bit of savagery the Minister has almost succeeded in extinguishing one of our oldest traditional industries.  That is something to which the House should direct its attention in a rather deliberate way.  In accepting this amendment the Minister will not lose anything.  At any rate he cannot do worse.  It is a simple mathematical theory that if one over-taxes one is bound to suffer a substantial fall in revenue.  If, on the other hand, one taxes at a reasonable level one is likely to find buoyancy at that level.  That was proved conclusively by the last Government.  When they took it upon themselves to remit certain penal taxation it subsequently transpired that the remission did not in fact cost the State anything because the general yield more than justified the confidence of the then Minister for Finance that instead of causing any serious loss of revenue it was going to maintain and did, in fact, increase the yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got to examine this whole situation against the background of three paramount factors.  This particular taxation hits not only the industry itself and its employment potential but also the farming community. It also hits what has been aptly described by Deputy Cosgrave as certain ancillary employment that normally flows from the carriage of barley.  We had an election contest recently in East Cork.  In one town in that constituency there has been a tremendous curtailment of employment <Col N="727" /> as a direct consequence of this tax.  It involved the discharge of between 30 and 40 male workers.  That certainly is not indicative of any intelligent effort by a Government to arrest the rising growth of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I venture to hazard a guess as against a guess by the Minister that if this amendment is accepted it will infuse sufficient hope and life into the distilleries to take many people off the unemployment queue and at the same time ensure that the now apparent substantial decline in contracts to Irish farmers by maltsters will be arrested.  It is quite true&mdash;the Minister knows it is true and Deputy Corry who was here a moment ago but who has gone out knows perfectly well that it is true in the Cork area any-way&mdash;that there is a decrease of more than 50 per cent. in certain areas in the contracts being offered by maltsters this year for barley.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister, although he may not be of an agricultural turn of mind, analyse the position for himself.  In the general overall revenue you are going to have a considerable diminution in the cash available to farmers in respect of a cash crop which they normally produce.  This taxation to my mind was savage in its initial conception because it hit the type of industry that was traditional and least equipped to withstand this type of strain.  As adverted to by Deputy Norton, many of these industries were family industries in which there was a pride of craftsmanship and a family tradition. It is something absolutely essential to the way of life in certain areas where families grow up in anticipation and expectation of succession.  The son succeeds the father and a nephew an uncle within the system of employment in these distilleries.  There is a pride of achievement and work in them.  The standard of the products ranks fair with the standard of goods produced in any other type of industry in this country.  I think it is a travesty on the people that we should by an Act of this Parliament permit the gradual extinction of this type of industry.  It is <Col N="728" /> a type of industry which once gone is impossible to replace.</P>
    <P>Too often in our history have we seen certain traditional types of craft and industry blotted out never to be revived and this particular industry is one of considerable value to our agricultural industry in so far as it is one of the few real industries the raw materials for which can be found here.  In my opinion it is something that the Minister might consider outside the realm of politics altogether.  It should be considered as the basis for maintaining an employment potential in certain areas throughout Ireland where otherwise it would not be.  In the light of two successive Budgets, I would impress upon the Minister that it would be infinitely better to see relief given to an industry that needs relief and which has an honourable and decent record in this country than to give it, as we found in two successive Budgets, to ballroom proprietors.</P>
    <P>In the light of the general economic policy of the present Government the time has come to try and pound, not from the point of view of political advantage, a little bit of ordinary common sense into them and arrest their willy-nilly flight into economic degradation and bring them back to the reality of saving, as they can save, at no loss of revenue to the State.  I suggest they can save by accepting this amendment.  Many traditional distilleries throughout this country have been a mainstay in rural areas not only in regard to the immediate employment they give but because they are a source of hope and employment to families who grow up round those traditional distilleries.</P>
    <P>I press the Minister to accept this amendment with a view to maintaining employment where it is badly needed.  We do not want any increased flight from the provincial towns or rural areas.  I impress on the Minister that he should accept this amendment to maintain that industry in production.  He should accept the amendment because by doing so it will be a near certainly that will enhance his revenue yield.  Finally, the Minister should remember that in the ulti-in <Col N="729" /> mate analysis once this type of industry is annihilated by his tax policy it will be impossible to revive it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether it would be possible to get the Minister to change his mind on this matter.  I should like to suggest that I do not believe the Minister, or any member of his Party, would like to see the distilling industry destroyed.  I know that is not the intention of the Government, but it has to be pointed out that the very serious impositions in the last two Budgets have done considerable damage to the industry.  If the Minister and his colleagues are serious about keeping the industry going, and if they are not prepared to accept the amendment before us, then I think they should find some alternative way of keeping the industry alive.  In other words, if we are not going to allow the Irish people to consume this excellent beverage at a reasonable cost, then I suggest we should take steps to make it available to other nations and thus protect the distilling industry here. Let us have it one way or the other.</P>
      <P>The trouble that I see is that this decision to increase the burden on the distilleries was taken at a time when it was most difficult for those concerned to try and break into the world market. I think it must be apparent to every member of the House that, in the past, our distillers have been very conservative, and that when they had good times they neglected to a great extent to drive home the advantage they held and so secure a permanent market in other countries.  The trouble is that we are paying to-day for their conservatism. It is not the members of this House who are going to suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dwelt in other debates on the value of the distilling industry to the farming community.  If anyone takes the trouble to look over the debates they will find that other Deputies have also mentioned the benefits which this industry confers on the farming community. It is agreed by all of us that the distilling industry is based on agriculture, and, if one likes to put it this way, one can say that the distilling industry is about the one industrial arm of agriculture that we have.  To <Col N="730" /> my mind it has been most neglected. Everything that goes to the making of whiskey is of benefit to the farming community, to those who are employed on the land and to those engaged in the towns in the distribution trade.</P>
    <P>The growing of malting barley provides a rich cash crop for the farmer. The whiskey is made by the distiller from this barley and the residue, the grain that is left after the distilling, goes back to the farmer and provides him with an excellent feeding stuff.  In addition, we know that within the last couple of years a number of distilleries have perfected a system whereby they are able to utilise all the waste products available after distilling.  Heretofore, they had to be discharged into the river but now, as I say, due to the system which they have perfected, these waste products, when processed, provide excellent feeding for pigs, Therefore, there is no waste whatever from the time the seed goes into the ground for the growing of the malting barley until the bottle of whiskey, which is the final result, is placed on the table or on the counter before a customer.</P>
    <P>Everything connected with this industry means profit and wealth for the farming community, for their farm workers, for those employed in the distilleries and those engaged in the distribution trade.  In addition to all that, the distilling industry provides a first-class income for the Exchequer. Again, the money which is raked in from it by the Exchequer can be utilised for very beneficial purposes for the community in general.  There can be no question but that the impositions in the Budgets in recent years have been damaging to the industry generally.</P>
    <P>I read in the newspapers recently that the Minister had been congratulated by certain pressure groups, as one might describe them.  They congratulated him on turning the people of this country into a bunch of teetotallers. I have no intention of levelling criticism at those people because everyone is entitled to be in an organisation as long as it is not a secret organisation.  What I do want to say, however, is that I think some <Col N="731" /> of those people should show a little more charity instead of congratulating the Minister on cutting down the consumption of liquor.  I wonder did they consider for a moment that the efforts of the Minister in this regard have thrown many of their comrades, boys and girls throughout the country, out of work and left them on the dole or else put them on the emigrant ship? Now that they have got their way, so far as the Minister is concerned, I think they should show a little more concern for the unfortunate individuals who have lost their means of livelihood. I want to impress on the Minister that he should help in every way possible to try to find an alternative market for Irish whiskey.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency, particularly in the southern portion of the County Roscommon, quite a large number of small farmers there have been growing malting barley for the past 40 years. The land that they utilise for the purpose is not suitable for the growing of wheat.  It is not good land for that purpose.  The farmers I refer to are looked upon as being some of the best tillage farmers in Ireland.  This year, the firms which give them contracts for the growing of malting barley have reduced the contracts by over 50 per cent.  That means a reduction of 50 per cent. in tillage in that area because it will take time before those farmers will be able to change over to an alternative type of tillage.  I believe that the same thing applies in other areas which have been noted for the growing of malting barley.  Therefore, one result of the impositions in recent Budgets will be a reduction of 50 per cent. in the acreage under the growing of malting barley.  That is taking place at a time when appeals are being made, and rightly so, for an increase in the tillage programme.</P>
    <P>I am merely mentioning these things to the Minister.  I do not know what he is going to do about this amendment. I mention them for the purpose of impressing on him that if he is going to stick his heels in the ground with regard to the amendment and not accept it, he must ensure that the distilling industry is not going to suffer, <Col N="732" /> that employment will not decrease and that tillage will not decrease.  I am suggesting that his colleagues and himself in the Government must take immediate steps to ensure that alternative markets be made available for Irish whiskey in other countries, and that the time is ripe for a complete overhaul of the industry so that we can get co-operation amongst the distillers themselves with a view to initiating an energetic drive comparable to that undertaken some years ago by the Scottish distillers when they, more or less, captured the world market.  I am offering that alternative to the Minister because I feel that neither he nor his colleagues would endeavour at any time to destroy the distilling industry.</P>

      <P>I have been rather disappointed with some of the points made in the course of this debate.  We are all anxious to see everything in the garden lovely.  None of us likes to see anybody hurt by taxation, but when I heard the word &ldquo;savagery&rdquo; used and implications made that these impositions were for some purpose other than trying to raise taxation, I was forced to rise and say a few words on this amendment.  There has been a good deal of reference by the Deputies opposite to the Budget of 1952.  They were the people who were responsible for this taxation in 1952.  But now, of course, they are on the opposite side of the House.  I say that they were directly responsible for the taxation that we were forced to impose.  We found ourselves in such a very awkward position in 1952, with our Minister for Finance having to handle a very ugly job, that taxation on spirits and other things had to be increased.  The Minister, and every other Minister, knew very well at that particular period that they had to do some unpopular things.  No Government wants to do that, but the situation was such that we had to put the interests of the country before the interests of our own Party if the economic position of the country were to be put right once again.  We do not want to carry on the policy of expediency that was adopted by the Opposition from time <Col N="733" /> to time.  They may laugh about it but they are very good at mispresenting facts and I have often congratulated them for that.</P>

      <P>As a matter of fact, I am merely answering some of the points that were made already.  We realise thoroughly that anything we have done is essential.  In imposing this taxation we realised that some one was going to be hurt as a result. This matter has been kept under review. I have met a number of representatives and have discussed the matter with them and I have great sympathy for their position.  Nevertheless it is outrageous to have Deputies standing up here and referring to the action taken as savagery, implying that the Minister, a political Party or a Government would dream of taking such a step unless it was a matter of urgency.  A Government must endeavour to pay its way in the same way as the ordinary housekeeper would.  We have to try to clear away the legacy we inherited from the inter-Party Government when they left office.</P>

      <P>In the Budget speech of 1952, at column 1142, Volume 130 of the Official Debates of 2nd April, 1952, the Minister stated in the paragraph dealing with spirits (I do not think I need read the whole paragraph):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" />&ldquo;... Accordingly, the excise duty on home-produced spirits is to be increased by £1 19s. per proof gallon, with corresponding increases in imported spirits.  This will raise the price of whiskey by 6d. per glass, again, as in the case of beer, allowing some margin for the trade.  By this means, I expect to get an additional £1,020,000 this year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the figure Deputy Dr. O'Higgins mentioned as the expectation and that was the figure that the Minister contradicted.  Now let us look at the result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get the net figures.  If the £1,020,000 was divisible as to £700,000 for home-made spirits and £320,000 for imported spirits, I am quite happy with that.  But will the Minister now come along and break down the other figure, because when the Minister was speaking on the Budget this year on the 6th May, 1953, he mentioned the figure for the reduction of the spirits duty receipt as being as much as £1,500,000 short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is home-made and imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us the break-down of that figure because if we want to compare one with the other we must compare like with like?  That is my only point.  If you are going to take the home-made figure solely in one instance, you must also take the home-made figure in the other.  The Minister also produced some figures in regard to drawings from bond for the first three months of the financial year, this year and the three previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> There undoubtedly was some hope this year that the Minister would in his Budget see the error of his ways and repent of what has been described, and correctly described, as the savage imposition that was put on in 1952, even though Deputy Burke does not like that word.  It is a very fair and adequate description and there is no doubt whatever that some part of the 155,000 gallons which have been taken out of bond this year does represent a make-up in stocks where stocks have been allowed to decline because of hope that the Budget would show some relief.  However, it is nonsense to say that the difference involved is purely a difference now between 155,000 gallons and 161,000 gallons in 1951-52. It is purely a nominal difference and trade has gone back to the level of heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Minister has only to go into any licensed premises&mdash;I say that without meaning any improper suggestion&mdash;and he would know, as I would know, if I went in, whether what was taken out of the bottle was as he would like it to be or not.  He would get what he wants now but two years ago he would have found difficulty because the supply of whiskey was on quota and it was not possible to get it because the supply was not there.  Now the supply is there.  Anybody who goes into a licensed premises to buy whiskey now is regarded as such a benefactor by the owner of the premises that he would almost throw his arms around his neck so small are his sales at the present time.  That is perfectly patent to anyone going around the city.  The value of licensed premises has come down in a most startling way.  Profits of the licensed trade are down.  That will hit the Minister again in income-tax and, in respect of those licensed premises that are owned by companies, in corporation profits tax.  It is a very short-sighted policy.  It will mean that the Minister will lose the amount involved in taxation, which on expectation was £1,500,000 on total spirits and, if I may take the same percentages for home-made spirits as the Minister took for expectations, it would be seventenths of £1,500,000, which would be roughly £1,050,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="737" /> That has been the effect so far as the tax is concerned.  There has been a startling effect, as Deputy McQuillan mentioned a moment ago, in regard to contracts for barley.  So far as Kildare is concerned the allocations by the maltsters and distillers to farmers for barley have declined this year in certain cases.  One purchaser of barley for malting purposes is giving a contract for one acre where last year he gave a contract for five acres.  In other areas there is a drop of 55 per cent. In one area in mid-Kildare it is down to 20 per cent. of the area allocated for malting barley last year.  The effect of that will be very substantial.</P>
    <P>This industry, both on the industrial arm and the agricultural arm, gives very good, sound employment.  It seems ridiculous, when we are pampering other industries, that we would knite this one in the back.  The industries which have no protection and no quotas to keep them alive are those we should go out of our way to assist and we should see to it that they will not be taxed out of existence.  That is the only effect of the Minister's impositions last year and the continuation of the increase this year will mean the end of the distilleries, particularly of the smaller distilleries, with consequent substantial unemployment in industry and on the land.</P>
    <P>The Minister should think again on this matter.  He should be honest and admit that his estimates and his expectations of last year were all wrong, that his estimates based on the first three months of this year will not be right.  He should make an effort to save these industries in the only way in which they can be saved, that is, by the reduction of this excise duty.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is strictly relevant but, in view of the comment made by Deputy McQuillan on the policy of the distilleries, perhaps I would be allowed to say that up to a couple of years ago one of the reasons why the distilleries were not able to export or build up an export trade was that the Revenue Commissioners refused to give them export allocations.  Their export allowance was on quota.  It was for the purpose of ensuring that <Col N="738" /> taxation would be kept up here that they were not allowed to export as much as they liked.  Even in one year, the last year in which there was restriction in this way, the delay in the announcement by the Department of Industry and Commerce of the amount which the Government would allow the distilleries to export was of the order of seven months.  As well as I recollect they asked for this information at the beginning of September.  It was the end of February before they got an indication of what the export quotas would be.</P>
    <P>It may have been necessary from the point of view of revenue that the export quota would be reduced but it is not fair, on the one hand, that there should be restriction on the amount that they are allowed to export, as there was in those days, and that then we should come in and hit them for not having exported.</P>
    <P>I shall not quarrel about the restriction on exports.  If there was not enough for our own people it was probably right to restrict exports.  But fair is fair and it is not fair now to accuse those who run the distilleries of sabotaging a national effort, of not having looked after the national interest when, in fact, they were trying to export and the Government Departments concerned, for good and sufficient reasons, were not prepared to allow them to do it.</P>
    <P>When we compare the export possibilities of Irish whiskey with those of Scotch whiskey we seem completely to forget that Irish whiskey has built up a name on potstill distilling and that Scotch whiskey has built up a name on patent still distilling.  While there might be a difference of taste and palate, I am quite sure the members of this House, if offered a choice, would prefer a potstill brew.  We must remember that potstill whiskey requires at least seven years to mature while the patent still whiskey is fit for sale after three years.  It is, therefore, a very much less expensive process to build up substantial stocks of patent still whiskey than to build up the same stocks of potstill whiskey. The Scotch distillers are in the lucky <Col N="739" /> position that they have to carry heavy stocks for export for only three years. It is comparatively easy to foresee how a foreign market may go in three years.  It is almost impossible to estimate how a foreign market may go after seven years.  If the Irish potstill distilleries are to build up a stock for export seven to ten years hence it is very little encouragement if there is the risk that the export market may then be gone and the double risk that, in addition, the home market is seriously declining and is being driven down.</P>
    <P>By attacking the home market in the way that the Minister did in his 1952 Budget he also prevented any possibility of escape for the distillers by building up stocks for the export market.  It was an unwise course of procedure in 1952.  We said so then. Time has shown that our prognostications at that time were right.  The Minister would get just as much revenue by reduced taxation.  That would not really affect the person who indulges to excess.  It is the person who drinks a limited amount who has had to suffer during the past 12 months. He ought for their sake and for the sake of the workers in the industry to have another look at this matter and go back to where we were, with beneficial results to the pocket of the revenue as well as to everyone else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputies who have listened to the discussions we have had here or who have interested themselves in this matter of the spirits tax must realise that there could not be the clamant criticism throughout the trade outside this House in every part of the country unless there was something very seriously wrong.  I would like to remind the Minister that at the moment the bottle of whiskey which is sold at something around 36/- or 37/- a bottle carries taxation to the total of 22/- a bottle.  In other words by successive taxation we have now reached a stage in this country where one of the most famous of our own native products is taxed by our own native Government to almost 75 per cent. of its cost.  Now <Col N="740" /> that is a very serious situation.  The whiskey industry in this country.  I suppose, is now about 100 years old.</P>
      <P>It was only some 30 or 40 years ago that we had a number of quite famous distilleries in the country.  Through actions of successive Governments&mdash; and I am not suggesting for one moment that the entire condition of the industry is due completely to the action of the present Minister&mdash;the number of distilling units in the country is now a mere handful and can be numbered on the fingers of one hand. Throughout the last 30 or 40 years this industry has dwindled and dwindled and dwindled, and now the stage has been reached where there is a last ditch fight by those engaged in the production of Irish whiskey, not against Scotch distillers, not against Canadian distillers, not against rye whiskey from the United States of America, but against an Irish Government and an Irish Minister.  I do think that that calls for some active consideration by Deputies in this House.  I am not endeavouring to urge a particular case on the Minister on behalf of the particular distilling units.  The ramifications of any old-established industry in this country are wide.  Those who are being injured at the moment are not merely the producers of the whiskey but there are many thousands of others who directly or indirectly are engaged and interested in this Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 13,000 publicans in the country, 13,000 publicans who have as much right to live and to earn their livelihood in this country as anyone else, 13,000 publicans who are very seriously affected by this taxation.  In addition there are many thousands of persons employed in the licensed trade who have their employment seriously jeopardised by anything which affects the trade.  I am not in a position to give figures, but the Minister may have the figures, and I am quite certain that the employment of many assistants in the licensed trade in this city has disappeared in the last 12 or 18 months. There is in addition the very high employment content in the distillation of potstill whiskey itself.  I know that in my own constituency or rather in the Midlands the number of persons <Col N="741" /> employed in two local distilleries has been reduced by well over 75 per cent. in the last 12 months.  In addition there is also the fact that with booming conditions in the whiskey trade there is a vast employment content in the distributive section of the business that has been very seriously affected in the last 12 months or so.  I mention these matters because a suggestion was made, which I thought myself an extremely unfair suggestion, on the Second Reading of this debate when I raised this particular matter, by Deputies in this House that anything was good enough for the distillers, that they had their golden days and now it was good enough if they have to suffer.  It is very wrong if we should approach matters of such importance from that narrow bigoted point of view.  The facts are that we in this amendment are fighting not merely for the primary producers of whiskey but also for the livelihood of thousands and thousands of inoffensive citizens in this country.</P>
    <P>When I mention these matters I do not want anyone to think that our case for this amendment can be confined merely to its effect on employment. There is no industry as important as the whiskey industry, which is native to the country, which has grown up with the country and which started off a new world-famed drink and which could not have grown to the importance it has attained unless all the raw materials were available here at home; and the parlous condition of the whiskey industry at the moment is reflected by the position of the agricultural industry in the Midlands.  Around the distilling units in the Midlands there has grown up a very fine tradition of the growing of malting barley.  In the Counties of Kildare, Carlow, Leix, and Offaly and even up as far as Roscommon there is a traditional policy engaged in by the farmers of the Midlands who depend on the malting barley crop as a cash crop vitally associated with the production of whiskey.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I might emphasise, in practically opening the discussion on this amendment, because we had not progressed very far on the previous day, that this amendment, while it sets up a consultative committee for each local authority is an amendment which discloses very nakedly what we were trying to get the Minister to realise, or even admit, when discussing the previous amendment, that is, that the only person who has any functions in the administration of health matters, the only person who will have any overriding functions in the administration of this Bill under a local authority, is the county manager and that the elected representatives on the county council will have no power at all, except in relation to particular things to which the Minister rather indelicately drew attention when he said that they will have power in a most elaborate way to direct that something will be done under Section 29 of the County Management Act.</P>
      <P>I referred on a previous occasion to Section 16 of that Act which deals with reserved functions for the local authority, and I think I established very clearly that, under no heading of the reserved functions indicated in the Second Schedule, had the elected body any detailed function in relation to the administration of health legislation. The Minister drew attention to Section 29 under which, if a county council require a particular thing to be done, they can use a certain number of bulldozing propositions contained in the section, which would involve two meetings of the county council and perhaps a mandamus from the Minister to get a thing done; but I set that completely aside as an ordinary part of administrative machinery, and, setting that aside, I say that there is no statutory provision which gives any power to the elected members of a local authority to interfere in any way with the administration of health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, the policy is going to be <Col N="743" /> directed from the Minister when the Minister sees that the situation in the country is ripe enough for him to dictate policy, and, when that is done, the only function the elected members will have will be to examine the cost and strike the rate and then the Minister has power even to override the local authority and have a rate struck.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It deals with consultative health committees, and at column 2171 of the Dáil Debates of Thursday, 25th June last, introducing the amendment, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As I have said, the local consultative committee will be purely advisory to the county manager and it will be appointed by each local authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This revelation, if you like, to people who have been rather bemused or misled by the Minister's statement on the previous amendments and who thought that the elected representatives had some function in relation to the administration of health matters, will enable them to realise.  I think, from that statement that the consultative committee which is elaborately arranged for here will be an advisory committee, but advisory to the county manager.</P>
      <P>Again, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The committee, of course, will be purely advisory to the county manager&mdash;not to the county council &mdash;and the manager will have his functions, whatever these functions may be.  The committee will have the right to meet at certain times.  They will have the right to call a meeting or to have a meeting called at certain times, subject to certain limitations, but the county council can have a meeting of this advisory committee called at any time they like. If they think that anything should be investigated or that any of the actions of the county manager require to be investigated or considered, then they are in a position to make a report to the county council on anything they may find.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> But if they do investigate, even at the request of the county council, and make a report to the county council on anything they may find, the county council have no power under this Act to interfere in any way with the administration of the Act by the manager, no matter what the advisory committee may recommend or suggest.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks that Section 29 of the County Management Act, 1940 is any help in the matter, I suggest he should read that section again.  It sets out that if the county council is dissatisfied with regard to anything which they want the manager to do they can hold a meeting and pass a resolution.  If they pass such a resolution, the county manager will distribute copies of it to the members of the county council and they shall hold another meeting.  If they decide that they require the county manager to do something, the manager will be required to do it, unless the county manager says: &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; in which circumstances it becomes a matter for the Minister.  I suggest again to the Minister that he ought to be straightforward in stating categorically here that the local authority have no function in relation to this Bill, except that of collecting the rates from the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>When discussing this matter on the previous day, I was putting it to the Minister that we were in favour of a consultative advisory committee such as this, but that it was very hard to see how they can implement their function, if I may put it that way.  This advisory body can be summoned, according to the Minister, by the county council to have a meeting at any time and it can send a report to the county council.  At column 2173 the Minister goes so far as to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...if they think that the county manager has been unreasonable, or, if you like, impertinent or in any way offensive to the committee, of course <Col N="745" /> they will naturally raise the matter at the county council meeting and they will ventilate any grievance they may have there.  I do not think it will be necessary to do anything beyond that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We appreciate that.  The position now is that you have a consultative advisory council who are to give the county manager advice.  The county manager need not accept the advice.  That is all right; we do not dispute that.  The county manager, apparently, is accepted now as the health authority. The position is that an advisory council to be effective must be in a position to force their arguments home, so to speak.  If the advisory council advise the manager and they think the manager has been unreasonable, the matter is returned to the county council and there will be a meeting of the county council on the subject.  It may be ventilated in the public Press, but they have no executive authority whatsoever. That is the whole point which appears to arise here.  The county council, according to the County Management Act&mdash;I am not holding the Minister responsible for that law which exists&mdash;have no executive authority whatever.  That really nullifies the force of this advisory council.</P>
    <P>We place a good deal of stress on the advisory council because we think advisory councils or any other such bodies are a great advantage in State medical services in order to maintain the freedom of the individual.  In effect, however, they can only offer advice to the county manager.  If he does not accept the advice they cannot object.  They can bring the matter before the county council and the county council can discuss it, but the advisory council have no executive authority and therefore their authority is really nil.  That is what we are asking the Minister to explain.  We are not accusing the Minister of being responsible for the present state of affairs.  We appreciate the fact that the Minister is introducing the principle of a local advisory council and we welcome that, but we cannot see that there will be any real benefit from the advisory council as matters stand at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> I asked the Minister the last day if he would give instances of some cases, hypothetical cases, if he liked, in which the advisory council might advise the manager to do so-and-so and how the thing would work out.  That is the position now.  They simply can give advice, but the county manager need not accept the advice and they have really no way of voicing their grievance other than through the county council. The county council have no authority to support them.  They can only strike the rate.  That brings us back to the position we have been discussing all through this Bill and I should like the Minister to make a statement to clear up the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended that these consultative councils will have any function in relation to the voluntary health institutions?  Will they have any advisory or executive functions as part of the health institutions being used in the health scheme or will the proposition be accepted at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an advisory council and has no executive functions.  It is called an advisory council and it is purely advisory.  There is no more than that in it.  If the local authority, which is the health authority, as this does not prove that the county manager is the health authority, want to set up a sub-committee of their own, they are at liberty to do so, but they must set up this advisory council.  As I pointed out here, it can make itself felt by publicity; that is all.  It cannot make itself felt by executive action because, if it could, it would not be an advisory council but an executive committee.  It only purports to be an advisory council; that is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bringing in this propaganda which Deputy Mulcahy is so fond of bringing in&mdash;he was the father of the county manager system&mdash;about the county manager and so on will not help in this discussion.  I explained that a County Management Bill is coming along which will, I believe, define more precisely what powers the county manager will have and what the local authority will have, and there will be an opportunity then, if the Party opposite are more liberal than they were when they were <Col N="747" /> in Government about giving more power to the local authorities, of making that suggestion.  I do not see what purpose is being served by this attempt on behalf of Deputy Mulcahy to father the county management system on me or on this Government considering that it was he who brought this in first in the City Management Act for Dublin.  Could he not leave that aside and deal with the Bill in a serious way?  Then we might make some headway.  There is no use in trying to read into this amendment anything but that the council's function will be that of an advisory body and that is all it is meant to be.</P>

It may be no harm to have a consultative committee of this type. It will give some kind of a group looking in over the shoulder of the manager and the shoulders of those who are carrying out the work.  It is not the kind of statute that we should be passing here dealing with lives and health which is so intimately connected with individual lives and personalities. This is particularly so when the position is that the Bill is being brought in with a certain amount of cloud over it from the moral point of view and with indefinite opposition from the organised medical profession.</P>

      <P>I was endeavouring to get that.  The Minister very rightly said that this committee is purely an advisory committee, and as I was pointing out, the matters on which they can give advice are limited by the amendment itself.  The Minister says in the amendment that they can report to the county councils, but the county councils have no more power than the advisory committee itself. The county council has not even the status conferred on it that this committee will have of acting even as an advisory committee.  It can nominate a number of its own members, not fewer than four, on the committee. The Minister says the committee will <Col N="753" /> have the advantage of publicity and that they can use the county council for that purpose.  Is that going to work out in practice?  If it were to work out in practice, is it something that we all desire&mdash;that the only way in which publicity can be obtained for the views of the consultative advisory committee is by way of a public conflict between the county council and the manager?  That is the only way in which the publicity to which the Minister refers can be obtained.  I doubt if that is even advisable.  I want to make it as clear as I can that my understanding of this measure&mdash;and if I am wrong I shall be thankful to anybody who will put me right; I do not pretend, like some people in this House, to be infallible on everything that is introduced here&mdash;is that there is only one authority and that that is the county manager.</P>

Since the advent of the County Management Act &mdash;and it has been 12 years in operation now&mdash;the very same authority has been operating the health services, so far as almost 50 per cent. of the population of the country are concerned, as will operate this Bill when it becomes an Act.  There was not a word, not a single word, from the leader of the Opposition, Deputy Mulcahy, with regard to the manner in which these services were being operated.  He was not the slightest bit concerned with the interests of that 50 per cent., the poorer sections of the community.</P>

      <P>I repeat that not one single question was asked.  Hypocritical is not a sufficiently strong word to apply to the attitude of Deputy Mulcahy on this Bill.  He wants to know who is going to administer this Bill when it becomes an Act or who will administer the health services in future, but he never thought of asking a question for the last dozen years as to who was administering the health services for 50 per cent. or more of the population who happened to be the poorest section of the community.</P>
      <P>There is one matter arising out of the amendment to which I should like to call the Minister's attention and, if it is possible to do so, I should like if he would bring in an amendment on the Report Stage to deal with it.  I refer to the proposal that not less than four members of the council should be appointed to this committee.  I want to suggest that such members of the council should be elected or selected for the committee through the system of proportional representation, because it will give general satisfaction.</P>

There <Col N="755" /> is no doubt but that this amendment setting up a health committee will be of advantage.  There has been a lot of talk about the county manager having absolute control, as if the county council were not in existence or as if the manager could function without the council of a county.  An effort has been made to put that view across to the country for quite a while now.  The Fine Gael Party are only echoing what has been said by other organised groups in the country but Deputies here should know, and Deputy Mulcahy knows it well, that the county manager cannot function without the council of a county.  He knows that the council of a county have the right in law to provide the moneys for any particular service and they can determine in what way these moneys will be spent.  They have also the determining voice in respect to each individual item, each individual service for which they provide money.  They are all-powerful in that respect.  They can override the manager in every single instance if they so will.</P>

      <P>I wonder how we ever got as far as Section 44?  I suppose we had the same argument on every section. So far as I heard Deputy Mulcahy, on every section he spoke about the county managers.  I just want to say that the county manager under this Bill or any other Act, cannot operate without the county council or the local authority. They can determine policy in respect to every single section in the Bill because they are going to provide the money for it.  I hope the Minister will consider bringing in an amendment on a later stage of the Bill to provide that the nominees of the local authority on this committee will be elected by the system of proportional representation.</P>

      <P>Before dealing with a number of matters arising on this amendment I should like, lest I forget, to endorse the suggestion made by Deputy Allen as to the method which could be used in regard to the election of the four members by the council to the consultative committees which are to be chosen by the county councils.  I have no intention of discussing the merits or demerits of the County Management Acts or even of attempting to discuss who was responsible for these Acts.  I think, however, we have to face up to the situation that this Bill widens very considerably the powers that the county managers have. It increases their functions very considerably. I suppose it is very hard to avoid that in any extended system of medical services but I think we should take every step we can to prevent this widening and increase of powers of county managers from being abused&mdash; from becoming a dangerous form of bureaucratic dictatorship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that it is easy to say that county managers will behave reasonably, that they will be subject to public criticism and that that will act as a brake to ensure their reasonableness.  Unfortunately, however, I think the experience is, as it generally is with human nature, that when a person gets certain functions and certain powers that are unchecked, the tendency is to use these powers very fully and to resent criticism.  I think that members of the Government &mdash;not necessarily of the present Government but of any Government&mdash; resent criticism even though, God knows, the whole political system is devised to ensure that political criticism will be forthcoming on every political issue.  Therefore, I think it is certainly of value to have these consultative committees, but I think that some more specific powers might have been given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions and duties of county managers have been increased very considerably in recent years, not merely by this legislation, but by other legislation also.  This particular legislation will increase them still further. Would it not be advisable to have the health services administered in the county or county borough by a specially appointed officer who would deal with health services and nothing else?  The county manager already has a tremendous number of duties of a varied nature to perform&mdash;the administration of the finances of the county, the question of roads, the maintenance of institutions, rate collection, and so forth.  When these health services are in operation they will entail a tremendous amount of additional administrative work.  I think the Minister should consider whether better results will not be achieved by making provision for the appointment of a special officer who would, in effect, be director of medical services in the county and who would be responsible directly to the council for the administration of the health services in that particular area.  By all means leave the county manager with his general powers in regard to expenditure, and so forth, but I think there <Col N="758" /> would be a good deal to be said for having the medical services administered by a specially appointed officer rather than by the county manager who is already overburdened with a considerable amount of work.  I would ask the Minister to consider that position and examine it carefully himself.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I should like to raise concerns the composition of the consultative health committees.  I know that, apart from the four members who are to be elected by the county council, the county medical officer and the county surgeon will also be members of the committee.  I appreciate fully the reasons that prompted the Minister to include these two medical officers as members of the committee.  Is it not, however, creating rather a difficult position? You will have a consultative committee whose function will be, according to the Minister, to criticise and voice public criticism, if needs be, in regard to the manner in which the health services are administered.  These two officers will, at the same time, be paid officials of the council and under the control and jurisdiction of the manager. Will they be free agents, and will they feel themselves free to criticise their boss, their chief, who is the county manager, as if they were outsiders?  I can see a certain amount of difficulty there.  I appreciate fully the reasons why the Minister included them on the committee.  He felt they should be members of the committee. I should be more inclined to suggest that they should be officers of the consultative committee rather than members of it.  I suggest to the Minister that the members of the committee should, in no sense, be paid officials of the council or officers of the council.  By all means make provisions whereby the county medical officer of health and the county surgeon will be officers of the committee, if you like, who will attend meetings of the committee and be able to supply information and to answer questions.  I wonder, however, if it is wise to make them members of the committee?  I think this is a matter that the Minister should consider.  Probably he has <Col N="759" /> already considered it to a certain extent.  It is making rather a dangerous precedent whereby paid officials, in effect, are placed on the committee whose function it is to criticise the services administered by the council.</P>
    <P>I also feel that the county medical officer of health and the county surgeon might not feel themselves as free to voice their criticism as some persons who are not in the employment of the council and who are not subject to the control of the county manager.  I know that in a great many cases no difficulty of that kind will arise but the position in regard to legislation is that we have to legislate not only for the normal course of events but also for the exceptional circumstances.  I would like the Minister to examine the provisions covering the composition of these committees, not in the light of what will happen in 90 per cent. of the cases but in the light of the situations that might arise in 10 per cent. where any kind of conflict develops between the county manager and the consultative committee.  Presumably the function of the committee is to decide as to the essential health services.  Otherwise, it would be of no value to have such a committee.  Paragraph (d) of sub-section (3) also provides for the appointment of two doctors nominated by a body which, in the opinion of the council, is representative of the medical practitioners in the country.  Again I appreciate what the Minister is trying to do, but I wonder if the position is sufficiently clearly set out in the section.  How will the council decide that?  Is the council the best body to decide that?  I do not know how many organisations there are which embody medical practitioners at the moment, but should there be three or four, five or six different organisations at some future date, I could see that some difficulty would arise on the part of the county council in deciding which of them should be taken as representative of the medical profession in the county, particularly if there were any kind of political issue.</P>
    <P>As for sub-section (4), this is the sub-section which provides when the consultative committee shall meet.  It <Col N="760" /> provides, first of all, that the consultative committee shall meet when requested by the council or by the manager.  That is fair enough.  It then provides that, subject to sub-section (5), it shall meet at such other times as the committee may determine. That throws us on to an examination of sub-section (5).  Sub-section (5) is extraordinary in that it limits the number of meetings to six in the year. Is that wise?  Why limit the meetings of the consultative committee to six in the year?  I do not imagine the consultative committee will want to meet more often than is necessary.  If the consultative committee is doing useful work, why not let them meet once a month; why not let them meet once a week, even; it might be convenient to have them meet once a week.  I think the experience in England is that a lot of the local health committees do extremely valuable work, voluntary work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will we not have the health committee operating here as distinct from the consultative committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment I am discussing this health committee.  I do not see why they should be prevented from meeting more often than six times a year.  It seems an unnecessary limit to impose, unless there is some very good reason for imposing it.  The mere fact that you set up a committee and then tell it: &ldquo;You are forbidden to meet more than six times a year&rdquo;, is starting off on the wrong footing.  I would urge the Minister to drop that provision and let them use common sense as to how often to meet. If they are difficult cranks, irrational people, they should not be on the committee; but if you have a committee charged with responsibility of this kind it is to be assumed that they are reasonable and rational and will not want to meet more often than is necessary for the purpose of fulfilling their function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next sub-section, sub-section (6), is one that also needs attention. Indeed, it seems hard to reconcile it with the statement the Minister made, that while these committees had <Col N="761" /> no power they had at least the power of publicity and in that way they could ventilate grievances and protect the interests of the public by means of publicity.  Sub-section (6) provides that every meeting of the consultative health committee shall be held in private.  I could quite well understand that these committees would normally meet in private, but I do not think that I would include a provision of that kind in the Bill.  Again, I would give complete freedom to the committee as to whether it should meet in private or in public.  I do not think that daylight and a bit of fresh air is any harm if criticism is to be levelled.  The function of these committees, as the Minister told us, is to act as a curb on any undemocratic tendencies by means of publicity. If the committee is prevented from meeting in public, it is hard to see how it can serve any useful function in that direction.  I am quite certain that 95 per cent. of the time the committee will probably meet in private.  I would leave that to the discretion of the committee.</P>
    <P>I make these suggestions not by way of destructive criticism but rather to indicate to the Minister a number of things he should look into very carefully.  I think these are matters which deserve consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make just a few observations in regard to the working of this machinery.  It is necessary to have some practical knowledge of health affairs either in a city or in a county, to understand really how this machinery will work. In Dublin Corporation we have a public health committee&mdash;all the members are on it&mdash;and we have a very considerable amount of work to-do, but we find we can do it by meeting regularly one day in the month. We never had any difficulty with the city manager.  The city medical officer of health attends the meeting with officials and every problem that comes before us is considered.  Whatever our views are, they are adopted, so that in practice there is no difficulty at all in the working of the machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I try to keep myself informed as to what is happening in the different <Col N="762" /> counties, particularly right across the whole of the Midlands.  I read the local papers every week and I am in pretty close touch with what is reported, at least, of the activities of the local councils down the country. I think we have reached the stage where the members of local authorities have much more power in practice than they are supposed to have in theory.  That is my experience as a member of a local council.  I can see that this consultative council will meet very infrequently.  Certainly, as far as Dublin is concerned, I do not see very many reasons why it should operate at all.  However, the Minister has endeavoured to meet some point by the provision of these consultative councils.  They may fulfil a useful function during a certain stage of evolution in the machinery of our health services.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride referred to his experience of people who gain a certain amount of power and who resent criticism.  We realise there are people like that.  In my experience in relation to Dublin, as far as the city manager is concerned&mdash;and he has most extensive powers&mdash;he is a very sensible man and he does not exercise any of these powers without consultation with the city council, the housing committee, the health committee, the town planning committee or some committee.  Although in theory one can say that he has tremendous power, in practice he does what the elected representatives of the local authority require.  That is a stage in evolution in so far as county managers are concerned.</P>
    <P>In a couple of counties in the past, we had a type of manager of whom Deputy MacBride says he has had personal experience, the type that resents criticism or even advice from the other members of the local authority.  That day has passed and at the moment one would have difficulty in getting that type of manager. If one had a county manager always ready to fly in the face of his local council, the position would be very unsatisfactory.  In 99 per cent. of the cases at the moment, there is no friction and the 1 per cent. can always be dealt with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> This question of the county manager and the local authority is bound to give rise to a good deal of discussion as to which is the best machine for progress.  If society endeavours to improve medical services for the community generally it is a neat question as to whether the county manager will do the work more quickly than the local councils, bodies which are apt to raise questions of expenditure, rates, and this, that and the other. When it is a matter of life and death and health generally the question of whether or not any action taken will increase the rates by one-tenth of a penny ought not to enter into the discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister is here making provision to meet some objections raised.  Anyone who has any experience of the actual working of the machinery of local government can see whether this provision can operate and function, for the time being at any rate, in a satisfactory manner.  I see nothing wrong in principle in the county medical officer of health or the county surgeon being asked to sit on a consultative committee.  I do not think that because a person is a paid servant he cannot have a voice and cannot explain his views.  The point has been made that the county medical officer of health would be afraid to express his views because they might conflict with the views of the county manager.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>These two officers might feel they could not express their own views or that, if they did express them, that might prejudice their position. Having had practical experience I have no fear of that.  At the moment everything is discussed and debated on a man-to-man basis.  The meetings are held in secret.  No members of the Press are present and the result is that the elected representatives and the county medical officer for health are able to express their views quite freely. No sensible person could have any fears as a result of a discussion of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this section in the way <Col N="764" /> it is being discussed here we are raising hares.  Generally speaking, the views of the elected representatives prevail in the long run.  The Minister has pointed out that there is on the stocks at the moment a Bill to amend the County Management Act.  A former Bill for that purpose had gone a good distance here before the change of Government.  With our experience since, it is possible that any defects which may appear here will be removed when the proposed new Bill becomes law.  This amendment has been put in for the purpose of meeting the viewpoint that there should be this type of consultative committee.  Because of that I think we ought now to accept it and get the Bill passed into law as quickly as possible.  The longer we hold it up the more we may endanger the life of some individual. That would be poor satisfaction to those members who do not like this Bill, who want to obstruct it in every possible way and keep it from being passed into law as long as they possibly can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one point in relation to the composition of these committees.  In paragraph (a) it is provided that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;not less than four members of the council of the county...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it wise to insist that the four members elected by the county council should actually be members of that council?  Why not leave it to the discretion of the county council?  Some member of the county council with long experience of public administration may retire or not be re-elected; the county council might decide that because of his long experience and particular knowledge of some aspect of the council's working they would like to have him on the consultative committee. If the members of the committee must be members of the county council that provision might easily debar a number of very useful people. I suggest it should be left to the discretion of the county council to appoint any four members they like.  Let them choose I can see cases where there would be a very strong argument for having some person who is not a member of the county council but who has <Col N="765" /> special qualifications and a wide experience having worked on a county council for many years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan has shown one thing anyway, that he has experience in regard to the working of health cases in the past.  That is what some of the members opposite very seriously lack and, indeed, show in their speeches.  Deputy Cowan has given his views on how these various councils and consultative bodies may be expected to get on under this Bill as the councils have got on in the past. I am sure that all are glad to have the benefit of his experience and his opinion of how things are likely to work out.  Deputy Allen, who has also experience for many years in regard to these health cases, would, I think, largely bear out Deputy Cowan. Deputy Allen truly said that whatever may be the functions of the local authority and the county managers they are not being changed by this Bill.  These functions have been there for the last 12 years.  I never had any complaint.  As Minister for Health for one year before and two years now, I never got a complaint from any member of the Fine Gael Party.  I do not know whether I should put it that they are more interested now because a different class of people are coming in.</P>

      <P>I only want to know why this barrage is being raised.  Is it because a different class of people is being brought in or is it because some political stunt is being inaugurated for the purpose?  When Deputy MacBride was speaking I took a few notes.  As far as I could see he was the first member on the opposite benches who had read the amendment.  We had a couple of days' discussion by some of the other members opposite, and as far as I could see they had not read the amendment at all.  At least Deputy MacBride read the amendment because he took it line by line and gave his views.  If we had that type of discussion on this amendment from the beginning instead of the political manæuvring of Deputy Mulcahy and the rest of them we might have got somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride says that this widens the power of the county manager. <Col N="767" /> Again, he says that the function and powers of the county manager are vastly increased.  I must say that I cannot see that.  This Bill is brought in to deal with health matters.  Whatever are the powers of the local authority and whatever are the powers of the county manager they are not being changed so far as this Bill is concerned.  That is settled by the County Management Act and they will each learn what their own part of the business is under the Act but not under this Bill.  I am not finding fault with Deputy MacBride.  He may have a point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I be permitted to explain what I mean?  Say that it costs £4,000,000 per year to administer it.  That is £4,000,000 more of services that the county manager will have to administer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you put it that way, the county manager will have £4,000,000 more to spend and, therefore, he will have more power.  There is something in that, but the local council will have £4,000,000 more to distribute.  Therefore, they will have more powers.  I take it that the matter will go <i>pari passu.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a real gentleman. Deputy MacBride advocates a specially qualified officer because the county manager has too much administrative work.  When I was setting out on this Bill in the begininng, I had the same opinion and I was inclined to have an executive officer especially for health <Col N="768" /> purposes.  By discussing this matter with the Department of Local Government who have a fair amount of knowledge of the subject and by making what inquiries I could, I came to the conclusion that the county manager, so far as his functions are concerned, could administer the health services as well as the local government services. It would not be fair to have another person appointed at an additional salary and that expense put on the local authority.  For that reason it was not done.  I can assure Deputy MacBride that the matter got very full consideration.  If the business of the local authorities grows, we may come to the point where it will be necessary to have an executive officer for local government matters and another for health.  I think we should not do that at the moment.  We should let things go for a while to see how they may pan out.</P>
      <P>It is true, as Deputy MacBride points out, that the function of the advisory committee we are dealing with is to advise on and criticise the manner in which the health services are administered.  He goes on to say that that being so he thinks it is hardly advisable to have officials such as county surgeons and medical officers of health on this advisory committee. That is a point of view too.  I must say, again, that in the beginning I was rather averse to the inclusion of any official on the committee.  I thought it was rather an anomalous position to have a paid member of the council on this advisory committee sitting beside county councillors and others and criticising their own work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was then put to me that if they were only present as officials they would not have the same right to interfere, as it were, in the discussions and that they might be slow to interfere unless they were asked to interfere on any particular issue.  I came to the conclusion that in an advisory committee of this kind it would be well to have a few officers at least who would be familiar with the working of the health services and who would be in a position to voice their opinion and, perhaps, have an opportunity of putting a point of view which they had <Col N="769" /> already put to the county manager and got nowhere.  They can put that point of view to this advisory committee and in that way may have some good idea adopted.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to say, of course, which way is the better, whether it is better to exclude the officials from any committee of this kind or to include them.  I can quite see the point of view either way, but at any rate we came down on the side of including them.  The inclusion of these particular officials is in the scheme now, and I would say that, on the whole, we should let it have a trial on that basis.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy MacBride's point that we should not have put in the words &ldquo;not less than four members of the committe&rdquo;, may I say this?  The committee is to consist of ten.  We are only, as it were, nominating eight out of the ten.  There will be four county councillors, two medical men from the county, the county surgeon and the county medical officer of health.  There are two places left. That was purposely done so that the county council could put on one or two people whom it thought would be useful on this advisory body, who were not members of the county council, and who were not doctors.  It is free, at least, to put these two extra people on.  It may be argued, of course, that that is not giving the council sufficient scope but, on the whole, I think it is. It will have the opportunity of nominating one or two very useful people.</P>
    <P>We had the difficulty, of course, that Deputy MacBride referred to, that, if you were to select two medical officers from the county, the council might have some difficulty in selecting them.  The medical men of the county who will be taking part in these health services, whether as dispensary doctors or in other sections of the health services, would probably like to be officially represented through their own organisation.  That is why it is put in that the council would take two medical practitioners nominated by the organisation which represents medical practitioners.  Under present circumstances we might, perhaps, have said &ldquo;the county medical association&rdquo;, <Col N="770" /> but you never know&mdash;there might be a split and there might be two organisations in the county.  In that case the council would be at sea to know what it should do.  I think that the simplest thing to do is to say that the council will take them from whatever organisation is, in its opinion, representative of the medical men of the county.  I am afraid we will have to leave it to the council to decide, although I can see Deputy MacBride's point.  If there was a split, the council would, perhaps, not be the best body to decide, but then can we say who would be?  I think we will have to leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether he considered the possibility of having someone representing the nurses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, but we did not want to have this body too big.  The whole trouble is that if you had a big advisory council it would, in my opinion, be useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride raised another point with regard to the six meetings in the year.  I do not think it will be necessary for an advisory council like this to meet more than once every two months or so.  If, for any reason, it is required to meet for some special investigation or consider some special recommendation which might require more than one meeting, the council can, by a resolution, settle that.  That will make it all right as far as the meetings are concerned, or if, on the other hand, the county manager is a man of the type described by Deputy Cowan, that is a man who is very anxious to get advice, well he can call them together as often as he likes. The only thing we want to avoid here is that four members of the council who are perhaps in a minority and who are trying to push some certain idea that the majority do not agree with, will have the power to call meetings at any time they like.  If they had that power they could make it nearly impossible for the other six members to attend as often as they might like to have meetings.  That is why some limit has to be put on the number of meetings to be held.  You <Col N="771" /> have the same idea in the case of the central consultative council that meetings cannot be held oftener than a certain number of times in the year. I think, therefore, it is necessary to put some limit to the number of meetings that may be called in that way.</P>
    <P>The meetings are to be held in private.  I think that a body like this is not going to do good work unless it meets in private.  I think that we have only to listen to the debates here to realise that.  You might have a member like, say, Deputy Mulcahy, who would like to attack the county manager for political kudos, and who would like to have the Press present for the purpose.  No good work would be done if you had a member of that kind.</P>
    <P>The only way to muzzle a man of that type is to have the meetings in private.  I think that if you want to get work done, therefore, these meetings should be held in private.  As I have mentioned already, if there is a good sustainable case to be made the members of the council who are members of the county council will, I am sure, be impressed by it, and if they think that something should be reported to the county council they are in a position to do so.  In that case, publicity will be given to anything that may be reported.</P>
    <P>A point was raised by Deputy Dr. Browne as to whether this council would have any function in regard to voluntary hospitals with which a council may have agreements.  It would, of course, in this way, that if there were any complaint that a voluntary hospital, with which a local authority had a contract for sending its patients to, that would come before this advisory council and be discussed.  If a member had any question to raise of that kind he could raise it at the meeting and get whatever explanation or evidence was available from the county manager and the officials present, such as the county surgeon, have it discussed and see whether there was any justification for the complaint or not.</P>
    <P>I do not think there was anything else arising out of this discussion that <Col N="772" /> was purely related to the amendment that I need deal with.  I know that we had quite a lot of a discussion on points that were not related to the amendment but which might properly be raised if the County Management Act ever came up for discussion.  I have said already that I do not know exactly what is in the County Management Act except in a rough way, but I do know that as far as this Government are concerned they are certainly going to go further than the Coalition Government proposed to go by giving wider powers to the local authorities.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the House that, in my opinion, the establishment of this consultative committee will go a long way towards meeting the wishes of the Irish Medical Association in their quest for the establishment of regional councils such as obtain in England for the working of the Health Act.  I consider that these consultative committees, such as we propose to establish here, will be even more effective than the regional councils at the other side, for the reason that their members will be more <i>au fait</i> with local conditions.  I think there is an unfounded fear abroad that these consultative committees will result in the county managers being a bit dictatorial.  I cannot imagine that particularly in regard to health matters. I have never found him asserting authority unduly in matters of this kind.  I had cause to consult him on many occasions and he had cause to consult me on many occasions; there are times when he is in consultation with the medical officer of health, the county surgeon or the county physician and I have no reason to believe that he is dictatorial in this connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of paid officials being members of this consultative committee is rather a difficult one but I cannot see how that can be avoided.  I believe that if critcism even of their own duties came up at meetings of the <Col N="773" /> consultative committee, they would appreciate more their being criticised in their presence than behind their backs.  The question of paid officials being on this consultative committee is absolutely inseparable from the successful functioning of the committee.</P>

      <P>There is the question of the appointment of two other registered medical practitioners.  It occurred to me when Deputy MacBride was speaking that the selection of these two medical practitioners should be left to the county medical association. There seems to be more fear surrounding that selection.  I do not think it is necessary to meet the devil half way in this regard.  I cannot imagine anybody visualising two county medical associations.  It is pretty far-fetched.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> When one considers that over 90 per cent. of the county medical officers of health, county surgeons, and so forth, are members of the county association, it can be safely and wisely left to that association to make a suitable selection.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the objection to the committee meeting six times a year.  The explanation the Minister has given is quite reasonable. I would not imagine that they should meet oftener unless in times of unusual difficulty or unless something unusual arises.  The fact of the meetings being private rather surprised me at first.  There is a lot to be said against it and a lot to be said in favour of it. Personally I would be in favour of meetings being held in public unless conditions warranted otherwise or some particular subject for discussion would justify the meeting being held in private.</P>

      <P>In the present circumstances and under the present local government code practically every county manager in the country will welcome the setting up of a consultative committee.  My criticism, however, would be much the same as Deputy MacBride's.  The amendment here says that the consultative health committee will advise the county manager on the general administration and general operation of this Act and the Principal Act.  My criticism would be with regard to the actual membership of the consultative committee. If I am to interpret the Minister's remarks properly, he is himself quite satisfied with the representation on the health committee, but most of us will agree that the weight of membership should be in favour of the elected representatives of the people.  I cannot see at all why the county medical officer of health for a county should be a member of the council.  Some weeks ago when we were in the initial stages of the debate on the Committee Stage many members in the House&mdash;and especially members on the Government side, including the Minister, who also fell into it&mdash;pointed out that in actual fact it would be the county medical officer of health who would <Col N="775" /> administer the health affairs of the county.  I think that is the practice to a very large extent at the present time. While I am not a member of a local body I know that the county medical officer of health has the very last word in matters on which the ordinary public would imagine that the county manager should have the last word.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily. The county medical officer of health, to my knowledge, has certain decisions to make which, to say the least of it, are very hard for the county manager to question.  I submit that if the county medical officer for a county &mdash;not so much a county surgeon&mdash;is a member of this council he or she would be in the position of being adviser or critic to himself or herself.</P>

      <P>My point is that it will be.  The Minister and, I think, Deputy Dr. Maguire stated that the function of this committee was to advise and criticise.  I submit that in the committee as proposed here the county medical officer of health will be giving advice to himself and that in regard to the general administration of health matters very important decisions are taken by the county medical officer of health.  I do not think it is important whether or not the county surgeon would be attached to the committee except in a consultative capacity to the members.  I would not have the county medical officer of health or the county surgeon as members of the committee at all. On the committee of which Deputy Cowan is a member it seems to be the practice that they are there to give information.  I do not think the lay public is represented strongly enough on this committee.  There is power to have four members out of ten from a county council.  There should be <Col N="776" /> much wider representation of members of the council who themselves constitute a very wide representation of the people.</P>

      <P>I would suggest in that respect, even though the ordinary representation is still too small, that people like public health nurses or, say, child welfare officers would be in a far better position to relate experiences, to give advice and to make criticisms than, for instance, a person like the county medical officer or the county surgeon, and they might be in a better position to give advice and make criticisms than even the two appointees who are described here, the registered medical practitioners. This would apply particularly to public health nurses whose duty it is to travel their own areas&mdash;and they are very extensive areas at times&mdash;into the houses of the people.  I do not suggest that the dispensary doctor does not do that but it is intensified in respect of the duties of, say, public health nurses and child welfare officers. They see actual living conditions, health conditions and conditions generally and the relating of their experience to this committee would be a tremendous advantage.</P>

      <P>My permission is no good to the Deputy.  I would suggest that the Minister should widen the scope.  I assume that when advice is to be given, there should be a vote taken as to what type of advice to give or as to what kind of criticism to make. The county surgeon, the county medical officer of health and the two medical practitioners will always find it possible to be present.  As members of public bodies in this House know, it is not always possible for the members to be present.  It is in no offensive manner that I state that the county medical officer of health and the county surgeon and, to some extent, the practitioners, are being paid as officers of the local authority and it will not be the same burden on them to attend meetings as it would be for the four or six public representatives.  In some cases we might find that a majority decision in respect of advice is taken by four persons who may be, and two of whom at least will be, paid public officials.</P>
      <P>I know that many bodies will seek representation&mdash;the Red Cross, the Order of Malta, the trade unions, Muintir na Tíre, Young Farmers' Society.  All these people will be looking for representation on this consultative health committee.  If the Minister has difficulty in selecting bodies to whom he might give representation, it is my opinion that it would be far better to have the health council composed entirely of members of the county council, with the stipulation that there be present to give information such people, if the Minister so desires, as the county medical officer, the county surgeon and any other two medical practitioners who are officials of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not advise the Minister at this stage to accept the suggestion of Deputy Allen, to adopt the system of proportional representation in electing the members from the county council to this consultative health council.  I would agree that all these committees within the public body should be elected by the system of proportional representation, but I would say that that would be certainly much more appropriate to any Bill that might be <Col N="778" /> introduced to amend the County Management Act.  Just to take this one particular committee out and to adopt a system of election by proportional representation would not be just right.</P>

      <P>I agree mainly with what Deputy Corish has said.  The point I want to make is: why did the Minister think it necessary to insert the provision that these sittings should be in private?  As I see this committee, it replaces either the board of health, which was the county council proper, or the public assistance committee. Take my own constituency.  It was a joint committee of the corporation and the county council.  If it replaces that committee, I feel it should have the very same functions as that committee.</P>

      <P>I thought the individual cases were excluded completely in sub-section (1), that that was a complete power of the manager.  I have read this.  I have not had the happy experience of Deputy Cowan in regard to all county managers or officials.  In our county, I found a case where people were starving and it was only by public opinion and bringing it out in the Public Press that we forced action.  If that power is being taken from public representatives, the power <Col N="779" /> of having the Press behind us to expose what is happening, I feel we will have very little function left. This is the first attempt&mdash;a thing I will resist to the end&mdash;at complete and utter dictation, where the officials will strangle us.  The only power we have lies in the fact that the members are able to talk and criticise, which hurts and causes wrongs to be redressed. That is the very function we have. What are we going to be doing in this matter?  Are we not going to be charging, say, doctors with neglecting their duties and asking the manager to deal with the matter?</P>

      <P>As I see it, we are getting bogged down a little bit here. I agree with the Minister.  It is my reading of the amendment that what the Minister says is right, that whatever powers of publicity exist at the moment still remain.  This consultative council is a peculiar sort of body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is set up for a peculiar purpose and for peculiar reasons but anyway it is going to be set up, and there will be a new consultative council with experienced officials, experienced members of the council and a couple of other experienced men and they are going to advise the county manager in a consultative capacity on certain matters that may come before them.  Now it seems to me that this is a sort of thing where the county manager up to the present may have been consulted and advised by his county medical officer of health or by his county surgeon or by some other official but it is obtained here by exchange between these particular people and that advice will be transmitted or given to the county manager, who may be personally at the meeting, whether it is provided for or not I do not know.  I do not think that it is provided for but I think he should be present.  That is the sort of thing that strikes me where perhaps publicity would not be desirable.  This is advice tendered to the city manager or the county manager who proceeds to act on that advice.  It is open to any elected member to raise the thing in the ordinary way.  That is as I see it and I do not think that this is the sort of thing that should be discussed in public.  It is just as if the county medical officer of health would be advising the county manager, to put up the pros and cons of a particular thing before the members hear of it. When the manager receives the advice and acts on it it is open to any elected member of the council to take such <Col N="781" /> action as he might wish to in regard to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this matter has been brought out so clearly by Deputies.  They have clearly outlined, to my mind, the object for which this amendment was introduced.  I take it that the object of this amendment, the appointment of an advisory consultative health council to advise the health authority, which I presume is the county manager, is for the purpose of creating a situation whereby the general public may be protected against bureaucracy.  We had better read the section, which distinctly states here in Section 6, sub-section (6) that every meeting of the consultative health council shall be held in private. I take that to mean that it must be held in private.  There would be some point in it if it said may be held in private.  In fact, this health council are going to meet and to offer advice to the health authority.  We think it is very desirable that they should be created and that they should be in a position to offer this advice.  I was asking the Minister what redress they would have should the county manager or whoever the health authority is&mdash; there seems to be some doubt here as to who it is, but we believe it should be the county manager&mdash;intend not to accept that advice, and the Minister replied to me saying that the publicity would give them the authority they desired.  Section 6 obliterates that straight away.  They have not got the publicity.  It seems to me that if this body is going to meet it is quite natural that there must be some things they would like to discuss around the table without having unnecessary publicity but there are other matters which it would be better to discuss in public in the interests of the health authority itself.  Supposing that definite charges were being made against the health authority, against the county manager, that he was not carrying out his duties efficiently and in the best interests of all concerned would it not surely be in his interest to have the matter discussed in public and strengthen his authority, strengthen his morale, clear him of any accusations, if you had a discussion <Col N="782" /> of these matters coming before this consultative body, and they entirely exonerated the county manager or whoever was being charged with carrying out his duties in an unsatisfactory manner?</P>
      <P>I think it cuts both ways.  It is in the interest of the health authority to have a matter public.  The Minister might easily do that if he introduces &ldquo;may&rdquo; there instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; but under the section as it reads at present it says that these meetings must be held in private.  One of the Labour Deputies, I think it was Deputy Kyne, said that that immediately creates a bad impression as if there is something here that we want to hide, that we want to muzzle the discussion.  The very purpose for which this council is established is to enable the people to see what is going on and to see that these services are administered in a satisfactory manner.  I think that the Minister would be very well advised to accept that point.  I think it was first brought out by Deputy MacBride and later by a variety of other Deputies and that it would be reasonable for him to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the composition of this council, as to whether the medical officer of health and the county surgeon should or should not be members of the council, in view of the fact that they are paid officials of the health authority already it raises a very difficult point.  There are many arguments in favour of it and many against it. Somebody stated that the medical officer of health already administered the health authority, acting more or less as the health authority, as Deputy Morrissey intervened quite rightly to say, on occasion on powers delegated to him by the county manager.  I think that Deputy Captain Cowan intervened with one of his numerous interjections then to say that in housing the medical officer of health was responsible.  That is not the position.  The position with regard to housing in my constituency anyway is that if there is a vacant county council or local authority house it is referred to the medical officer of health for an opinion but the medical officer of health is not the final arbitrator <Col N="783" /> in the matter.  He only advises the county manager and it is the county manager who decides who gets the house.  So we get a position where the medical officer of health is really acting with powers delegated to him or her as the case may be by the county manager.</P>
    <P>This advisory council is for the purpose of advising the health authority, whom we consider to be the county manager, and therefore, an official acting for the county manager who has powers delegated to him to carry out these health services will have a certain say in them as a member of the advisory council.  So some of the health authority's own officials are put in the position that they are acting in an advisory capacity upon the very functions that they are carrying out themselves.  It certainly creates an anomalous situation, and it is a very difficult question.  I am inclined to agree that by and large it would be better to exclude the medical officer of health from this.  Of course I think it is extremely desirable that he should be present and, if I heard Deputy Cowan aright when he was talking about the way they managed these things, which apparently they do so well in the Dublin Corporation, they had the medical officer of health there but he does not act on the council. They meet him there as an official. Perhaps I did not hear him aright, but that is what I understood him to say.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Cowan is so fond of interjections in these debates it is very often hard to hear what he says, but it seems to me to be more reasonable that the medical officer should be present as an official rather than as a member of the advisory council.  With regard to the other matter, the question which arises of the county surgeon, I think it would be a good thing that the county surgeon should be a member of this body. Probably the discussion will in many cases turn on the question that we have been discussing in the past in this, the question of the hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying, before we adjourned, that the effect of this tax on our agricultural industry could not and should not be ignored.  Individual Deputies have mentioned the percentage reduction in their own constituencies with regard to contracts for the growing of malting barley.  I am told that, generally speaking, in the past year there has been a reduction all round in the growing of malting barley and the placing of contracts for it, of 35 per cent.  That is a very serious consideration to the tillage farmers of the Midlands, Kildare, Carlow - Kilkenny and, other parts of the country&mdash;and, of course, as Deputy Collins reminds me, there always has been traditionally a considerable amount of malting barley grown in the County Cork.  I mention this matter because it is clear that the tax to which we take objection has had its effect not merely on the production of whiskey and on the employment that the industry formerly gave but in addition on the agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>There is also the fact&mdash;it may be peculiar to the Midlands but it is so, nevertheless&mdash;that the distillation of whiskey has traditionally made available an important market for hand-won turf.  Here in this House from time to time we are accustomed to hear Deputies making appeals for the hand-won turf producer.  The production of hand-won turf has for many years been a production occasioned and delimited by the market available for it.  In two distilleries in the Midlands there always has been a market for turf.  That market is now jeopardised to a very serious degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> These particular considerations that I have mentioned certainly suggest that this tax is not one that should be supported by this House when we realise that what we are in effect killing is one of the oldest Irish native industries, an industry that 40 or 50 years ago was endangered by competition from abroad but an industry that met that competition and overcame it.  It is now being threatened by the action of an Irish Government and an Irish Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the answers which the Minister has given to criticism of this tax should be confined merely to his intervention in the debate to-day, because in fact in the last six months or so a variety of cases has been advanced on behalf of the Government as to why this particular tax should be continued and as to the manner in which it should be defended. I would like briefly to refer to one or two of the points that have been made by the Minister on different occasions.  The facts with regard to the tax and its revenue have been referred to already.  It is clear that the Minister expected in April, 1952, from the spirit duty as it fell to be collected from home distilled and also from imported spirits, to get an increased revenue of slightly more than £1,000,000.  In fact, the revenue in the last financial year fell by close on £500,000.  That particular reduction in revenue must be regarded as one of the most signal failures of any kind of taxation.  As has been said by other Deputies, the only reason the Minister for Finance can advance for any taxation&mdash;if he is not to be in the rôle of a social reformer&mdash;is to collect revenue.  The result of this taxation has been to reduce the revenue which he could collect as Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In dealing with that marked reduction in revenue, the Minister on other occasions has advanced two or three reasons why that reduction took place.  First of all, he suggested that the imposition of the tax was at an unhappy time, because there was a decline in the consumption of spirits. In fact&mdash;and it is well to have the figures on record&mdash;it appears from the Revenue Commissioners' report, Table <Col N="786" /> 21, that in 1951 there were 993,314 proof gallons of whiskey consumed.  In 1952 that had slightly declined, by a little over 13,000 gallons.  That decline is so trivial as really to make very little difference to the quantity of whiskey consumed and to the position of the industry itself.  In the last financial year, while the revenue fell by £1,500,000 from expectation, the drop in consumption fell by 267,631 proof gallons or well over 300,000 bulk gallons of whiskey.  That is a drop, if my mathematics are correct, of over 27 per cent.  in consumption.  That particular decrease in consumption could not be explained, even by the most enthusiastic defender of this tax, by suggesting that the tax was imposed at a time when consumption of whiskey was in any event declining.  A drop of over 27 per cent.  is such a colossal decrease in the operation of the industry as to bring very serious consequences.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said some time ago that another consideration why he did not attain his expected revenue and why revenue had dropped was that there was advance buying by those in the licensed trade, prior to the Budget of 1952.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that particular contention is still pursued by the Minister.  He did not put it forward to-day.  But the fact is that all those engaged in the licensed trade prior to April, 1952, were on a strict monthly quota in relation to their purchases of whiskey and no publican, no matter what his standing in the trade might be, could purchase from any distillery, and accordingly take out of bond, any quantity of whiskey in excess of his monthly quota.  In fact, every Deputy knows that there was no serious advance buying of whiskey prior to the Budget of 1952.  There might have been the usual movement out of bond when a Budget is about to be brought in, but it certainly could not have been to any serious extent.  In addition, Deputies will recollect that the Revenue Commissioners, at the instance of the Minister, took very definite steps to prevent any large scale withdrawal of whiskey from bond, because before the Budget of April, 1952, there was a sealing of bond <Col N="787" /> and a prohibition on the withdrawal of any spirits from bond.  Accordingly, that particular case does not seem to be worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>In addition, of course, as Deputies will appreciate, in April 1952, while conditions were I suppose better in the country than they are now, the effect of the restriction of credit was very keenly felt by those in the licensed trade.  That restriction of credit had commenced to operate and be felt the previous autumn and certainly, prior to the Budget of 1952, no person in the licensed trade had the necessary capital to engage in lavish capital expenditure on the purchase of spirits.</P>
    <P>Those are one or two of the reasons advanced by the Minister to explain away the very serious fall in revenue. Deputies will realise, however, as people outside do, that the Government must be concerned about the condition to which they have reduced this industry.  Recently, the Minister for Industry and Commerce suggested to the licensed trade that we should have an Irish &ldquo;nip&rdquo; which would be sold over the counter at 1/2.  I do not know whether &ldquo;nips&rdquo; appeal to members of the Government, but that certainly suggests that at least one Minister is now beginning to realise that parlous condition in which the whiskey industry and the licensed trade now find themselves.</P>
    <P>Other suggestions were made by the Minister on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill to deal with the present condition of the industry.  He asked: &ldquo;Why do not those engaged in the production of whiskey here develop an export market?&rdquo;  The example was held up of what the Scottish distillers have done.  My colleague, Deputy Sweetman, has referred to that and it is not necessary for me to go over the same ground.  I should like merely to say that the Irish distillers have a very legitimate grievance against the Government owing to the loss of an export market.  During the war years, when the production of American whiskey began to wane and when whiskey was a very scarce commodity in the dollar area, case after case was made by the &lsquo;Distillers&rsquo; Association to the then Government, <Col N="788" /> which was also a Fianna Fáil Government, for some freeing of the restrictions then in operation in this country.  Despite all the representations made, the Government still continued to control in a very rigorous manner any movement of whiskey from this country.  The export market was strictly controlled and only a mere trickle of whiskey was allowed to be exported.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recollect that those restrictions occasioned much publicity some years ago when it was suggested that the stocks of a particular distillery in this country might be exported, I think, to Switzerland.  Right through the war and until 1948, I think, at any rate some time ago, there was a very rigorous clamp down on the export of whiskey from this country.  That was at a time when the world market was favourable to the development of an export trade in whiskey.  It was at a time when the Scottish distillers, backed by the British Government, began to roam over the American market and build up an export trade that now even rivals that of Seagram's Canadian whiskey and other whiskeys of that kind.  We lost that opportunity because the Government were not prepared to permit the free export of Irish potstill whiskey.  Accordingly, I think the four or five distilleries now left in the country have a legitimate grievance if they are attacked in this House by the Minister or by any Deputy for not building up some years ago an export trade.  They were not allowed to do it.</P>
    <P>What is the position now?  It is suggested that a way out of their present difficulties would be to export whiskey. It is very easy to make a suggestion of that kind without examination of what it entails.  It certainly would be a very doubtful foundation for a flourishing export trade were Irish distillers to do it at a time when the home market is dwindling away and the very source of our export trade is endangered.  Our own Irish distillers are facing a 27 per cent.  decrease in turnover in business and they now have to search for world markets when conditions have turned against the export trade and when there is an abundant supply in England and in the hard currency areas of all <Col N="789" /> other whiskeys.  In addition, as Deputy Sweetman pointed out, there could be no comparison between Irish whiskey and Scottish whiskey.  In Scotland there is a stock figure of blended whiskey of over 150,000,000 gallons.  Here the stock figure is less than 10,000,000 gallons.</P>

      <P>In any event in dealing with the trade in the export market, the British Government in selling Scotch whiskey to the American market even in the height of the war realised its importance as a dollar earner and went to infinite pains to sell Scotch blended whiskey in the American market.  Here the position was quite the contrary.  We were prevented from exporting whiskey and certainly everything was done to discourage any distiller to export.  But the suggestion now is made that a solution to the difficulties of the industry is to search for export markets.  We are doing it now when the Scotch Distillery Company sells over £32,000,000 worth of whiskey a year; when the entire export market has turned against us.  In addition, the Scotch distillers produce a blend of whiskey which can be distilled and sold after a period of three years.  The Irish potstill is in a most unfavourable position.  It cannot, in fact, be exported or sold for a period of seven years unless it is exported from this country, as the Minister seems to suggest, and sold to Scotch distillers and blended and eventually sold in the American market as Scotch whiskey. If that is the suggestion now being <Col N="790" /> made for the future of this industry it is not a suggestion that should ever be made in an Irish Parliament.</P>

      <P>In this House, many Deputies can apparently blow hot and cold.  I think, in any event, that the Minister is inclined to be complacent <Col N="793" /> about this matter because he thinks it is a good thing to have Irish whiskey in an immature condition exported from this country, blended in Scotland and sold as Scotch whiskey.  I do not think that is a good thing.  I think it is a very bad thing.  It is an unfortunate habit that was started in this country some years ago where, in order to build up the huge export market that the Scotch whiskey was attaining, we were building up the production of Scottish whiskey by the export of immature Irish spirit.  I think, as I say, that that is a very bad thing.  I am afraid in the past&mdash;I am talking about the years of the war&mdash;that position was permitted by the then Government when they allowed Irish distillers to export only immature whiskey. Right through the war the only export, practically speaking, apart from D.W.D.&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>You could not describe that surely as immature whiskey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall discuss the case of D.W.D. on any occasion with the Minister that he wishes.  I think it was one of the greatest scandals that ever happened in this country.  Apart from D.W.D. the only whiskey exported was immature spirit.  It was exported to Scotland, used as a blend by Scottish distillers and sold later as Scotch whiskey.  Apart from D.W.D., no mature Irish potstill whiskey could be exported because the Government would not permit it and now, some years later. when the home market is being killed by this taxation, when it is disappearing, it is suggested, in effect, by the Minister's speech on Second Reading that everything is all right because immature Irish whiskey will continue to be exported to Scotland and blended with the patent still Scotch whiskey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid I have spoken at undue length, but I do suggest to the Minister that the condition of the industry at the moment does require immediate attention by the Government.  This tax has failed.  It has failed in its initial purpose of bringing in revenue. In fact, it is clear that it represented <Col N="794" /> very much the final straw.  We have reached the stage where a bottle of Irish whiskey bears taxation to the extent of 22/- and this very parlous condition is brought about in the industry.  When, in addition, that taxation gives a smaller yield of revenue, when consumption begins to fall, unemployment is caused in the industry and general hardship is felt, surely it is time for the Minister to reconsider the position.</P>
    <P>We suggest in this amendment that the Minister should remove the tax imposed in April, 1952, completely and bring the tax back to the level that was brought about by the Supplementary Budget of 1947.  Deputies will recollect that the last Government, which in this connection had the unstinted support of Deputy Cowan, took a very clear view with regard to the spirits tax and the tax on beer that had been imposed by the Supplementary Budget of 1947.  The last Government decided that the spirits tax was a tax which the industry could just bear and that it would bring in an increase in revenue.  They decided that the beer tax was a tax which could not be borne.  Accordingly, the spirits tax imposed in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 was maintained while the beer tax was reduced.  We are asking now that the Minister should revert to the position as it was before the 1952 Budget taxes were imposed.  We think, if that is not done, that certainly in the very near future two of the smaller distilleries in this country are going to close up.  It would be no good, if that happens, for the Minister to try to reduce the tax or to undo the harm.  If two distilleries close up here, the result will be extremely serious.</P>
    <P>I think that not only has this taxation worked out in a most unfair manner but it is contrary to the assurance given by the Minister before he became Minister.  We recollect that it was the Minister, then Deputy MacEntee, who on May 16th, 1951, told the electorate in the last general election that &ldquo;a number of persons in the licensed trade were spreading the rumour that if Fianna Fáil were returned to power, the taxes imposed on drink in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 would be reimposed.  There is no truth in any <Col N="795" /> such rumour.&rdquo;  That speech obviously was intended to refer to the matter dealt with in the next amendment but certainly it gave an implied promise to the electorate that the Minister's Government would not impose taxes on spirits and beer which during the election might have been regarded as unfair.  In fact, the tax as imposed, as I have endeavoured to show, has been a failure on all grounds.  It is now in danger of killing a native Irish industry that never sought protection, never required a tariff, an industry that has grown up amongst our own people, an industry that has given to the English language the name whiskey.  It is killing that industry at a time when we should be developing it, getting markets abroad, cutting down the cost of production and putting the industry in a position to compete with Scotch whiskey in the markets of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that this amendment is designed to raise revenue and not to provide any special advantage for any interest at the expense of the Exchequer.  There does not seem to be any doubt in the minds of anybody who has given any thought to the subject that in regard to the taxation on spirits we have passed beyond the point of diminishing returns.  If anybody wants an object lesson as to the consequences of doing that, he need only look at the experience of the 1947 Government with port wine.  They raised the level of taxation on port wine well beyond the point of diminishing return with the result that that trade disappeared altogether and, with it, the revenue from that source.  Since that time, that source of revenue has never revived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our proposition is that if you reduce the level of tax in respect of beer and spirits the revenue yield will increase.  Over and above that, I think it is perfectly manifest that the depression in the distilling trade and licensed trade, wholesale and retail, must be having serious repercussions on the yield of corporation profits tax and income-tax.  I suggest that, if the normal profits were restored to these trades, there would be a further handsome <Col N="796" /> accretion to the revenue of the Exchequer through the medium of corporation profits tax and income-tax.</P>
    <P>I want to refer the House for a moment to what the Minister for Finance said on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill for it gives a clue as to his attitude to this whole problem. At column 317 of the Official Report of the 28th May, 1953&mdash;Volume 139, No. 2&mdash;the Minister for Finance is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...Perhaps the fact that the home market has so substantially declined will act as a spur to induce them to try to develop an export trade.  It may take a long time to do that, but after all, it is their business primarily.  If they do not do it, their profits will decline and their industry will decline: if they do it, on the other hand, their profits will increase and their businesses will prosper accordingly....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the approach of a very smallminded man because of course, the fact is that it is wholly mistaken to believe that this is a matter of &ldquo;their business primarily&rdquo;&mdash;meaning thereby, the distillers and the brewers, primarily.  Most distillers and brewers in this country are reasonably comfortable people.  What I am thinking of is the men who are employed by the brewers and the distillers.  What I am thinking of is the men who own small public houses all over the country.  I have a great many friends amongst them&mdash;and I have no apology to make therefore.  They are respectable men who reared their families by their own industry and never sought relief or sustenance from anyone.  They are now being crushed out of existence. I am thinking also of the assistants who work behind their counters.  I am thinking of the farmers of this country who have had to jettison thousands of acres which were normally appropriated to the growing of malting barley which was a highly profitable crop for the men who grew it and for the nation which produced it.  That crop has been wiped off the land.</P>
    <P>In introducing his Estimate, the Minister for Agriculture told us that. <Col N="797" /> this year, thousands of acres of malting barley have been abandoned and that their place has been taken by wheat on which, from the national point of view of economy, there has to be paid £1 a barrel subsidy in order to get it grown.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, having delivered himself of that unworthy aphorism which I have just quoted, went on to say this, as reported at columns 319 and 320.  Before I quote it, I should like you all to remember at this stage that the Minister for Finance of the Republic of Ireland is talking about two of the oldest industries in Ireland&mdash;two of the only industries in Ireland all of whose raw materials are produced from the land of Ireland.  Their name is not Lichtovitch nor Steinwich.  They do not come from Czechoslovakia, Lithuania, Hungary or from the other end of the earth.  If they did, we would all be called upon to bow down before them and to acknowledge them as princes of commerce but because they happen to come from Bow Street or James's Street or Midleton or Tullamore, this is what the Irish Minister for Finance has to say about them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we want to develop an export industry, the best way would seem to be to make the home market more difficult, so that if they want to maintain their profits and position in this country they will be compelled to go out and look for export markets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister said that to Mr. Lichtovitch he would go back home to Czechoslovakia and we would all be out on our knees to say: &ldquo;Come back to Erin and put a greyhound and a round tower on your product and we will call you &lsquo;O'Looney&rsquo; and forget all about the Lichtovitch&rdquo;.  But, because they happened to be born in Tullamore, Dublin, and so forth, the attitude is to put bit and bridle on them and, if that is not enough, to try a whip.  The attitude is: if they do not get to work and work hard, close them down.  Remember, it is &ldquo;if they want to maintain their profits and position in this country&rdquo;.  It is not &ldquo;in their country&rdquo;, it is &ldquo;in this country&rdquo;.  If <Col N="798" /> Mr. Lichtovitch had changed his name to &ldquo;O'Looney&rdquo; he would be going around calling on us all to join with him in building up the economy of &ldquo;our country&rdquo;&mdash;and I would be expected to tip my hat and say: &ldquo;Yes, Mr. O'Looney&rdquo;.  But if I said: &ldquo;Mr. Lichtovitch, your country is Czechoslovakia, Hungary or Turkey&rdquo; I should be told that I was an enemy of Irish industry and I would be asked if I did not see the harp, greyhound and round tower on everything he produced.  I should be told that I should consider it a privilege to pay a tariff of 50 per cent. in order to ensure that he would live in Donnybrook and drive home every night in a Chrysler car while I would get into my Ford 10.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about people who have never earned or sought to earn a penny except on the investment of their wealth in this country and who have always produced a product of which this country has reason to be proud on the grounds of quality.  I do not think we are called upon to make any apology for saying that no responsible Government in any civilised country would set out to smash an industry of that kind on the ground that, in the development of their trade, they were not doing what the Minister for Finance at the moment thought they ought to do and which they are prepared to make the case is being done to the limit of possibility.</P>
    <P>If you ask any of the leading distillers in this country, I think they will tell you that every conceivable effort is being made to break into foreign markets.  They did not complain when our Government, during the war period, forbade them to export spirits. They said then that they were prepared to accept that restriction if the Government thought the public interest required it.  However, they think it hard that now, having been prohibited by their own Government from entering the American market during the war, where scarcity then existed, they should be asked to break into that market blithely now.  The Scotch distillers were forbidden to sell Scotch whiskey in Great Britain and were ordered to sell it on consignment to the United States of America and to get <Col N="799" /> into the United States of America market at a time when the Bourbon and rye whiskey trade of America were themselves restricted in production by the United State Government because they were required to produce other requirements&mdash;and Scotch whiskey poured into that vacuum and established itself with its campaigns of advertising for &ldquo;Johnny Walker&rdquo;, &ldquo;Black and White&rdquo;, and so forth.</P>
    <P>At the end of the war, when the Kentucky distilleries, when the rye distilleries in the United States of America are going full blast and are free to sell distilled whiskey in America within 12 months of distillation and, with the Scotch whiskey distillers, one of the greatest and most powerful combines in the world, firmly established in the United States of America, we ask our distillers to try to break into that market.  We command them to do it and tell them: &ldquo;If you do not, we will kill your domestic trade in order to punish you for not doing so.&rdquo;  I begin to wonder are we in Grangegorman, particularly when any one of these distillers is prepared to put before the Minister for Finance proof that they have gone to New York and have taken counsel with the best marketing advisers in New York and have marked out limited regions for publicity where their stocks would permit them to maintain supply, if they succeeded in conquering the market.</P>
    <P>Any authority who knows anything about foreign marketing will tell you that nothing is more fatal than to go into a market as big as the 48 States of the United States, spend a couple of million pounds sterling creating a great demand over the whole 48 States and discover, when that demand hits you, that by no stretch of the imagination could you conceivably fill it.  You can lose in three weeks an investment of ten years and, therefore, as these distillers have been wisely advised, they have divided the country into small areas&mdash;taking an area in New England, a restricted area in California and another area around Baltimore&mdash;concentrated their advertising there and prepared stocks to meet any demand however gratifying that may <Col N="800" /> materialise, so that whatever money they spend on advertising, when it fructifies, will be further exploited by adequate delivery of the commodity advertised.</P>
    <P>The distillers, in pursuing that course, are perfectly right, and it would be reckless madness for them to try to spread a national campaign of advertising all over the States, because if they did, Irish whiskey would be dead and damned for ever by the consequent failure of our domestic distilling resources to deliver a mature whiskey which might be demanded by so vast a market as the whole United States if a very large sum of money were spent on advertising over the whole area simultaneously.</P>

      <P>Because that man, who is described in this book as Mr. MacEntee and who, as a result of the Red Nuncio's vote, is Minister for Finance in this country says he is going to kick the distillers of this country out of the country to get trade in foreign countries.  I am trying to establish to the satisfaction of the House that the distillers are doing all that is humanly possible to get trade abroad and that there is no need to destroy their domestic market in order to make them try harder to do that which the United States Government is doing its damnedest to prevent them doing; but, despite all that, I think the Irish distillers are exerting themselves and spending heroically on what they conceive to be a prudent campaign to procure markets in the United States over all opposition which they will be able adequately to supply if their advertising campaign should be a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These distilleries and breweries are old established Irish industries, trading in a free and open market in competition with all comers, seeking protection <Col N="802" /> from nobody, employing our own people directly and indirectly, contributing substantially to the revenue and providing a medium which everyone who has any understanding of public finance will agree is one of the most powerful anti-inflationary instruments that can be used at a time when there is excess purchasing power in the hands of the public.  There is no more expedient device for correcting an inflationary trend, arising from excess spending power in the hands of the people, particularly in our conditions where such a malady manifests itself in growing imports of consumer goods, than to make accessible to the consuming public a commodity carrying a high rate of excise duty but not a rate so high as will deter them from consuming it.</P>
    <P>I want to know why we approach these interests in the spirit of the speech of the Minister to which I have referred, as being undeserving of any consideration.  Why should we say to them, as the Minister said at column 318: &ldquo;I do not see why we should single out the potstillers for special consideration?&rdquo;  Why should the man who said that be the same man who singled out the dance-hall proprietors for special consideration?  The man who said that, on the Budget of 1953, is the man who, in the Budget of 1952, when he put these taxes on, presented the dance-hall proprietors with £100,000 which dance-hall proprietors, being so greatly gratified thereby, wrote to every dance-hall proprietors in Ireland and said: &ldquo;You had better put up the dough to get MacEntee made Minister for Finance, for he has promised to grease our palm to the tune of £100,000&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made the point that in asking for this revision of taxation <Col N="804" /> I am not appealing for any special consideration for any special interest in this country.  I am asking that employment should be restored to shop assistants.  I am asking that publicans should be enabled to earn their living again.  I am asking that the retail and wholesale trade should be revived and that the distilleries which have threatened to close down should be restored to their legitimate business.</P>
      <P>I would like the House to bear this interesting fact in mind because those who do not understand the licensed trade may not appreciate the fact: Gresham's law works in inverse ratio in the whiskey market.  Bad money drives out good: good whiskey drives out less well-known brands.  One of the first consequences of seriously contracting the domestic market for spirits is that the customer going into the licensed house asks instinctively, and insists on getting, the well-advertised brand of the larger distilling firms because he cannot remember the name of the smaller distillers, whose product may be intrinsically just as good but which in the public mind has not the place reserved for those with a name with which they are familiar.  Therefore, the impact of a contracting trade in whiskey precipitated by excess taxation falls in entirely undue proportion on the small distiller who by the nature of his capital and physical structure is unfortunately more dependent on the domestic market than the larger firms will naturally be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am warning this House there are more than two distilleries which, if required to carry on under the present taxation pattern, will close their doors, and if they close they will close for ever.  Perrse's of Galway made as fine a whiskey as was ever manufactured in this country; they closed in 1913 and they never reopened. Cassidy's of Monasterevan closed their doors after the 1914-1918 war; they made as good a whiskey as was ever made, but they never opened their doors again.  If two or three more of the small distillers close their doors in rural Ireland, they are gone and gone forever.  Where you have a distillery <Col N="805" /> in a small town, you kill your small town if you close that distillery down.  You may completely disrupt the whole social life of that town to the point of rendering it in due time a virtual desert.  A town that grows up around an industry like that cannot survive the sudden disappearance of its main source of employment, and the whole town goes down.  I think that is something this House should think long and well about before they run the very serious and indefensible risk of seeing that very thing come to pass.</P>
    <P>The Minister also chose to sneer on the Second Stage of this Bill because he thought that by sneering he could rouse Deputy Hickey.  He said that the fact was that those who criticise this duty were, in effect, trying to expand the consumption of whiskey. That was calculated to put every Deputy on his guard lest he enrage the teetotallers.  Now I speak here as a collateral descendant of one of the most energetic defenders of total abstinence in this country and I am saying quite deliberately that my purpose is to increase the consumption of whiskey above its present level.  I warn the House of certain evils that will arise if we attempt by fiscal methods artificially to reduce it.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have shared with me the experience of seeing the consequences of poteen distilling in the West of Ireland.  No more disastrous catastrophe can fall upon a parish than that some individual, or individuals, should be persuaded into setting up an illicit still.  The distilling of poteen in rural Ireland can be a major catastrophe in the area in which it occurs.  One of the surest ways of precipitating the distillation of poteen is to make the price of whiskey utterly inaccessible to the average man.  I would ask the House to remember that the people who have to give up drinking whiskey are in the great majority of cases not the wealthy, for the wealthy will buy the luxuries they want so long as they have the money wherewith to buy them.  The people who have to give up whiskey in many, many cases are the aged poor.  I know them and I do not doubt there is not a Deputy here <Col N="806" /> who does not know old people who are in the habit of taking a half one at night before they go to bed and who get their night's sleep as a result thereof and feel the want of it when they are no longer able to afford it. But they do not lie down and die because they cannot get it.  They endure a great deal of unnecessary discomfort because they cannot afford it and I think that is something we ought to bear in mind in dealing with a matter of this kind.  That kind of silent suffering, which, to us who are not yet borne down by weight of years, may appear trivial, can bulk very large in the life of an old person to whom few luxuries remain accessible and to whom ordinary healthy life is no longer available.  The difference between moderate comfort and permanent discomfort may often be measured by no more than a half one of whiskey.  It is no light thing to take that away and philosophically to observe that you cannot have omelettes without breaking eggs.  That is the most comforting economic aphorism always provided that you are not the egg.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the difficulties of Irish distillers in breaking into the foreign market.  I want to say at this stage that if our Government is instrumental in bringing pressure to bear on the potstill distillers of this country to produce a synthetic product against their better judgment for a foreign market I think they act most recklessly and imprudently.  Irish whiskey is potstill whiskey.  Scotch whiskey is blended whiskey&mdash;a blend of potstill and patent still whiskey.  If anyone in Ireland is nursing the illusion that he can break into the American market with Loch Lomond Dew manufactured in Ballydehob he is just crazy.  It may be that some enterprising souls did capture the Belfast market with Coronation rock manufactured in the Republic of Ireland but they called it what it was, but if anyone thinks you can break into a foreign market with an article the very name of which is a misdescription he is just daft.  You cannot break into a foreign market with a Scotch whiskey distilled in Ireland any more than you could break into it with Irish whiskey distilled in <Col N="807" /> Glasgow.  It is not through any inherent superiority in Scotch whiskey that Scotch whiskey has got such a footing in the United States of America.  It is due to the fact that Sir Stafford Cripps&mdash;God rest his soul &mdash;forbade the British people in substance to drink whiskey during and after the war and directed it to be sold abroad in order to earn dollars. That is what gave Scotch whiskey its standing in the United States of America, plus the fact that it was presented to the United States of America by one of half a dozen of the greatest and wealthiest combines that this world has ever seen who were in a position to spend on advertising more money than the entire Irish distilling industry has.</P>
    <P>If Irish whiskey is to break into a foreign market it will have to do so on its merits.  It will never do so as an ersatz product masquerading as something which, in fact, it is not.  I sincerely hope that the Government in so far as they may have pressed that course on the Irish distilling industry will consider again the nature of what they are doing.  That is all I have to say, Sir.  I am making the case for an old Irish industry operated by Irish people in their own country, employing Irishmen and using exclusively raw materials derived from the land of Ireland.  I am making the case of thousands of small publicans up and down the country who are rearing decent families through their own honest labour.  I am making the case for thousands of shop assistants who, to my own knowledge, are unemployed to-day where they could command good wages two years ago.  Lastly, I am making the case for the Exchequer in the profound conviction that in respect of these two commodities, whiskey and beer, you have long passed the point of diminishing return.</P>
    <P>If we will at this stage mend our hand and bring the level of taxation back to the point of the optimum of return, undoubtedly the distilling industry and the licensed trade will still consider that level of taxation too high.  But at this stage I would be prepared to settle with the Minister <Col N="808" /> for Finance if he agreed to bring the level of these duties back to the point which would be certified to him and through him to this House by the Revenue Commissioners as the point of optimum return from the Exchequer point of view.</P>
    <P>I think we should deliberately set our minds to the task of bringing the level of taxation in respect of these two commodities in due course as Exchequer exigencies will allow, to the point of optimum production from the distillers' and brewers' point of view, not only for domestic consumption but for the foreign market which they will be in a position to exploit having employed a fair proportion of their current profits on advertising and other organisational work essential as a preliminary profitably to enter a foreign market of that kind.  If we are not prepared to take some steps in that direction now, ultimately we will have to do it, but meantime, certain small distillers are going to close and will never open again and a great many anonymous and unknown tradesmen will have to get out of business and a great many men and women who want to earn their bread in their own country will be driven to get jobs in the public-houses of Bootle and Manchester because there is no employment for them here.  Can that case be answered?  If it cannot, is it not the Minister's duty to tell us what he proposes to do about it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say a few words in connection with this matter.  Listening to Deputy Dillon the problem seems more difficult than I really thought it was.  Deputy Dillon concluded his speech by stating that certain small distillers were likely to be driven out of existence.  I think he attributed that to the fact that there is increased taxation.  Earlier in his speech he told us that Perrse's of Galway who made an excellent whiskey went out of existence in 1913 when whiskey could be bought for about 2/6 a bottle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did they go out of production in 1913 if the whiskey could be bought at 2/6 a bottle?  Why did Cassidy's of Monasterevan go out of production shortly after the first world war?  I <Col N="809" /> drank and enjoyed Cassidy's whiskey at 1/3 a glass.  It was an excellent whiskey, but it went out of production. Why?  It went out of production for the very reason that Deputy Dillon himself gave&mdash;that good whiskey drives out the less well-known brands.  That is what Deputy Dillon said.  If good whiskey drives out less well-known brands and, if it drove Perrse's whiskey out in 1913 and Cassidy's whiskey shortly after the first world war, undoubtedly certain small distillers are going to have a tremendous struggle for existence.  Apparently, it is not the extra taxation that is going to cause them to go out of existence but the fact that they are being driven out by better-known brands.</P>

      <P>The market did not contract in 1913&mdash;at least, that is my recollection.  People's tastes change. When one went to a funeral at that time one was handed a mug of whiskey, and you were not considered a man unless you could drink the mug of whiskey.  Times have changed.  In every farmer's ass's cart going home on a Saturday you saw a jar of whiskey.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but the very best whiskey.  Many a time I went into town myself and brought home a jar of whiskey for a few shillings.  In fact, in those days if a young lad, riding an ass, went into town for a few bottles of whiskey he was given a little <i>taoscan</i> to take himself.  Times have changed completely and tastes have changed.  I think it is a pity.  I think we were a wonderful race when we drank plenty of good Irish whiskey. I am glad that Deputy Dillon agrees with me that it would be a good thing if we came back to that state of affairs. But it does not matter what the price of whiskey is, or what the tax on whiskey may be, we will never go back to the hard drinking times of 30, 40 or 50 years ago.  Supposing that the tax of 6d. a glass was taken off whiskey, it is not going to increase the production of whiskey or the consumption of <Col N="810" /> whiskey to a sufficient degree to enable the small distilleries, which are threatened with extinction, to continue.</P>
      <P>I must say that there was one thing in regard to the distillers that I did not like.  The extra tax was put on last year, and apparently, immediately after that was done, although their whiskey takes seven years to mature, and although there may be changes in taste in the next seven years, they immediately cancelled many of their contracts for malting barley.  Why did they do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not accept that.  I think they stepped in deliberately to reduce their own production of whiskey, and why they did that I do not know.  I do not think it was in the national interest to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the Deputy do if he suddenly found himself with a ten years' stock instead of a seven years' stock on hands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>They had no indication last year that the position was so, nor had they a guarantee that it would be so in seven years' time when the whiskey matured, and yet they went out and cancelled these contracts, with the result that thousands of acres of land that apparently should be growing malting barley are not growing it.  That drives me back to this one point, that I agree with Deputy McQuillan and with those Deputies who want to see an increase in the production of whiskey in this country.  I want to see a market obtained for that whiskey whether it be in this country or not, although I do not think we can improve the market an awful lot here, but, even if we do, I want to see a market for whiskey elsewhere.  I agree with Deputy Dillon that we will have tremendous difficulty in trying to get into the American market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a tremendous difficulty in getting into the American market.  One of the distilleries, Locke's of Kilbeggan, always sent their whiskey to the American market.  There has been some stoppage of supplies of Locke's whiskey to America&mdash;I do not know what it is &mdash;but, apparently, the Americans took exception to something in connection with the containers in which the whiskey went out.  I asked Deputy Dillon the question because I thought he was more in touch with the difficulties of the distillers than I am, and that he might have known that.  I am only mentioning what is a general topic of conversation, which, of course, may not be correct at all, but apparently the suggestion is that the Americans insisted on the old jar, which we all knew, being altered. There was a certain figure, not the harp or the shamrock, but the lady. Apparently she was not sufficiently modestly dressed for the American market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>It is a pity the Deputy cannot restrain himself, but that is one of the difficulties of getting into the American market.  Undoubtedly, our distillers are going to have a very big problem.  If we want to increase the production of whiskey, and if our distillers will not do it, or do not want to do it, and want to put all the difficulties they possibly can in the way, then we will have to do something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned here, in the <Col N="812" /> course of other debates, that the machinery and plant in our distilleries are old, have become inefficient and want to be replaced.  Now, in all the years that those distilleries were making very good profits they did not make prudent provision for the installation of new machinery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I am quite certain that some are, but some are not, and it is the ones which are not that are complaining that they are unable, because of this extra tax, to make the provision for replacing the machinery and equipment that they should make. If we are going to increase our whiskey production, and if we are going to give more employment on the land in growing malting barley, then I think the State will have the responsibility of entering into competition with those distillers and with those distilleries. We have got to face up to that fact. This House will have to face up to it. If we want to give extra employment on the land and to get extra production, the State will have to step in and will have to distil whiskey.  It will have to make all the necessary arrangements to get the foreign markets that we require.  I think that on this we are all of the one mind.</P>

I would love to see it but nobody knows better than Deputy Dillon does that that cannot be done.  We must have a market for our whiskey if it is going to be the industry that will give the employment we should like it to give, and we must get a market somewhere. There is another matter I might mention.  Our Irish potstill whiskey is 24 U.P.  That is, as far as Jameson, Paddy Flaherty's and Power's are concerned.</P>

      <P>But they want something not so strong abroad.  There is no use saying: &ldquo;You must drink our Irish whiskey because it is the best whiskey&rdquo;.  If we are a sensible people we will provide for them whiskey blended in the way that they want it. You cannot tell the customer he is wrong and we are right.  Our Irish whiskey has its reputation in this country.  It has its reputation in other parts of the world but the new generation growing up does not want to drink whiskey as potent as our whiskey is. Consequently, we must suit the taste of the people who are going to drink our whiskey.  I know very well the Minister does not intend to set up a State whiskey industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Listening to this debate for the last three or four hours, I have heard some very lucid and comprehensive surveys of the distilling trade.  I do not propose to wander up all the avenues that have been travelled by the other speakers, but for about the third time I want to make an appeal to the Minister&mdash;I have already done so on the Central Fund Bill and in my speech after the Budget this year had been introduced&mdash;to do something to alleviate the very heavy burdens that are pressing on the licensed trade throughout the country. There is no use in blinding ourselves to the fact that one trade on which sentence of death was pronounced in the Budget of 1952 was the licensed trade.  The terrific impositions that were heaped on the trade had the effect of putting many people out of business.  I am aware that in the part of the country from which I come men who were able to make ends meet heretofore have now been driven nearly to distraction.  I would ask the Minister to do something before it is too late to lighten the burdens that he imposed on these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> I refer to the ordinary licensed traders who have to make a living in this country.  For the last year and a half or two years that has been wellnigh impossible.  Every Deputy who has spoken is in complete agreement on that point.  Anyone who frequents licensed premises, or pubs, as they are commonly called throughout the country, knows well that the same volume of business is not there at all.  Let one go into any public-house, whether in Dublin, Cork or anywhere else and ask the owner or any of the men working behind the bar and every one of them will tell you that the volume of trade has been cut by 25 per cent. or 30 per cent. over the last year and a half.  That is a sad blot on this Dáil which is responsible for the severity of those taxes.</P>
    <P>Most people in the country have only one desire in life and that is to make ends meet.  Nobody wants to accumulate any money but everyone is desirous of being able to foot their bills at the end of the month.  To-night we are primarily discussing the distillery trade.  When speaking on the Budget on the 21st May last, at column 2274, Volume 138, of the Official Debates of that date, I read for the Minister's benefit a letter which I received from the director of one of the biggest distilleries in Ireland.  The letter read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We enclose herewith a copy of a letter forwarded to the Minister for Finance by the Irish Potstill Distillers' Association.</P>
    <P>We need hardly stress our grave anxiety at the damage being caused by the present excessive taxation to this old-established Irish industry which is so closely allied to the agricultural economy of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That comes from one of the most reputable directors in one of the finest concerns in Ireland, a firm that has always paid decent wages and given a considerable amount of employment in the constituency I have the honour to represent, that is, East Cork.  In various visits to that town, Midleton, where the whiskey so well known throughout Ireland, Paddy Flaherty <Col N="817" /> and Midleton whiskey is produced, I have come in contact with men who for the last six or eight months have been laid off.  The reason is that the demand is not there.  I want to be perfectly frank.  None of us wants to make any capital out of this.  The Minister, in his wisdom or otherwise, decreed that such taxes were to be imposed.  This is too serious a matter for politics but, when I get a letter from the director of one of the best-known distilleries in Ireland quoting the grave damage being caused by the present excessive taxation to this old established Irish industry so closely allied to the agricultural economy, it is incumbent upon me to sit up and take notice and to place that before the members of the Dáil and the Government. It is very, very serious.</P>
    <P>Those of us who visit licensed premises cannot but observe that the same volume of business is not there.  A glass of whiskey at 3/6 is more than any man can afford, even if he is earning £600, £700 or £1,000 a year.  Three and sixpence a glass is far too much. People are beginning to realise that. People who have to do justice to other members of their household must deny themselves the luxury which whiskey is now.  It was an amenity at one time to go into a house and to have a drink and a chat but those days are over.</P>
    <P>The very same applies to the pint which was always regarded as of nutritional value for the average Irish working man.  That has been put beyond the reach of many by the tax of the 1951 Budget.  I was in the House at the time when these taxes were imposed and I felt that they were giving a crippling blow to the licensed trade.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister that, if he wants to maintain these Irish industries that have had a tradition in the manufacture of the best whiskey for the last 100 or 150 years, he must ease the burden imposed on them.  We cannot deny that the same demand is not there.  One need only walk into a pub to realise it.  It is very hard luck on the licensed traders to have their living filched from them like that.  We observe in the daily papers, particularly <Col N="818" /> in the Dublin and Cork Saturday morning papers, what I can only describe as a bunch of licensed premises for sale.  That is the mercury in the barometer indicating how the licensed trade is going.  The licensed trade is decreasing and cash receipts falling and there is nothing for many publicans to do but to place their property on the market.  No one wants to do that if he can help it, but that is the position of all but a very few in the licensed trade at present.  The people in my part of the country have told me that any man who has to live on a public-house at the moment is just eking out a miserable existence if he has not some other business, such as a grocery trade, attached to it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give very serious attention to this matter.  I know the Minister does not want to put anyone out of business.  I do not want to resurrect anything unpalatable but some Deputies said it was all due to the inter-Party Government.  It was not.  There were other ways of getting money if the Minister wanted it, without passing sentence of death on the licensed trade.</P>
    <P>In the East Cork constituency barley contracts have been cut by 50 per cent. for the coming year.  East Cork is one of the best-known barley-growing areas in Ireland, and many members of the agricultural community secure a very remunerative livelihood from barley growing.  The cut of 50 per cent. is a serious matter for them.  If you kill the licensed trade, you kill the malting barley trade.</P>
    <P>There are so many points that have been gone into by various speakers that I do not want to go over them all again.  For the third time in the last two or three months, I would appeal to the Minister to do something. Those of us who come in contact with business people realise what it means to them.  Nobody wants to be put out of business but, owing to the severity of this tax, many people will be.</P>
    <P>The letter to which I have referred was from a director of one of the most reputable distilleries in Ireland.  Businessmen have to live out of business. <Col N="819" /> They are not politicians.  They do not care a thrawneen for politics.  They want to give service to the country. They want to produce the best.  When men like that, of very high repute in the industrial world, send you a letter you must pay very serious attention to it.  I hope the few words I have said will weigh with the Minister, and that he will do something to ease the burden on these people.</P>

Are these the same goody-goody boys that are bewailing the fact that every fellow in the country cannot get drunk?  It is rather amusing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us get down to business. Let us, first of all, remember that the reason why these taxes have to be imposed is that we have to find each year a little sum of £7,000,000 odd to pay the interest on what the gentlemen over there spent.  The sooner they get that into their heads and understand it the sooner we will be able to do a little more business. They may get away with a little thing here and there on a fair day down the country, but when you are here you have to meet the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were asked in this House in May, 1952.  They were answered in this House by the present Minister in May, 1952, and they were never contradicted and could not be.  They are <Col N="820" /> facts.  They are in the Official Report for any Deputy who wants to read them.</P>
    <P>Now let us deal with whiskey and see where we are.  We hear all about the exports of whiskey.  We hear that Fianna Fáil killed the exports of whiskey.  That is the first cry that was made by some of the Deputies. Let us go into the figures.  In 1944, we exported 111,000 proof gallons of whiskey and we got for that £147,000. In 1945, that was increased to 376,000 gallons and brought us in £400,000.</P>

Then last year&mdash;it was not the consumption here that dropped&mdash;the export of whiskey fell to 75,000 odd gallons.  The export of whiskey last year fell by 75,000 odd gallons.</P>

When I heard Deputy O'Higgins (Junior) over there this evening telling us the number of gallons reduced consumption I was amazed when I found I could take this out of it, 75,500 that the gentlemen forgot to export last year as an assistance to the artificial reduction of the acreage of barley. The barley, mind you, as Deputy Cowan told you, would not be sold for <Col N="821" /> seven years more as whiskey.  They reduced their contract acreage last year.  Why?  They must have great faith in the Fianna Fáil Government because they believed that we were going to be here in seven years' time.</P>

      <P>I have given here the figures.  The export of Irish whiskey increased from 1944 to 1951 by 400 per cent.&mdash;from 111,000 gallons to 444,000 gallons.  Now let those who say that an export market could not be built up remember that.  I have gone back in the Library as far as I could, as far back as 1944 and got the figures of the number of proof gallons exported in 1944, and I followed them up to 1951, and those are the figures.  We hear men wailing here about certain distillers. I have not the slightest sympathy for any distiller in this country for I know their record, and I know what they did along the years past back to the time when with a Cumann na nGaedheal Government in office here they were allowed to bring in all the foreign stuff they wanted and they bought Irish barley at 13/6 a barrel.</P>

      <P>This particular trouble of the tax this year does not affect the particular distillery that Deputy O'Gorman is talking about at all.  We know that you can sell all the Paddy Flaherty whiskey you can get, but the trouble is in getting it.  The only group who are knocking down in this job are the fellows selling the tripe and poison, as Deputy Cowan said.  Therefore, as far as I can see it, we have seen here a definite attempt by these people.  I have given two instances&mdash; one a reduction by 75,000 gallons in their export sales of whiskey last year, and number two, their reduction in contract acreage for a product that they would not be putting on the market for seven years more&mdash;two definite attempts to create an atmosphere in this country which would endeavour to force this Government to reduce the tax on whiskey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment first of all because I believe that if the taxes on spirits and on beer are reduced to what they were before the 1952 Budget it will be a great benefit to the agricultural industry.  I am very surprised to see <Col N="823" /> that the publican Deputies from the other side of the House have not said a word at all about the tax that was imposed over 12 months ago.  Barley growers in this country have suffered to a very great extent during the last 14 or 15 months.  The amount of barley taken from barley growers has been reduced by approximately half over the last year.  The farmer who would have a quota of five acres of barley would have something over two acres now. The unemployment position which is growing fast in the licensed trade in Dublin is something that the Government should consider, and consider very seriously.  Contrary to what has been said by the Deputies on the other side of the House, there has been a very serious drop in the consumption of spirits in the licensed trade.  I know because I have a pub myself.  The Minister and members of the Government could find out here if they made inquiries in the Dáil bar to what extent the trade has been affected by the increase in duties.  The increase in taxes on spirits and beer has seriously affected licensed premises throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that during the last three or four years every local authority saw fit to increase by nearly 100 per cent. the poor law valuation of all the licensed premises.  I would like to quote a few examples.  The Dew Drop Inn in Trinity Street, Dublin, which was purchased two years ago for a total sum of £10,300, was offered for sale about five weeks ago and it was withdrawn. There was one bid for it, £4,000.  This is only one case.  There is Lawlor's of Frederick Street; £25,000 was the figure at which negotiations took place for the purchase of these premises four years ago.  The negotiations failed then.  The highest offered about six weeks ago for these premises when put up for sale&mdash;owing, I think, to a death in the family&mdash;was £11,500, less than half the price.  O'Hara's of Chancery Street had two houses in respect of which a combined figure of £25,000 was the basis of negotiation for sale four years ago.  It was sold a few weeks ago, one house for £5,800 and the second for £4,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> I just mention these few facts to show the Deputies on the other side of the House how the licensed trade has been affected.  It has been affected principally by the increase in the tax on spirits here.  I might mention that there has been a fall in consumption of 27.8 per cent. in the case of spirits and of 13 per cent. in the case of beer. There has been a fall of approximately 6 per cent. in the gross profit which the publican made out of his business. Everybody knows that the overhead expenses of publicans, particularly in the City of Dublin, have increased considerably.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to what Deputy Corry said about the increase in the exports of whiskey from 1944 on.  It was a very simple matter for the exports of whiskey to increase from 1944 on, because up to then the export of whiskey was practically prohibited. Whiskey was on a quota or a ration basis here in this country and everybody concerned in the licensed trade found difficulty in getting their own requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They exported it in 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 100,000 gallons exported in 1944 and it increased considerably each year after that.  The Minister mentioned in his Budget speech that it was noticeable that there were very few withdrawals from bond prior to the Budget of 1952. The Minister knows well that a prohibition Order was issued by the Department of Finance prohibiting the withdrawal of spirits at that period. This year, prior to the Budget, even though it was commonly voiced throughout the country that there might be a reduction in the tax on spirits and so forth, the withdrawals from bond did not appreciably rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several questions I would like to ask the Minister and Deputies on the other side.  Apart from that, I would like to hear some Deputy on the other side who is interested in the licensed trade, say a few words here as to what he thinks about the tax on spirits and the tax on beer.  I would ask the Minister is not the demand for barley now lower than ever before? In view of the fact that there is one major brewery here in this city which <Col N="825" /> claims that it has two years' stock of malting barley, how are the farmers going to be affected?  How are the other breweries fixed in that respect? The farming community will suffer and so will the farm labourers who would be employed on this land.  I would ask the Minister also is there not less employment in the distilleries themselves than there was two years ago?  Is it not a fact that a lot of men have been let go from certain major distilleries in the country?  Is it not a fact also that employees of certain distilleries have been warned that they may be allowed to go in the near future because the directors did not see any great prospects?  If the Minister or his staff take the trouble to inquire from the union that controls the licensed trade in Dublin, he will find there a very sorry tale.  The licensed houses in Dublin at the moment are overstaffed in comparison to the trade they are doing and the time is approaching, and approaching very fast, when the position will have to be dealt with drastically before any solution can be found.</P>
    <P>The last question I put to the Minister&mdash;and I think it a question in which this amendment cries for an answer&mdash; is it not a fact that the Minister is now getting less revenue than he was before he imposed these taxes?  He expected to collect £1,020,000 more than was collected in the year 1951. Instead of that, he collected something over £400,000 less.  I put these four questions to the Minister and if he cannot answer them satisfactorily&mdash;I do not think he can&mdash;he should give serious consideration to this amendment. I believe, and we on this side of the House believe, that if the taxes are removed from beer and spirits the Minister's Department will gain more revenue.</P>

      <P>I wish to say a few words.  I thought others were going to speak.  In the Minister's Budget of 1952 he blundered badly in his taxation on the licensed trade.  He has hurt them considerably; whether that was his intention or not, I do not know.  Deputy Belton and others have told you that licensed houses have been offered for sale and only half the price expected was bid&mdash;a drop of 50 per cent. inside five years.  Most of these people are decent men from country districts, farmers' sons who invested their savings in licensed houses and got the banks to help them with the second half of the purchase price.  They undertook very heavy commitments.  The Minister stepped in last year and put on them the most crushing burden ever put on any trade. It is a good trade, a decent trade, they are decent men that are in it and they deserve more from an Irish Government than being crushed out the way they are.  They give good employment and nowadays I understand they are paying very good wages.  We merely asked the Minister, if he has to find money as we all admit he has, not to crush out decent Irishmen whose fathers in the days gone by subscribed to keep the national flag flying in this country.  It is not as if they were foreigners who came from Czechoslovakia or somewhere else and got subsidies in order to give employment. The licensed trade got nothing from the Government and they did not ask <Col N="827" /> for anything.  The whiskey-distilling trade never got anything from the Minister and yet he is crushing them out.  They merely want to be allowed to do their own business and to get some encouragement to get the foreign trade which the Minister said they should get.</P>
      <P>It has been stated that they have done everything humanly possible to get their product into the foreign market. Irish visitors to New York will tell you that you will see there aeroplanes advertising Irish whiskey.  I have seen them myself.  They spent a lot of money in that way.  <i>(Interruptions.)</i> The licensed traders are Irishmen in a decent trade recognised by the State.  They pay their way and their sons and daughters do well in this country.  They deserve more than sneers from Deputies when one tries to say a word for them.  They are farmers' sons who invested money in the licensed business in Dublin.</P>

      <P>A good thing can lose nothing by being repeated often, especially when Deputies are trying to make a laughing-stock of it.  The Minister was mistaken when he put an increased tax on whiskey.  He lost £400,000 or £500,000 in revenue in his efforts to get more money.  We all agree that the money has to be found, but in his desire to get that money the Minister ought not to crush out a trade like that.  He ought to give the distillers, who give good employment, a chance to carry on.  They are not asking for a subsidy.  They only want to be allowed to carry on their own business and give decent employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am voting in favour of this amendment because I am against an increase in taxation.  I am consistent in adopting this line as I am opposing extra taxation, and I am not looking for further expenditure, which does not happen on all sides of the House.  I have had letters, as Deputy O'Gorman has had, from firms in my constituency and in his.  They complain that they cannot sell their products and at the same time there are people all over the area who cannot get supplies from the firms who are writing to me and to Deputy O'Gorman saying that they cannot sell their products.  Only this week a number of people were told that they could not get supplies from the firms who wrote to us saying that they could not sell their products.  They were told that they could not get supplies or that they could take whatever they wanted this month but that they would not get any more until the end of September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I want to make on this amendment, and that is with regard to the amount of feeding barley that was bought for the brewing and distilling industry last year. It was bought at a cheap price and it was used for brewing and distilling. I defy the brewers or the distillers to contradict that statement.  We have had certain cases where they objected to the quality.  One particular firm took in a quantity of short straw barley which they said previously was not fit for using for the liquor trade. <Col N="830" /> They forgot that they had said that, and they could not distinguish it from the other.  I think that is the situation that we should consider.  There is another point that I want to bring before the House, and that is that when the price of barley increased to the very high price of 84/- a barrel, the Minister for Industry and Commerce came into this House and said that the price of whiskey and the price of stout would have to be increased because of the increase in the price of barley.  But when the price of barley fell last year, and when I tabled questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, he said that the fact that the price of barley had fallen affected only a very small percentage of the cost, and would not be reflected in the price of the glass of whiskey or the pint of stout.</P>
    <P>I think these are things we should concern ourselves with.  If the high price of 84/- a barrel for barley affects the price of stout and whiskey when it falls to 52/- or 48/&mdash;and there was a lot of stout and whiskey brewed and distilled from 48/- barley last year&mdash; the prices should come down when the price of barley comes down.  But the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the small percentage of reduction that that involved was not worth considering.  But if the farmers get a few shillings more per barrel it affects the prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I wish to point out to the House is that this amendment deals only with excise duties on home-made spirits, but it is of course customary to keep duty on imported and home-made spirits in line.  My first objection to this is based on a very sordid motive&mdash;that if we want to accept the amendment in the form in which it stands, it would in a full year cost the Exchequer £800,000.  If we were to apply the principle of the amendment and grant corresponding reduction in duty on imported spirits the cost to the Exchequer in a full year would be £1,000,000.  Last year we did not balance our budget by almost £2,000,000.  This year we are hoping to balance our budget by means of positive <Col N="831" /> economies in the Public Services, but if we give away this £1,000,000 we must replace the lost revenue by revenue from some other source.  It will not represent a reduction in taxation.  It will represent a transfer of taxation from this commodity to some other commodity, and I would like to know what the other commodity is that will yield £1,000,000 in increased taxation.  That is, of course, the important point, the point which has been very skilfully evaded by those speaking in support of this amendment.</P>
      <P>The next thing we ought to consider is this: whether it is a matter for praise or blame there is a duty on spirits in this country.  It is probably the lowest in the world, and the price of spirits in this country is probably among the lowest in the world. Certainly, if we do pay 3/6 for a glass of whiskey here let us not forget that people on the other side of the Border pay 5/-, and I think, in Great Britain, they pay 5/3.  And they buy their whiskey, if you like, in the despised &ldquo;nip&rdquo; of which I think Deputy T.F. O'Higgins spoke so disparagingly during the course of the debate.</P>
      <P>Let us examine some other significant figures, but before I come to them I want to say this: that in dealing with the distilling industry and with those who stand in an intimate position between the distillers, on the one hand, and the consumers on the other, we are dealing with a very close-knit vested interest.  It has been said here there are about five or six distilling concerns in this country, some very long-established and very wealthy.  All of them made very substantial profits during the war years.  Then, between them and the retailers there stands again a very close-knit organisation, an association of wholesalers.  And then, of course, we come down to the retailers about whom I have nothing to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we have been talking here about the depressed condition of the distilling industry and of the spirit trade, it has been suggested by the Opposition that the duties which were <Col N="832" /> imposed in the 1952 Budget represent the only increase in the cost of spirits to the consumer that has taken place since Fianna Fáil was last in office. But, of course, that is not the fact.  The price of whiskey has admittedly increased by 1/- a glass since 1948. Since the Coalition Government took office in 1948 the price of whiskey has increased by 1/- a glass.  But the Exchequer only got 5½d. out of that. The other 6½d. was distributed among all those who were engaged in the trade, and there was no complaint coming from the Coalition Government or from the present members of the Opposition.  There was no talk during the period when they were permitting the price to the consumer to increase by 6d. a glass for the benefit of the trade.  There was not any talk then about killing the distilling industry, or any talk about the effect that the increase in price was going to have upon Irish agriculture.  Not at all.  It was given by the then inter-Party Government, by the Coalition, this 6d. was given with an open hand as a gesture, shall we say, to show their appreciation to those who had been such stalwart supporters of them during the elections.  That cost the consumer, you know, more than the increase in the spirit duties made in the 1952 Budget, a great deal more because there was more whiskey being consumed during that period, and the consumers had to pay on the increased consumption an additional 6d. a glass.</P>
    <P>But let me get back to the point I was making that we have a very close-knit organisation of vested interests here.  We have a very small number of distillers and we have a very well organised wholesale trade, and at the end of it all we have the retailers who will put over the dope on behalf, if you like, of themselves, of the wholesalers and of the distillers, and say that the Government is crushing the distilling industry by the taxation it has imposed.  That is all very well, and, of course, a well-organised campaign was undoubtedly conducted during the year 1952-53.</P>
    <P>During that financial year, there is no doubt whatever&mdash;and I shall give you <Col N="833" /> the figures to support what I am going to say in a moment&mdash;that there was a concerted campaign to restrict withdrawals from bond, in order that the Opposition might be able to get up and say that the increase in the spirits duty had defeated itself.  I have the figures here for the net clearances from bond of home-made spirits for the years, 1947-48, 1948-49, 1949-50, 1950-51, 1951-52, 1952-53 and for the first quarter of the current financial year.  Here are the figures.  In 1947-48 clearances in the first quarter of the financial year amounted to 163,000 odd gallons.  In 1948-49 the amount of the clearances in the first quarter fell to 161,000 gallons.  They rose again in 1949-50 to 163,000 for the first quarter of the financial year.  In 1950-51 they were 166,000 gallons for the corresponding period.  They fell again in the first quarter of 1951-52 to 161,000 gallons and then there was a catastrophic drop to 105,000 gallons in the first quarter of 1952-53 but in the first quarter of the current financial year there has been a surprising increase, an increase of no less than 50 per cent. in the clearances of home-made spirits from bond.  The figure has jumped from 105,000 gallons in the corresponding period of last year to 155,000 gallons this year and I can tell the House it is still going up.</P>
    <P>There is another very significant figure that I think I should quote.  In the month of May, of the year 1947-48, clearances from bond amounted to 44,000 gallons and in May of 1948-49, to 43,000 gallons.  In 1949-50, when there was some expectation that there might be an increase in the duty&mdash;I should remind the House that the Budget for the year 1948-49 closed with a substantial deficit and people were expecting that in the subsequent Budget there would be increased taxation&mdash;the clearance for that month jumped from 43,000 to 54,000 gallons.  In 1950-51 they went up a little further to 55,000 gallons.  In 1951-52 they fell to 36,000 gallons, but in the month of April, of the year 1951-52, they had reached 84,000 gallons, which was probably a record clearance for that month since the State was established in 1922.  In 1952-53, the clearances from bond were <Col N="834" /> a little higher for the month of May than they were for May, 1951-52; they were 38,000 gallons, but in May of 1953-54, perhaps because everybody started drinking, they jumped to no less than 75,000 gallons, an increase in the clearances for the month of May of almost 100 per cent. over 1952-53 and more than 100 per cent. over 1951-52 and the highest figure recorded for the month of May during any year since 1947-48.</P>
    <P>What does that show?  It shows one thing, that the decline in the consumption of spirits was not at all as great as would be indicated by the decline in the clearances from bond.  I am not prepared to deny that there has been some reduction in the consumption of whiskey but these figures show that the consumption of whiskey is tending to regain what might be described as its normal level, not the abnormal consumption which we experienced here when we were spending 128,000,000 Marshall Aid loan dollars, but the consumption, which was regarded as normal, of 1947-48.  The figures which I have given indicate that in this year the clearances from bond and the consumption of home-made spirits will probably be of the order of 650,000 gallons.  It is as high a consumption as was reached in 1929-30 of home-made spirits.  I anticipate that it will probably be repeated this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane gave some very significant information to the House. While we have been talking about the decline in the spirit trade, while we have been saying that people were not wanting whiskey, he was able to inform the House that one of the distilleries with which he was well acquainted was declining to supply its customers.  Now if they have been piling up, as they have been over these years, stocks in bond, why would any distiller refuse to supply customers, why would any distiller put his customers on a quota if he had not one thing in mind&mdash;to try and reduce the figure for the clearances from bond, to try and give support to the campaign which has been carried on for the last 12 months in regard to the wine and spirit trade but particularly in regard to the distillers' trade?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="835" /> There is another significant thing to which some attention should be directed.  In the course of the debate people have adverted to the important part which the Scotch distilling industry has played in providing exports for Great Britain.  They have been saying that the distilling industry here has been very slow to try to break into the export markets and we have had all sorts of excuses for that.  The Government, it is said, has been blamed because they restricted exports during the war years and tried to ensure that there was an ample supply of whiskey at home.  But these restrictions have been considerably relaxed in recent times.  They were in fact completely removed by this Government.  The people who have been blaming us because these restrictions were maintained are the people who kept them on during the period they were in office.  This Government freed the distilling trade; not only that, it has met the distillers and has pressed them to try and develop an export trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The extraordinary thing is that during one of the years there was a very considerable increase in the export of Irish whiskey but for some reason or another there was also a very heavy slump.  Whatever the reason may have been I do not know, but in the year to the 31st March, 1951, the exports of home-made potable spirits amounted to 414,000 gallons.  In 1952, that figure had jumped to 458,000 gallons&mdash;and then, of course, somebody had to show that the distilling industry was being killed by the present Government.  For some extraordinary reason, the exports for the year ended 31st March, 1953, dropped to 305,000 gallons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government had nothing to do with that.  The Government had freed the export trade.  The <Col N="836" /> distillers were free to export to any part of the world they liked.  They succeeded in exporting 458,000 gallons for the year ending 31st March, 1952, and then they could not export more than 305,000 gallons for the year ending 31st March, 1953.  I do not know what the explanation is, but when I hear talk about rationing and when I hear of distillers, who were complaining about bad business, putting their customers upon a quota, I begin to wonder whether this is not again part of the concerted plan to try and break this Government and to make the Government of this country subservient to the distilling industry and other interests associated with it.</P>
      <P>We have heard talk about the fall in value of licensed premises.  Having regard to the statements the Opposition have been making up and down this country over the past 12 months about the parlous condition to which the wine and spirit trade has been reduced, and about the oppressive taxation that has been levied on beer and spirits, how does anybody think that the value of licensed premises would be maintained? On those people who have been making these speeches rests the responsibility for the fact that people are chary about going into the licensed trade.</P>
      <P>I think that the figures I have given indicate that we cannot afford to accept this amendment because, in a full year, it would cost about £800,000 if it were confined to home-made spirits and about £1,000,000 if it were applied to imported spirits as well.  In addition to that, the figures which I have given indicate that the spirit duties are beginning to resume their old rate of yield and that the estimates we made in respect of them in the 1952 Budget will perhaps be realised if not in 1953 at least in 1954, even on the existing rates of taxation.  The duty on spirits here is probably the lowest in Europe or the world and the prices here are still considerably cheaper than they are in any other country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>This afternoon I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether he would state if he had yet sanctioned an appointment to the position of sub-postmaster in Gowran, County Kilkenny, and, if so, what was the name and what were the qualifications of the new appointee.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs answered the first part of the question all right.  He stated that a Mr. James Lennon had been appointed and added:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is not the practice to furnish information regarding the claims or qualifications of candidates for sub-postmasterships or other similar appointments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I often heard the Minister replying before when he would give reams, but apparently there is something behind this question which the Minister does not want to give away.  I further asked the Minister whether he would state how many applications he had for this position.  He said he had not that information. If he made the appointment, I am sure the Minister had the information.  He must have had it.  I hope he has it now.  I also asked the <Col N="844" /> Minister when the inspection of the premises took place and he said he had not that information.  I hope he has it to-night.</P>
    <P>This post office was taken over by the postmaster in September, 1952, and the position was not filled until last month.  I wonder what was the reason for that?  Was there a desire on the part of the local Fianna Fáil cumann as to who should get it and not who the Minister should choose?  Was that the reason for the long delay?  Is it a fact that one part of the branch wanted one person appointed to the sub-postmastership while another section of the same branch wanted another applicant appointed?  I cannot tell which.  There are rumours in Kilkenny, and especially in Gowran, that that was the reason for the long hold up in regard to this appointment.  The Minister eventually appointed this Mr. James Lennon, although there were several applicants.  In fact, there was an application from a Miss D. Carmody who since the post office was taken by the postmaster had acted there as charge-hand.  That lady applied to be appointed.  She had the use of the post office.  Her application was not accepted.  There was another application from Miss E. Carroll, who was also a post office assistant.  There was a further application from a Miss M. Carroll.  She was also a post office assistant.  All three had actual experience of post office work.  None of the three was accepted.</P>
    <P>Mr. Michael Dwyer, a businessman with a large family, applied.  He received no word and was not appointed.  A Mr. Walsh, living in the very heart of the village&mdash;he is a very good businessman, too&mdash;applied but his application was not accepted.  There was also an application from a Mr. Byrne and some others.  At the time the premises were inspected, I understand that the present appointee had no premises at all in Gowran.  In actual fact at that particular time he was a lodger in Gowran and how his premises could have been inspected under his name I do not know.  The premises he has now taken over were inspected because the person who owned them at that time had applied.  They were <Col N="845" /> inspected in that person's name.  That person was turned down and they are giving the post to Mr. James Lennon.</P>
    <P>I have no personal animosity towards Mr. Lennon.  I think he is a very decent industrious man.  In fact, so industrious is he that at the present time he is a beet loading agent.  He has two lorries for beet drawing and other haulage and he has ten acres of beet.  I understand that he has about twice as many acres of corn.  He is a single man and is unmarried.  He is now going to conduct the business of this post office.  He has the supreme qualification which everyone now needs if he wishes to become a sub-postmaster. He is secretary of the local Fianna Fáil cumann.  That is the supreme qualification which is required at the present time.  One must be the secretary, the treasurer or a member of the local club.  If the secretary or the treasurer does not get a job some private member of the local Fianna Fáil club will.  The day is gone when anybody in this country can hope to get a post office on merit.  I did not intercede with the Minister in regard to any particular applicant in this case and I did not raise this matter until last week.  I wanted to see what would happen.</P>
    <P>Here is a man appointed who had no premises whatever at the time of the appointment.  He was residing in Gowran at that particular time and, as I have said, he is a beet loading agent and has two lorries.  He is a very busy man.  Is it fair that the Minister should burden this man with further duties in addition to the duties he has as secretary of the local Fianna Fáil cumann?  The whole thing is shady. The people feel it is shady.  It looks like sheer political jobbery to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>The house which has been accepted as a post office is at the very extreme end of the village and if an old age pensioner or anybody else has occasion to call for old age pensions or widows' and orphans' benefits he has to travel the whole length of the village and up the hill to this house.  There were applications from several people in the village whose houses were very <Col N="846" /> centrally situated and who were in a position to give guarantees regarding their probity in connection with financial matters.  The application of none of these people was accepted.  It looks as if there is no hope for an ordinary man in this country of being appointed to a position on merit.</P>
    <P>My reason for bringing up this matter to-night is to ventilate the grievances of these people.  The Taoiseach spoke a lot about justice but I think this is the greatest injustice that has been done in this country for quite a long time.  I do not know how the Minister can dare stand over that injustice.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Cowan had any say in this appointment or not.  I hope anyway that the Minister will have some information for us to-night.  To-day, apparently, he was sheltering behind the statement that he had not information about the number of applicants or about an inspection of premises.  I hope that he will have full information on these points for us to-night.  I feel that a big injustice has been done to the people of Gowran, whatever Deputy Cowan may think.  As the representative of that constituency, I am only doing my duty in bringing this case forward so as to have it ventilated in the interests of the public good.  I know that I cannot do anything now to have the appointment changed.  I hope that in future, if it is possible, that this system will be changed.  If the Minister is going to stand over this kind of political jobbery he should resign his position and not be a party to it.  The Taoiseach should ask him to resign and not be a party to political jobbery in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a number of previous occasions we had trouble over appointments such as this, and <Col N="847" /> I understood that a committee was appointed in the Department to deal with these matters.  It looks very strange that seemingly the only qualification which this gentleman has was that he was secretary of the local Fianna Fáil club.  The person who held the post previously was dismissed last September and applicants' premises were inspected last February.</P>
      <P>At that time, this man had nothing whatever to do with the village of Gowran.  He lived outside of it.  His connection was with agriculture as a beet loading agent for the factory in Carlow.  He also held some conacre which he worked himself, but he had no connection whatever with the village of Gowran.  Now, he is appointed to this post.  He got possession of the premises that he now holds, where the post office is being installed, only within the last week or two.  Normally, I understand that appointments of this kind are made about two months after the previous occupant of the post is dismissed, but it has taken practically nine months to make this appointment.  It is very apparent that the whole thing is a set up to hand it over to the secretary of the Fianna Fáil club.</P>
      <P>The position in the district is that this appointment has caused grave dissatisfaction.  It looks as if it is a complete case of jobbery, and that the Minister has just handed over this appointment to one of his own because he has the political qualifications.  If that is to continue it is going to create a very serious situation in the country &mdash;that is, if appointments like this are not going to be given on merit, and on merit alone.  That will have a very bad effect on the people who are very sore about the present set-up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Deputies on the opposite side of the House, I must say that I have been rather amused at their Simon Pure attitude and towards what they call jobbery in this case.  So far as I know, when they had the opportunity in regard to jobbery, well there were just no limits.  That is all I can say about <Col N="848" /> that, and everybody knows it.  However, the Deputies are on the wrong track in this particular case.  There were 13 candidates for this postmastership and there were no unusual circumstances in regard to the facts known to the postmaster at Kilkenny. He presented the list of candidates with their various qualifications and there was no intervention on my part, or on the part of any person in the community before he made his report. The postmaster in Kilkenny presented the facts in detail regarding the candidates as well as the premises which they were going to offer.  He presented the facts to us on the 14th March with all the circumstances that were known to him.  There was no change in the circumstances, either in regard to the candidates or to the premises, either at a date subsequent to that or at any time and there was no interference in any way.</P>
      <P>It so happened that a great many rumours were circulated in Gowran with regard to this appointment, but the Deputies opposite should take more care before they try to blacken my reputation solely, I believe, for the sake of their political advantage.  There are, I am glad to say, a great many villages and towns in Ireland where postmasters are appointed without intrigues and without the strange rumours, most of them lies, which are circulated.</P>
      <P>In Gowran there were a great many rumours circulated.  In the case of Gowran, I am sorry to say I was sent a petition, allegedly signed by nearly all the candidates withdrawing their applications.  The petition was supposed to be signed at a bogus meeting. If it had not been for the intelligence of the present postmaster at Kilkenny certain people might have been done a grave wrong because of that.  I just mention that to illustrate the kind of rumours that are circulated on these occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It so happens that the Deputies have made another mistake in regard to the political circumstances attending this case.  I am sorry that Deputy Crotty did not take greater care to ascertain the facts, because it so happens in this case that there was any <Col N="849" /> amount of political cross-fire.  It was of a rather amusing kind, but I am not going to go into details.</P>

      <P>I did not say that the Deputy had anything to do with that, but I did say that, as a matter of fact, they did not affect me.  I was saying that there was any amount of political cros-fire.</P>

      <P>No.  From one side and the other.  That is what the Deputies do not like to hear.  I do want to tell the Deputies that they are wrong in this case because I had people in one political camp recommending people in the opposite political camp, including recommendations for the person who <Col N="850" /> has been chosen as sub-postmaster.  I do want to say that the Deputies opposite have been deluded by all the rumours that were circulated.  The person appointed will, I believe, do credit to the post office service in Kilkenny.</P>
      <P>As regards all the appointments I have made since June, 1951, I do not think that I have received one single complaint either in regard to bad service or to discourtesy.  No single complaint has reached me at any time and I suppose I must have appointed during that period at least 100 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  So far as their political convictions are concerned there is nothing that the Deputies opposite need worry themselves about because there is no evidence whatever that I have exceeded in any way my political authority in this matter.</P>

      <P>That is no answer.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, the 9th July, 1953.</P>
