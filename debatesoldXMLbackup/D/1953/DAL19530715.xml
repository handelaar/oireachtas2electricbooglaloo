      <P>I am informed by the E.S.B. that the Gortnahoe area has been considered by the board on a number of occasions for development under the rural electrification scheme, but has not so far been selected as its financial returns do not compare favourably with those of other areas awaiting development in the board's Portlaoighise district.  The area will again be considered in the future, but I am unable to state when development is likely to take place.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if his attention has been directed to Press reports that two United States Army Air Force officers are now giving instructions by way of sealed orders to civilian air line pilots leaving Shannon for the United States for the purpose of the defence of the United States; and, if so, if he will state (a) if he was consulted before these officers took up duty at Shannon Airport; (b) if they are there with his approval; (c) how long they will be at Shannon and (d) if their presence involves Ireland in any non-neutral commitments in the event of war.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

      <P>The two United States officers in question are at Shannon Airport for the purpose of briefing pilots of commercial transatlantic flights on certain methods for the identification of aircraft entering the United States during a test period which began a few weeks ago and which will last for some weeks longer.</P>
      <P>Before the arrival of the two officers in Ireland the United States authorities sought and were granted the necessary sanction.  Their accommodation at Shannon Airport is not only a reasonable facility to make available to the United States authorities but it also facilitates the air companies from many parts of Europe who wish to use Shannon as a last port of call en route to America.</P>
      <P>In answer to the last part of the Deputy's question I may add that the presence of these officers in no way involves Ireland in any non-neutral commitments in the event of war.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state whether his Department is able to fulfil the demand for woodwork instructors in accordance with the returns recently submitted by the chief executive officers; and, if not, whether he proposes to take the necessary steps to remedy the position in the near future in view of the widespread demand in rural areas for the services of these instructors.</P>

      <P>The Department is not as yet in a position to meet in full <Col N="1180" /> the demand for woodwork instructors, in accordance with the requirements of vocational education committees, as given in the returns of chief executive officers.  It is hoped, however, to overtake the demand in a few years.</P>
      <P>Since the year 1949, inclusive, the Department has held training courses annually for woodwork instructors resulting in an output of about 20 new teachers each year.  This is considered to be the maximum number of suitable trainees that can be obtained annually at present.</P>

In view of those circumstances would not the Minister consider increasing the number of trainees per annum from 20 to 50 so that this demand would be met in a very short time?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 72:&mdash;</P>
    <P>To delete sub-section (6), Section 49.&mdash;(Deputy Dr. Browne.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, we were discussing an amendment tabled by me to delete sub-section (6) of Section 49.  My objections to sub-section (6) are similar in principle to my objections to the previous sub-section, sub-section (5), and that is that the general tenor of sub-section (6) tends to place penal impositions on the inmates of our county homes.  These penal impositions are contained particularly in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of the sub-section which read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every person maintained by a health authority in a county home or similiar institution who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  is by reason of the consumption of intoxicating liquor drunk or incapable of conducting himself in such home or institution,</P>
      <P>(c)  does any act of insubordination in relation to an officer of such home or institution, or</P>
      <P>(d)  does any other act (whether of commission or omission) of misbehaviour in such home or institution which is prejudicial to the discipline or the good government thereof</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>shall be guilty of an offence under this sub-section and shall be liable <Col N="1185" /> on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 21 days.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I suggest that that sub-section should be deleted from this Bill because, in my view, it is very objectionable in its suggestion that the inmates of our county homes are likely to require this special consideration outside the considerations which we give to the inmates of our district hospitals, our county hospitals, our regional hospitals, where we have them, and our T.B. institutions.  According to the Minister all these people who are inmates of these other institutions are not covered by this sub-section, but it is directed specifically against the destitute aged poor who have found their way to the county home, not through any choice of their own. If they had a choice, as I said last night, I am certain they would not go to our county homes.  County homes are not places that any aged person would readily enter or choose to spend the declining years of his life, if he had a choice.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested, in fact I think it can be suggested, that these aged people on the whole tend to become extremely difficult charges and an extremely difficult problem for those caring for the inmates of these institutions. I think it is because of this great difficulty in caring for the aged that we should pay tribute to the many members of the different religious orders, here in Ireland in particular, who spend their lives looking after and caring for, in the considerate way in which they do, these aged persons. There is no doubt in the world that the majority of these aged people are difficult, that they are irritable, that many of them are cantankerous, badtempered and unreasonable and that some of them may indeed take an occasional drink and may at times be offensive to the attendants who look after them, but I still do not think that this penal sub-section is in keeping with the general tenor of our social legislation.  I do not think it should be laid down here by us that special legal powers must be taken to deal with cases of intoxication and cases of insubordination <Col N="1186" /> amongst our aged persons. If I could make my feeling on the matter clear, I would prefer a sub-section which would completely reverse the present paragraph (c)&mdash;that is, that anybody who is guilty of an act of insubordination in relation to an inmate of one of these county homes should be subject to summary fines and summary imprisonment.  That would be my attitude because these aged people are there not through any choice of their own.  They are there because most of them, at any rate, are entering into a state of senility, which means that the majority of them are not themselves, that many of them are cantankerous, bad tempered, unreasonable or even take a drink due to physical changes which have taken place in old age.  Consequently, we should be particularly careful that every consideration and every latitude be given to these people rather than that they should be treated in the way suggested in this sub-section.</P>
    <P>This sub-section is a continuation of the old attitude towards our county homes, our workhouses, which persisted right through the 19th century. These homes were set up, as Deputy Larkin said, as places to which people went through force of circumstances and not of their own free will and it was the determination of the authorities that life in them should be made as hard and as difficult as possible for these aged people.  The idea was that they would spend as little time in these homes as possible and, if it could be so arranged, they would be driven out because of unsatisfactory conditions, unduly severe rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>There is no reason in the world why the authorities cannot find legal remedies under the existing legal code in order to deal with any person who is intractable or difficult or who is wilfully and repeatedly offensive.  I see no reason why this sub-section should be introduced.  There are many private homes and institutions throughout the country and it has never been found necessary in their regard to have these extraordinary clauses in anticipation of drunkenness, disorderly <Col N="1187" /> or riotous behaviour on the part of the inmates.  Most of these institutions depend for the maintenance of order on the tact and understanding handling of the attendants and religious orders looking after these homes.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that the aged poor would be so offensive as to require special legislative clauses providing for dragging them into court is to me utterly repugnant.  As a member of the younger generation, I refuse to accept the idea or suggestion that our aged poor require these penal clauses. This is like an echo of the report of the Viceregal Commission on Poor Law Reform in 1906; the implicit suggestion in that report was that the poor were poor and destitute through their own criminal negligence in failing to make provision for themselves; that the native Irish were dirty and improvident and should be treated like animals; that they deserved nothing better.  The whole conception of workhouses was to degrade and humiliate our people.</P>
    <P>I do not think the idea implicit in this sub-section should be allowed to emanate from this House.  Our voluntary hospitals find they can run their institutions perfectly well and orderly without any such legislation.  Institutions for the aged, such as the MacGeough Home and the excellent institution in Mallow that I had the pleasure of visiting on one occasion, find they can get along perfectly well without legislation such as this.  Hotels, to which many aged people go in the latter end of their days, find it unnecessary to have any such legislation.</P>
    <P>Into these homes will go the old people who were once patients in local anthority hospitals.  We do not find it necessary to have any such legislation in connection with our hospitals.  Why should it be necessary, therefore, when we come to deal with the aged poor? The protection that should be given is protection of the aged themselves, rather than the other way around.  I am not suggesting that the attendants, or those who look after these old people, are themselves insubordinate, but I would prefer to see protection for <Col N="1188" /> the aged rather than any suggestion of protection against the aged.</P>
    <P>I admit that the inmates of county homes are difficult.  Any aged person is difficult, cantankerous, quarrelsome and intractable.  Some get drunk, though it has always been a puzzle to me how a destitute person can get. drunk sufficiently often to necessitate the enactment of legislation in order to deal with him.  Nevertheless, I think it would be a retrograde step for us to continue the atmosphere of penalty inherent in this sub-section. This is a heritage of 19th century legislation in relation to workhouses and the treatment of the aged poor. Most of these people go into these institutions because they have no other choice.  Their only crime is the crime of being poor and destitute and it would be wrong for us to accept the suggestion that they should be marked in this way.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested this legisilation is for the purpose of catching the vagrant or the person who stays overnight in an institution.  Even if that is so.  I suggest it is not worth the slur on our aged poor or on ourselves to have this legislation.  The tiny percentage of casuals can surely be dealt with without this penal enactment.</P>
    <P>I think this is a watered-down piece of legislation inherited from people with a completely different attitude and approach to the, problem of the aged poor from the attitude we have. I appreciate the Minister's difficulty. There are cases in which trouble can arise, but I really think this is a too-sweeping power.  I object, in particular, to the implication the sub-section carries.  The suggestion is that the aged must be treated like delinquent children.  I think that is entirely wrong and something alien to our feelings towards our aged poor and I do not think this should go out as the collective will of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Deputy Dr. Browne has proceeded to debate this sub-section on a basis that is not altogether correct and, from that point of view, I think I should clarify the position at this stage.  Nobody would bring in an amendment like this to <Col N="1189" /> deal with the aged poor <i>qua</i> aged poor in these institutions.  It is necessary for the purpose of dealing with casuals who come into such institutions.  I think that if any person were to visit some of the old people in these institutions he would say that this was necessary for their protection.  I say that because you have in some of the county homes&mdash;it is quite a common practice&mdash; casuals of various kinds coming into them on the night before the races. There is one particular town where races are held, and the night before all the casuals come along in the hope of making a few shillings at the races. They spend the night in the county home and when they go in they are not always sober.  The fact is that it is not easy to keep order among them.</P>
      <P>There is another town where dog races are held a fairly short distance from the county home.  There is a view of the dog races from the windows of this county home and the night the dog races are on people come into that county home and fight to get a place at the windows.  They make a great deal of trouble, so much so that it would take the Civic Guards to keep order among them in their scramble to get to the windows so as to have a good view of the dog races.  These are the sort of things that are taking place and the things that we must keep in mind.</P>
      <P>I think the Deputies should look on this provision more as a protection for the old people who, are in the county homes and who want to have peace and quiet and do not want to be disturbed by people coming in for the night.  I think that, if Deputies were to look at it from that point of view, their approach to this clause would be quite different from what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, of course, that we have not got these powers in regard to the ordinary institutions, such as hospitals and sanatoria.  It must be remembered, however, that the people who go into a hospital or a sanatorium are sent in by medical men.  They are suffering from some illness, and it is to be presumed that they go in for the good of their health.  In the case of the county homes, however, you have a <Col N="1190" /> minority&mdash;it is true a small minority&mdash; of very undesirable people going into them.  Those people are not very amenable to discipline of any kind, and they have to be controlled by rather drastic methods at times.  The Guards are not inclined to go into these places if there is a row going on.  They say to the head of the institution, whoever he may be, that he is responsible. They regard whatever may be going on in a county home in the same way as they would regard a row going on in a private house.  As Deputies are aware, if there is a row in a private house between the members of a family, the Civic Guards do not go in.  They leave it to the members of the family to settle it or to prosecute one another if they think fit.  The point is that the Guards do not interfere.  In the same way, the Guards leave it to the authorities in the county homes to deal with a row if there is one going on.  They leave it to the inmates to have it out between themselves or bring a case to court if they think fit.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we could possibly run these county homes as long as casuals are admitted to them unless we had a clause of this kind.  As I said last night when dealing with this subject, the aim is to try and get the county homes divided up, to get the various categories of people there taken to separate institutions: the unmarried mothers to one, the casuals to another and the old and infirm people to another place.  If we had achieved that, then I think there would be no necessity to apply this clause to the institution where the old and infirm were kept.  It probably would be necessary to apply it to the building in which the casuals were located. But I think the clause is necessary as long as the county home is an institution where all these people come together.</P>
    <P>I must say that I cannot see how a county home could be run without the powers laid down in the sub-section. I would, therefore, appeal to the Deputies who are interested in the good running of these institutions to leave this power so far as the county homes are concerned, at least until we get them broken up into the various <Col N="1191" /> components of the population that we have there at present.  If, as I have said, we had achieved that, it would then be only necessary to apply this power to the institution that housed casuals because these are the only people we have in mind so far as the county homes are concerned.  I would, therefore, strongly appeal to Deputy Dr. Browne to reconsider his amendment in this case and allow the sub-section to stand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister can have seriously considered the full implications of this sub-section, and that he should reconsider the position.  I think the sub-section is outrageous.  It is setting up a different code of criminal law for people who are unfortunate enough to find that they have to enter a county home in their old age or because of poverty.  I have no doubt that the Minister is really re-enacting something that was there before.  He is certainly re-enacting something that is archaic and completely out of tune with the present day.  The sub-section hits directly against what is recognised to be a fundamental principle for the administration of the law, that is that there is equality before the law: that, if an offence is created by statute, that offence can be committed by any citizen in the State.  There are no privileged or unprivileged in the eyes of the law.  Indeed, that is a principle enshrined in the Constitution which we have in this State.  I think that if the section remained it might as well be argued that it is completely unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>Misbehaviour is not defined in this sub-section.  What is the meaning of misbehaviour?  Is it misbehaviour if you do not touch your hat to some official when he passes by, or if you do not call somebody &ldquo;sir&rdquo;?  What does it mean?  What is the offence of misbehaviour which is &ldquo;prejudicial to the discipline and good government of the institution&rdquo;? If an old person complains, for instance, about the quality of the food will it be argued that that was misbehaviour prejudicial to the good discipline of the institution?</P>
      <P>The sub-section creates four new types of offences which can only be committed by persons who are in the institution and imposes a special penalty for them.  I think that if anybody cared to try it out that the sub-section would be declared to be unconstitutional because it does violence to the principle of equality before the law which is fundamental to the administration of justice.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister should insist on keeping the sub-section in the Bill because it runs completely contrary to what I understood to be his attitude towards county homes.  In earlier discussion I think I raised the question of providing homes for old people more or less on the type of those provided on the Lansbury estate in London and the Minister indicated that he had visited some of these homes and agreed entirely that that was the line to move on.  To come along at this stage and re-enact a penal sub-section of this kind would be a step backwards.  I do not think it is of any real value.  I do not think the Minister can justify it by saying that in one county home there is a window from which you can see dog-racing and that several people want to get to that one window.  Surely we can deal with it otherwise than by enacting this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not let the people into the room where the window is. You can take an extreme case of that kind in regard to anything and start making a case for it but, as regards the Minister's case, the average people in the county home are old people; the vagrants and casuals that come in for the night are a very small proportion of the population of the county homes. It would be quite easy to set aside a portion of the county homes for casuals so as to ensure that the old people who are there would not be disturbed by any noise that the casuals might make.</P>
      <P>I am speaking subject to contradiction on this, but I do not think a similar position exists even in regard to inmates of prisons.  I do not think any special power is taken to deal with them more stringently than people outside.  The ordinary law is there and it is capable of being invoked if needs be in regard to the inmates of homes and if anybody in a county home uses obscene language or is drunk in an offensive fashion, the ordinary law can be invoked if needs be.  I do not think this sub-section adds very much to the position that exists at the moment but it certainly puts a label on those who, through no fault of theirs, have to enter such a home.  The Minister should not persist in it and should accept Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment or withdraw that sub-section.</P>

      <P>I am sure every Deputy would be anxious to see the old unions and the workhouses go as soon as possible.  I am sure everybody would be anxious to see the inside and outside appearance of our county homes changed overnight if possible.  Everybody in this House, I am firmly convinced, wants to get away from the relics of these old poor law institutions.  Why then, at this stage, when we are trying to formulate a Health Bill, lay down legislation which permits the continuation of that very system?  It is all very well for the Minister to say that it is only intended to apply this to casuals but what does the section say?  It says: <Col N="1194" />&ldquo;county home or similar institution&rdquo; and what does the sub-section say? It says: &ldquo;every person maintained by a health authority in a county home or similar institution.&rdquo;  The Minister's case that this will only apply to casuals cannot be sustained when legislation with that scope is envisaged.</P>
      <P>This is a most authoritarian and ruthless piece of legislation and I would be very sorry to see it go out from this House.  I am a member of the Dublin Board of Assistance.  The Dublin Board of Assistance is an institution which was at one time the biggest union in this country.  With the moneys which the Minister and his predecessors made available and by the action of previous Governments there was an endeavour over the years to transform that place from what it once was, a union, into a modern hospital and I would be very sorry to see that that institution would continue, under the Health Bill, 1952, to have powers to treat anybody in St. Kevin's like that.</P>
      <P>I would like to join issue with the Minister on each of the points that he has raised in defence of this section. I have a note of them here.  He says, first of all, that Deputies are under the impression that this might be used to deal with the aged people in the county homes.  Let me point out again to the Minister that the section includes a very wide number of people and includes several different types of institution.  If the Minister wants to deal only with casuals&mdash;and I do not even accept that where casuals are concerned he should have the legislation&mdash;why did not he say so in the section?  The scope of this is very wide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept it that there may be a number of casuals who would come into a county home or similar institution, but these people also go into voluntary hospitals and they go into homes provided by voluntary institutions here in the city&mdash;soldiers' homes, sailors' homes and various other places.  Are those authorities given legislation like this to deal with them?  They certainly are not.  They can manage perfectly well without it.  Often when I have <Col N="1195" /> been on duty in a voluntary hospital, a casual or a drunk or some obstreperous person has come in during the night.  Did we have to have an Act or a section like this to deal with him?  Not at all.  We telephoned the police and they came and dealt with the situation quite effectively.</P>
    <P>When you enact a piece of legislation like that and allow a county home or similar institution, St. Kevin's or wherever else it may be, to deal with somebody in that manner, you immediately class it as something quite apart. The police, the Minister says, refuse to go in there.  They refuse to go in and do their job because they know that people who have no power to implement the law are being allowed to take the law into their own hands in these institutions.</P>
    <P>I think this is a matter that we would want to consider very seriously.  Take the various parts of the section.  Paragraph (c) says:&mdash;&ldquo;Every person who does any act of insubordination in relation to an officer of such home or institution.&rdquo; I would ask the Minister to tell me what is meant by that sub-section. That can cover practically anything.  Here we have a position where we have a health authority operating a county home or similar institution. The sub-section says that it applies to every person and then we have somebody who is &ldquo;guilty of an act of insubordination.&rdquo;  An act of insubordination could be anything.  Why should we, under this Bill, in regard to institutions which we are trying, in the interest of public health and medical progress, to make into decent medical centres, turn them into semi-prisons by giving them power of that nature?  I do not want to be facetious about this but a person might get 21 days for speaking to a nurse.  This is quite a ridiculous situation.</P>
    <P>This legislation was framed when there was a completely different attitude towards public health, when there was a completely different attitude towards illness in medical circles and amongst doctors.  This legislation was framed at a time when people who were suffering from mental diseases <Col N="1196" /> were treated in prisons.  What are the casuals to whom we refer?  The casuals are the people who in the old days were suffering from mental conditions or other diseases which medicine at that time was not able to diagnose and treat.  Most of these people are sick people.  St. Kevin's Hospital in Dublin is the biggest institution which will be operating under this scheme and I would say that there are at the moment not more than two or three casuals who come any night to St. Kevin's Hospital. Why, because two or three casuals come to a hospital which has 2,000 beds, should we put in a section here which allows the institution to treat every person maintained by them under sub-section (6) and the very wide scope which it envisages?  I have listened very carefully to the points put up by the Minister and I know the explanation.  When I raised objection to the section at a board meeting of St. Kevin's Hospital when we were discussing the Bill, the very able executive officer put the objections to me that the Minister has put to the House. I discussed the objections with him and, in my opinion, not one of his objections could be sustained.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister again to look into the points raised.  This is an extremely ruthless and authoritarian piece of legislation which covers a very wide scope.  It covers county homes and similiar institutions and everybody in these institutions and I see no necessity for taking on to ourselves in any hospital or institution what could be perfectly well done by them.</P>

      <P>Last evening we had occasion to congratulate the Minister in connection with another section in this Bill.  To-day, I am afraid I must join with Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll and Deputy MacBride in condemning this section. I think this could well be termed the Belsen Camp section of the Health Bill.  Last evening, under combined pressure from Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll and the Labour Party, with the help of Deputy MacBride, we succeeded in inducing the Minister to withdraw one of these penal clauses.  I hope we will succeed <Col N="1197" /> to-day in getting him to see that the inclusion of this sub-section will certainly have the county homes looked upon as Belsen Camps.  It is an awful thing that we are proposing to have this kind of special legislation.</P>
      <P>I am not a bit convinced by the Minister's reply to the points made by Deputy Dr. Browne.  The Minister clearly stated yesterday that he hoped when this Bill came into force the county homes, as such, would just shelter aged people who had not the means to keep themselves outside, that he had plans, as a result of which he hoped all the casuals would be transferred elsewhere and the unmarried mothers put into some other institutions. We must look upon this as a section to deal with old people.  Would any of us like to think, if our mother had to go into a county home and if, through forgetfulness, she omitted to do something required by the regulations, she would be liable to be dragged before the courts and imprisoned for 21 days?</P>
      <P>As one Deputy of the Labour Party I will never consent to the passing of any Bill which contains such a provision.</P>
      <P>The story about the casuals is ridiculous.  I am certain that the county home in my county is no different from those in the West of Ireland.  Admission is by ticket.  It is usually given by the relieving officer, and you are not let in after a race meeting unless, with the connivance of the relieving officer, you can get in to stay for the night.  I am doubtful that there are people going to race meetings who take the advantage of lodging in the county homes.</P>

      <P>That is not so.  If people on a race night wanted to go into a county home I am quite sure that a reason could be found for refusing them.  Is it not also true that this could <Col N="1198" /> be prevented by closing the gates at 4 or 5 o'clock?  That is done regularly even when there is not a race meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would, and I have done it.  As long as there are needy persons outside I would object to refusing them admission.  The Minister should not shelter behind these fictitious persons going to a race meeting.  This is a penal clause which I imagine was put in by the officials. It is a hang-over from the old days, and every Deputy should protest against it and say we will not have any going back to the workhouse days. The Minister's statement that these persons cannot be refused admission is ridiculous.  There is no such law. The relieving officer has to satisfy himself that the person is in need of shelter.  I have seen people refused time and again.  The police can come in answer to a phone message and take them away from outside the gate if they are kicking up a row.  The Minister says that the police cannot go into a private house.  That is so, unless it is on the invitation of the person in charge of the house.  They can go in then.  If I have visitors in my home and they attempt to murder me, I can call on the police to come in and protect me, and they would be compelled to come in.  The same thing applies to casuals in county homes.  If they attempt to murder somebody, on receipt of a phone message the police would come and remove them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see no reason at all for this provision. It is a desperate thing to think that progressive legislation in the form of a Heath Bill should have these relics of the old Dickens days tied on to it.  I appeal to the Minister to see the light of reason and to do as he did last night on the other section, remove the sub-section.  In fact, I think the removal of the whole section would be an excellent idea.  In the next section the Minister takes power to say that certain people need not be allowed in.  Under the next section he can stop race goers from <Col N="1199" /> going in and let the ordinary people enjoy, if you like to put it that way, the amenities that the county homes will give them in future without any threat of a term in jail hanging over their heads for any act of omission or commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The next section which the Deputy refers to gives the Minister power to make a regulation to exclude certain people.  But, of course, the whole idea of the county homes is that they should be places where people who are destitute and who cannot get accommodation elsewhere must be admitted.  We must keep that in mind.  I have been trying to get this Bill for many days.  I am beginning to despair, because I think people are mistaking licence for liberty.  Liberty is all right, but you must remember that the old people in these places must have liberty to live and sleep and so on.

You might as well say you should have no law relating to murder because only a few people commit murder.  It is for the sake of the few, of course, we are legislating, for the few blackguards that might come in and kick up a row in the county home. It is only for these we are legislating. I am determined as far as this clause is concerned to guard the decent old people in these institutions and see that the governors and so on are able to deal with the people who come in.</P>
      <P>Somebody said to me that I was thinking of one particular institution where a window overlooks a dog track. I took that as an example that could be given, but surely if I take an example, it is not to be gathered from that that I am only dealing with that individual case.  I could give several examples.  We want to divide up these county homes, yes, but until they are divided up we must continue to protect the old people.</P>

      <P>Most Deputies will have a great deal of sympathy with the points of view put forward by Deputy Dr. Browne, particularly in so far as he stressed the position of the aged and the infirm.  We are all anxious to see that the aged and infirm in the county homes enjoy at least as good treatment as in the voluntary hospitals or institutions but I think we have got to be reasonable in this matter.  We must recognise that there is a statutory obligation on our county homes at present to accept able-bodied people who are destitute.  A person may not be very orderly or very amenable to law or discipline, but if he fulfils the qualification of being destitute the <Col N="1201" /> county home must, under existing law, admit him.  It is therefore necessary that something should be done to protect the other infirm patients there and also to protect the very deserving people who are running those homes. Deputy Dr. Browne referred very eloquently to the services rendered by religious orders in those various institutions.  They have a very difficult task to perform and they do perform it with great zeal and self-sacrifice and I think nobody can deny that.  It would be wrong to refuse to afford them the little protection that is provided in this section pending the time when those county homes will be divided and become&mdash;the county homes proper&mdash;purely nursing homes for aged and infirm people.  But whatever happens it will always be necessary for the State to provide shelter for able-bodied and completely destitute people, and as long as that is so, that some sort of shelter must be provided for these people, it is essential that special legislation will be there as far as those institutions for the sheltering of the able-bodied destitute are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputies on all sides should be reasonable in this matter, and I think there is a certain amount of exaggeration in regard to the position. Deputy MacBride suggested that the problem of able-bodied people coming in and fighting for a particular window from which to view a dog track could be solved by closing up the window, in fact, by turning the county home into a sort of Black Hole of Calcutta with no admission of air or light.  The problem is not so easy of solution.  As long as there are a few and comparatively only a few able-bodied destitute people there is a statutory obligation on the local authority to provide accommodation.  So long as that position remains special legislation is necessary in order to ensure that the shelter and accommodation to be given can be given without doing harm to other people or those people themselves. There is no comparison whatever between the county homes which must admit able-bodied destitute people and the voluntary hospitals or nursing homes of any kind which may <Col N="1202" /> refuse to admit persons who are disorderly or who misconduct themselves. I understand that the various homes for disabled people run by religious orders and by other wellmeaning people refuse admission to people who make themselves obnoxious and who do not conform to any rules of discipline.  They can refuse to admit those people, but the county homes cannot refuse to admit people who fulfil the only qualification required, namely, that they are destitute.  As long as that position remains, something should be done about it, but I think the Minister might be able to, meet objections, perhaps, by some rewording of the section so as to differentiate between the able-bodied ambulant persons or casuals and the ordinary infirm patient.  I do not know.  It may be difficult to draft such a section, but some compromise might be found possible.  Certainly nobody wants to impose any hardship or indignity upon the deserving, aged people who find it necessary to avail of the county home accommodation.</P>
    <P>This whole discussion reveals the urgent need for the immediate implementation of the reforms which the Minister has suggested, namely, the segregation of the different types of patients so that we shall have instead of the present type of workhouse, homes for the aged and infirm to which no able-bodied person can be admitted. We must then, of course, provide separate institutions for able-bodied people and there again, I think, provision will in that case be found necessay in respect of the separate institutions that may be established for the able-bodied casuals and people of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say I have the greatest sympathy in the world with the Minister in dealing with this Health Bill generally.  I know perfectly well he has gone through a lot since this Bill came before the House, and I sympathise with him in having to put up with the criticism levelled by the main Opposition Party.  But I want him to understand that this, now, is an attempt by the more progressive elements in the Opposition and among <Col N="1203" /> the Independents to deal in a constructive way with the measure before the House.</P>
      <P>As so many constructive suggestions have been put forward, I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that the people who have spoken so far on this sub-section are engaged in an attempt to prevent the re-enactment of legislation in this House to which we are totally opposed.  There is no doubt that what is contained in sub-section (6) is a carry-over from former days which we should all like to see removed. No Deputy worth his salt would like to have his name associated with the re-enactment of legislation which for years we have been endeavouring to remove.  The Minister has stated that his sole aim at the moment is to protect old people from the blackguards who come in at night, to allow the old people to sleep in comfort and to ensure that these blackguards who come into these institutions according to the Minister are dealt with in a proper manner.  In order to give effect to that intention the Minister takes some extraordinary powers in this sub-section in which you have paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  I do not want to bore the House by reading them out, but in paragraph (d) it is provided that every person maintained by a health authority in a county home or similar institution, who does any act (whether of commission or omission) of misbehaviour in such a home or institution, which is prejudicial to the discipline or good government thereof, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 21 days.  In order to protect old people from a few blackguards that very wide legislation is being enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister decided&mdash; and I congratulate him on it&mdash;to accept an amendment tabled by Deputy Dr. Browne to delete sub-section (5) under which a health authority, as a condition of the granting of institutional assistance to a person, might require him to perform such work as the authority considered suitable to his sex, age, strength and capacity.  That sub-section, as I say, <Col N="1204" /> was withdrawn but now we find in the following sub-section that where any person maintained by a health authority in a county home does any act, whether of commission or omission, of misbehaviour he is liable to the penalties I have mentioned.  Is it not a fact that in sub-section (6) the Minister is taking unto himself the powers which he already sought under sub-section (5) so that although he has given way on one sub-section he is still retaining the powers which he sought in that sub-section in the following sub-section?  I think that to be logical the Minister having accepted the suggestion of Deputy Dr. Browne to delete the previous sub-section should also agree to delete this sub-section.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point I want to make with regard to the blackguards, as the Minister described them, who may come into county homes and disturb old people.  I know for a fact that one of the reasons why the Garda Síochána will not interfere at the moment when these disturbances occur is that they know that the power is there for the local authority to take action themselves. Naturally enough, no superintendent or sergeant of the Garda will interfere when he knows the power already exists for the local authority themselves to take the necessary action. The Garda are not inclined to act outside their own duties when the power is given, as the Minister wants in this sub-section, to the local authority to take action.  If however that sub-section was removed, the Guards will do their duty as they do at present when called into private institutions.</P>
    <P>If there is a row in a county home as a result of two or three of these &ldquo;boyos&rdquo; having taken a few extra &ldquo;jars&rdquo;, it is quite a simple thing for the responsible authority to ring up the Garda Síochána and within ten or 15 minutes that little fracas will be dealt with.  There is no need to insert specifically in legislation powers to enable the local authority to deal with these matters themselves.  I think the Minister, having taken such a progressive line on this health legislation in <Col N="1205" /> regard to other matters, should withdraw this sub-section.</P>

      <P>I agree with everything that has been said in the debate on this amendment except the remarks of the Minister.  I think it rather unfair of the Minister, at a time like this, to infer that there is an attempt at obstruction, at least by the people who have spoken here on this amendment because it is the desire of the Labour Party, in any case, to have the Bill enacted as quickly as possible and any remarks we make or any amendment that might be proposed from this side, are designed merely to improve the Bill. That was the approach of the Labour Party on the Second Reading of the Bill.  Our remarks are designed to get information and to be as helpful as we can in having this Bill enacted as speedily as possible.  There is no necessity for me to reiterate the objections that were mentioned by Deputy Dr. Browne who proposed this amendment but I should like to mention a few points that occur to myself. The first point is that people who are maintained in an institution such as the county home must have as their first qualification, destitution.  If some of these people are charged with insubordination, misbehaviour, or the breaking of any type of regulation, they will be charged by the local authority which in most cases will be the county council.  The county council will have their solicitor representing them at the District Court but who is to defend the unfortunate person who has been described as a delinquent?  As I said a moment ago the first qualification for these inmates is destitution and I think anybody will agree that if these people are charged with insubordination or misbehaviour, they will not get a fair crack of the whip unless they have adequate means at their disposal for their defence.  The Minister has not indicated to us whether free counsel or free legal aid will be provided by the local authority which charges them.</P>

      <P>No, they would not have the advantages that a local authority would have.  I would seriously ask, if we are to enact this type of legislation, why should we not introduce similar legislation for hotels, cinemas, theatres or concert halls?  I would not place much importance on the arguments that were put forward by the Minister when he said the Guards were reluctant to go into the county homes.  The Guards are reluctant to go into hotels if there is a row.  The Guards will always think twice before they go into a dance hall in order to prevent a row.  The Guards will think twice before they go into a public-house even though they hear the din inside.  The usual procedure is that the manager of a hotel, or some other official or employee, calls the Guards on the phone.  In a cinema the manager will summon the Guards if there is a row kicked up and a Guard is promptly on the scene.  The same thing applies in relation to dance halls and other places of public assembly. In particular, I give the example of the hotel.  The Minister made the point that no person can be refused admission to a county home and it is, therefore, difficult to keep out the blackguard and the rascal.  The same argument could be put forward in relation to hotels.  So far as my information goes, the hotel proprietor has no right to refuse anyone who presents himself to be bedded down for the night or fed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> I do not think that the Minister's argument has impressed many of us here.  I find it difficult to believe that race-goers of the type the Minister described can get free accommodation in the county home on the night before a big race meeting in a particular town.  I think that would be stretching State charity a little too far.  I am perfectly certain the local authority can prevent people from using county homes as hotels.  That may have happened, but it is not the casuals who are at fault: it is the people in charge of the homes who are at fault. The Minister cited that example as a practice that is carried on.  Surely the officials could use their ingenuity to prevent that practice.  As far as I know officials can prevent a county home being used as a hotel before a race meeting.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Kyne was right when he described this section as the Belsen Camp section.  I find it somewhat extraordinary that we should have to legislate in such a strong form for blackguards, who are in a small minority, when the fact is that this penalty of 21 days' imprisonment can well be applied to some unfortunate inmate who errs unconsciously and who, if this is passed into law, will have to go to the District Court without legal aid to prove that what he did was in fact a real error on his part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a good deal of misunderstanding in relation to the purpose of this sub-section. The sub-section does not affect the right of the management of a county home to call in the Guards. At the same time it does not confer upon the authorities any additional rights to maintain order or discipline. The purpose of the sub-section is to create a new set of offences applicable only to the inmates of county homes. It will not give the manager one iota of power as regards the calling in of the Guards other than the power he has at the moment.  It creates four new sets of offences and creates a punishment in respect of each of these offences.  In other words the section says that there will be the black citizens who are in these county homes who are liable to certain penalties, but that the white citizens who are not in these homes cannot be convicted of these offences.  It sets up two separate codes of law, one in respect of old people, the unmarried mothers and so on who are in these homes, and one in respect of the ordinary citizen who <Col N="1210" /> is not in these homes.  That, I think, is a very fundamental objection.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with the objections which have been put forward by the other Deputies.  If you like, the objections put forward have been in the main on humanitarian grounds and on a psychological approach to the problem.  I endorse everything that they have said in that respect.  It seems to me that there is the very important principle that we are now enacting a law which imposes special penalties and creates special offences in respect of a limited class of persons who, mainly because of poverty, find themselves in one of these homes.  This, as Deputy MacEoin remarks to me, is a Public Safety Act applicable only to the inmates of these homes.  Therefore, I think the Minister should be patient with us and not become intolerant of criticism because this does raise a completely new principle.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Allen referred to the question of the maintenance of discipline in the Army.  As far as I know the only case in which special offences are created are in regard to the Army, and, God knows, I think we hedged them in the Defence Bill and in the Constitution with a tremendous number of safeguards to ensure that persons subject to military discipline may be tried in a different way or may suffer different penalties.  That has caused, not merely this Parliament, but every Parliament in the civilised world a considerable amount of trouble and difficulty. By this sub-section, you are adding a third category of people. We will have the ordinary citizens, the ordinary civilians of the state; we will have the Army, those subject to military discipline, and now we will have a third category composed of persons subject to a special code of law applying to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, this does not add one iota to the powers which the management of the county homes have for enforcing discipline in the county homes.  It is quite easy to make capital on one side or the other as to the type of person who goes into the county home.  But let us face realities. The fact is that 95 per cent. of <Col N="1211" /> the inmates of the county homes are old people who are destitute, with probably a percentage of unmarried mothers.  The number of troublesome cases is fairly small.  I do not want to emphasise the example which the Minister took of the county home where there is a window overlooking a racecourse.  But, surely, it should be possible to set aside, in every county home, one or two rooms into which the troublesome type of casual could go for the night.  If a person were intoxicated it should be possible to have a room into which that person should go so as to keep him away from the rest of the inhabitants.  I am certain that is done in practice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen referred to the need for the maintenance of discipline in the Army.  We are not dealing with the Army here.  We are dealing with the very opposite, with weak, old defenceless people.  Several references have been made, I think on both sides of the House, to the reluctance of the Guards to go in.  This sub-section will not affect the willingness or unwillingness of the Guards to go into a county home.  If they are called in, presumably they will go there and carry out their duty.  That is a matter for the Guards.  If a person rings up the Guards and tells them that there is noisy behaviour in his home it is the duty of the Guards to investigate that.  If there is a danger of a breach of the peace being committed, it is the duty of the Guards to intervene.</P>
    <P>The sub-section creates a number of offences.  One is the offence of insubordination. What does that mean?  Insubordination is not an offence under the civil law.  It is an offence under military law, and there are definitions of insubordination under the military code of law.  I do not see how that code of law can be applied to old people in the county homes.  It would be ridiculous.  What then does it mean?  Does it mean a refusal on the part of some old person in the county home to do something that he is ordered to do by an attendant&mdash;for example, to refuse to get up in the morning.</P>

      <P>What is the definition of misbehaviour?  Probably most members of this House could be accused of misbehaviour when they become irrelevant or rowdy in the course of their speeches in the House. I think that the Minister should yield to the pressure which has come from all sides of the House in regard to the sub-section.  I do not think there is any need for a sub-section of this kind at all.  If the Minister has the need, there is a simple way by which he could get over it.  That is, instead of the sub-section, to include a provision to provide that any act which would constitute an offence, if committed in a public place, shall constitute an offence if committed in a county home.  In making that suggestion to him, I was thinking of the cases that the Minister might wish to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an offence for a person to be drunk in his own home, but it becomes an offence if he is drunk in a public place.  Likewise, it is not an offence to make as much noise as one likes in his own home, but it is an offence to make noise in a public place and disturb the peace of the neighbourhood. If the Minister's case amounts to this, that he has no power to prevent persons from getting drunk in county homes and is unable to prevent it by the ordinary running of the place, or if he says that he has no power to prevent people from being noisy in the county home on the ground that it is not a public place, he can get over that difficulty by including in the Bill a short section saying that any act which constitutes <Col N="1213" /> an offence if committed in a public place shall likewise be an offence if committed in the county home.  I do not think he has need for that actually. I think the ordinary common sense of the management of the county home should be able to prevail and obviate the necessity for any penal clause of this kind.  Certainly, it would be outrageous to ask the House to pass the sub-section as it stands now.  I am sure the Minister agrees. He should withdraw it and not waste any more of our time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish is surprised that people go to the county home on the eve of a race meeting.  If he lived in a locality where there are race meetings he would know that that is a fact and that the Minister is making an understatement.  If he were a member of a public board he would know the trouble that occurs again and again as a result of people coming in. The Act lays it down that a person must get in for shelter and maintenance if he has not shelter and maintenance. Existing legislation lays it <Col N="1214" /> down that they can go to a warden in Mullingar or any other town for a ticket which will admit them.  That is honoured more in the breach than the observance.</P>
    <P>They apply, Sometimes, not always, and not in the majority of cases, they are intoxicated.  They are taken in and treated humanely.  As a member for 25 years of the Westmeath County Council and having been on the board of health for a number of years, I know of cases that have occurred again and again where rows have been created by these people.  They have created trouble for the nuns and trouble for the nurses.  The old people who have been in the homes for years have been disturbed.  They made life impossible through the night until the Guards came on the scene.</P>
    <P>These are the actual facts of the case.  These casuals come along on the eve of Mullingar races, on the eve of Mullingar show, very often on the eve of Mullingar fair&mdash;there are 14 fairs in the year&mdash;and they give immense trouble.</P>

      <P>I feel that we are wasting a tremendous lot of time on this section.  In my view the section as it stands should not have been put into the Bill at all.  We must have a reasonable approach to a problem that exists.  Whether a person is in a hotel or a county home or anywhere else it is only reasonable to expect him to behave himself.  That is a fundamental point on which we would all agree.  If he does not behave himself, if he is in a hotel he can be thrown out.  I take it the same can apply to a county home or institution.  If a person becomes obnoxious to the inmates there is no obligation to keep him there.  That is the first consideration.  If an institution is provided for a number of people, no individual should be permitted to make life a hell for the other inmates.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I am inclined to the view that the draftsman took this section out of an old Act and wrote it in and that there is an attempt being made now to justify the section. You can make grounds of justification of some kind.  You can defend anything. It is part of my profession to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>One can defend anything.  Deputy Allen and the Parliamentary Secretary are endeavouring to defend this section on certain personal knowledge that they have of things that have occurred in the past. Let us look at the section.  Obviously, if an institution is to be run, there must be some regulations in regard to it and those regulations must be <Col N="1216" /> obeyed.  They are just like traffic regulations. If they are not obeyed there has to be some penalty for not obeying them.  What that penalty is is a matter for consideration.  In my view it is not the sort of penalty that is provided in the section.</P>
      <P>We come to the next matter&mdash;a person who is drunk.  The ordinary law refers to a person who is drunk and incapable.  The ordinary law does not convict a man of being drunk; he has to be drunk and incapable or he must be drunk and kicking up a row or drunk and riotous, or something like that.  If you are simply drunk, it is no offence unless you happen to be in the driving seat of a motor car or driving along the road.  If an inmate is drunk he can be dealt with under the ordinary law, if he is drunk and incapable or if he is drunk and riotous. You come to a very queer point in sub-paragraph (b) that if by reason of intoxicating liquor he is incapable of conducting himself, he commits an offence.  That is the sort of thing that should never be written into legislation &mdash;that he is incapable of conducting himself.  A lot of people even in this House are not capable of conducting themselves at times.</P>
      <P>This is the sort of thing which, in my opinion, should not be written into legislation: &ldquo;does any act of insubordination in relation to an officer of such home or institution....&rdquo;  We have reached the crossroads I suppose now.  I do not know whether we are going into civilisation or where we are going, but for more than 100 years we have had experience of penalties for insubordination and what was insubordination in the old days.  That a human being should express himself in front of a minor official is considered insubordination.  I would not stand for the insertion in any Bill of a provision that an unfortunate person who simply expresses himself, perhaps forcibly in the way Deputy Dillon might express himself, to an officer of an institution is guilty of insubordination. I do not think it is right and I do not think we ought to have it in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> Then we come to the last sub-section: &ldquo;does any other act (whether of commission or omission) of misbehaviour in such home or institution which is prejudicial to the discipline or the good government thereof.&rdquo;  I have had many years' experience in the Army and we used to have a section in the Army regulations, Section 68, that anybody who walked in such a way that his corporal or sergeant did not like was guilty of an act prejudicial to good order and military discipline.  No section has been abused so much during my 30 years' experience as that particular section.  You almost had to crawl on your hands and knees to avoid committing that offence, if some superior happened to be around. We do not want that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>If this section is passed, and if there was an attempt to put it into force, we would be creating an instrument of tyranny for petty minor officials in these county institutions.  I am all for reasonable regulations, reasonably enforced, in any institution, just as we have them in this House.  But I think that the draftsman in this case got a section out of an old Act, perhaps more than 100 years old, and put it in and now there is an attempt made to justify it.  We want to get this Bill passed and into law as quickly as we can.  I ask the Minister to say that, having heard the views expressed by Deputies, he will have this section reexamined and then we can talk about it on the Report Stage if necessary. Deputies have expressed themselves very forcibly in regard to it. The Minister will realise that this is really an argument between two things, between the old approach and the new approach, and I think the Minister, when he has time to consider what has been urged by Deputies, may be able to bring in a section which will be considered to be reasonable by this House.  I ask him to do that now and let us get on with the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the explanation by the Minister and I ask him to have patience with us.  As Deputy Corish said, I think the majority of Deputies have quite honestly spoken from the deepest conviction <Col N="1218" /> in regard to this matter.  Speaking for myself, I think it can hardly be said that I am attempting to hold up the passage of this Bill through the House.  Nothing could be further from my mind, because all that the Minister has suffered during the discussion of this Bill has been suffered equally by me in the attempt to delay its passage through the House.</P>
      <P>I objected to this section and I still object to it.  I believe that it is a reflection on the aged persons in our county homes.  As they are in the majority in our county institutions, I consider that this is sectional legislation against a group of persons who are destitute, legislation against persons who are either aged or who are in these places because they are paupers.  I believe that this sub-section is a direct descendant of all the obnoxious, objectionable legal impositions carried out in the atmosphere of landlordism and in an attempt to degrade our people in the centuries gone by.  I do not think that is an exaggeration.  It is a perfectly just criticism of this sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to notice that in this report which I have mentioned on a number of occasions of the Viceregal Commission on Poor Law Reform in Ireland issued in 1906, which was a most ludicrous document practically in every section, on page 54, chapter 211, this explanation is given about the casual or vagrant wards: &ldquo;Admissions very often to the vagrant ward of a particular workhouse for the night are far more numerous on the eve or on the night of general popular assemblies, whether cattle fairs, markets, races, or athletic sports.&rdquo;  That was the explanation given to the Government in 1906. I do not think it is an explanation which we can accept in 1953 as a justification for this sub-section.  It is a slur on our aged poor people and even on our vagrants.  I believe that if the vagrants are handled in the right way it is possible to deal with them without these penal clauses.  Even if it were not possible, as Deputies on all sides have pointed out, particuarly the legal Deputies who have knowledge of these matters, the Guards have a right to come in if called upon and help anybody such as a Reverend <Col N="1219" /> Mother or whoever may be running these institutions.  As I said, our existing voluntary institutions of this kind do not require this legislation.  People running these institutions or even <i>bona fide</i> public houses can deal with blackguards by calling the Guards if they feel it is necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is good enough that we should merely get an assurance from the Minister that there is no implication on the character of our aged persons.  In this section it is clearly implied that if an old man in one of these institutions gets a few shillings from home or from relatives in America or elsewhere and goes out and has a few drinks and is a little truculent when he comes back, the official can use this power.  Nobody has fought the more&mdash;shall I say&mdash;reactionary Deputies in this House than I have on this question of the delegation of power to officials.  I think that it is highly dangerous.  I think our answer is perfectly sustained.  If we are careless about the type of legislation we entrust to our paid officials they will carry out only that which we enact in this House, and it is only in that way I can stand over the provision of legislation and the delegation of power and the making of regulations through the Minister.  I think the powers in this sub-section are much too wide and far-reaching, and while it may suit officials or official advisers of the county homes, or of the Department or anywhere else, we are the people who make the laws and we make the laws under which regulations are provided to carry out our will.  It would be very nice to provide legislation which would release an official from all his worries by providing in this House&mdash;as many of us would like&mdash;a guillotine act every time we are obstructed.  I have often wished for it myself but we always give way to our feelings that the right thing to do is to reason and wait and have patience, and we know that in time we will get it in the ordinary, proper way of democratic assembly.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in the way of discipline in institutions, there is the hard way of <Col N="1220" /> slapping a person into jail or taking criminal proceedings against them or reasoning with them, trying to educate them and to improve their conditions of life.  A majority of these people are largely vagrants, who because of the state of society in which they were brought up are now on the road and out of occupation.  And the fact that they are on the road and out of occupation is our fault.  We should have provided them with these things so that they could have fitted themselves for a job and kept out of the county homes. Anybody would think that the vagrants wanted to be on the road or went to the county home because they preferred it to the Gresham Hotel.  I think we should be very much more lenient and much more understanding of these people's problems.  We should tend at all stages to protect them to the best of our ability against the fruits of our own inadequacies as Governments in not providing them with employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen tended to attack Deputy Kyne because he said that he wished to defend the itinerants who go the road and expect to get food and shelter and so on.  If Deputy Kyne does not want to defend the itinerant and anybody else who is in need of such protection, I do.  Just because they are vagrants or tramps or because they are aged or poor or destitute, that is all the more reason in my view why we should be particularly cautious and careful in interfering with their liberty.  They have exactly the same rights under the Constitution as any of us here or in the Gresham or Shelbourne Hotels, or as any person of wealth.  It is in defence of that liberty which I hold above everything in spite of the accusations that have been made against me on the matter from time to time, that I oppose this present Section 6 as I opposed the previous section. I must continue to press my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather surprised to be the subject of such an attack by the Minister because of our apparent defence of the person who goes the roads.  God knows one would have thought that there are plenty Deputy Allens and plenty Ministers and officials <Col N="1221" /> waiting to make all the rules against that type, and that he would rather welcome the fact that some of us in the Labour movement with the help of some Independent Deputies were prepared to stand up and fight for the rights of these people who have no money, no influence and no position.</P>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Dr. Browne referred to Deputy Allen's attack on me.  I only hope Deputy Dr. Browne did not intend to suggest that I was in any way drawing back because of Deputy Allen's attack from the position I have adopted not only in this House but in actual practice.  Throughout the length and breadth of the County Waterford it is known that my house is ever open for the man on the road and I have become unpopular with officials in the County Waterford on this account and please God I will not seek their grace if it is to the detriment of the man of no money and what is more important to me&mdash;the man who has no vote in my constituency. No matter what the Minister says under this Act if my mother or any of our mothers had the misfortune to go into a county home and did not like the soup and refused or neglected to eat it she could then be charged&mdash;I do not say convicted&mdash; with insubordination and hauled before the District Justice.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicated it would be a waste of time, that even where such people were guilty, it would be hardly possible to secure a conviction at all.  If that is so, is there any need at all for this section if it is not going to get convictions? We all know that if you give powers and delegate wide powers to officials you might get one unscrupulous official who will take advantage of the power.</P>
      <P>I am not quite satisfied, in spite of some statement made by someone, that just because a certain section or community is in charge of a county home, there will not be injustice.  I am not at all satisfied with that.  I am afraid I would keep a watch on all county homes run by anyone because you will always get people with strange ideas who will do strange things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> I believe that the statement of the Minister in connection with keeping people awake is not in actual fact quite correct.  Taking our own county home, people who come in singing or quarrelsome are lodged in a separate ward and while there might be some minor commotion certainly there is nothing so serious that it will keep the old people in all the wards awake all night.  I will suggest again&mdash;I made this suggestion to the Reverend Mother and when I made it and it was acted upon there was no trouble&mdash;that there was nothing to prevent the Reverend Mother from ringing up the police and bringing them out as a hotel or publican might do.  The police have come in and have taken back into prison the people causing the trouble.  Surely that law is there and if it can be acted on in Dungarvan in County Waterford surely it can also be acted on in Mullingar or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I say there is no reason for this section and I would see grave injustice in it.  Not only do we not want to be connected with the old Victorian laws but surely while this section is there how can we induce or advocate to old people that they ought to take advantage of the county homes that we have provided?  We hope to make the county homes something better than they are for old people.  Surely while that section is hanging over us, all our aims will be defeated by the section itself.</P>

      <P>This is a repeated piece of legislation except in one respect.  That is that in the Public Assistance Act of 1939 this section refers to all institutions including hospitals.  Now in the new Act it only applies to county homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the purpose of the words &ldquo;similar institutions&rdquo; in the second line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Similar to county homes. The point was that we considered it was no longer necessary to apply it to hospitals, sanatoria and so on because in such institutions people are sent in by some doctor to have treatment applied and it is presumed that there <Col N="1223" /> will be no trouble as far as they are concerned.  It was considered necessary to have these powers until these institutions are divided up and old people are put into a place for themselves and casuals provided for in a separate institution. If we had reached that stage, it would possibly be unnecessary to have these powers or, if necessary, they certainly need only apply to institutions where casauls would be housed.  I do not think that anybody ever had the slightest idea that this clause should apply to old people who are in the county homes permanently, not as casuals.  That has been the law for many years but anybody listening to the debate here might well become frightened that when this Bill is passed they will be reading every day in the paper of people being brought before the district justice and getting three weeks' imprisonment for misbehaviour. Is it not extraordinary that nothing like that has happened for the last 20 or 30 years?  Yet the law was there and applied not only to county homes but to county hospitals.  I never read of such a case in the papers but the fact that the law was there gave people in charge of county homes an assurance that they had authority to deal with anybody who might create trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I always wonder how Deputies can take such a pessimistic view of the future in matters of this kind and conveniently forget the past&mdash;how they conveniently forget that for years and years this power has been there.  I do not know how Deputies can conjure up such a gruesome picture of the future of people who will come before the District Courts and of the extravagant sentences they are going to get.  I do not see how we can run these institutions without having some power there.  There are voluntary institutions in existence that provide a night's lodging for destitute people but they need not accept them if they do not wish to do so.  They are purely voluntary and if a person creates any trouble after admission, they can throw him out and nothing can be said to them.  Here we are dealing with county homes which are bound to accept these destitute people if they <Col N="1224" /> are unable to get lodging elsewhere or are unable to pay for it.  I think if they are in that position, they must at least be provided with power to deal with these people if they do not want to behave themselves.  I do not want to be unreasonable.  Deputy Cowan made a suggestion in analysing this section which perhaps on examination would at least warrant a closer investigation of this whole clause.  For instance so far as paragraph (c) is concerned, I do not mind whether that goes out or not because I do not see very much meaning in it.  If a person is insubordinate, I am very sure that if the Reverend Mother in charge of a county home brings that man before a district justice and says: &ldquo;This man was insubordinate,&rdquo; she will not get very far, so we might as well leave out that clause.  As my colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary says, our experience when we read in the papers about people being brought before the district justices is that they are not very ready in regard to inflicting sentences.  You would want to have a very good case before they will inflict a sentence and I am quite sure that on their present form, if you bring a man before them and say: &ldquo;This man was insubordinate,&rdquo; the district justice will merely say: &ldquo;dismiss&rdquo; or &ldquo;probation&rdquo;. In regard to paragraph (b) Deputy Cowan has suggested that the words &ldquo;drunk or incapable of conducting himself&rdquo; are rather difficult to interpret and that we might substitute words such as &ldquo;drunk and disorderly&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want proceedings to be taken unless a man is disorderly. If a man drinks too much, comes in and sleeps it off, we can leave it at that.  They can give him his pension in the morning and let him off.  If he is not disorderly, it will not be necessary to take any action against him.  I think however that in regard to paragraphs (a) and (d) it will be necessary to have some clause to cover them together. If an institution makes rules of various kinds, let us say to the effect that a man must be in bed at <Col N="1225" /> 10 or 11 o'clock, he must keep the rules and therefore we must have some clause to cover paragraphs (a) and (d), in regard to the observance of the rules of an institution.  Everybody knows that if a person is a little bit off the mark, if he sits up in bed at night smoking a cigarette after lights have been put out, a district justice is not going to give him three weeks in jail.  But if he is grossly violating the rules, if he gets out of bed at night and is walking around and singing, it might be necessary to take serious notice of such conduct. I think therefore we shall have to insert something in the section to the effect that an inmate must keep the rules of the institution.  The rules will be laid down by regulation and this House will have an opportunity of examining what the rules are.  If Deputies think they are in any way unreasonable, they can deal with that.</P>
      <P>There is one other point I wish to make.  Deputy Kyne said there was not very much in the point that I made that these people might keep old people in the institution awake because the old people were remote from them. Perhaps they are kept remote from them in the county home which Deputy Kyne knows but that does not always happen.  Every county home cannot make provision to have them kept a long distance away.  Sometimes they are very close to these people.  I do not want to be accused of being unsympathetic to itinerants.  As a matter of fact, when I was young and had more opportunity of talking to these people, I knew many of them in the country.  I found they were most interesting and that some of them were very clever.  Far from being unsympathetic to these people I was very sympathetic to them and very friendly with them.</P>

It <Col N="1226" /> is only to be expected that where people drift into an institution of this kind, you are likely to have some people who must be dealt with sternly. So far as I am concerned, I do not want to be unreasonable.  I quite agree with what Deputy Dr. Browne said that most of the speakers&mdash;I am not looking to my right now&mdash;were honest in the way they approached the subject. I am willing to redraft this section to meet the views expressed.</P>

Supposing a drunken itinerant comes along, is the relieving officer not in a position to say to himself: &ldquo;In my opinion that man has had sufficient money to make himself drunk.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

I indicated that the producers of chickens and boiling fowl who have to sell their produce for export are getting barely more than 1/- per lb. at the moment.  A further load in the matter of price is put upon them before they reach the British market. That is another aspect of our economy during the past year in which there has been deterioration and a falling-off as compared with the situation that existed when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture.  In 1950 the value of eggs exported amounted to £5,145,000.  In 1952, the value was £3,345,000.  In 1950 the number of ordinary fowl in the country was 18,000,000.  In 1952, it had dropped to 16,300,000.  I quote these figures to show that as compared with 1950 there has been a considerable decline in the egg and poultry industry.</P>

I know the Minister does not want to hear anything about the creamery milk suppliers.  He does not want to have anything more to do with them.  In 1950 and in 1951, when the Minister was on this side of the House, he agitated for an increase in the price of milk.  Having led the farmers to believe that he was in favour of an increase, he followed up his agitation here by seconding a proposal at the Kilkenny County Committee of Agriculture that the price of milk should be 2/- per gallon.</P>

      <P>When the Minister was pressing for 2/- a gallon the cost of milk production was 20 per cent. lower than it is to-day.  Rather than give an increase to 2/- a gallon, plus a further increase now to meet the 20 per cent. increase in the cost of production, the Minister allowed a dispute to develop in the early months of this year.  Strangely enough, although he is Minister for Agriculture, he could not be found in order to negotiate with the suppliers and thereby prevent a stoppage of milk to the cities and towns.  Nobody could be found except the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach, of course, knows nothing about agriculture or industry.</P>

      <P>I wanted to say that the Minister, when he could be found, <Col N="1230" /> and the Taoiseach had carried on negotiations and announced an increase for the creamery milk suppliers which amounted, on the average, to five farthings per gallon.  That went to meet a 20 per cent. increase in the cost of milk production.  Similarly, we have seen a considerable drop in the number of milch cows.  During the last couple of years, the number has dropped by something like 80,000.  We also have the situation where there is more foreign butter being imported at the present time than ever before in the history of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wishes to offer that as an excuse he can, but he must remember that the chocolate crumb industry was established by Deputy Dillon, the former Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be very amusing to the people opposite, but we can get the figures to show up the Minister in relation to the quantity and value of the chocolate crumb exported. I will have them later.  The fact that the chocolate crumb industry has increased progressively since it was established in 1948 does not justify a situation where our dairying industry is being allowed to decline to such an extent that in the last couple of years, the number of milch cows has dropped by 80,000.  Similarly, the number of men engaged on farm work has fallen. I challenge the Minister to deny that, even though the housing campaign and house building have been brought almost to a standstill.  In spite of the flop in the building trade, the number of farm workers on the land has not increased.  There has been a decline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>And yet the volume of output is greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>According to Professor O'Rahilly one out of every three young men is emigrating from the country.  I am not putting all the blame for that on the Minister for Agriculture because it is the Government which must <Col N="1231" /> shoulder the responsibility in that respect. But, in order to shelve his reaponsibility, we had the Minister last year establishing a costings committee. That was supposed to be a way of pawning off the milk producers, of leaving them to look to somebody else except himself and his Department for an increase in the price of milk supplied to the creameries.  It was a typical example of shedding responsibility. I feel sure the Minister knew that the costings committee would come to nothing.  He knew the various interests that would be involved when it was established, and he knew the difference of opinion that existed amongst the members, and that it was not probable an agreement would be reached.</P>
      <P>As I said a moment ago I shall deal later with the figures relating to chocolate crumb.  It is important for the Ministsr to realise that that industry was established to absorb the surplus milk that was being produced after the three years under Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture.  We have the situation now where we are importing more butter than ever before. We have had the position, for the first time, when it was illegal for an Irish citizen to buy Irish butter. That was the situation in Dublin and Bray.  That position has been eased, probably only for a couple of months, when people will again be obliged to eat foreign butter.  It is only those in the other parts of the country who can eat the fresh Irish creamery butter.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not deny the statement in his own White Paper that 800,000 cwt. of Irish butter were exported during the year 1952, and that the amount received for it was something like £134,000.  I think it was a very bad thing for the Minister and his Department to export 400 tons of Irish butter last year, and at the same time to have ships coming in from London loaded with New Zealand butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not described as factory butter in the statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If it was factory butter it was a different matter, but the Minister should have taken trouble to indicate that it was 400 tons of factory butter which had been exported.  The people are now being asked to eat what he calls factory butter or margarine because the policy of the present Government and of the Minister for Agriculture is forcing a very large portion of our population on to margarine.  In the long run, that is going to upset the economy of the Irish creamery milk suppliers because the fresh milk used for butter making will not be required if our people are forced by this Government to acquire a taste for the many brands of high-grade margarine which have come on the market in consequence of the choice of getting New Zealand butter, or no butter at all, at 4/2 per lb.</P>
      <P>As regards butter production, if the Minister tries to be critical of Deputy Dillon While he was Minister for Agriculture, let me remind him of this. Deputy Dillon found a situation here in which our people were receiving only 2 oz. of butter per week.  When I examined the figures for 1947 I found that the total quantity of butter produced in that year was 518,000 cwt. I think that was the lowest quantity of butter ever produced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the reason far that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1950, three years later, the quantity of milk produced was so great that 786,000 cwt. of butter were produced&mdash;more than our people could eat.  Our people have never been able to eat 786,000 cwt. of butter in any one year.  That was the second highest figure ever reached in this country.  It is probable that it would have continued to go up if there had not been a change in the Minister for Agriculture at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>What did the Deputy do with the surplus at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to continue answering questions but I <Col N="1233" /> will tell the Minister that we exported the surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>And imported butter to replace it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to export a surplus of pigs and bacon also in 1950 but I will give the Minister the figures for that at a later stage in this speech. I would like to remind the Minister that the cost price of New Zealand butter is something like 3/3 landed in this country.  In fact, I think it is only 2/6 landed in London.  I do not know how it gets so dear coming from London to here but it lands here at something like 3/3 a lb. and then the manipulation begins, so that before the butter gets on the table of the consumer it has reached 4/2 a lb.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister questions recently which he refused to answer. At this stage perhaps I should mention to him some of the purposes of my questions.  I wanted to know from the Minister what was the cost of chopping up this butter and putting it into lb. packets.  What was the cost of the wrappings and the paper? That information would enable me to see how much of this 11d. the paper wrappers in this country are getting. I believe it is substantial.  The public ought to be told what these people who are parcelling the butter into lb. packets and wrapping it in Irish paper, no doubt, or at least in paper that says &ldquo;Irish Butter&rdquo;, are getting. We ought to he told how much these people are getting for this service because we know that there was a racket in relation to butter about 15 years ago and at that time it was a scandal to those who became aware of it and it is possible that there is a scandal going on at the moment.  The Fianna Fáil Party were very closely connected with the butter scandal of something like 15 years ago.</P>

Has he heard some of the whispers in the Fianna Fáil cumainn regarding the price of wheat and abolishing the guaranteed price for wheat?  There is an agitation in his own cumann and in his own Party to have the guaranteed price either reduced or abolished.  The argument put forward by these Fianna Fáil members in the Fianna Fáil cumainn is: which will they do&mdash;will they have the bread price increasing or the wheat price decreasing; which would bring greater political advantage to them?</P>
      <P>The Minister should make a statement at this stage in relation to the price to be paid for the wheat crop next season because there is a doubt in the minds of wheat growers regarding the price to be paid for wheat in 1954.</P>

      <P>In reply to these interruptions from the Minister and from Deputy Cogan, I would like to ask the Minister at this stage whether he intends to dispense with the guaranteed price for wheat.  He should make that statement in his reply and he should make it clear to the wheat growers of this country in order that they can make their arrangements for next <Col N="1238" /> year.  I know that the wheat flour subsidy has been taken out of the control of the Minister for Agriculture by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He has taken over that portion of the Department of Agriculture. It would be a bad thing if we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce instructing the Minister for Agriculture to dispense with a guaranteed price for wheat because he wanted something done about the increase in the price of bread and considered that the best adjustment in relation to the price of bread could be made through the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>We have had all this talk from the Fianna Fáil Party about wheat production and all the rest.  We hear them talking about dollars as if they were made of gold.  But during the last 12 months the Fianna Fáil Government have spent something like £21,000,000 on imported wheat, which comes to something like £7,000,000.  That is sufficient answer to Fianna Fáil when they talk about dollar wheat.  They have only to look at the imports for 1952 to find that dollars to the value of £7,000,000 were spent on importing wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the Minister claiming that he and his Party were the sponsors of wheat growing in this country.  I should like to remind the Minister that in 1947 the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, put up a programme to the O.E.E.C which showed that the Fianna Fáil Government at that time intended to reduce the acreage of Wheat.  Ths acreage of wheat at that time was 650,000.  Of course we know that there was a very poor crop got from that, because it was acreage and not barrels of wheat they were interested in.  Deputy Smith at that time indicated that there would be a progressive reduction in the acreage of wheat, that it would be brought down to 235,000 acres in 1951 if the Fianna Fáil Party programme was carried out and, I presume, if the Fianna Fáil Party were in office.  But the inter-Party Government came into office in the meantime and we find that the acreage of wheat never came down to that low figure.  In fact, it would <Col N="1239" /> have been necessary to take positive action in order to bring down the acreage of wheat to that figure.  I assume that it was intended by the Fianna Fáil Government to take that positive action and to cut down the acreage to 235,000, as was indicated in the programme in 1947.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, when we did have a big acreage of wheat and a big acreage of various other crops we had at the same time the lowest live-stock population in this country for 50 years. Then we have the Minister going round the country saying that the more tillage you have the more live stock you are going to have.  But the figures for 1947 and other figures prove that that is not the case, that economics in general will dictate the relation which tillage will bear to the live-stock population.</P>
    <P>The credit for the increased acreage of wheat this year&mdash;I am talking about acres because we do not know how much wheat we will get&mdash;is due to the seedsmen because, owing to the circumstances of the time, they were obliged this year to give 100 per cent. credit to persons desiring to grow wheat.  They gave that credit because there is a guaranteed price for wheat. If the farmers were depending on the banks to give them credit, or on the Fianna Fáil Government to bring about a situation in which the banks would give the credit for the growing of wheat, we would not have any wheat growing in this country because credit has been destroyed as far as agriculture is concerned.  Interest charges on even temporary loans from the banks have gone so high and the question of security for a loan is so difficult that credit could not be given.  But the seedsmen gave credit for the seeding of the acreage of land which is carrying the wheat crop at the present time. It would be most unfair for the Minister or the Government to disregard the fact that the seedsmen are the people to whom any credit that is to be given is due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard <Col N="1240" /> to the introduction of that scheme is that the Minister found that his Government had destroyed business to such an extent, had destroyed credit to such an extent, and had increased interest charges so much that there would be no hope for farmers getting credit from the banks or even from the Agricultural Credit Corporation in order to grow wheat.  Therefore, in order to side-step the austerity policy which was being and is being pursued by the present Government, he got the seedsmen to give the credit, instead of the Government taking the responsibility on themselves to ensure that the land would be seeded.  We also know that the flour millers are to a very great extent financing the growing of wheat at the present time.  As they have a monopoly in this country, it is only to be expected that they would take advantage of the situation by financing the growing of wheat. The lime scheme pursued by Deputy Dillon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They found a situation where the average yield per acre was below ten cwt. after 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government.  When Deputy Dillon was leaving office the yield per acre of land had been almost doubled in consequence of experiments and in consequence of the lime scheme operated by him at that time.</P>
      <P>I see also that the Beet Growers' Association have now been given responsibility for the distribution of fertilisers. In 1951 something like 50,000 tons of fertilisers were imported by Deputy Dillon which would have been made available at £9 per ton to the farmers, but it was collared by the Beet Growers' Association and was sold out at something like £15 per ton to the farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in good humour to-day.  I do not know why. We have a situation in the Sugar Company where there is a credit scheme operating also and the result is that the acreage of beet has been kept well up and has been extended in consequence of that credit scheme.  We know very well, owing to the conditions that have been created by the Government, that beet growers could not embark themselves on the seeding and growing of beet but because of the credit scheme operated by the Sugar Company they are enabled to do it.  It is unfortunate that the Agricultural Credit Corporation who are supposed to provide money in connection with agricultural production do not step into the breach. If you ask them for money to grow wheat or beet they will wonder what is wrong with you.  We have a situation where wheat and sugar are dependent mainly on credit schemes being operated by vested interests, people interested in the production and who have a monopoly.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer also to the fact that there is grave dissatisfaction among various seedsmen owing to the attitude of the Minister in relation to the importation of pedigree seed.  As the Minister knows arrangements were made by Deputy Dillon during his term of office, although he was tied up for a couple of years owing to a contract entered by the previous Fianna Fáil Government.  He intended to put an end to that monopoly and the date of expiry just came about at the time of the general election.  When the change of Government came we had a meeting immediately between the Minister and those interested in the seed monopoly in order to tighten that ring and we have the situation here where the freelance seedsman is not permitted to import pedigree seeds; he must go to this seed ring in order to get supplies and of course he cannot engage in trade in the ordinary way as a seedsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> Last year&mdash;there was a lot of things happened last year&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture destroyed the market for barley in this country.  The situation then developed in which people who had contracts found that there was an attempt to dishonour them.  We have had this situation, for instance, where malting barley which should have been sold at 75/- a barrel was being sold at 48/- or 50/- a barrel because the farmers were glad to sell 20 barrels at 50/- instead of ten barrels at 75/-. Although they were only getting the lower price, all the barley was being used for malting purposes and we have the situation where some distillers bought double the quantity they required and have barley on their hands and in conseqeunce it is not necessary for them this year to purchase barley for malting purposes.</P>
    <P>The confusion caused among the barley growers has caused a considerable drop in acreage of malting and feeding barley.  Both of these acreages have dropped considerably in consequence of the positive action of the Minister.  We had the situation where the growers of malting barley were able to get 85/- per barrel in 1951 when the present Minister took office but we found in the following spring arrangements were being made to depress the price of barley and the price was depressed as the result of an agreement between the distillers and the Beet Growers' Association&mdash;I beg you pardon Deputy Lehane&mdash;to 75/- a barrel.  Ordinarily the reduction in prices was negotiated by these people supposed to be representing the producers. I think it is the only time ever that organisation representing the producer negotiated for a reduction in the price and the result was that the confusion among the farmers caused a considerable amount of barley to remain on the farmer's hands unless he was able to sell at sacrifice prices.  The Minister has refused to put a floor to the price of barley.  Last year the floor price was about 48/- a barrel.  This year the floor is the limit, as far as the drop is concerned.  This year it is probable they will have to hold on to any barley they have and of course the acreage <Col N="1244" /> under barley has dropped considerably in consequence of the manner in which the Minister depressed the price of barley during the past 12 months. I believe he set out deliberately to do that because he started from malting barley prices and worked downwards until now we have a situation where even the floor price for feeding barley is gone.</P>
    <P>Another thing that has occurred during the last 12 months is that the price of fertilisers has been increased by £5 a ton.  That increase has to be shouldered by the farmers.  That price has been increased by the imposition of a tariff.  They have put a tariff on their fertilisers of something like 20 per cent. notwithstanding the fact that in this country we are not in a position to produce our full requirements of fertilisers. Even when we can produce our full requirements of fertilisers there is a tariff of 20 per cent. or £5 a ton which means that less fertilisers will be used by the farmers.  We have the Minister advising us to use fertilisers and at the same time he has increased the price by about £5 a ton during the past 12 months.  All these things are putting extra costs on to the farmer and in consequenee the price of food is increasing. Then they wonder why the cost of living is going up.  Is the cost of living not going up?  In fact, it is being put up by the deliberate policy of Fianna Fáil in relation to production costs whether it be the production of butter, bread or any other class of food or the fertilisers which are coming in.  The Minister should indicate also the extent of the loss on fertilisers and the cost of the loss in 1951 when the present Fianna Fáil Government came into office and began to juggle with the fertilisers.  They were so busy moving it out into various farms and stores that it became concrete and a dead loss.  The country should be told the amount of that loss, the number of tons of fertilisers which were lost in consequence of the way in which fertilisers were handled during that year.</P>
    <P>Only recently we found that when the British Government offered a bonus of 6d. per lb. for spring lamb exported from this country, that announcement <Col N="1245" /> was made on the 8th June, but it was a fortnight afterwards that it was discovered by the farmers that this arrangement had been come to.  In the meantime we found that the Minister had sent a letter to the Executive of the Livestock Exporters' Association telling them about this adjustment of prices.  The result was that hordes of dealers visited farmers' places asking them to sell them lambs but not telling them about the increase of 6d. per lb. offered from the 8th June for spring lamb.  In consequence, farmers who sold their lambs at the old price sold them at about £1 per head too cheaply. The dealers knew what they were doing.  They became aware of the bonus through the Executive of the Livestock Exporters' Association.  The Minister must decide whether he is to act for the farmers or on behalf of vested interests and groups whose only purpose is to get a profit out of the farmers and out of agriculture.  At least when we had Deputy Dillon as Minister for Agriculture he was the farmers' champion.  He was the champion of the farmers above all things. The Minister is in a position to be a guide to the farmers and he should fulfil that role.</P>
    <P>Wool prices fell also during the last year.  I suppose we cannot blame the Minister for that as it was due to a change in world conditions.  Will the Minister, however, explain why prices of machinery are allowed to increase? The price of machinery at the moment seems to be unreasonable for farmers and it is certainly beyond their capacity to pay, yet the Department does not seem to be doing anything about it.  I know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the big boss but at least the Minister for Agriculture should go and have a word with him about the price of farm machinery, because it also is adding considerably to the cost of production.  The Minister can get any list of items he likes, especially farm implements and compare the price of these farm implements in 1950 with the prices in 1951, 1952 and 1953.  These prices have been advanced considerably and no excuse has been offered for that very heavy advance in the price of machinery which is used for the production of food <Col N="1246" /> and which must be paid for in the long run by consumers.</P>
    <P>A very heavy price is also being paid by farmers and the community in general for the policy in relation to tariffs.  It is probable that tariffs in this country are costing something like £50,000,000.  The Minister should examine the figures and see whether the very high prices that are being paid by the community for these tariffs are justified.  Certainly, in relation to machinery and materials which are imported for use on the land, the tariffs are not justified.  I do not wish to single out any particular item but I shall take wire as one example.  We saw recently where a tariff of 37½ per cent. was put on wire imported into this country and which is used mainly-on farms.  That means that farmers must pay £137 1Os. Od. for wire for which they were paying only £100 up to a fortnight ago.  The excuse that is being offered for that tariff is that the production of wire at home will give employment.  We must examine how much employment it is going to give.  If it will give employment only to a handful of men and to a board of directors, it would be far better to have no tariff.  If it could be justified by the fact that a large industry was being established, that would be another matter but at least the tariffs put on materials which are used in agriculture should be examined very carefully and the Minister should make sure that in the long run these tariffs will not be the cause of forcing up prices unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>The Minister arranged during the last year to sell the machinery formerly utilised for the land project.  I do not think the big sale has taken place yet but he has come into this House and made that announcement. If the Minister sells machinery required for land drainage we know that the small farmers are not going to get a square deal.  They will not have the same claim as the man who has a large acreage because the man with a large acreage will get preference from the contractors to whom the Minister proposes to have this machinery sold.  The previous arrangement was <Col N="1247" /> that the landowner, large or small, could ask the Department to carry out the work under contract.  The farmer had a choice and that made certain that the small man had the same opportunity to have drainage carried out on his land as the man with the large farm, who would be the most attractive proposition so far as the contractor is concerned.</P>
    <P>I have heard the Minister and others speak about the expansion of drainage, the acreage covered and the amount paid out.  They thought perhaps that they could fool somebody when they said that the figures were much larger than the figures published when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture. It must be remembered, however, that Deputy Dillon was merely getting the scheme under way; in fact, in many cases he was only getting in the machinery when the change of Government took place.  In addition, many schemes had been put up but had not been sanctioned when the change of Government took place.  Of course, as the work had not been sanctioned, payment of the amount involved could not be made.  Bearing these facts in mind, I think the arguments based on the payment of money and the acreage drained fall to the ground.</P>
    <P>We have seen a progressive drop in the acreage of potatoes in 1951, 1952 and 1953.  The Minister should explain why the acreage under potatoes has dropped.  We know the important part that small potatoes play in the pig and bacon industry.  In 1947 the housewife was lucky if she could get 1 lb. of bacon in the week.  When we came into office in 1948 Deputy Dillon had to put some of the bacon curers in jail for breaking the law, for carrying on illegal curing and a flourishing black market.  A strong hand was taken by Deputy Dillon at that time to end that state of affairs and the result was that in 1950 we had a surplus of pigs and bacon.  In that year 708,000 pigs were delivered to the factories.</P>
    <P>The present Government and the Minister for Agriculture boast about the increase in pig and bacon production. But comparing figures we find that even in 1952 this Government did <Col N="1248" /> not reach the figure that was reached in 1950.  One reason for the increase in the pig population was the 1951 Agreement entered into by Deputy Dillon shortly before the change of Government.  That agreement enabled the price of pigs to be tied to the price payable in Great Britain.  Prior to that agreement the British Government had taken advantage of the situation and the result was that Deputy Dillon found it necessary to bring about an agreement in relation to pig prices similar to the agreement reached in relation to the export of cattle.</P>
    <P>One reason why the pig population increased so rapidly as compared with 1947 was that Deputy Dillon, instead of waiting to convert the farmers to the growing of barley again&mdash;they had been put out of it by the price of 35/-per barrel&mdash;imported maize as quickly as he could and that maize came in here at £16 per ton.  A very cheap feeding stuff was therefore available and the pig population rapidly increased. Maize is now double that price and the farmers have to rely once more on barley and potatoes.  But it was Deputy Dillon who converted the farmers to the growing of barley by giving a price of 84/- per barrel in the case of malting barley and £3 per barrel in the case of feeding barley. Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Agriculture estimated that this country would import 700,000 tons of maize in 1951; that was the estimate furnished in relation to O.E.E.C.  In 1951 it was not necessary to import that quantity of maize because the farmers were again growing barley.</P>
    <P>The policy of the present Government has resulted in an increase of 5/-in the £ on agricultural land.  The rates have gone up by 5/- in the £ and it is now intended&mdash;we have not heard anything to the contrary&mdash;to put a further burden of £500,000 on the rates payable in respect of agricultural land because the intention is to withdraw the supplementary allowance in relation to rates abatement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  In addition to the burdens I have mentioned the farmers will in future have to pay an extra 5/- in the £ on agricultural land plus the 5/- in the £ they have been carrying since 1951.  The Minister for Finance in the course of his Budget statement said that taxation presses lightly on the land.  Does the Minister for Agriculture agree?  These burdens would lead one to believe that the Government considers there should be further taxation put on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an announcement from the Minister lately that the differential as between this country and Great Britain would be reduced from 5s. per cwt. to 4s. 6d. per cwt., a difference of 6d. per cwt.  That is not a very substantial sum and apparently this annex to the 1948 agreement has not <Col N="1250" /> brought much advantage to the farmers.  In the last two years, dressed meat and frozen meat has increased 20 times over what it was in 1948.  In three years the inter-Party Government had increased exports by ten times.  Apparently they are still increasing. That trade is of definite benefit because we have the advantage of the offals.  I am glad to learn that the Minister regards the British market as an important one.  That market was despised by the Minister and his colleagues 16 years ago when they were trying to exterminate the live-stock population.</P>
    <P>The live-stock industry is the keystone of our economy.  It represents the bulk of the money received by this country for goods exported.  We can only export a surplus.  If our land was to-day carrying all the live stock it should carry we would be in a very happy position because there is a considerable demand for meat.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister intend to do in relation to cattle hide prices?  The butchers are receiving on an average only £3 per hide and the world market price is at the moment about £5 per hide.  Yet, this racket in hides is allowed to continue. Somebody is getting something out of it, especially when we see that in the last week a tariff of 60 per cent. was slapped on leather goods coming in here.  These include ladies' handbags and other kinds of leather goods. While that tariff of 60 per cent. is slapped on leather goods coming into the country, our cattle producers are only getting £3 each for the hides they have to offer for sale.  The world price for hides is around £5.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything more on this Estimate.  I hope that when the Minister comes to give an account of his stewardship this time next year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am an optimist if I put the Minister in good humour by referring to that.  I hope, however, that when an account is being given by the Minister for Agriculture next year, and I am not referring to the present one, he will not come in with the story that he had last year. That was the milk dispute, the butter racket, the 5/- in the £ on the rates, the barley muddle, the fertiliser tariff, the bonus for lambs being handed over to the dealers instead of to the producers, and, of course, the significant drop in the value of our exports in eggs and poultry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to a few aspects of our agricultural policy that are, to my mind, the most important. In doing that, I think I will be closely reflecting the views of the people in East Cork, views that were solidly endorsed by them within the last three weeks.  Since I started to read the newspapers, some few years ago, it seems to me that the main aspect of our agricultural policy, the dairying end, has been sadly neglected by successive Governments since this State was established.  In 1923, what was known as the Livestock Breeding Act was passed.  During the years that have since elapsed that Act has been criticised in this House and outside of it by Deputies of all Parties.  It was found to be faulty, and I believe it was.  What I cannot understand is, why some attempt has not been made to change it.  I believe an amending Act was passed in 1926, but so far as I know nothing has since been done to change the Principal Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the whole vexed question of the dairying industry centres around this Livestock Breeding Act. Last year, the Minister set up a costings committee to inquire into the cost of milk production.  I believe he would be much better advised if he had set up a commission to inquire as to whether or not, or as to how and when, we can get rid of this wretched animal known as the uneconomic cow.  I would not mind whether that was done by a Minister in a Fianna Fáil Government <Col N="1252" /> or in an inter-Party Government, but I believe that if it had been done by some Minister, we could get a more rational approach to the vexed question of the price of milk, and the vexed problem of the dairying industry.  I understand that the Minister expects to have the results of the investigation of the costings committee on milk production in 1954.  These results will not be relevant to the price of milk in 1953, and will not, I believe, reflect the cost of the production of a gallon of milk in that year.</P>
    <P>The uneconomic cow is the whole problem centring around the dairying industry at the moment.  We also have this wretched animal known as the dual purpose cow.  I do not believe there is any such animal.  I am afraid that officials in the Department of Agriculture, some Ministers and some of the higher inspectors believe that we can get milk and beef together.  It is my opinion, and the opinion of the people in East Cork, that that cannot be done.  What is happening is that you are sacrificing the two.  I want to suggest in all sincerity to the Minister that he should immediately set up some commission, not in a political way but in an economic way, to inquire into the best means, first of all, of eradicating the uneconomic cow, and, secondly, of arriving at something that will give us beef or milk economically, and not to try to get one to the detriment of the two.</P>
    <P>That is my opinion as regards the dairying industry.  I believe that the price of milk, a very vexed question, will automatically solve itself if we can get rid of the uneconomic cow and produce something that will give us quantity. In other businesses, we know that it is mass production that counts.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer the Minister to the price of feeding barley.  I understand that, in a letter recently to the Knockraha branch of Muintir na Tíre, the Minister indicated that the price in 1953 for feeding barley would, more or less, be determined by the rise or fall in the price of live stock and live-stock products during the coming year.  I think the Minister should state now what the price is likely to be before the crop is harvested. There is an immediate and <Col N="1253" /> urgent desire that he should do so&mdash; that he should tell us what will be the price of feeding barley for the 1953 crop.</P>
    <P>With regard to wheat growing, the farmers of East Cork who sent me here within the last three weeks, are worried about the position.  East Cork is a place where there is a great deal of wheat grown.  There is the danger, more than a danger, that the crop will not be grown there at all in 1954 unless the Minister can speed up the investigations which are being carried on in the university into the ravages caused by the wheat midge.  Within the last three weeks, every farmer in my area had to spray his wheat against an attack of the midge.  Apart altogether from the extra cost which the spraying involves, the farmers there are not at all satisfied that spraying provides a safeguard against the damage that may be done by the midge.  I understand that the Minister is making some inquiries into this, and that research on scientific lines is being carried out into the ravages caused by the wheat midge.  In order that wheat may be grown extensively in the wheat-growing area of East Cork, I suggest to the Minister that he should push forward the investigations and research which have been undertaken so that next year the farmers may feel that they have a preventative against this attack and that they will be quite safe in growing the crop.</P>
    <P>I think it is only right that I should say that the farmers of East Cork&mdash;in fact all the farmers of Cork and of Munster&mdash;have sent me here to tell the Minister that he should take a few more leaves out of his predecessor's book.  He should now be more decisive with regard to the schemes such as land reclamation, which were inaugurated by his predecessor, Deputy James Dillon, and instead of more or less putting them in the background he should give them more publicity and put more push behind them.  My constituents feel, and recorded it in the ballot boxes, that the policy of Deputy James Dillon was much better than the policy of Mr. Thomas Walsh, who is now the Minister for Agriculture.  I <Col N="1254" /> am telling the Minister the message that came from East Cork.  He should give these schemes more publicity.  It seems rather strange that the Minister should think of selling the land reclamation machinery when it was doing such useful work, when it kept so many people in gainful employment. The Minister should not think of selling it to private contractors for private gain.  The message they gave me to bring here to Leinster House is that the Minister and the Government should decide that that machinery should not be sold, that it should be used to resume the activity for which the Minister's predecessor intended it and that the Minister should give more push and more publicity to the schemes inaugurated by Deputy James Dillon. The sale of that machinery is one of the most degrading and retrograde steps that agriculture has seen.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be more decisive.  What is lacking in his Department and in him more than anything else is some kind of progressive approach.  I believe, and the people of the country hope it is true, that Deputy James Dillon will soon be back with us.  The Taoiseach used a phrase commenting on the results of the by-election which I use in regard to Deputy James Dillon: &ldquo;Beidh lá eile ag an bPaorach.&rdquo;  'Sé mo thuairim go mbeidh sé amhlaidh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will be brief.  First of all, I should like to congratulate Deputy Barry on his maiden speech and to say that his approach to this important Estimate and this important industry was quite reasonable.  I am glad he did not follow too much on the line of Deputy Rooney, in telling us what a great fellow the previous Minister was and what a shocking character the present Minister is.  Deputy Rooney has a family tradition of farming behind him, which is an excellent one. If he would cut out this business of saying what a great fellow Deputy Dillon was and is and what a terrible character the present Minister is and give us some practical ideas from his own knowledge, it might help city <Col N="1255" /> Deputies like me to have a good approach to this industry.</P>
      <P>No matter what we may hear from the Opposition, the Dublin man will tell you that since Fianna Fáil came into power the farmer has got increased prices for many of his products.  There is no denying that. We in Dublin, who are paying through the nose for milk, butter and so on, want to know where it is going to end. Since Fianna Fáil came into power there has been an increased price for wheat of, it has been said, 15/- a barrel.  There is a guaranteed price for beet.  There was an increased price for milk.  These are facts.  Fianna Fáil cannot be regarded as an enemy of the farmer.  The people opposite find it very difficult to attack Fianna Fáil very strongly on the question of prices paid to the farmers.  They may bring in personalities but that gets them nowhere.</P>
      <P>If the farmers could do something about the animal that Deputy Barry has referred to as the uneconomic cow and give the people of Dublin cheaper milk, I would be very grateful.  I am not an expert, and do not pretend to be an expert, on farming.  We would be very grateful if anything could be done to give the people of Dublin milk at a cheaper price and at the same time to give the farmer a reasonable price for his produce.  I do not know how that will be done, but there are enough farmers on both sides of the House and we in Dublin would like them to put their heads together and give us some relief.  The Dublin man's point of view is that the farmer has been well looked after by every Government since this State was founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter to which I wish to refer.  It may not appear a very important one.  There is a very old sport in the City of Dublin&mdash;pigeon racing.  For years upon years many young and old people have gone in for pigeon racing in Dublin.  It has been banned by the Minister as a precaution against fowl pest.  I have an interest in sport and I have been approached by the national association here to see what can be done about it.  I <Col N="1256" /> appreciate the Minister's difficulty and the difficulty of his officials in regard to fowl pest, which is a serious disease and which could do a great deal of damage to poultry breeders.  The people in control of pigeon racing here tell me that they went to a great deal of trouble to see if any blame can be attached to pigeons in connection with this disease.  They tell me that the International Pigeon Federation have established on the highest authority of the scientific and veterinary world that racing pigeons play no part whatsoever in spreading this disease here.  I think it is known as Newcastle disease.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Minister to a report from this international federation.  I have a copy of it here.  His inspectors, or the Department, may have it at the moment.  It is very interesting indeed. I suggest that the Minister should read it.  He will get it in the issue of a paper known as the <i>Racing Pigeon,</i> dated April 25th, 1953.  This report gives a detailed account of how the federation went about proving that this pigeon does not bring the disease with him.  I would ask the Minister to consider the matter very seriously.</P>

      <P>You have listened to Deputy Rooney for over an hour and you will find that there is more sense in my small contribution than in his. I do not intend to praise the present Minister or the previous one.  I am getting down to points made to me. I am trying to deal with some of the points made to me by these men.  This may not be as important as the price of milk, but to these people in Dublin it is as important as the other is to Deputies from Cork.  This report from the international federation was signed by Dr. P. Schigns and Dr. A. Florent, of the State Laboratory for Veterinary <Col N="1257" /> Research in Brussels.  They went into the matter thoroughly and examined every aspect of it and they were satisfied that these racing pigeons played no part in the transmission or catching of the disease known as Newcastle disease.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consult his veterinary director and see if anything can be done on the basis of this report. The report is too long to read it, but I have studied it very carefully and it certainly impressed me very much.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister will see his way to allow the ban on pigeon racing to be lifted.  After all, you cannot control every bird that flies, but this is one case in which you can and I think the ban should be lifted. The Minister may have a serious view on it, but the report shows that there is a reasonable case to be made for it.  That is my main reason for speaking, although people may look upon it as audacious for a Dublin Deputy to speak on agriculture.  I am putting forward this case because I was asked to do it by these men who are very good friends of mine and are very keen on this sport.  It is a very popular sport in this city and I should like the Minister to do what he can to meet these people.</P>
      <P>As I said, I am not an expert on agriculture, but the Dublin people certainly feel that it is about time something should be done to give the Dublin people milk at a reasonable price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>With Deputy Gallagher, I should like to congratulate our friend, Deputy Barry, on his very effective and admirable contribution to this debate in his maiden speech.  I believe that there is great room for the expansion of the agricultural industry here and that if it were properly developed it would absorb all our unemployed in rural Ireland.  We have to face the position that it is not being properly developed at present. We know that in the Midlands the farmers are not developing the resources they have at their disposal. We know that the vast bulk of the land in that area, which is the best land not only in this country but in the world, is not being properly <Col N="1258" /> developed.  Passing through that part of Ireland anyone can see that the percentage of land tilled there is negligible in comparison with what it should be and what it is in other areas.</P>
      <P>A peculiar feature of this discussion is that we approach our agricultural problems as if they were the same all over the country.  We know very well that that is not the position.  We have some of the finest land in the world here in Ireland but we have also very poor land, and the position is that the people who own this poor land are the hard-working type who mainly produce the bulk of our agricultural products. The position in the West and South of Ireland is quite different from that in the Midlands.  In the Midlands the farmers are having a very good time. They are doing no practical farm work, but are relying on the fact that they have good land and can graze cattle on it, cattle which they buy in the South and the West.  That is not the position in other counties.  In my county we have to take off our coats and work, not for eight hours, but in many cases for 12 or 13 hours, in order to eke out an existence.  I come from one of these uneconomic holdings.  We have to be up and doing in order to keep things going.</P>
      <P>I think we must divide this country into zones as far as agriculture is concerned. What is applicable in one part of the country is not applicable in another.  You have an entirely different set of circumstances obtaining.  We should not forget the uneconomic holders and the Minister or some future Minister should do something to help these people.  It has been said: &ldquo;Why should we be asked to subsidise uneconomic holders or to help them in any way beyond the general help given to the farming community as a whole?&rdquo;  If we were to accept that contention, the result will be that the day will come when all the uneconomic holders in Cork, Kerry, Galway and Mayo, particularly the younger ones, will be leaving their holdings and going to Limerick, Cork and Dublin to try to get work in an already overcrowded labour market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contention is that some definite help should be given to these people. They reside mainly in the congested <Col N="1259" /> districts which are clearly and fully defined.  These districts are mainly along the southern and western coasts of this country.  I contended last year, and I think with every justification, that so far as the principal industry in these areas and indeed in the country is concerned, the dairying industry, some help should be given to those engaged in it if they are to continue in existence.  The necessity for that is more apparent to-day than it was then.  Even though the Minister and other people in Dublin may be complacent about the position, we find that we have to import at heavy cost a substantial quantity of butter from a country 6,000 or 7,000 miles away.  I believe that the quantity is in the region of 100,000 cwt.  Surely in a country like this, with the agricultural resources it has, that should not be the case.  It is the case, however, and were it not for the milk produced in what are termed the congested districts, instead of importing 100,000 cwt. of butter from New Zealand I believe we would be importing three times that quantity.  Therefore I think we have some claim on the Minister to see to our case.</P>
    <P>In dealing with this matter last year I pointed out that the bulk of these farmers in the congested districts are very small farmers.  So far as milk production is concerned they would not have possibly on an average more than 13 or 14 gallons of milk a day in my own immediate locality and particularly in the western portion of my constituency.  I contend that so far as overhead expenses in the taking of that milk to the creamery are concerned it is just as costly to take 12 gallons to the creamery as it is to take 100.  Furthermore a man is not in the position to get the same production from his cows.</P>
    <P>We have heard comments about the uneconomic cow and the question has been asked why do people keep uneconomic cows.  People keep the type of cows that will live in the particular area and the cows that will give a big milk yield will not exist in my constituency. People have to rely on cows in my constituency&mdash;and I say this for <Col N="1260" /> more than half the constituency I represent, and I am sure it applies also to the Dingle peninsula, to Connemara and other places&mdash;giving about 300 gallons of milk.  Such a cow is deemed to be uneconomic by the experts, but whether the people like it or not they have to put up with that type of cow.  It is mainly only the hardy type of cow that will exist there.</P>
    <P>I contended last year that such people were entitled to subsidies of one form or another.  I then mentioned that the best method of approaching this problem was to give to the creameries operating in these particular districts a sum which would enable them to subsidise milk to the extent of, say, 3d. per gallon.  That, I think, is what I mentioned last year.  The Minister is very much against that suggestion. He thought it would be completely unworkable. I do not see that it would be in any way unworkable.  He alleged it would seem very strange that you would give a farmer in one district such a price for his milk and a farmer in an adjacent one another price.  Well, there must be a division somewhere. They have a division in this country as it stands.  The circumstances of two townlands on either side of the Border differ from each other entirely, and we have to be satisfied with that. I did not then know that this was in no way unworkable so far as other countries are concerned.  I have since learned that there were similar problems in Sweden where farmers were finding it very difficult to keep in milk production.  If something could be done in Sweden by the Swedish Government it could be done here to help farmers in uneconomic holdings if the Irish Government had not been so complacent.</P>
    <P>I have here some facts dealing with the problems in Sweden showing the way the Swedish Government dealt with it.  I believe it was a very admirable and effective way.  I cannot see why the Minister could not do the same thing in Ireland.  Their main aim, as it should be the aim of every Government in every country looking after this important industry, was, first, the fixing of prices for agricultural crops based on the cost of production, giving a fair wage to the worker and a fair <Col N="1261" /> return to the farmer for his work and interest on capital investment.  It was recognised that a just figure for a farmer in what was considered to be an uneconomic holding could not be taken as the standard for price fixing purposes; the basic price was fixed on a farm of some 25 to 50 acres. The standard of economic holdings visualised for the future is from 50 to 75 acres.  Indeed that should be the standard here, too, if we ever do have economic holdings.  The Swedish farmers get a subsidy which varies according to production and disappears completely when the figure of 5,000 gallons per week is reached.</P>
    <P>In the congested districts of this country very few farmers would reach the 5,000 gallon figure.  In Sweden, the costings, in a general way, are not so different from ours, and if the Swedish Government have devised a method for dealing with that problem why could not the Minister for Agriculture do the same thing?</P>
    <P>If he believes that it would not be the best method to subsidise milk in these areas then he could possibly put into operation a scheme for the elimination of any uneconomic cows and replace them with more suitable types such as the Kerry type or some other.  I am not only referring to the mountainy districts of the country but also to districts where the land is reasonably good but the holdings small.  I am very keen on this point because I come from a constituency where there is general mixed farming, where everyone is up and doing, where we are carrying no one on our backs and where we are trying to get a just and fair price for our products as the people of that constituency have tried to get from every Government of the State.</P>
    <P>I am just following the footsteps of the Deputies who came here before me and were fully conversant with the position as it obtained.  I am sure it is typical of other areas in this country. I ask the Minister to consider some way of helping milk production in these particular districts.  In many areas they are labouring under the disadvantage that for three or four months of the year they have no <Col N="1262" /> creamery facilities whatever because they are told that it is not worth while for the creameries to operate.  No wonder then when they know that no help is coming from the Government or the last one, except when Deputy Dillon did provide travelling creameries in many districts, that we have in two adjacent townlands in my constituency seven farm houses bolted up and the people away in England. They could not get a penny for them if they were put up for auction.  The doors are locked and the families gone over to John Bull to eke out a living.  That will be the position with several more if nothing is done in this particular line.</P>
    <P>We have been told about the need for industries and I think we have to rely on agriculture which is our principal industry.  In West Cork as in many other places the main activity is milk production and our duty is to see about the people who are producing milk.  It may be said that it is not a question of merely increasing prices for milk, that it might mean increased prices to the consumer and an increased price for butter and so on.  I am well aware of that but in making plans for the congested districts, I understood two years ago that so much money was to be set aside for the development of industries in these particular areas.  Now agriculture is the main industry in Ireland and could not some of this money that is provided under the Undeveloped Areas Act be used in these congested districts for subsidising milk or for helping farmers in any other way that the Minister or advisers think fit?  Our farmers living on the islands around the Irish coast are finding it very difficult to live at the present time. Perhaps the Minister may not know so much about them, but, as one who takes a trip fairly often to five or six of them, I am fully conversant with the position as it obtains in the islands off the West Cork coast.  These small farmers have no creamery facilities except in one or two cases and these people have to make butter.</P>

      <P>We have a number of small farms in the islands around our coast and they are cut out so far as the production of milk is concerned.  They have to manufacture it into home made butter and sell it at a reduced price.  They have also to sell their cattle at £2 or £3 per head below the current market value due to the fact that they have a very limited market and are dependent on some buyer coming from the mainland.  They have also to sell their pigs at a price less than the market value while they have to buy any commodities they require at a price above the market value.  I think that the people on these islands deserve special consideration from the Minister.  There are five or six islands in my constituency and it would be very much out of place for me, or I am sure Deputy Collins, to pass over this Estimate without referring to the plight of the farmers on these islands.</P>

      <P>I do not want <Col N="1264" /> to leave this matter of the production of milk without again emphasising, as strongly as I possibly can, the need for some special provision in these particular districts.  I have travelled to creameries morning after morning myself, often with only five or six gallons of milk, and I have seen several people from West Cork like myself bringing milk from these small farms.  In time alone, it is at least a three hour job because the transport facilities in some districts are not very good and people have to travel fairly long distances.  I think the day is coming when, if something is not done for these people, milk production for the creameries will cease because young boys and girls in these places will definitely emigrate as there is no other possible alternative for them. The Minister is certainly in good humour to-day and I am glad to see that he has so fully recovered from his recent illness.  I hope he will take cognisance of my representations regarding a milk subsidy for these people in the congested districts.</P>
      <P>Another very important line in farming in this country is poultry production. It provides self-employment for many of our young boys and girls on farms throughout the length and breadth of the country.  It eliminates the need for emigration amongst these boys and girls.  We were all hopeful that this industry would be developed to the greatest possible extent.  However, unfortunately, due to one condition or another, the industry has been struck and struck very heavily in recent times.  I am fairly conversant with that particular line, and I know very well that the prices obtained for poultry and for eggs at the present time are not economic.  The people were led to believe, when chickens were being hatched early this year, that certain prices would obtain&mdash;at least they were given that impression when they bought eggs for hatching early in the year, but they were dumbfounded to find subsequent to the purchase of the eggs and subsequent to their entering on preparations for the production of poultry on a large scale, that the price dropped 1/- per lb.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister can get away with that argument.  Last year there was a price of 3/6 per lb. for chickens in season, and the price this year was 2/6.  The difference between 2/6 and 3/6 is 1/-, and the poultry keepers learned subsequent to their purchases of eggs that they were going to be paid 1/-per lb. less than last year.</P>

      <P>We are not narrow or sectional in our outlook.  We are out to give justice to everybody. We are out to give justice to the self-employed worker as well as to every other worker.  In speaking of workers, I am using the term in a very broad sense.  I am speaking for the industrious people who are self-employed in this industry which the Government is slowly but steadily killing.  The Minister may say that, so far as poultry is concerned, nothing can be done, that world prices control the whole position; but when the Minister was in opposition, he and his supporters down the country attributed any decline in poultry prices and any decline in the numbers of poultry to the policy pursued by the former Minister. Now they have had their chance but the industry was never in a worse state recently than it is at the present time.  It was never in a worse state for the last five or six years.  I am not going to go back to the days of the economic war.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to make a very clear and definite statement so far as the poultry industry is concerned.  Another very important line, particularly so far as small farms are concerned, is the pig industry.  In various areas in my constituency, and I feel sure in several other similar districts throughout the country, along with poultry the people generally engage in pig production and they are anxious that that industry should be in as flourishing a condition as possible.  We feel in County Cork that some improvements could be effected in that vital line.  We believe that there should be some more effective measure of control over bacon factories than exists at present.  Certain bacon factories have a complete monopoly of the purchase of pigs in this country.  I assert, as I asserted in other places, having a fair knowledge of their actions, that they are not giving justice or fair play and that they are using that monopoly to the detriment of pig producers.  The sooner we look after that particular section of the people the better for all concerned.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 72.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to accept the explanations given by both the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with this sub-section. I am satisfied that if it is our wish to continue county homes as such for the housing of the aged and infirm, as well as unmarried mothers and casuals who go there for a night or two or even for a period of 18 <Col N="1267" /> months, as the Minister said, it would be more desirable that we should run the risk of rows being kicked up rather than include this sub-section to minimise such a risk.  The Minister has very fairly indicated that it is hoped in a couple of years to rearrange our county homes and to have separate institutions for casuals and unmarried mothers.  In that eventuality the county homes would become more or less county hospitals for the care of the aged and infirm.  I think it would be most undesirable to have any legislative clause implying that these people would enter such homes subject to the risk of being charged in court with an offence and subject to the risk, should that offence be proved, of serious punishment.  I agree that the number of occasions on which these offences might occur will probably be infinitesimal.  For that very reason, indeed, I think it would be well to exclude this sub-section completely.</P>
      <P>A few weeks ago the Taoiseach when replying to the confidence motion before this House, stated that people enjoyed pensions and the right to go into our county homes as a right because they in earlier life had as rate-payers contributed to the establishment of these institutions.  If people have a right to enter such a home because they and their people before them have paid rates, then we should not include such a sub-section as this in health legislation here.  The Minister promised to look into this matter in response to an appeal from Deputy Cowan.  This amendment was tabled by Deputy Dr. Browne and we were satisfied that this sub-section should be wiped out.  We are prepared to support Deputy Dr. Browne.  I think the Minister should withdraw this odious sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that this legislation is the last remaining piece of such legislation applicable to our health institutions up to now.  I think that is a welcome improvement. This particular clause does not apply to hospital institutions, T.B. sanatoria and so on.  I welcome that. I am afraid the assurance given by the <Col N="1268" /> Minister, though it was given quite <i>bona fide,</i> does not cover the aged person and would not be sufficient when it came to an interpretation of the law.  Unless the old person is specifically mentioned, the Minister's assurance would not be binding on any subsequent local authority or official who wished to implement the provisions of this sub-section.</P>
      <P>This is discriminatory legislation in relation to our county homes.  These homes should be places of refuge for the old in their declining years.  They should be places in which the old can live in dignity and with a feeling of self-respect, the right of any citizen in a democratic republic.  If they have to enter our institutions with the threat of this sub-section hanging over their heads, that will sadly impair the dignity they should feel.  The general attitude would be that they would be regarded as irresponsible, unruly and unmannerly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a retention of the old pauper type of legislation imposed on this nation in bygone years.  While the other parts of this Bill represent a progressive attitude on health legislation, this sub-section represents a retrograde step, because there should not be sectional legislation in relation to the destitute aged.  A very important principle is involved.  The Minister may say that the purpose is to catch the blackguard.  Examples have been given in which a vagrant in these county homes has assaulted a member of the staff.  I sometimes wonder if the member of the staff does not deserve the assault.  I am not suggesting they all do, but it is possible for people to be offensive on both sides and the offence need not always be on the side of the vagrant.  There is no point in pursuing that particular line at the moment and I would not like to condemn all because of the weaknesses and failings of the few.  Deputies have pointed out that there is no section of society without its drunks, its unruly and irresponsible hooligans and its blackguards.  It has not been found necessary to legislate for them.  It has not been found necessary to legislate for the hotels, the cinemas and so on. Consequently, since this sub-section is directed towards our county homes in <Col N="1269" /> which the majority of our aged poor find shelter in the declining years I must press my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister indicated earlier this afternoon that he was prepared to drop paragraph (c) of sub-section (6).  I do not think the Minister seems to have appreciated the objection which is taken to the whole concept of this sub-section: that is, that there should be a separate type of criminal law set up in regard to the inmates of our county homes. It is an objection in principle.</P>
      <P>The Minister says that probably the sub-section will not be resorted to. That may well be so, but why include it in the statute?  There are many things that we might all wish to provide for in legislation, things that are never likely to occur, but it would be a tremendous waste of time to include sections in an Act of Parliament dealing with eventualities that are never likely to occur.  Therefore we do not do it.</P>
      <P>The fundamental objection is to the fact that a separate code of law is being created in respect of the inmates of county homes.  You have the ordinary citizen whose conduct is subject to the Constitution and to the law of the land, and side by side you have this inferior type of citizen who is not entitled to the protection of the ordinary law, but is subject to a separate criminal code though that citizen has done nothing to deprive himself of his right of being regarded as equal before the law with every other citizen.  His only offence is that he happens to be poor.  That is the principle which is involved.  I think the Minister should short circuit this discussion by agreeing to withdraw the whole sub-section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I cannot understand how the Minister can persist in his decision to maintain this sub-section. Yesterday, he accepted an amendment to delete a sub-section to provide for task work.  The approach made by a number of us to the two sub-sections is the same.  If we provide places to which men and women can go when they find themselves in <Col N="1270" /> difficult circumstances, places to which they can go not as a charity but as a right due to the citizen, and if we are to regard them not as something next door to the criminal class, then I suggest our whole attitude has to be conditioned by that approach.</P>
      <P>The Minister accepted arguments yesterday in regard to task work and agreed to withdraw that particular sub-section. The same mentality is behind this sub-section.  As Deputy MacBride has pointed out, what in fact we are proposing to do here is to establish another code of law for those people in the same way as we have established a special military code of law.  The arguments to support a military code of law were peculiar to the whole basis on which military courts are set up, but there can be no similar arguments in regard to these citizens who have to go to the county homes, whether they be old people or people in their adult years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these powers are necessary in the county homes, why are they not necessary in the night shelter in Back Lane?  The whole argument of the Minister was directed to what he regards as the vagrant class.  He said there was no intention of applying these powers to the elderly people in the county homes.  I should like to point out that the same class of people have to have recourse to night lodgings in Dublin, the night shelter in Back Lane and to Iveagh House.  I do not know why they should be called vagrants just because they are unfortunate enough to be out of work, have no home and have to depend on the goodwill of the community.  If those who run lodging houses and night shelters in Dublin are able to conduct those places without special powers such as are being asked for here, why should we give such powers to the officials in charge of county homes? The fact that the officials in charge of the county homes are public officials gives them much greater standing and authority than that possessed by those who carry on these night shelters in Dublin.  The latter are run by private individuals, ordinary men and women, who give their time free for social work of that kind.  The ordinary employees <Col N="1271" /> in charge of Iveagh House are able to manage it without any difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  What we are arguing against is the principle that is involved in this.  We object to the carrying over of the workhouse atmosphere into any legislation passed by this House.  The argument that there was such provision in previous Acts cannot justify the inclusion of a sub-section such as this in this Health Bill.  It is no argument to say that this sub-section is necessary to deal with vagrants.  I think that the term &ldquo;vagrant&rdquo; is just as objectionable as the term workhouse.  If there are vagrants it is because we are not doing our job.  It is well known that if you treat a criminal as a criminal he will be a criminal.  If you treat an ordinary decent man as a vagrant then he will be one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making is, why should these powers be necessary for a county home when they are not necessary in the same type of institution where men are provided with night shelter through the work and organising effort of people with a sense of social responsibility?  What are the special circumstances which require that, because a man is merely guilty of contravening some regulation in a county home, he should be treated as having committed a criminal offence? I am not concerned as to whether the Minister is prepared to amend other sections or not.  I feel that we should make a stand on this.  I understand that the Minister has been a little bit impatient in listening to the discussion, except from one section of the House.  He should remember that there are others in the House who are trying to make this a better Bill.  We do not regard the Bill as a good Bill.  We are giving such credit to the Minister as he is entitled to for the introduction of the Bill, but we think that it can be very much improved.  Whatever improvements are made in the Bill, as a <Col N="1272" /> result of our discussions, will be to the credit of the Minister.  Whatever the final outcome of the Bill is the Minister will get the credit for that. There is, therefore, no use in the Minister getting impatient and telling us we are wasting a lot of time.  We can waste a lot more time if that is the position that is going to be put to us.</P>
    <P>We are not asking the Minister to accept any amendment except on the basis of the arguments supporting them.  What we do object to is to be told that we are wasting time when we put forward arguments.  The Minister was prepared to amend other sections because there were votes involved and because the suggestions came from certain quarters of the House.  If we are to deal with the merits of the case, let us do so, and not have decisions made merely because a particular member of the House puts the suggestions forward.  As far as we are concerned, we think the section should be taken out and we think the House should stand on that decision and let the Minister make up his mind one way or the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the last speaker that the same type of people are dealt with in these lodging houses, such as Iveagh House, that he has been talking about, as are dealt with in the county homes.  There are aged, destitute people living in the county homes who have to make their home there for the rest of their lives. It is only right that we should protect those people against the ordinary casuals, vagrants or whatever you like to call them.  I do not know whether the Deputy is aware of it or not but in some institutions many casuals go in for a night's lodging and disturb the people who have to make the county home their home.  We are anxious to make the county home as good as possible for these old people. This section is aimed at protecting those people more than anything else. I certainly think that the ordinary decent man who is destitute and down-and-out at the end of his days is entitled to protection from people who come in casually and kick up rows in the institution.</P>

Certain arguments were advanced to the Minister and the Minister said that he is prepared to agree that (b) and (c) should go and that (a) and (d) should be reconsidered, and that on the Report Stage an amendment would be introduced by him to deal with the position based on the arguments we have heard. I thought the matter was solved.  It is a reasonable approach by the Minister, when points are put to him, that he would say: &ldquo;All right.  I am convinced about (b) and (c), and as far as (a) and (d) are concerned I am prepared to examine them and, on the basis of the arguments that have been addressed to me, to consider the whole position and I will introduce an amendment on the Report Stage.&rdquo;  That was done because strong arguments were advanced to him from all sides of the House in regard to this matter.</P>

Before the tea interval we had an assurance from the Minister that this matter would be looked into on the basis of the arguments that were addressed to him, that sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of the section would be dropped and that sub-paragraphs (a) <Col N="1276" /> and (d) would be drafted in such a way that it would in no way interfere with the human dignity of any person who goes into an institution.</P>
      <P>Are we going to accept that or are we not?  Are we just going to play a bit of politics about it?  That is what it boils down to.  This is a Health Bill. At 5 o'clock this evening I asked the Minister to do that.  He agreed to do it so that we could get on with the other sections.  On Report Stage, if the amendment that the Minister brings in is not acceptable, we can, if we like, drop it but, when the Minister has said that, in view of the arguments, he will consider the matter, that he will prepare a section instead of the present one which he will put before the House, if we are to be reasonable or fair we have to consider that.  The point is, can you run a county home without any rules at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what happens.  Supposing a person breaks a rule, are you going to ignore it or are you going to deal with it?  I know some countries where they have very strict rules, very advanced socialist countries.  I think they have very strict rules in Russia and they enforce them very strictly.  I think that if we are to have an ordered society there must be some enforcement of rules, whether the rules of trade unions, the rules of a bar association or the rules of a political Party, and these are generally carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that Deputy Dr. Browne is very keen about and I am very keen about&mdash;Deputy Dr. Browne was the man who examined this and took objection to this section and put down an amendment&mdash;is that we want to see as far as the ordinary old people in county homes are concerned that they are not to be dealt with in any tyrannical manner, that as far as unmarried mothers are concerned they are not to be dealt with on any basis of tyranny, <Col N="1277" /> but that as far as other people in the county homes are concerned, they cannot be permitted just to make a shambles of the place if they want to. I do not think there is anything unreasonable in that.  Having heard the arguments advanced, I think the Minister will produce an amendment which will receive the support of this House.  The Minister stated that any rules that will be made under this section when it is amended will be submitted for the approval of this House; in other words, the amendment will be extended to that extent.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a system of anarchy, very well.  In our secondary schools it would be grand if there were no rules or authority, but there have to be rules and authority in secondary schools.  There have to be rules and authority in primary schools.  In the different trade unions and organisations to which we belong there must be some rules.</P>
    <P>The vital thing I see in this section is that a man who requires shelter and is unable to provide it for himself must get the shelter.  Therefore, the local authority must provide the shelter. With regard to the other institutions mentioned by Deputy Larkin, the Back Lane institution and different voluntary institutions, if a person acts in an offensive or objectionable way he is simply put outside the door and that is their discipline.  Under this section the local authority is bound to provide shelter for a person who is unable to provide it for himself.  I do not think it is unreasonable to say that we must obey certain rules.  For instance, if the rules say that breakfast will be from 9 to 10 o'clock, I do not think anyone would agree that a person should be able to demand it at 11.30.  Some of us might like to do that, but we find that even our wives enforce a pretty stiff discipline upon us.  The same thing applies to the other meal hours.</P>
    <P>The one thing I want to see is that there is no question of interference with the human dignity of an individual, and there is no interference with the human dignity of an individual if he subjects himself to reasonable rules approved of by the Parliament of this country in the year 1953.  Deputy <Col N="1278" /> MacBride may find that there is something unreasonable in the rules of his own profession of law.  But the rules are there and he accepts them.  He does not find that they are as bad as might be imagined in theory.  Deputy Larkin is in the same position in regard to members of trade unions who, in the general interest, have to submit to certain rules for the organisation and control of trade unions.  The same thing applies to individuals who go to the university or to secondary or primary schools.</P>
    <P>If the argument is for anarchy, let us say so.  But if what Deputy Dr. Browne is attempting is to prevent any humiliation of individuals, then I think we can ensure that by agreeing to allow the Minister to consider the matter on the basis he has indicated, having heard the arguments from all sides of the House.  If we want to get a good section which will help us to provide that, then we ought to agree to let the Minister have his second attempt at it.</P>
    <P>It is very funny that the argument should have developed in the way it has developed on the part of people who are supporting the Bill, the Labour Party, the Independents and the Fianna Fáil Party.  They are supporting the Bill and yet this argument has arisen.  I saw no sign of impatience on the part of the Minister and I see no necessity for the type of threat made&mdash;that the Bill will be held up. Fine Gael have been doing very well in holding it up for some weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>You can sit back very nicely and say that.  Fine Gael will sit back and say: &ldquo;You are doing all right&rdquo;.  But when we agree on a point, then Fine Gael comes in to hold up the Bill.  It seems to me that the sensible thing is to let the Minister consider what he would put in instead of what is there.  On the arguments advanced to him, I think that the sort of section he will put in will be a section to which no Deputy can take exception, that it will not be a section that will lead to the humiliation of any human being.  If it does not lead <Col N="1279" /> to humiliation, then the House could very well accept it.</P>
      <P>The main thing, as I said earlier, is to prevent the creation of a tyranny by minor officials.  It has been shown very clearly by what has been said that we will not stand for a tyranny by minor officials, that we will not pass any rules in this House that will result in that type of tyranny, and that we will not pass a section into law that will enable that sort of tyranny to be put into practice.  Therefore, I think we ought to accept the assurance which the Minister has given to the House and then we will see what he will produce on the Report Stage.  This is the month of July and the Government are determined, and it is one of my determinations, that this Bill will be passed in spite of any reactionary opposition there may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to concentrate on two phrases used by Captain Cowan, one that there must be general agreement that at all costs we would avoid the humiliation of any human being.  The second was that we should do nothing that would in any way injure the dignity of any human being. Those are two points on which I feel that no matter how reasonable the Minister may be, there is an issue involved on which we should make a stand.  Deputy Cowan has pointed out that the Minister is prepared to withdraw paragraphs (b) and (c) and rephrase (a) and (d).  All that is required is to rephrase the section and say: <Col N="1280" />&ldquo;every person maintained by a health authority in a county home or similar institution who wilfully does any act ... commits an offence&rdquo;.  Deputy Cowan says the Minister will bring the regulations back so that we can have a look at them.  We have had a lot of experience of what we can&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say I would accept an amendment phrased in that way.  There are a number of things I would want to go into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed, but do you not see that so long as the amendment merely indicates that regulations can be made and the breach of these regulations is an offence, it will be against the principle for which we are fighting?  Any unfortunate man who, because of his poverty, must have recourse to the county home knows that when he crosses the gates of the county home we have already branded him as a special type for whom special laws must be made, and the law is that the regulations are of such a character that if he breaks them it is an offence against the law.</P>
      <P>If he breaks the laws of a trades union he is merely dealt with as a member of that organisation who has broken the rules, and ordinary action within the rules is taken against him, but he is not a transgressor against the law and he is not open either to a fine or the penalty of imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer the fine or imprisonment to some of the professional penalties that are imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy's views are in that regard are not very interesting at the moment.  What I am concerned with is that a member of a trades union or a member of the legal profession voluntarily becomes a member of that organisation and accepts the rules and regulations, and if he breaks them, he is not proceeded against as a criminal, however harsh the penalty for breaking the rules may be.  Perhaps, in the case of the legal profession, he is barred; maybe in the case of membership of a trades union, his membership is taken away and certain <Col N="1281" /> consequences follow and that is the end of it.  In this particular case we are saying that regulations and rules are necessary.  Nobody objects to that, but what we see in addition is that because A or B or C are unfortunate enough to go into the county home we decide we are going to create a special set of laws for Pat Clancy or Pat Murphy and they operate when he crosses the gates of the county home; and he crosses the gates because of his poverty.  That is my objection and I cannot see how the Minister can draft regulations that will avoid that difficulty in regard to principle, because if it merely states that when John Murphy walks down the corridor he should keep three feet from each side of the wall and, if he does not, he is guilty of a breach of the regulations and then he is guilty of an offence. That raises the whole question of principle.</P>
      <P>There is grave concern for the aged people in county homes to see that they are not disturbed or interfered with.  Everybody will agree with that, but whatever may be the difference, I personally feel that however strong the claim of the aged people to rest and contentment may be in their old age, we are not entitled to go to the other extreme and brand the man or woman who has also got to have recourse to the county home as some special type of individual who is outside the criminal law of the country and has to have a special set of laws made for him because he is going into a county home.</P>

We agree there must be regulations and orders which everybody agrees are necessary to run any organisation.  The only difference, we say, is you can break a rule or a regulation of a trades union, of a sports club, or of the bar association or anything else and all that will happen is that the penalty provided will be imposed.</P>

I happen to be a member of a public health authority and I visit the institution in my district occasionally and I know of many incidents which have occurred in that institution through what might be called undesirables, fairly able-bodied people who applied for a night's shelter.

    </Speaker>
    <P>If poverty has overtaken them, that is no fault of theirs.  It is our bounden duty to protect these old and infirm people and to see that they will be permitted to end their days in the county homes, at least in peace.  That is all that is asked by the Minister in this amendment.  The amendment <Col N="1284" /> may be harsh and there may be means of modifying it.  I believe that it can be modified.</P>
    <P>I, for one, have had experience of visiting institutions other than public institutions.  One of them was the old ex-soldiers' home in Washington in the United States.  There they had a system of strict regulations and rules governing the conduct of people who sought accommodation in that old soldiers' home.  There is nothing wrong in my opinion&mdash;in fact, I believe it is our duty&mdash;in ensuring that these people in the county homes should be protected.  I do not know what the exact layout of county homes outside my own county is, but I do know that in my county we have a form of county home, a form of hospital and a form of institution for unmarried mothers in which there are a number of young children.  I do know that scenes take place late at night in that institution and that assistance had to be sought to prevent that sort of conduct. I do not think that Deputy Larkin is right in describing all these people as decent working people.  Many of them are decent but a considerable number of them are not decent working people.  Of course, when we reach that Utopia when there will be no want anywhere, all our troubles will come to an end, but I believe that, under existing conditions, it is necessary for the Minister to provide some protection for the inmates of these institutions and to see that people who have to go to the county home are allowed to remain there in peace and comfort for the rest of their days.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 73:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (7) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(7)  Where the Minister directs by Order that a specified class of persons shall not be sheltered or maintained under this section by or on behalf of a health authority in a specified institution, the authority shall not (except in cases of urgent necessity) shelter or maintain, or arrange for the shelter or maintenance of, any persons of that class in that institution.</P>
      <P>In considering this clause some Deputies interpreted this sub-section as applying to all institutions.  I do not think it could be legally so interpreted but, in order to allay any doubts or fears, I have had sub-section (7) redrafted to make it quite clear that it refers only to county homes.</P>

      <P>The Minister last night agreed to accept an amendment tabled by Deputy Dr. Browne to delete sub-section (5), a sub-section requiring persons in an institution to perform such work as a local authority might consider suitable having regard to sex, age, strength, capacity and so forth.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether or not there is in any other Health Act or legislation dealing with county homes a provision, which has not been repealed, giving the right to local authorities to insist that inmates will work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It means that, if a person has means, a certain amount can be claimed from him for his maintenance in the county home.  It has been quite a common practice for years in the case of old age pensioners.  A certain amount of the pension is taken for maintenance and the remainder is left to the pensioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one small matter that I should like to raise.  In Dublin, and I suppose in other parts <Col N="1289" /> of the country as well, we occasionally have cases where families are evicted, very often for no fault of their own.  These families are compelled to seek shelter in St. Kevin's in Dublin and in the county homes in other parts of the country.  It seems to be the practice that when that happens the family is separated.  I have known of such cases myself where, owing to the housing difficulty, families have had to remain in St. Kevin's for as long as two years.  Would the Minister see if it would be possible to ensure that in cases of that kind the members of the family should not be separated, but should be given accommodation in the institution?</P>
      <P>Seeing that we all profess such a great regard for family life, it seems to me that it is regrettable that a family should be broken up in that way.  The members of the family are separated when they have to stay in the institution for a period.  The fact that families have to remain so long in these institutions is, as I say, due to the housing difficulty.  If the Minister could do anything to remedy that situation it would be appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer the Deputy off-hand as regards that particular instance.  In my talks with local authorities about starting colonies for the old people, I have stressed that, as far as possible, they should have one for men, one for women and one for married couples, so that the married couples could live together.  I could not say off-hand whether that could be done in an emergency case. Personally, I would like to see it provided for, if possible.  I do not know whether it can be done or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that there would be great difficulties, but I put it to the Minister that if anything could be done to remedy the situation it would be desirable.  In a number of cases that I have come across, I am aware that because of this separation the family, and particularly the mother, has been most anxious to leave the institution.  If we could avoid this separation it certainly would be desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is recasting that sub-section it might be desirable to amend the last five or six lines of it.  As far as I can gather, the purpose of these five or six lines of the sub-section is to deprive a person who might sustain an injury while working of his contractual rights.  Sub-section (8), as it stands, provides that: &ldquo;where a person is required in pursuance of sub-section (5) to perform work.&rdquo;  Well, sub-section (5) has been deleted.  Sub-section (8) goes on to say that if he does such work he shall:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...be deemed, in relation to the doing thereof, to be for the purposes of the Workmen's Compensation Acts, 1934 and 1948, a workman in the employment of the health <Col N="1291" /> authority, but, save as aforesaid, neither such requisition nor the performance of the work by such person shall operate to create or imply the relation of master and servant or a contract of service between the health authority and such person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that the real purpose of that proviso is to protect the local authority against any claim that might be made on foot of negligence should a person be injured while doing such work by the negligence of the local authority.  I may be wrong but that is my impression. I think that is probably the purpose of that proviso.  I think on the whole the Minister should drop it.  If, through the negligence of a local authority, a person who is doing work as an inmate of a county home sustains injuries, that person should be entitled to his common law remedy if he has one and it should not be taken away from him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 75:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (8), page 18, line 48, to delete &ldquo;45&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;47&rdquo;.</P>

    <Col N="1292" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 76:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (9), page 19, line 3, to insert &ldquo;subject to such conditions as they think fit,&rdquo; before &ldquo;contribute&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this particular section, first of all, we had regard to a person who has a boarded-out child and who gets very fond of that child and would like to adopt it.  Very often, of course, in such conditions, the foster parent is not very well off and is dependent to some extent on the income that he or she might get for the child in order to keep that child.  I think, however, we should not allow that to interfere with the foster parent's affection for the child and we therefore provided that adoption might be carried out in that case but that the allowance might be continued even if adoption was carried out.  The next thing that arose was that we got representations from those who are interested in adoption, that it is possible that it might work the other way, that an unscrupulous foster parent might adopt a child in order to have a sure continuance of the allowance.  This amendment is to correct a mistake in that direction. Even though a foster parent would adopt a child, the foster parent might be subject to the condition of inspection the same as was there before the child was adopted.</P>
      <P>I must say that I am rather doubtful about the whole thing.  It is very, very difficult to keep an even balance, as it were, in this whole problem. Deputies will realise, of course, that if a person takes a boarded-out child that child can be taken from the person by the local authority if the child is not well treated, but it is quite possible that the foster parent may become very fond of the child and would like to adopt it and, if that is genuine, it is all well and good and if the foster parent is not too well off, let the local authority continue the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have to guard against the other position that a foster parent might say: &ldquo;The local authority can take this child from me any time they like but if I adopt it they cannot take it from me&rdquo;.  We have to guard <Col N="1293" /> against that contingency for the sake of the child.</P>
    <P>That is why I am putting in this amendment that where the local authority is continuing to pay an allowance when the child has been adopted they can make such conditions as they think fit.  The only condition that I can see at the moment that they would make is that they would continue inspection.  They cannot make a condition that they will take the child back again because the Adoption Act fixes that.  The only condition that I could see that they could possibly make is that they could continue inspection and in that way try to safeguard the child if there was any doubt about it</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question which will resolve any difficulties I have about the whole section?  I do not know whether it is fair to ask the Minister or not.  Does the section embody the views and recommendations of an extremely competent lady inspector in the Minister's Department who deals with boarded-out children?</P>

Unscrupulous people who have a child and want to hang on to that child at all costs so that they can draw the allowance can adopt it.  It subsequently transpires that they have done it for that particular purpose.  The authority then comes on the scene and inspects and considers that the situation is not satisfactory.  Then they stop the allowance. Who is going to suffer?  The child will suffer.  The Minister is handing away his authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are set up under the Adoption Act.  The Adoption Board, in all probability, would ask for a report from the inspector under the Department of Health or the local authority.

As I understand the position, at the moment, children boarded out are subject to inspection regularly and the question of adoption will only arise after the child has been boarded out for a period of time and, therefore, the Adoption Board will have the benefit of the report from the inspectors of the Department and the local authority before they act in the matter.</P>

      <P>There is only one request I would make to the Minister&mdash; I agree entirely with him that it is quite a difficult problem.  I have a great deal of personal experience in this type of case.  I would appeal to the Minister not to hesitate to come back to the House if he finds that he requires an alteration in regard to this.  He may find after a year's working that it does not work satisfactorily and he may want a different type of power.  I know how easy it is to put a thing on the long finger.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite correct.  Once the adoption takes place, I cannot see what he can do except to stop the contribution. <Col N="1296" /> But, as Deputy Dr. Esmonde stated, the child would suffer in that event.</P>

      <P>Then the child becomes an unwanted child in that household. I do not know how the Minister can get over it.  I cannot accept the point of view put forward by Deputy MacBride, that the Minister should not hesitate to come back for further powers at a later date.  That would only come about after grave hardships had arisen.  When the Adoption Board is going to make an order, I think the Minister should have some say in the matter and see that there would be a probationary period of one, two or three years.  I think that he should have some influence on the board's decision so that the child would be fairly protected in the event of any hardship arising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that when a child is boarded out with foster-parents a certain period should be allowed to lapse before the question of adoption is considered.  I am looking at it from this angle. Assuming that the foster-parents have not the best intentions and are simply looking for the money, they may have a child for a very short period and may be able to hoodwink even such an astute person as the inspector.  I suggest, therefore, that a certain period should be allowed to elapse before adoption would be considered.  I do not know whether that is the position at present and I should like the Minister to make a statement with regard to it.  It seems to me that if we pass this legislation a position may arise that a person may have a child for a year or 18 months.  It would be quite easy in that short period to create the <Col N="1297" /> impression that the home is a very good one for the particular child and the Adoption Board might receive such a report from the inspector.  As Deputy MacEoin has pointed out, the damage will then be done.  I do not think it meets the case that the Minister should come back to the House to look for further legislation.</P>
      <P>The boarding-out of children is a very serious problem.  We have all the deepest sympathy with children with no parents who have to be boarded-out and I think we should protect them in every way.  Subject to the Minister discussing the matter with the Adoption Board and with his officials, I suggest that a certain time limit should be fixed before he permits the adoption to become an accomplished fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be influenced in regard to this by the fact that the officers dealing with this problem in the Minister's Department apparently feel that this is an improvement on the situation as it exists now.  They are better qualified to advise on the realities of the situation than we are and, if they feel they require this section, I think they should have it.</P>

      <P>I should like to make it clear that the local authorities are very particular about the people with whom they board out children.  They always select very reputable people.  You may take it that you are dealing with very decent people, but there may be a wrong done now and again.  It is to guard against that we are putting in this amendment.  The Adoption Board has power to fix a probation period of two years, and I think they will be likely to use that power in cases of this kind.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister can enlighten me with regard to some particular cases I have in mind.  As Deputy Dr. Esmonde said, we all have sympathy with children who have no parents.  I think we <Col N="1298" /> would also have sympathy with children whose names are not known.  I should like the Minister to enlighten me if he can in regard to two cases of boarded-out children whose foster-parents can get no particulars as to their birth or as to at least one of their parents.  Is there any legislation under which the Minister can compel the person by whom the child was given to the foster-parents to disclose some information at least about the birth of the child?  I know of two cases where the person who handed over the child would not disclose even its age. In one case the boy is now about 19 years of age, and the time is coming when he will need a birth certificate of some kind for national health insurance, or unemployment assistance, or matters of that kind.  The foster-mother discovers now that she cannot get such a certificate and has only a rough idea as to the boy's age.  Both these foster-parents have difficulty with regard to the question of adoption. because the Adoption Board requires a fair amount of information before they will permit adoption.  These two people have tried unsuccessfully since the passing of the Adoption Act to get the required information.</P>
      <P>There is another question which I am sure that the Minister will consider. A large number of the boarded-out children were born in county homes or other institutions and I am sure the Minister will think it desirable that in the description of the place of birth on the certificate, instead of &ldquo;county home&rdquo; the particular name of the institution should be put in, such as St. Kevin's or St. John's.</P>

What I would like the Minister to do would be to have the description or the name given to these <Col N="1299" /> institutions by the local authority in serted instead of &ldquo;county home&rdquo;.</P>

These are given out by voluntary organisations and I am afraid I have not much control over them.  However, I will inquire into the position.  The short certificate is designed to give the necessary information without creating any embarrassment.  I think that is all right, but I will look into it again just to make sure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 77:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Provided always that the person with whom such child is boarded out shall have the right of appeal to a district justice in the area in which such person resides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment, but from the last remark which the Minister has made, it appears that he may not be able to do very much to help.  My concern relates probably to nursed-out children.  My problem is this: I know of many households to whom children are boarded out at a very young age of, say, two or three.  I know many of the people in my own area at home, and they have developed a tremendous affection for their children and the children have developed an affection for their new parents.  The most desirable thing, of course, in this whole mechanism is that the child would have a foster-home.  It has happened on a number of occasions that the child has grown up in that home, is given the atmosphere of the family, the advantages of family life, dependency on the mother and father and the general feeling that they belong to the family even though the father and mother may have children of their own.  It is quite remarkable the way these children <Col N="1300" /> are assimilated into the family and become one of the family circle.  In my view it is most desirable, and much more advantageous than attempting to bring these children up in schools away from the family circle.  But at certain stages, it appears the child can be taken away from the family at the age of, say, eight, nine or ten.  At some age, the child can be taken back by the people who have put it out&mdash;it may be a school or voluntary organisation such as the Minister referred to a few minutes ago.  It seems to me that unless there is a very good reason at the back of it, that wrenching-away of the child from what it has come to believe is its normal home and family life could do irreparable damage to the whole mental make-up of that child.  Its whole security could be injured.  It has had two phases of unhappiness, the first, say, up to the age of two, probably in the county home, or at any rate, away from the family influence, in which a small child would have all the benefits of the care and attention of a foster-mother and father.</P>
    <P>The second phase comes just when the child was regaining its self-confidence and self-reliance when it is again taken away and returned to one of these voluntary bodies who put out these nursed-out children to families in different areas of the country.  In a number of cases, I know that the families have conceived a tremendous regard for the children and treat them as their own natural children in every way.  There have been cases of which I know in which the children have been taken back to the city school or whatever it may be for some reason or other&mdash;I was never terribly clear on the reason, because the educational facilities were there in the schools.  The children can be removed from the family and taken away to the neighbouring city or town.  It appears that the foster-parents have no appeal against this decision and apparently they are completely helpless.  The Minister, I understand, is helpless, and cannot be of any assistance, and the foster-parents have got to submit to the taking away of the child from the family circle.  It does some damage to the foster-parents.  In some cases I know, many of them have been very <Col N="1301" /> agitated by it.  That would not concern me very much but I do think it does very considerable damage to the child because I believe that the child should be brought up, if at all possible, as a member of a family rather than in an institution or an industrial school or whatever it may be.  No matter how kind, thoughtful or careful the staff may be, they can never replace the interest of the family even though it is a foster-family.  Would it be possible to give the right of appeal to foster-parents so that the cases could be considered on the merits and so that the individual foster-parents would have power to have their cases stated in open court and a decision made by somebody like a district justice, or an appeal to the Minister or somebody so that if possible the damage which I honestly believe is done to these children by the interruption of their normal development could be avoided?  It appears to me at present that there is no power or right of appeal for the foster-parents, and if they could state their case it might transpire that the district justice would, in the interests of the child, decide that the child should stay in the home in which it has been so contented and happy and in which the parents have looked after it so well.  This is a question which also occurs in different circumstances where there are broken homes, but I wonder in this matter would it be possible to give some right of appeal to the foster-parents, to make a case for the retention of the children in the interests of the children?</P>

Anyway it would require redrafting, and if the Deputy would agree to withdraw it, I would promise to bring it in later.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate fully the purpose of the section and the motive that has prompted the Minister to introduce it, but I am worried a little bit by sub-sections (4) and (5).  I wish we could try to get away from the kind of policeman mentality we seem to have in drafting legislation.  This tendency of always being inclined to impose a penalty and to create an offence is unwise if we can avoid it. There is a point that occurs to me, and I wonder if the Minister has considered it.  The section deals with children who are boarded-out by a local authority.  A child may be boarded-out by a local authority under a number of different circumstances. The child may be one who has been abandoned; it may be an illegitimate child whose parents are not prepared to look after it; it may be an orphan; it may be a child that has been abandoned by its parents.  The section as drafted seems to confer on the local authority absolute rights of disposal over the child irrespective of the child's wishes&mdash;that may be understandable if the child is under 16&mdash; and also irrespective apparently of the wishes of the parents of the child.  I think the Minister should include some safeguard in the section providing for a situation where the parents may come along at some later stage and say: &ldquo;Well, we are now able to look after the child; we want the child back; we do not agree with the proposals that the local authority is making for the future training or care of <Col N="1303" /> the child.&rdquo;  The section requires a good deal of examination from that point of view.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (4) creates an offence on the part of the guardian of the child, as we may call the person with whom the child is boarded-out, if the guardian refuses to deliver up custody of the child boarded-out with him or her. The next sub-section provides that where a person is convicted of refusing to deliver up the child to the local authority, at the same time the court shall make an order for the removal of the child from his custody to the custody of the health authority.  I think that is a bit drastic.  The Minister would, I think, require to redraft these sub-sections and also to make some provision to enable the parents of the child, if they turn up, to have some say in the matter and to enable the parents to regain custody of the child against the local authority or against the custodian of the child under the local authority.  There are quite a number of cases of parents who, may be after ten years or so, find that they want the child themselves. Take the case of an illegitimate child. There are many cases where the parents of such a child get married after five or ten years, set up a home and are prepared to look after the child.  I think some provision should be made in the section to enable them to have a say in the matter.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I do not like sub-section (5) at all.  I am afraid that the sub-section gives absolute power to the local authority to go into court and say: &ldquo;Take that child from its present custodian and we will put him some place else.&rdquo; Nobody has any say in the matter, apparently, except the local authority.  The local authority may be animated with the best intentions for the child's future.  I do not want to say a word in criticism of local authorities, but I have come across a number of cases myself where members of local authorities have been canvassed by farmers who wanted boarded-out children, not because of their affection for these children but because it meant cheap labour for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have known of cases of members of county councils being actively canvassed <Col N="1304" /> to secure boarded-out children. I am not saying that these farmers did not treat the children quite well when they had them and probably got quite fond of them at a later stage, but I say that you cannot rely entirely on the good sense or judgment of the local authority in the matter.  I do not know that the average county council is a good body to decide questions of that kind.  I would have more confidence in the inspectors of the Departments.  I think in most cases-probably the Minister would be able to tell us definitely-the care of boarded-out children in country districts is relegated to the relieving officer of the area.  I am saying this subject to correction.  In some cases it is the rate collector who looks after them.  The relieving officer may be a very good relieving officer or the rate collector may be a very good rate collector, but he is not necessarily the type of person whose advice and views would be sound in regard to the future of such a child, particularly if there are local interests at work in regard to securing these children for a farmer.  I think the Minister should re-examine these sub-sections and consider inserting provisos to protect the rights of the parents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last section, Section 50, we were dealing with boarded-out children, and the idea appeared to be, in the case of the unwanted child, that the local authority should, in the event of a child not having a home, try to get a home for him and give him a family atmosphere. This section appears to be in direct contradiction to the preceding section. I think it is reasonable to assume that in the majority of instances boarded-out children are handed over to their foster-parents at a very early age. The foster-parents will get very fond of the child.  The child will go into their house and to all intents and purposes, it is a home for that child.  It will never have known any other home. It seems, however, that the State mind predominates again in this section.  I am entirely against such a mentality. In the previous section we were out to give a young nameless child a home, but in this section we seem to be trying to nullify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> There may be occasions on which it may be necessary to remove the child. But here the point is that in this connection you are handing over to a State official, to the health authority which will probably be the county manager or the person to whom he delegates the power, the right to remove that child from its home.  The Minister will appreciate that it is reasonable to assume that the child may pass into a home at a tender age. He will regard the people with whom he is living as his parents&mdash;the only father and mother he has ever known and the only people he has ever cared for.  A State official can come along and say it is for the betterment of the child that the child should be removed. Consider the agony of the child.  Consider the agony of the people who reared it and looked after it.  Boarded-out children are boarded with carefully selected people, people who can be trusted to look after the child.  The State decides that a particular child should be put into some institution or school.  That would be all right if it were done in agreement with the foster-parents, but this section stipulates that the local authority has the power to break all contracts.</P>
    <P>Now, we are legislating for the future and all Deputies are agreed that we want to do the best we can for these children.  The position under this section will be that one may remove the child without any reference to the parents and dump it somewhere else.  That is not fair to either the child or the foster-parents.  I see no sense in this section.  It nullifies the previous section which seemed to be a pretty sound one.  Under that section we were endeavouring to put children into homes so that they would become part and parcel of those homes and derive from them all the rights and privileges that we here enjoy.  Under this section the Minister proposes to wipe that out altogether.  It does not make sense to me.  I think the Minister should either withdraw it or modify it drastically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the section was withdrawn and a local authority was told that a boarded-out child was badly <Col N="1306" /> treated, nothing could be done and there would be no redress.  The purpose of this section is to enable a local authority to remove a child that is not properly treated or looked after. Deputies must realise that one cannot qualify these things all the time because that is the way in which one creates legal difficulties.  I am accepting Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment that if the local authority removes a child on the plea that the child is badly treated and if the parent goes to court and the court is satisfied the local authority is wrong, then the parent can keep the child.</P>

It provides that where a court convicts a foster-parent the court then makes an order for the disposal of the child to the health authority.  That is the only thing the court can do.  The foster-parents may object to giving up the child.  A prosecution is brought. The foster-parent is fined or sent to jail and the effect of that order is to dispose of the body of the child as if it was a chattel.  I do not think that is wise.  I think there should be some provision giving the parents of the child the right to intervene at that stage.</P>

      <P>It is a well-known fact that jealousy can arise in connection with boarded-out children and I have known cases where local authorities made orders taking children away from their foster-parents and giving them to others.  The Minister's acceptance of Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment leaves the foster-parent now with the right to go to court and make a case to have the child restored. The objection I see to this section is that it is mandatory on the district justice to remove the child from the foster-parents if the foster-parents refuse to surrender the child in the first instance.  Jealousy or other causes may induce a local authority to make an order for the removal of a child.  That order can be circumvented by the foster-parents making application for legal adoption.  If they move quickly enough they may circumvent the local authority.  But they may not move quickly enough and they will then find themselves before the district justice charged with refusing to comply with an order of the local authority.  All the local authority has to do to prove the case against the defendants is produce the resolution for the removal of the child plus the evidence of the person authorised to take the child.  Even though the Minister now proposes to give the right of appeal to the district justice, the child will be removed in the meantime and the home will be broken up temporarily at any rate.  I am aware of great hardships arising in that connection.  I am also aware of grave hardships arising from the maltreatment of foster-children and in that case I agree that there should be authority to remove the children.  The Minister says the parents have an overriding right in relation to legal adoption. That is not so.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll can say all he wants to say later.  I am stating the fundamental law.  The Legal Adoption Act takes away that right and it is only in the case of boarded-out children that the right still remains.  There is no law that anybody can make to prevent a parent getting the custody of a boarded-out child.  I would like the Minister to have some power to ensure that if foster-parents appeal against a decision, that it is not the local authority making the order in the first instance that will hear that appeal. The local authority will already have come to a decision and they would not be the best authority to reconsider the matter in the event of an appeal and to adjudicate as to whether they were right or wrong in their decision.  This is, notwithstanding that, an extension of State power.  I think the Minister, himself, should be the reviewing authority so that the foster-parents can appeal to him.  The Minister can send down his inspectors.  We know they are of high standing.  They can take statements from the local officers.  I regret to say that, even the best of them, can be misled by the information they get.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a child is removed by a health authority from the custody of a person with whom the child has been boarded out, employed or placed in a trade, calling, or business, any contract between the authority and such person in respect of the child shall terminate immediately upon the removal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A child is boarded out with foster-parents, but apparently we cannot prevent the Minister or the local authority from having the right to take the child away whenever they want to do so.  It is then sent to a trade, calling or business.  But where is the <Col N="1309" /> child to go to?  Is it to go back to the local institution or be boarded out again subsequently with the foster-parents from whom it had been taken away?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice at the moment is that the child is brought back to the institution if the treatment is so bad that it should be removed urgently.  It is then placed, as soon as possible, with another foster-parent. I think that is the usual procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The sub-section says that, if the child is removed from the people it is boarded out with, the contract is terminated.  The child may be happy with the foster-parents.  If it is removed from them for the purpose of teaching it a trade, will it be entitled to go back to them on holidays, or where is it to go?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That point does not arise on this sub-section which deals with the case of a child being removed from foster-parents or from a trade, or from a school.  When that happens, then it says immediately the contract is terminated.  The question which the Deputy seems to want to put is whether a child, if removed from foster-parents in order to be sent to a school or to be trained to some calling, may be allowed to go back to the foster-parents on holidays.  The answer is yes, if the foster-parents are satisfactory.</P>

      <P>The point, as far as this sub-section is concerned, is that, if the local authority finds that the school is unsatisfactory or the foster-parents unsatisfactory and takes the child away, the contract is broken so as to prevent the school going against the local authority afterwards for damages for breach of contract.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had something about this already on one of the Financial Resolutions.  The Rag Flock Act passed in 1911 was repealed.  A provision in it was re-enacted in 1947 giving the Minister power to prescribe standards of rag flocks and to prohibit the use of rag flock which was below the prescribed standard.</P>
      <P>Section 67 of the Health Act, 1947, re-enacted the Rag Flock Act and extended its provisions to other types of materials used in filling and transferred the responsibility to enforce them from the sanitary to the local authorities.</P>
      <P>There has been a good deal of agitation, more particularly from the trade union organisation, with regard to this subject for some years back.  As a matter of fact, the Trade Union Congress passed a resolution in 1946 asking for more stringent regulation and inspection of these filling materials used in furniture and so on, and this is an attempt to bring the matter up to date.  I do not think the section is a very difficult section to follow, even though it is fairly long.  It deals with these filling materials generally.</P>

It is difficult, because the person can carry on without stoppage, having paid the fine.  It is a very important matter. It is better that we should have the licensing provisions so that the business <Col N="1313" /> can be closed down if they do not toe the line.</P>

      <P>I take it that the main objective of this section is to prevent the carrying of disease by the use of old clothing and that type of material as filling.  I am in agreement with the section if that is the object.  There is one point on which I would like information from the Minister.  Why has he not taken power to do something about the sale of old clothing, the same type of material as this, only in more complete form, that is hawked around the streets on fair days by dealers?</P>
      <P>I asked a parliamentary question in connection with the dangers that can arise from this old clothing some months ago and the Minister's answer was that the medical officer of health had power to deal with it.  We all know that, whether he has power to deal with it or not, there is no attempt made to deal with it.  At every fair all over Ireland old clothing is sold indiscriminately. There is no certification of disinfection.  Old clothing is collected indiscriminately for jumble sales.  Disease can be spread, and is spread, due to these careless methods.</P>
      <P>The Minister should include a section dealing with that.  In other countries they have a system under which when second-hand clothing is sold it has to bear a label of some sort certifying that it has been disinfected and made safe.  Surely we should pay attention to that.  This is the only section on which it is appropriate to bring it to the notice of the Minister.  The Labour Party would welcome some restriction with regard to this.  We do not want to prevent the sale of second-hand clothing, but we want to protect the health of the people who buy these things.  There is also the fact that some material is made from old clothing shredded into small fragments. I should like if the Minister would tell us if he has any ideas in regard to that.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (9) states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A person who contravenes a regulation under this section or who wilfully obstructs the execution of a regulation under this section shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary <Col N="1316" /> conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £100 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the punishment sub-section. The Minister has indicated that this regulation is for the purpose of setting a standard with regard to cleanliness and providing for machinery that will enable him to establish that standard by inspection.  If that is so, it appears to me that this punishment sub-section is rather strangely arranged.  The section provides for the licensing of premises and for the conditions under which a licence will be given or can be retained.  It also provides for the imposition of charges.  If the purpose of the section is the establishment of a standard and the controlling of that standard, the provisions with regard to licences and fees seem to be rather elaborate, as well as the provision with regard to punishment.</P>
    <P>When the Financial Resolution in relation to this section was under consideration the question was fairly widely discussed that there was a danger that, not only was there power to arrange standards and to see that these standards were maintained, but that there was a rather systematic and elaborate machinery for controlling the industry, that it was extending the control by way of licence to the organisation of the industry with regard to either the raw material or the subsequent manufacture of articles from the raw material.  I should like to ask the Minister specifically whether in dealing with this matter under the powers that have been available already there has been any indication that, for the purpose of maintaining standards, it is desirable to set out on the wider proposition of controlling the industry either in the collection of the raw material, the processing of the raw material, or the final manufacture of articles in respect of which the raw material is used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some attempt made to go back to the processing by having the materials marked with a special mark.  If the inspector finds <Col N="1317" /> that certain materials in a factory are not up to standard he can trace where they came from.  An attempt is being made in that way to trace the materials back to their origin.  I think that is as far as we can go at the moment.</P>

I am asking whether in dealing with the matter up to the present there has been any suggestion that it is desirable to extend control of the industry apart from requiring standards, whether in the difficulties that have been met in maintaining standards up to the present there has been any suggestion that at any point in the industry there is a desire to control it.

      <P>It is interesting to know that the Fine Gael Party have the view that the imposition of a penalty on manufacturers for using faulty material is objectionable, while the imposition of 21 days' imprisonment on an old person who is an inmate of a county home does not seem to arouse any indignation whatever in their manly breasts.</P>

We are making an attempt in this section to trace the material back to its origin.  If we find any person is not doing his business properly in connection with the collecting, assembling, packing, and so on, we can deal with that person.  That is all I can say.

      <P>If some of the windbags were disinfected here and some of the wind that is put into them got a bit of a filtering beforehand, the atmosphere might not be as clouded as it is.  I would like to ask any of the Deputies who have shown an interest in our approach to this <Col N="1320" /> stantial discussion on the Financial particular section can they give us any more enlightenment than the Minister.  After all, there was a sub-Resolution when the Minister proposed to make a charge for the issue of licences in connection with the carrying on of this business, and the Minister appears just to say they have found some defects, from the standard of health point of view, in some of the manufactured goods that have been inspected in some of the manufacturers' places, and that they have difficulty in tracing where the objectionable material came from.  Now that is just a statement made, but in view of the serious doubts and fears that were expressed when we were dealing with the Financial Resolution that an attempt was being made here to affect the employment of people and the economic interests of people engaged in the manufacture of furniture and any preparation of filling, the Minister ought to have adopted some way or other to satisfy our fears on what is an important point.</P>
      <P>We have had very considerable experience, even in the advanced 20th century, and at the enlightened hands of some people who belong to the 20th century of what can be done by machinery and licences and fees in putting people out of industries that they are legitimately entitled to enter into.  We have had very considerable experience of the way in which the type of social and economic organisation that Fianna Fáil wished to build up with these powers could be used to put people out of industry and to make those people that are left in the possession of the concentrated industry, pillars of the type of political power and arrangement that the Fianna Fáil Party stood for.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it is an extraordinary thing when we are dealing peacefully here with health matters that some front bencher from Fine Gael comes in with filthy, dirty allegations and nothing else.

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We spent four days discussing a small amendment because Fine Gael wanted a certain committee to meet with the Press present so that they could go on with their propaganda. Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Mulcahy filled four volumes of the Official Report advocating that the Press be present so that they could go on with that kind of talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should circulate those volumes in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we should.  But we can never get down to business in a decent way as long as this kind of business goes on.  Deputy Mulcahy got away from the point but who was it that asked us to do this?  It was the Trade Union Congress that put it to me in 1946.  They said that the congress considered that the uncontrolled use of dirty materials&mdash;they were not referring to Fine Gael&mdash;in both new and second-hand upholstery and in bedding filling was a danger to the health of the public.  They said the congress was therefore of the considered opinion that after due inquiry legislation should be enacted setting down standards of cleanliness for all such materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Trade Union Congress met and considered the matter, I think they were dealing honestly with the situation they were up against.  I do not think they had any ulterior or special motive in passing that resolution. They sent it along to the Government of the time and it was put on the file to be dealt with whenever the Health Bill might be introduced.  This particular clause, as a matter of fact, appeared in the Health Bill of 1950, which was approved by Deputy <Col N="1323" /> Mulcahy, a Minister of the then Government, and, I suppose, approved of because he saw the political use that could be made of it.  He has pointed out to us the political use that can be made of licences and registrations.  I am sure that Deputy Mulcahy approved of this clause in 1950, rubbed his hands and said: &ldquo;Now we can get our friends into this business and wipe out our opponents because that is the way to use legislation of this kind.&rdquo;  Deputy Mulcahy approved of this in 1950.  So did Deputy MacBride.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They approved of this clause on the full understanding, as Deputy Mulcahy has just said, that the political Party in power can use it to wipe out their opponents in business and do their friends a good turn.  Is it not an extraordinary thing that Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy MacBride approved of the Bill for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The clause extends to two pages and every Deputy has it in front of him.  Deputy Mulcahy told everybody in this House the object a Government Party would have in inserting a clause of this kind in a Bill. He pointed out that it was put in for a particular purpose&mdash;to preserve their friends in business and to wipe out their opponents.  Now we know why Deputy Mulcahy approved of the Bill in 1950&mdash;in order to help his friends in the Fine Gael Party and wipe out his Fianna Fáil opponents.  We are not doing it with that object.  We are doing it because the Trade Union Congress asked us to deal with this matter, and we brought in this clause to deal with rag flock.  I pointed out already to Deputy Dr. Esmonde that we can license a person who is manufacturing mattresses or upholstery and, if we find that he has contravened the regulations more than once or twice, we can apply to have his licence withdrawn. We can also go back to the assemblers of the flock.  You cannot register a ragman; I do not know if the ragman exists in this country still.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he does, we can only go back and register the premises to which the ragman delivers his goods. That is, we can register the premises where the flock is assembled, where the rags are turned up and passed on to the manufacturers.  As I have said, the assembly premises should be compelled to put a mark on the material so that when an inspector goes into the manufacturing premises and finds that a particular filling material is not up to standard he knows where it came from.  He then pays a visit to the assembler to find out whether the assembler is carrying on under proper conditions or not.  In order to protect the public we want to see that upholstery and mattresses are filled with materials of a proper standard and which are clean, whether the business is carried on by a Fine Gael supporter or a Fianna Fáil supporter.  If Fine Gael were in power it would not matter whether they were clean or not.  That is the difference.  We stand for cleanliness. Deputy Mulcahy stands for political trickery.</P>

      <P>I do not see any reason why the Minister should use strong language.  This is a long section which deals with the question of licences.  This country is full of licences and quotas and the people are very keen on this question of licences and quotas.  We are sent here by the people to discuss these things and I take a very poor view of the Minister standing up and giving expression to a lot of political propaganda, pure and simple, and nothing else.  We are quite entitled to discuss these sections and, as I said before in this debate, we intend to do so.  No obstruction on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party or those who support the Fianna Fáil Party will stop us doing so.  Section 53 deals <Col N="1325" /> with licences and Deputy Mulcahy was quite entitled to ask the question which he did ask without being insulted, as I submit he was, by the Minister.  When he asked that question, the whole Fianna Fáil Party and those who support the Fianna Fáil Party flared up but the Deputy achieved his object because he got a reply from the Minister.  The only way we can get a reply from the Minister is to keep on asking questions.  The Minister lost his temper but he has nobody to blame but himself as we cannot get any information out of the Minister except by asking these questions.</P>

I was asking the Minister, before this pleasant little interlude, whether there were any licences in existence already. Paragraph (h) would seem to indicate that there are some licences in existence since it says that the regulations may provide for conditions governing the retention or renewal of licences. I understood from the Minister that there were no licences in existence. Can it be that there are some licences in existence and that possibly these licences may not be suitable for the Deputies opposite or, to put it the other way around, that there may be <Col N="1326" /> other people looking for licences as well?  I was not a bit suspicious when the discussion on this section started, but when I see people getting annoyed I cannot help feeling somewhat suspicious.
