      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware of the grave hardships imposed on unemployed persons in Dublin south west by reason of having to attend the employment exchange of Werburgh Street, particularly in view <Col N="479" /> of the increase in bus fares; and, if so, whether he will request C.I.E. to provide transport during the winter months from Crumlin, Kimmage and Drimnagh to the Werburgh Street employment exchange for unemployed women and men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. P.S. Doyle Mr. P.S. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that unemployed men resident in the Crumlin area are obliged to travel to and from Werburgh Street employment exchange three or four times weekly; which, owing to the long distance they have to travel by bus, imposes a serious strain on their limited means due to the increased bus fares; and if, with a view to giving some relief in this respect, he will recommend to C.I.E. to consider the making of some arrangement for reduced fares on production of an unemployed receipt card.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Question Nos. 3 and 4 together.  A person seeking unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance is statutorily required to prove unemployment by signing the unemployed register at the nearest employment exchange or branch employment office at regular intervals, depending on the distance he or she resides from the exchange or office.  In Dublin personal attendance for signature of the register is only required on alternate days.  I do not consider that attendance three times weekly imposes a great hardship on persons resident in Kimmage or Crumlin or Drimnagh particularly in view of the convenience of the public transport services from these points to the men's exchange in Werburgh Street and the women's exchange in Victoria Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 20 (2) of the Transport Act, 1950, it is provided that the board of C.I.E. may fix, demand, take and recover such charges as the board sees fit for services provided by it. The statutory position is, therefore, that the Minister for Industry and <Col N="480" /> Commerce has no functions in regard to the charges made by C.I.E. and, accordingly, I am unable to request or recommend to C.I.E. that reduced fares on the public transport system be granted to unemployed persons.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will introduce proposals for legislation to enable the National Health Insurance agents to be granted a gratuity in lieu of pension, as these officers are in nonpensionable employment and require some allowance on retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary say whether the service of National Health Insurance agents with the former State-owned National Health Insurance Society is reckoned as State service for the purpose of any gratuity to which they may be entitled under the Superannuation Acts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The great majority of agents were recruited by the former National Health Insurance Society who made it clear to them on engagement that the appointment carried no right to gratuity or allowance on its termination. As compensation for their noninclusion in the society's pension scheme, they received a content in their salary rate equivalent to 10 per cent. plus £4 per annum.  On assimilation into the Civil Service under the Social Welfare Act, 1950, their previous conditions of service continue to apply.</P>
      <P>Rural agents are paid on a capitation basis and may engage in other employment. In fact, many of them do so. Gratuities on retirement are granted only to persons in the Civil Service whose employment is whole time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state whether the decision to plant 25,000 acres annually will be implemented in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will refer to my statement when introducing the Forestry Estimate for the current year he will find ample evidence that the planting of as much as 25,000 acres either this year or next would be impracticable unless at the expense of proper forestry development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I indicated in that statement that nursery production was being geared to a 15,000 acre annual planting programme to enable the planting rate to be increased over the next few years <Col N="483" /> if land availabilities permit and presuming that necessary maintenance work would not suffer interference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it from the Minister's reply that the decision made by his predecessor when in office that in 1952 we would have reached a programme of 25,000 acres per annum cannot be fulfilled under any circumstances by the present Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it can be attained for several years.  I would not go so far as to say that it can never be attained.  As has been pointed out repeatedly in this House, one of the bases of forestry development is a reserve of plantable land of roughly three times the annual planting programme for the coming period.  The total amount of land on hands in the reserve stands at about 30,000 acres and it is extremely difficult to get suitable land.  Therefore, the Deputy will see that it is almost impossible to secure a 25,000 acre figure or anything near it in the present circumstances.</P>

As a matter of practice and so as not to block promotion, extensions are not granted to members with rank unless they have some special aptitude or technical skill the loss of which would impair the efficiency of the force.  As the sergeant in question had no such special qualifications the commissioner did not see fit to retain him and the Minister for Justice was not asked to consent to his retention.</P>

      <P>It would not be proper to discuss the arrests made yesterday and to-day but I think I should make clear what I am advised the general law is.</P>
      <P>The law does not allow people to congregate in such number or manner as to intimidate others from doing what those others have a lawful right to do.  The law also intervenes to prevent meetings and conduct which may be likely to lead to a breach of the peace.  A citizen driving a car, with or without milk, is entitled to pass and repass along the roads without being stopped and interrogated by other private citizens.  Further, where producers (whether of milk or other suplies or goods) withhold supplies or goods from distributors, there is no question of a trade dispute with the distributor, and it is not within the law to picket the distributor's premises.  Even in the case of a valid trade dispute a picket may not be of such numbers as to be calculated to intimidate; it is thereby rendered unlawful.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach (No. 16 of 1924; No. 40 of 1937; No. 38 of 1938; and No. 24 of 1947).</P>
      <P>From some of the remarks that were made when this question of unemployment was referred to last week it is clear to me that the main contention will be that this unemployment has been caused by Government policy, that it is the direct consequence of the financial policy, as it is called, of the Government.  For that reason it is right that we should consider what really has been the financial policy of the Government.  Last year, at Budget time, the Minister for Finance was faced with a deficit of £15,000,000&mdash; the contemplated expenditure was £15,000,000 in excess of the estimated revenue.  We have to make up our minds whether or not we will balance current expenditure by current revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate that ensued, as far as I remember, not a single member of the Dáil stated that it was not proper to aim at that balance.  The arguments were of quite a different kind.  In order to effect the balance, the Minister proposed to lessen expenditure by reducing the food subsidies and to make certain compensations so that the strain might not be too heavy on the weaker sections.  All he was able to get when the compensations were taken from the saving on the food subsidies was a sum of slightly less than £4,000,000.  That meant that, of the £15,000,000, £11,000,000 had to be met <Col N="492" /> by increased taxation.  We had a great deal of complaint about the reduction of the food subsidies, and we had at the same time a great deal of complaint about the increase in taxation. It was conveniently forgotten, of course, that if we had not reduced the food subsidies we would have had to impose more taxation.  However, the policy of the Government and the Minister was to effect the balance in the manner I have indicated.</P>
    <P>What were the arguments by which we were met by the Opposition at the time?  The arguments were that this additional taxation was altogether unnecessary, that we had inflated the expenditure.  We appealed to the common sense of Deputies and of the public by pointing out that no Government in its senses would increase taxation unnecessarily.  We asked what had the Government to gain by any such course; what had the community to gain by unnecessary taxation?  We pointed out that it was ridiculous to think that we were engaged in any such course.</P>
    <P>When at a loss to find an excuse, Opposition Deputies suggested that we were secretly budgeting for a very large surplus at the end of the year in order that, with that surplus, we might be able to reduce taxation in this coming year.  It was suggested that there was at least some £10,000,000 of unnecessary taxation, and figures were adduced to try to bolster up that case. These figures were demolished as effectively as arguments could demolish them, but nevertheless the suggestion continued to be made that the taxation was unnecessary and that some £10,000,000 was being extracted from the taxpayers' pockets without any necessity.  The changes were rung on the damage that this unnecessary extraction of money out of the pockets of the community would do to the whole economic structure.</P>
    <P>We are now coming close to the end of the year, and we can see how things are working out.  Where do we find any evidence of this £10,000,000 surplus that we are supposed to have?  I pointed out at the time that my fear was that, when we came to the end of the year, <Col N="493" /> far from having any large surpluses, as was suggested, we would find, possibly, that revenue would not equal expenditure and that we would have a deficit again.  It is not possible at this stage to foresee exactly how the accounts will balance.  The latest information that I have been able to get, by way of anticipation, is that there will be a deficit.</P>
    <P>In view of these facts, might I ask whether it is suggested now that Government policy in regard to trying to make ends meet is responsible for unemployment?  In other words, are we earnestly and vigorously to aim at balancing our accounts or are we deliberately to aim at a deficit Budget? Unless it be contended that we should have budgeted for a deficit, nearly every one of the arguments put forward as to the effect of taxation must fall to the ground, except it be suggested now that expenditure could be cut down.  When we did come to cut down expenditure in the way which was most in the interests of the community, we were met with intense opposition.  On every occasion on which there is a proposal regarding expenditure here the Opposition will always want more expenditure.  For any benefits which have to be met out of the public purse, the argument all the time is that these benefits are not enough.  Of course the Opposition will always want to have it both ways.  They want increased benefits, and they want at the same time decreased taxation.  These are two divergent aims and they cannot be secured at one and the same time. The Opposition used to talk about the reduction of expenditure by some £20,000,000, prior to assuming office in 1948.  When the Opposition came into office we saw no reduction of the magnitude of £20,000,000.  On the contrary, we saw substantial increases.</P>

      <P>We have discussed this <i>ad nauseam</i> and the figures have been quoted <i>ad nauseam.</i>  The fact is that, if one compares expenditure before the last Government came into office &mdash; of course immediately they took office they made a demonstration &mdash; one <Col N="494" /> will see that within a year or two of their taking office expenditure had gone up by several millions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that many of the people who spoke about reducing expenditure were people who had been in office on a previous occasion, and they should have known that one cannot decrease expenditure and increase social and other benefits at the same time.  The two things are impossible of achievement, but reducing expenditure was a good catch-cry for election purposes: &ldquo;We will reduce expenditure by so many millions&rdquo; was the slogan.</P>
      <P>The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  The figures are there for everybody to see.  Within a very short time of the last Government assuming office it will be found that, comparing their expenditure with expenditure in the previous period, expenditure had gone up by several millions.  Government expenditure was not reduced during that period.</P>
      <P>It is inherent in politics that an Opposition must always strive to do the things that are popular.  An Opposition does not bear the responsibility that a Government has &mdash; to make ends meet.  An Opposition does not strive to make ends meet.  They are not compelled to try to balance their accounts. It has happened in the past, it will probably happen in the future, that on every occasion on which a measure is introduced conferring benefits on certain sections of the community the Opposition will seek to increase those benefits and subsequently, when the cash has to be found, they will oppose the measures necessary for providing the cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make is that, unless the Opposition claims that this is a time in which we should have deficit budgeting, they can make no case that the Government policy of balancing the Budget has in any way whatsoever led to the present position. It will not surprise me if some of them talk about deficit budgeting. <Col N="495" /> There was deficit budgeting in the past.  There had been deficit budgeting when we took over in 1951.  There was, in 1951-52, a deficit of some £4,000,000 on items that will not be disputed by the Opposition as being current items.  We had in that year a deficit of £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>Are we or are we not to borrow to meet current expenses?  We hold that whilst under very exceptional circumstances deficit budgeting may be resorted to in order to meet a special emergency, if we want to get down to normal working and if we want to achieve something like stability and something permanent, we must make ends meet and revenue must balance expenditure.  Increased taxation does, of course, take out of the pockets of the individual money that the individual would otherwise have an opportunity of spending for himself. If it is taken by the State it may not be spent to the best advantage in order to meet local needs and to encourage private enterprise, which is the best way of giving employment. So much for the first point in our financial policy of balancing our Budget.</P>
    <P>The next urgent problem confronting us was to try to reduce the deficit in our international payments account. When the official figures were calculated it appeared that there was a deficit in our international payments for the year 1951 of £61.6 million.  In the previous year there had been a deficit of £30,000,000, and in the year before that a deficit of £10,000,000. It will be seen from those figures that there was a progressive increase in the magnitude of the deficit.</P>
    <P>These deficits meant that by corresponding amounts our net external assets were being reduced, and that over a period of three years there was a reduction of over £100,000,000 in our net external assets.  In 1949 the total of these assets was reckoned to be about £225,000,000.  I think £400,000,000 represented our gross external assets and our liabilities amounted to about £175,000,000, leaving a balance of £225,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> Most of these figures are, of course, estimates.  They are as accurate as a competent investigator could make them.  So far as I am aware, they have not been seriously questioned.  At the end of 1951 we had only £125,000,000 worth of net external assets.  That was the amount that saved us from being a debtor instead of a creditor nation.  A couple of years with deficits in the region of £61,000,000 would have changed us from being a creditor to a debtor nation and would have left us without any net external reserves, with all the adverse consequences that would flow from that situation.</P>
    <P>At the moment, in case of necessity, we can for any good or sufficient reasons realise some of our external assets.  They are available, and we can use them.  If, however, we were to continue along the road on which we were travelling in 1951, in two years from that time we would have come suddenly to a situation in which we would find ourselves without any reserve to call on in time of necessity.</P>
    <P>Will the members of the Dáil say it was wrong financial policy that we should aim at changing that situation and drastically reducing that deficit? The best way of doing it would be, of course, if you could, to increase production and increase our exports, but that is something which, with the best will in the world, you cannot do quickly.  It takes time to have productive enterprises mature and give you the results which you hope for when the enterprises are being embarked upon. Increased production is the cure, and perhaps, before I conclude, I will repeat what I have said many times about the direction in which that increased production can best be secured.  At any rate, it would not give us within a year the results we felt the situation demanded, so we had also to reduce imports, to go through the list of imports and discourage those which were not vitally necessary.</P>
    <P>The year 1951 and preceding years were ones in which there was a tremendous increase in the amount of our imports.  There was, as a result of the Korean war, feverish stockpiling. Because of that and also because of the general monetary and financial situation <Col N="497" /> here, there was a great deal of over buying, with no attention being paid to savings.  The worst feature of these deficits I have mentioned was that, if you take, for instance, the increase from the £10,000,000 to the £30,000,000 of this £20,000,000 only about one half represented capital formation.  The rest was spent on consumer goods.  If you examine the next year's deficit, you will find that of the £31,000,000 by which the £61,000,000 exceeded the £30,000,000, only about one half corresponded to capital formation. The other half was expenditure over and above that which would have been possible if we were to live strictly within our means and make consumption and production meet.  This situation meant that there were really no savings in the year 1951.  A general examination of it shows that there was practically no community saving; yet, while that was happening, there was a very extensive campaign of capital investment.</P>
    <P>As far as the second point in our financial policy is concerned, again I put it to the Dáil that it was adopted essentially to safeguard the nation economically.  The dangers of these high deficits were well understood by the Opposition when they were themselves in Government, with the responsibilities of Government on their shoulders.  When the deficit increased from £10,000,000 to £30,000,000 they gave warning of the dangers and pointed out how alarming was this increase.  Surely, if it was alarming when it went up to the magnitude of £30,000,000, it was sufficiently alarming to make the Government of the day look sharp and take action when it reached £61,000,000.  I say, then, that on these two points of general policy, if the Government were to do their duty at all, there was no alternative for them.</P>
    <P>We were not against capital investment. We had plans in 1947 which indicated a considerable expansion in capital investment for which the State would be taking the initiative and be largely responsible.  But at all times we knew that there were limits to what could be done.  We were not like the <Col N="498" /> frog that wanted to become equal to the ox and blew himself up in the process.  We realised fully what were the limitations of our financial and economic resources and that we had to live within them and not to imagine that we had the resources, say, of the U.S.A. or some other big nation.  Our resources were definitely limited, and we had to live within them if we were not going to jeopardise the economic future of our nation.  Therefore, as far as balancing the Budget and trying to bring about a balance in our international payments are concerned, the Government took the only course that was really open to them to take.</P>
    <P>The next question was our capital programme.  As I have said, we were never opposed to capital development. At no time have we said that any reserves which we had outside should not be brought home if they could be used for production here at home giving dividends anything like what they were giving while they were outside. Perhaps we should have been more conservative than that.  The return on our external investments enables us, year by year, to bring in millions of pounds worth of goods, just as if we had sent out exports to an equivalent amount.  They were valuable in enabling us to import these goods every year.  They were producing capital and consumable goods which we needed to the extent of several million pounds, the amount varying from time to time.  If you part with that right or power to get goods from outside, you must see that goods are produced at home to something like the same amount.  The only test we ever had with regard to the realisation or utilisation of these foreign reserves was to see that they were employed here in a manner that would give the same national dividends in the way of goods or the utilisation of national resources.</P>
    <P>From the very beginning, Fianna Fáil set out to develop the national resources of the country, and wherever it was a question of utilising some of our outside investments to get that done we have never hesitated to use them.  Let nobody suggest that as a Government we were against capital development or the realisation or <Col N="499" /> return&mdash;or, using that famous word, the repatriation &mdash; of our assets or some of them.</P>
    <P>What was the actual capital requirement in accordance with the programme which we set before us and which was also the programme adopted by the Coalition Government, when it changed its old attitude and reverted to the policy of Fianna Fáil in these respects?  The policy of capital development became common policy, and the only question was the extent to which it could be done and the manner in which it could be done.  We are running now at a rate at which, according to the latest the Minister for Finance has told me, there are demands amounting to something like £47,000,000 for the coming year.  Taking it generally, there was a demand this year for something like £42,000,000, of which £35,000,000 is for direct Government enterprise, for the financing of which the Government became almost immediately responsible, and the remaining £7,000,000 is required to meet other needs, such as those of Dublin and Cork Corporations.  Therefore, £35,000,000 was the immediate State requirement.</P>
    <P>To meet that, one should have current savings to practically the same amount, that is, if we were to act on a sound basis that would continue.  I am not going to say that that should not be supplemented, that it could not be very profitably supplemented, by the realisation of some of our foreign investments, on the conditions I have mentioned &mdash; that is, when we do realise these foreign investments they should be applied and used here in a manner in which they would be at least as productive as they have been and supply us directly with the goods which we were indirectly getting through them from outside.</P>
    <P>Compare that £35,000,000 needed with our savings.  I have told you that our savings in one year were nil. Can we get them up to £35,000,000? The savings which the State could hope to get were practically nil.  How were we to get those savings stepped up to such an extent that there would <Col N="500" /> be some £35,000,000 over and above the ordinary needs of private enterprise? About one half that figure seemed to be the sum one would arrive at as being likely.  Is it unreasonable to look for savings of the magnitude of £35,000,000 annually from the community?  The national income, according to the latest figure we have, is about £369,000,000.  Ten per cent. of that would be about £37,000,000.  Is that an unreasonable amount to look for?  In other countries they are able to save from 10 to 15 per cent., and it is not regarded as unreasonable.  We ought to strive to get at least 10 per cent.  Are we able to do it?  The indications were far short of that.  The sum we were likely to get was far short of that.</P>
    <P>Under those circumstances if we are to keep up this rate of capital investment at home &mdash; of a magnitude of from £35,000,000 to £40,000,000 &mdash; there will be a very heavy demand on our external reserves.  These reserves are not unlimited.  Even though we could do it we should think twice before we deprive ourselves completely of these reserves, even though there are some projects at home in which they could be usefully applied. If we are careful not to make the demand too heavy we can use them to supplement our savings for capital development here up to a reasonable sum for a number of years, but we certainly cannot afford to draw on them as heavily as we have been doing in some recent years.</P>
    <P>Some people seem to suggest that the amounts that are available are far greater than they really are.  Take the sums that are available to the Minister for Finance directly through Post Office savings, Savings Certificates and some other departmental funds.  The liability standing against the sums which he holds, the repayments which can be demanded from him in cash, amount to about £86,000,000.  The latest figure I have shows that, in external assets, he has only about £30,500,000.</P>
    <P>The money which the Central Bank has to meet the legal tender notes is some £65,000,000.  There has been a <Col N="501" /> good deal of discussion as to whether all that money should be kept in external assets or whether some of it should not properly be put into Irish securities.  That is a question of which different views can very well be taken. At the moment, there is no immediate need to decide which way it should be done.  If a decision had to be arrived at, I have my own views about it; but I do not think a decision has to be arrived at, as there are other resources. It is a matter on which there are strong differences of opinion.  We can leave it aside for the moment, but if it became a question of having to take a decision, the Government would take a decision on it.</P>
    <P>The next item in our external assets is the amount held by the commercial banks.  The net amount is, I think, something about £109,000,000.</P>
    <P>The total under these headings for March, 1952, was about £211,000,000. That seems a substantial sum, but when you inquire how much of that is really readily available, you find that there are considerable restrictions in regard to the realisation of these sums. The commercial banks have their own obligations and responsibilities.  So far, we have not found any enterprise for which we definitely wanted money in respect of which we were not fairly met by the banks.  I am sure that will be the position in the future, but if a different situation should arise, that particular situation would have to be dealt with.  It has not arisen immediately, anyhow.</P>
    <P>The position is that, at considerable loss, we have realised the assets which were necessary to carry out our capital programme.  Year by year, it is going to become more difficult, unless we have a greater amount of savings; and the whole economic position is going to be more difficult unless we are able to step up production.  The stepping up of production is, from the general economic point of view, the main aim of the Government's economic policy. There is one direction in which the stepping up of production is obviously possible and immediately called for, and that is in the agricultural industry. Anybody who studies the situation&mdash;<Col N="502" /> and a number of people have studied these matters, over recent years in particular &mdash; must be convinced that agricultural production can be stepped up at a far higher rate than any other production, by proper attention to it.</P>
    <P>The land is calling out for fertilisers, for lime&mdash;or ground limestone, if you wish to put it in that form &mdash; and other fertilisers.  In other countries the amount of fertilisers used is many times the amount we use, and they have production accordingly.  We have been appealing to the farmers to bear that fact in mind and to remember that a small initial outlay is able to produce over a period of years many times the amount in crops of the cash that has to be invested.  There is the question of credit, which is a matter which is engaging the attention of the Government with a view to seeing, if credits are necessary, how these can best be provided.</P>
    <P>There is also the necessity to produce the things required for increased production, such as ground limestone, and the question of how that can be produced in the quantities required and made directly available to the farmers. An increase in production will, of course, enable us, with the same rates of taxation, to bear the burdens much more easily, and it is in that direction that we have mainly to seek for relief. The time has come when we are bearing a burden of taxation which is already so heavy that we are practically staggering under it.  If we are to continue increasing benefits, social and other benefits, increased taxation is necessary.  If we have increased production, that is tolerable, but we have reached a point at which, without increased production, further taxation is going to be definitely harmful to the community, and, so far as we are concerned, we are going to set our faces definitely against it.</P>
    <P>I have said all this as an introduction to the problems which we have to discuss mainly because I want to point out that the steps the Government has taken, the financial and economic steps, were steps which were absolutely necessary to meet the grave problems with which we were faced when we came into office.  The suggestion is <Col N="503" /> made, first, that some alternative policy could have been adopted, and I am trying to prove that there was no alternative, in the situation with which we were faced, but to do the things we did.  In addition to the suggestion that there were alternative policies, there is the suggestion that some of the things that have happened have happened because of that policy, but that is a suggestion that cannot be sustained either.</P>
    <P>We are quite willing to admit that heavy taxation does make for less expenditure by the private individual and that its general tendency is to decrease the amount of employment that would otherwise be given.  I think that is true, and I will not seek to dispute it.  Generally, if you are taking out of the people's pockets money which otherwise they would be at liberty to spend and would be likely to spend in a way in which employment would be given, there will be less employment, and employment by private individuals is far preferable to, and far more elastic in its nature than, employment given directly by the State.  The fact that taxation is heavy is admitted.  If we could have lighter taxation, we would probably have, in certain directions anyhow, more employment, but the taxation was necessary to meet the expenditure on State and other services, the social services, for the removal of which I have heard nobody in the House put up a case.  The present social services have, so far as I know, been accepted by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>The unemployment in the main, up to the present anyhow, has been due to the fact that there was at the outbreak of the Korean war buying and stocking up of materials at high prices.  The public were slow to buy at these high prices.  A lot of consumer goods were brought in here, which meant that some of our factories which would have been producing these goods were on short time.  I instanced the other day the case of the clothing and textile industries. The using up of these stocks has taken place since the high price boom which followed the outbreak of <Col N="504" /> the Korean war.  Once that subsided a recession began to develop.  These stocks of materials have been slowly used up.  The using up of these meant that some of our industries were not working at full capacity.  Our aim was to try to reverse that situation as quickly as we could.  Consequently you had the Minister for Industry and Commerce reintroducing bit by bit, according as it was possible to do it, protective measures mainly intended to restore employment and, if possible, to increase employment in some of the manufacturing industries.</P>

      <P>The figures for unemployment have been disturbing. I do not want for one moment to say that there is not a problem, but in order to get down to that problem, to see exactly what it is and how best it can be remedied, one has to go into considerable detail.  It was only yesterday that I was able to get an analysis of the unemployment figures for January.  These figures seem to follow very closely the pattern of the unemployment figures of December. They are mainly on the construction and building side, in transport and in one or two other main directions. To find out what the cause of the increased unemployment in construction is we must remember that, so far as building and construction deals with house building, many of our local schemes are coming near to completion.  I think there were 116 such schemes and something like 69 are already coming towards completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a factor which, in the absence of alternative employment, has been contributing to unemployment in that particular direction.  A certain amount of employment is provided in the construction of bridges, etc., but the building of houses here in Dublin seems to have slowed up, although last year was a year in which the second highest number of houses was built.  I think the number built last year was 14,000. The highest number we ever had built in a year was about 17,000, during the <Col N="505" /> pre-war period.  There has been a recession, and the question is what has been causing it.  Is it an absence of planning ahead?</P>

      <P>Is it increased cost or the increased difficulty in getting purchasers which is responsible?  One has to make a number of inquiries to make sure that any one of the reasons given is the true one.  Each one of the reasons given has played a particular part.  The figures, however, have to be examined in regard to their effect when comparing December with January. There is also the fact that the Social Welfare Act has come into operation and has a considerable effect on these numbers.  As I have said, I have only just got the analysis of the figures for January, and I have not had time to examine them in detail, to find out in what particular direction the situation can be remedied.  Quite independent of that fact, these figures are under examination.  It may be even that the best solution will be the general solution we have always aimed at, that is by pushing ahead our industrial programme. There is a great deal of unemployment, for instance, in agriculture. Yet we hear constantly that the farmers cannot get the necessary labour.</P>

      <P>So far as I am concerned, the only remark I wish to make is that it is the duty of the Government and the duty of the Garda Síochána to enforce the law, as they understand it.  The courts will decide whether or not there has been any infringement of the law.  So far as we are concerned, our duty is to see that the law is obeyed.  That is all.  Deputy Dillon seems to suggest somehow that the Government is antagonistic to the farmers.  I doubt if I have ever spoken or ever acted &mdash; certainly not to my knowledge&mdash;in any way&mdash;I have always put it as the test &mdash; that was contrary to the interests of the small farmer or the worker.  We have constantly kept the interests of these two sections of the community in mind.  So far as the farming community is concerned, our actions in the past are the best proof that we realise that the working small farmer is the backbone of this country and that if he and his industry go down, then the rest of us will crumble down with him.</P>

      <P>With that I will conclude.  I want to point out that any unemployment which exists is not the result of any financial policy that is being pursued by the Government. It is, in fact, mainly due to the results of buying at high prices &mdash; the panic buying &mdash; and the stocking-up as a result of the Korean war.  The proof that it is not anything peculiar to our policy is that it is paralleled by similar unemployment in other countries.  That is about the best proof that it is not something that follows from our policy here</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="508" /> It is necessary to point out that the recent live register figures have to be reduced considerably to make them comparable with previous figures. They are affected by changes due to the Social Welfare Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have approached the original Estimate in a different manner.  I had, in fact, last July proposed to deal with it in a certain way.  Deputy Costello, when he was Taoiseach, introduced a rather good practice, one which would prevent the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate from being a repetition of the arguments and discussions which had taken place on the other Estimates. He initiated what I considered a good practice: that is, to have a general economic survey.  I felt, however, that that would be rather too academic for the present situation and the atmosphere in which I understood this Estimate was being brought on quickly.  I understand and appreciate the fact that this debate is being used by the Opposition to deal with what they regard as an important situation, namely, that of the growth of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. We all very deeply sympathise with the Taoiseach on the circumstances which forced him to absent himself from active public life in the country for such a long time.  We appreciate very much that he has given us this opportunity on his Estimate of <Col N="509" /> discussing the present situation.  We sincerely hope that the rest and the treatment he had restored him at any rate to facing up to his work in the ordinary kind of way.  May I say, not unkindly, that I think he has given us every evidence by his performance just now that he really is his old self again.</P>
      <P>He has indicated that his approach to the discussion on this Estimate would have been different if it had taken place in July.  It is quite definite that we are discussing now not the Budget, as it was discussed last year, but the circumstances which arise to-day and the Taoiseach has attempted to hang a curtain in front of that problem.  It is a very threadbare curtain and the problem that remains to be discussed to-day, whatever it flowed from, is a very definite and serious one.  The problem that remains to be discussed is that which exists to-day whatever it arose from.  How are the Government estimating that problem and how do they propose to deal with it are matters we want to discuss now.</P>
      <P>The discussion of the Budget, such as it was, and the financial results that flowed from it as far as the Exchequer goes will be discussed in another six weeks, or at any rate when we come to discuss the Vote on Account and when we have the Estimates in front of us and will be discussed more correctly and effectively when we see the results of the financial income for the year and the estimate of all the revenue understood by the Treasury and the Government to be expected at the present rates for the year that will come after the 1st April of this year.</P>
      <P>We are examining the situation that resulted from the taking of money from the people by taxation, from the taking of money from the people by increasing food prices through removing the subsidies, the results of which were accentuated by the Government's policy with regard to the raising of the rate of interest on loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone could have anticipated, as we did, that the infliction of the Budget, the taking of additional taxation from the people, would give rise to a very considerable amount of <Col N="510" /> unemployment.  We are asking the Government what they are going to do about that unemployment.  On a number of occasions, the Tánaiste spoke of the critical struggle that is taking place at the present time.  I think that the Taoiseach, the Government and the House will have to examine the position and endeavour to find out what that struggle is.  Is it a struggle in the Executive Council chamber or is it here?  That struggle is taking place around the homes of the people in Cabra, Crumlin, Limerick, Donegal and Tipperary.  They are facing the lack of employment, high prices and a lack of money brought about by the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>We hear of whole families in Donegal going to the Tánaiste's office to get a permit to bring their furniture to Scotland or England because they have to clear out from West Donegal.  We have the figures, not for January, but for September, October, November and December of this year showing what the position is with regard to recorded unemployment on the one hand and recorded employment on the other hand.  The recorded unemployment is substantially greater than it was last year and the recorded employment is substantially less.  The figures in between show that a large part of the population has left.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has indicated that the trade balance and the budgetary balancing have been &ldquo;rectified&rdquo; and that these were the two great problems that the Government set out to solve at the beginning of the year.  These are &ldquo;rectified.&rdquo;  What is the Government doing to rectify the problem that is disclosed in the unemployment figures and in the position that is shown in the way in which they are collecting their taxes, on the one hand, and in the high prices to people, on the other hand?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has indicated that the unemployment created in this country, and that manifested itself so severely last year, arose out of stockpiling.  He has indicated that the January unemployment figures are inflated by certain additional registrations under the Social Welfare Act of 1952.  Let us, then, examine the figures for December <Col N="511" /> and see where stockpiling has added to the unemployment.  Let us take the figures for those engaged in industry, that is, in employment other than in agriculture, fishing and domestic service &mdash; the figures for which are quoted regularly in the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i> The figures for August, September and October last will be found in the December, 1952, issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i>  I got the following information from the Statistics Office which enables me to make a comparison between the figures for unemployment in industry&mdash;other than agriculture, fishing and domestic service&mdash;in December, 1951, and December, 1952.</P>
    <P>Did we do any stockpiling in food? Yet the recorded unemployment figure rose from 1,562 in December, 1951, to 2,090 in December, 1952.  Did we do any stockpiling in drink?  Yet the unemployment figure has gone up from 299 to 432.  The number of unemployed on woodwork, furniture and fittings rose from 436 to 597.  Did we do any stockpiling in regard to metal manufacture and engineering?  The unemployment figure in that respect rose from 679 to 1,110.  The number of unemployed in respect of vehicles rose from 638 to 1,171.  Did we do any stockpiling in regard to mining and quarrying?  I do not know what stockpiling we may have done in that respect but the unemployment figure rose from 134 to 247.  I do not know whether we stockpiled in bricks and building materials but the unemployment figure rose from 134 to 255.  Did we stockpile in regard to public administration, the unemployment figure for which rose from 897 to 1,041?  Whatever stockpiling we may have done among the professions, the unemployment figure rose from 281 to 334.  The unemployment figure in relation to personal services, other than private domestic service, rose from 1,986 to 2,442.  So much for stockpiling.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the position in relation to the items to which the Taoiseach referred.  The number of registered unemployed in general building&mdash;houses and so forth&mdash;has gone up from 4,615 in December, 1951 to 7,067.  In other construction work <Col N="512" /> (roads, and so forth) the unemployment figure has risen from 6,209 to 7,836.  I do not know whether we stockpiled in the case of gas, electricity and water, but the unemployment figure in that respect has risen from 223 to 301.  The unemployment figure in relation to transport and communications has risen from 2,419 to 3,579, and in relation to distributive trades from 4,043 to 5,116.</P>
    <P>Out of 25 different groups, there has been an increase in the unemployment rate between December, 1951 and December, 1952.  The percentage of unemployed in December, 1951, compared with that in December, 1952, rose from 7.8 to 9.1.</P>
    <P>There are five sections in which there has been a reduction in unemployment. There has been a reduction of 25 in the number of persons employed in relation to tobacco, of 46 in the number of persons employed in relation to fertilisers, chemicals, paints, and so forth, and of 49 in the number of people employed in relation to finances.</P>
    <P>In the textile industry there has been a reduction in unemployment of from 2,027 in December, 1951, to 811 in December, 1952, and of from 4,082 in the clothing industry in December, 1951, to 870 in December, 1952.  Therefore you have there a reduction in unemployment of 3,428.</P>
    <P>Let me quote now from page 234 of the December, 1952, issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal.</i>  In the general industrial groups, other than those which I have mentioned, the total number employed in October, 1950, was 141,093.  In September, 1951 &mdash; which is the year quoted as analogous to October, 1950 &mdash; the figure was 133,210. The figure for September, 1952, is 125,902.</P>
    <P>I spoke of the reduction in unemployment in the textile and clothing industries.  There has been a reduction in unemployment there and an increase in employment.  But, between the reduction in unemployment and the increase in employment we see that 2,000 people who were engaged in the textile and clothing industries in 1951 have vanished by the time we <Col N="513" /> reach 1952, comparing the September, 1951, and the September, 1952, figures. They were the only two groups out of 25 in which there was anything that could be called a reduction in unemployment: there was a small increase in the numbers employed.  However, when you put the two together and look what is happening in the textile and clothing sphere you will see that 2,000 persons have vanished.  Those members of the Government who cannot get exact figures for emigration might find it interesting to seek the particulars that are available in the employment exchanges in respect of the number of persons engaged in the textile and clothing industries and to find out how 2,000 persons vanished between the period September, 1951, and September, 1952.</P>
    <P>When we consider the unemployment returns we have to realise that there is a certain hard core of people on the register who are unemployable and others because of Employment Orders. If you want to see what the real vital problem in regard to unemployment is, you have to take the figures recorded for men.  In January, 1951, the figure was 56,971, and in January, 1952, it was 61,302, an increase of 4,400 odd.  In January, 1953, the figure was 75,830, an increase of 14,528 on the 1952 figure. The Taoiseach has indicated that some of that increase may have arisen out of the special registration following the Social Welfare Act of 1952.  That is a matter that can be freely examined, but that unemployment is there, and that reduction in employment is there, too. We are asking the Taoiseach what is the Government going to do about it. Unemployment creates problems for various people, but the financial policy of the Government has created other problems for them.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach if he has been looking at the way the financial returns are running at the present time.  The Government estimated that they would get in tax revenue this year £85,945,000 as against what was estimated for the previous year&mdash; £71,126,000.  We find that, out of that estimate of increased income of £14,819,000, up to the present they have squeezed about £8,000,000 odd <Col N="514" /> out of the people.  It has been coming in in rather interesting ways.  About £4,400,000 additional has been brought in under the customs.  I suggest that under the cutting down of imports, which we hear about, and this increase of £4,500,000 under customs, something is happening which raises very substantially the cost of living on the people generally.</P>
    <P>I come now to income-tax.  Up to the end of December, there had been collected in income-tax £10,029,000 as against £10,499,000 in the previous year.  Up to the 31st December last, although the Government expected £3,300,000 more in income-tax, they had collected about £400,000 less than they had collected in December, 1951, but, in the month of January, they had squeezed out of the income-tax paying people £1,467,000 more than they did in January, 1952.  How are they doing it?  Ask the employers who are being asked to pay up the income-tax that it is alleged their employees owe.  It is being squeezed out of the salaried class who, according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce when figuring out all the liabilities that are there in front of the Government at the moment, have not got increases in salaries analogous to those that were got by the workers during 1952.</P>
    <P>Here is the hand of the Revenue Commissioners going out, so that in the month of January, 1952, they took £4,773,000 from income-tax payers, while they took £6,847,000 in January of this year, although the circumstances were such that, in the first nine months of the financial year, they collected less income-tax than they did in the corresponding nine months of the previous year.  There is that squeeze on that particular class, of whom the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Taoiseach very often speak, that is harsh and disturbing.</P>
    <P>We have the position now forced on employers by the Revenue Commissioners that whereas a wife, say, whose husband is misspending his money cannot go to the employer and demand a certain amount of money out of his salary to keep herself and the children or to pay the rent &mdash; to get what is her <Col N="515" /> natural right &mdash; the income-tax collectors can go to the employer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Because they cannot be paid in a spontaneous kind of way then &mdash; if the Deputy wants to accept that it is law that is working &mdash; some law is invoked to take from people what they want for the maintenance of their families and to dislocate the relations between employers and employees.</P>
      <P>I do not want to introduce this matter as the major matter that requires to be discussed here, and I again, Sir, would suggest to you, if Deputy Cowan is not able to contain himself in this House, that he could go outside for a while.</P>

      <P>I am much more interested in getting what I have to say over to the Government so as to get the Government to understand the situation than I am to carry on any kind of disorderly backchat with Deputy Cowan.  If I impose too much on the time of the House as a result of Deputy Cowan's interruptions I hope other Deputies will bear with me and realise that I am making points that it is absolutely necessary and absolutely vital to make.</P>
      <P>That is the position on the incometax side and the position on the customs side is very much the same. With reduced imports £4,500,000 more has been taken in ten months at the ports, with inevitable reactions on the general situation with regard to the cost of very many articles.</P>
      <P>Having stated that the Budget problem has been rectified and that the balance of trade has been rectified, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the 12th January, said: &ldquo;Unless a significant and all-round increase in production could be achieved the gains already made would be lost again and the last position would be worse than the first.&rdquo; I do not know what &ldquo;the gains already made&rdquo; are but if the position is going to be worse as a result of non-increase of production, what will be worse?  The ability of our people to pay, the ability of our people to get employment, the lack of sufficient production to go around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> What is the Government doing to see that there is an improvement in production?  What is happening that suggests to the Government that the necessary increase in production in either agriculture or industrial goods will take place this year?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach informed us about all the money that he wanted for Government capital expenditure and he thought that he might expect normally to get about £35,000,000, 10 per cent. of the national income, but he tells us that private enterprise and the production brought about and the employment given by private enterprise is a much more satisfactory way of giving employment and of stabilising conditions in the country.  Where are the investment moneys, the savings, to come from to maintain expanding production in private hands in agriculture or industry from the money available at the present time?  Down on top of their budgetary policy, the Government have imposed a dear money policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only that, but the Minister for Finance was not satisfied with underwriting £2,500,000 for the Dublin Corporation at 5 per cent. but he had to get as big an underwriting squeeze out of it as any banker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The 5 per cent. interest policy I take as Government policy.  The Government sponsored and acquiesced in the policy of the Dublin Corporation borrowing at 5 per cent. Whoever started the policy &mdash; which was the British Government, for the purposes <Col N="519" /> of their own British Budget &mdash; when the Government acquiesced and underwrote half of the Dublin Corporation loan at 5 per cent. and stuck on another 1 per cent. as underwriting fee, they adopted the policy.</P>
      <P>What effect will the dear money policy have on getting investment funds for the development of either agriculture or industry?  The anxiety and the uncertainty that has been created by the Government's policy and by all that it has said in favour of it and all that it has said about it has undermined the confidence of anybody who wants to develop industry in this country.  Such savings as are available naturally flow into a Government loan or even a Dublin Corporation loan in order to keep them safely out of the way.  Will the Taoiseach or any other member of the Government tell us where the moneys will be available from that will maintain and secure the development policy in agriculture and industry that the Minister for Industry and Commerce says is absolutely necessary if the situation is not to get worse?  He says that if we could achieve in industry and agriculture the considerable expansion of production which was practicable, we could get over our difficulties.</P>
      <P>We want the Government to say if they know what the unemployment situation is, what the under-employment situation is.  If, looking into the future, they are expecting increased production in this country to enable them to collect the revenue that they want at the present rates or to maintain the people in any kind of reasonable comfort, where will these investment funds come from?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach ask us to believe in a policy that has increased every month since May last, by £2,000,000, the sterling assets accumulating to our credit in London?  Every month since May last an additional £2,000,000 has accumulated in moneys of our people held in London to support the economy of another people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, because of the circumstances that have been created by Government policy in this country, £2,000,000 a month of the investment potential for our people here has been accumulating in London. Where our money goes, there our people go.  When our accumulated income is not used here to develop our country, our people will inevitably follow it.  Our money goes over there and our people follow.  I ask the Taoiseach does he believe in a policy that brings that about?  One of the reasons why that money is accumulating in that way is that in the cutting down of imports to this country, raw materials necessary for the carrying on of our industries are being kept out.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has the whole statistical machinery there. It is perfectly clear that in the reduction of imports during last year a substantial amount of the imports that were kept out were required here for semi-manufacture and for raw materials for our own industries.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect of that and of the Government's concern for the balance of payments was that, while we are able accurately to estimate the value and volume of our exports, there is not the same facility or machinery to estimate accurately what moneys come into this country.  There is a substantial amount of opinion amongst people qualified to have an opinion on the <Col N="521" /> matter that there has been accumulated a large accretion of external assets belonging to us abroad which has not been calculated or acknowledged to our credit in the estimates that have been made.</P>
      <P>You have, therefore, absurd confusion, not necessarily entirely between the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance, but sufficient confusion between these two to create a very considerable amount of doubt amongst our people.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce wants development both in agriculture and industry.  You must have money and you must have credit to develop these. You must have the raw materials to develop them and you must have lower taxation.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, on the other hand, wants high taxation.  He wants to cut down our exports.  He wants to scrounge every possible halfpenny he can, just as he is scrounging on the fees he is charging the Dublin Corporation for the loan.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce also expressed how important it is in our economy that our building industry should be maintained.  On the other hand, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, so far as he agrees with the Minister for Finance's policy, are cutting the ground from under the building industry.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach approaches this matter with an introductory statement which has nothing to do with the case. He gave us an address which was something like a leading article in the <i>Irish Press</i> as to what the Opposition Party said on the last Budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been talking about taxation and about the conditions created by that taxation, about <Col N="522" /> the unemployment created by that taxation, about the wiping out of any prospect of there being developed in this country the kind of progress which the Minister for Industry and Commerce says is absolutely necessary if we are to get out of our present difficulties. Does the Taoiseach deny that unemployment?  Does he deny the falling off in employment and therefore the falling off of production which is so substantial and so great?  Does he deny the falling off, for which I quoted figures, over the whole range of industrial work, from the drink group to the vehicle group, the distributive trade group and the professions?  Does he still claim that the unemployment which has come about is due to stockpiling?</P>

Does he accept the latest report of O.E.E.C. that in relation to our trade we have comparatively the greatest backing of external assets that any country has or wants? I want the Taoiseach to address himself to the question of what policy the Government are operating or propose to operate to relieve unemployment, to secure a return to the employment which we had a couple of years ago in our productive industries, so that there may be some chance of avoiding the dreary prophecies which the Minister for Industry and Commerce finds is necessary to make &mdash; that our last state will be worse than our first.  These are very definite questions to be answered. If the Government have a policy, will he let the people know what that policy is and give them some chance of realising that there is some kind of hope for us?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate very largely from the point of view of focussing the attention of the Government on the very serious and deteriorating situation which confronts us in respect of unemployment.  I imagine that the Government must be gravely perturbed at the manner in which our unemployment figures are rising.  They have now risen to such an extent and so rapidly as to afford no complacency whatever to the Government or anybody else concerned with promoting the material and economic welfare of this nation.</P>
      <P>What are the facts?  These ought to be stated so that we can get the picture in broad perspective.  I will take the official figures issued by the Central Statistics Office from week to week. These figures show that in January, 1951, we had 65,800 persons signing at the employment exchanges and, of that number, 23,400 were drawing unemployment insurance benefit.  Let us move on to the same day in January of the following year and we find that the all-in number of unemployed registered at the exchanges had risen from 63,000 odd to 73,000 odd and that the number drawing unemployment insurance benefit had risen from 23,000 odd to 30,000 odd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us move forward another year and we find that on the last Saturday in January, 1953, there were 87,200 people registered at the exchanges, and of these no less than 53,200 were drawing unemployment insurance benefit.  Let us get the complete picture.  The all-in number of unemployed increased from 63,000 odd in January, 1951, to 87,000 odd in January, 1953.  The number of persons receiving unemployment insurance benefit, and this is inclusive of the overall figure, jumped from 23,000 in January, 1951, to 53,000 in January, 1953, an increase of 30,000 persons in that short period of two years.  Nobody can attempt to deny the gravity of those figures.  One need only dwell upon them to see the picture of poverty and deprivation they <Col N="524" /> conjure up in the homes that are blighted by unemployment to-day.</P>
    <P>Bad as these figures are of themselves, the significance of them in some respects is even more serious because the last document issued by the Central Statistics Office shows that the figure is mounting rapidly each week.  It must be remembered, too, that these figures take no note whatever of the number of persons who are only employed partially, who are working two days, three days or four days a week under devices resorted to from time to time by managements in an effort to spread the available employment over as many as possible.</P>
    <P>Here are the official figures.  On the 17th January, 84,600 people were unemployed. One week later, on the 24th January, the number had increased to 86,600.  On the 31st January, again a week later, the number had increased to 87,200.  In each of those weeks there has been a substantial increase in the number of unemployed at a period when the figures should normally be falling.</P>
    <P>I think it is sufficient to give this over-all picture to the Taoiseach.  I hope he will do some of the things he promised to do in other years.  Government denials to the contrary notwithstanding, I am frankly convinced that this miserable and depressing picture has been produced following the adoption by the Government, consciously or unconsciously, of the policy recommended to it and to the nation by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>I know the Taoiseach will disavow any intention of following the dictates of those who control the Central Bank. I have known the Tánaiste to do that here.  Yet, I have read of the Minister for Finance attending at banquets and retailing for consumption by the public the same kind of wicked philosophies as are contained in the Central Bank Report.  When I hear these disavowals by some member of the Government and the endorsement for approval by other members, I am driven to remember the biblical phrase: &ldquo;The hands are the hands of Esau but the voice is the voice of Jacob&rdquo;.  The voice is the voice of the Jacobs who occupy the Central Bank in Foster Place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> If I can congratulate the Taoiseach on anything I think I can congratulate him on following faithfully the advice that has been tendered to him by the Central Bank.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will once again disavow any intention of accepting that advice but we can see from an examination of the Central Bank's recommendations and a reconciliation of those recommendations with Government policy that the Taoiseach and the directors of the Central Bank have now reached the point where they can lovingly embrace each other in their search for a solution of the nation's difficulties.  If we have any doubt as to whether there is any difference between the Government's policy in respect of those matters dealt with in the Central Bank Report and the policy of the Central Bank itself, let us take a few quotations from the Central Bank's Report and see how faithful, indeed almost dog-like in its fidelity, has the Government been in following the Central Bank's recommendation.</P>

The present Minister for Finance evidently thought the document worthy of some mental digestion and I took the trouble to read it.  Now I want to show the Taoiseach how his policy resembles that of the Central Bank. Paragraph 17 states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The public works programme differs from some other element of State expenditure being largely discretionary, thereby affording special opportunity for the exercise of a policy of contraction or expansion as economic circumstances may require.  It is commonly accepted as an expedient for coping with problems of depression, especially unemployment.  In view of the unusually favourable state of employment for a considerable time past there is less need at present for the artificial stimuli provided by such a programme, especially as prevailing high costs cause it to encroach rapidly on resources which may be badly needed at a later time when conditions afford more justification for this expedient.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The quotation from the Central Bank Report continues as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is important to notice that in present circumstances it is necessary to restrict not merely investments which give no tangible yield of the character needed by the State of the balance of payments but also investments which, while they might give useful long-term economic results, entail a disproportionate immediate pressure on the balance of payments without promise of early offset.  In this respect there is obvious danger in an attempt to achieve too much in too short a time and relief should be found by a suitable moderation in the pace of investment which can bring only long-term benefit.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The report goes on further to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From the monetary standpoint, economy in expenditure is the best way to a balanced Budget.  It is capable of producing quick results and it should react especially on the purchasing power that makes a high demand on consumer goods.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The report then goes on to subsidies:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Subsidies are not only a heavy burden on the Budget but also constitute a disguised addition to purchasing power as the money saved through getting the subsidised article at a reduced price is set free for other expenditure.  They can have a twofold adverse effect on the balance of payments by promoting excessive demand for the subsidised articles whether imported or domestic but <Col N="528" /> exportable and by facilitating additional demand for unsubsidised articles.  The effect of a subsidy may, of course, be modified to some extent by an associated system of rationing and some of the disadvantages of a subsidy may be obviated by a more severe ration scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Get back to two ounces of butter, for instance.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Reduction or removal of subsidies would, however, bring several advantages in relieving the Budget and allaying inflation and remedying a distorting influence in the price structure.  It is true that removal of subsidy might tend somewhat to increase the cost of living but some inconvenience in this respect must be weighed against the compensating gains including especially the reduction of consumption.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then on wages the Central Bank says this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In view of the situation described in paragraph 13 (above) the present levels of income and consumption are excessive in relation to other facts of the economy and therefore requires adjustment if progressive deterioration of the value of money is to be avoided.  <i>A fortiori,</i> the stage has been passed where further wage increases to any general extent can be justified pending marked actual improvement of production of the requisite type.  Some of the required adjustment should be obtainable from increased voluntary saving but, in the absence of any assurance of sufficiently large and early results from this expedient, recourse to the budgetary and fiscal remedies already indicated is called for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then it makes reference to bank credit:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rigorous restriction of bank credit for non-essential and less urgent purposes is now imperative if the banks are to be in a position to afford reasonable accommodation in those directions which are most in accord with the public interest. Resort to bank accommodation in cases where a public issue is feasible is plainly undesirable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> That has been the attitude of the Central Bank.  At the time that report was discussed in this House we said that in a nutshell the remedy of the Central Bank for our economic ills was a policy of deflation, but we pointed out at that time that the adoption of that policy would mean more unemployment. Were we wrong?  From the figures which I quoted it will be seen that the numbers of our unemployed have jumped from 22,000 since the Central Bank wrote that report.  We said, too, that the adoption of the Central Bank policy would inevitably mean the slashing of the food subsidies. The Central Bank first recommends slashing of the food subsidies and the next thing happens is that subsidies are slashed by the Government.  Of course, that was purely coincidental. The Government was not following the policy of the Central Bank.</P>

The Central Bank recommended the policy of slashing subsidies which they said was a hidden subsidy to wages.  The Government subsequently abolished the subsidies.</P>

      <P>We said at the time that the adoption of the Central Bank policy of deflation would lead to a reduction in the consumption of goods. Does anybody doubt that that has taken place?  One has only to go into the shops in this or any other city or town in the country to realise they are passing through the grimmest period they have passed through for a long time.  Drapers who used to have an annual sale are having monthly sales if they are not having them all the time.  Go into any factory and ask the people how business is and they will tell you they never experienced a period worse than the present.</P>
      <P>Look at some of the foodstuffs.  Look at bread in particular.  There is more unemployment among bread industry workers to-day than at any time for the last 15 years.  When I inquired from the Bakers' Union the other day what was the cause, they said that the bread was too dear and the people are not buying as much as they used to. They have now more unemployed bakers than they had for the past 15 years and it is not due only to the mechanisation of bakery plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also said that it would lead to a reduction in capital expenditure.  That has happened and nobody can doubt it.  You can see it in housing, in land drainage, and you can see it in respect of land reclamation.  We said, too, it would cause the imposition of more taxation.  We have in the Budget and since the Budget measures which have steeply increased taxation on our people.  We said, too, it would lead to pegging of wages.  In order to confirm the accuracy of what we said, we had the Minister for Finance giving out a <Col N="531" /> wage-pegging policy last night at some banquet in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Were we wrong when we said it would lead to a reduction in real wages, that the workers would not secure compensation in full for the increased cost of living?  It is now clear that in the last 18 months the cost of living has increased by 20 per cent. but that the increases which have passed through the Labour Court or been negotiated by direct discussion with employers have not given the workers a wage increase of 20 per cent. Therefore, their real wages are less to-day than they were two years ago.</P>
    <P>We also said that this policy of deflation would lead to more emigration. If anybody wants to test this out all they have to do is to go to the ports of this country and they will see &mdash; at the North Wall, Dún Laoghaire, Rosslare and Belfast &mdash; large numbers of Irish workers who are leaving.  You cannot go to any town or village and make inquiries about emigration without being told that substantial numbers have left for employment in Great Britain.  We said all this would inevitably follow the adoption of the policy recommended by the Central Bank. The Government has swallowed, hook, line and sinker, the advice tendered by the Central Bank, with the result that we have now reached the stage which the Labour Party prophesied from these benches when the Central Bank's Report was under discussion.</P>
    <P>Bear this in mind &mdash; when the Central Bank made its report we had 48,500 unemployed registered; we now have over 87,000, the clear consequence of following the policy recommended by the Central Bank.  Let this be a sobering thought, that our unemployment position to-day is such that the number of unemployed is ten times the British rate&mdash;not ten times more than Britain but ten times the British ratio. That is the situation we have reached as a consequence of the present Government following the Central Bank Report, or setting out on its own pioneering trail and arriving at the same conclusions as those in the report.</P>
    <P>There are clear causes for a situation of this kind.  I put the main cause <Col N="532" /> down as the policy of austerity and the policy of the recluse recommended to us by the Central Bank.  The increased prices of foodstuffs consequent on the increased cost of living and the slashing of portion of the food subsidies have created a situation in which people can now barely buy, if they can buy, the barest necessaries of life.  They have no money now for other kinds of consumer goods and these have to be sacrificed, if it is a choice between bread, butter, tea and sugar and the luxuries of decent clothing and furniture and the other attributes of civilised living.  The increase in food prices has crippled the people and has seriously contracted their purchasing power.</P>
    <P>As if that was not enough, we have had with disconcerting monotony one Minister after another making speeches here and to the country telling us that this nation was heading for full-blooded recession, if I may use that paradoxical expression.  We have been told that the people are living far above their means, that these people, the ordinary working-class people, are eating too much and wearing clothes of too high a quality.  We have been told that they are living a standard of life which it was not the privilege of the Irish people to live in present circumstances.  We have been told that the policy was to consume less, to use less, as if a policy of consuming less and using less might be a remedy for the economic difficulties of a relatively undeveloped nation such as we are.</P>
    <P>We have had the Minister for Finance &mdash; the man who ought to be trying to steady the financial ship if the ship were in danger &mdash; going off to the Gresham Hotel and there, at a well furnished table, telling the nation through the newspapers that we had reached the stage in our financial affairs in which the position was serious to the point of desperation. One could understand some of these statements if made in some coconut or banana republic in the South Pacific, but to have statements of that kind made by the Minister for Finance in a country which 12 months before that was in a flourishing condition, is <Col N="533" /> something that entitles us to ask if that was the effect the Minister for Finance was then striving to achieve.</P>
    <P>Clamped on to those difficulties &mdash; high prices, contraction of purchasing power, studied and gloomy speeches by various Ministers &mdash; we have had a governmental policy, if it could be so described, which was discernible by no clear features whatever, a policy of timidity, a vacillating policy in which one could discern no clear line of approach to any particular problem. These are the Government's three chief achievements in the last 18 months&mdash;a substantial increase in the cost of living, and they may take what credit they like for that; a substantial increase in unemployment, up by 22,000 under their administration whereas under ours it was falling; and they have sent more people than ever to the emigrant ship and more people than ever are leaving the country. These are the Government's three achievements on the home front &mdash; increased unemployment, increased emigration and a very substantial increase in the cost of living, measured by an increase of 20 per cent.  That is the achievement on the home front.</P>
    <P>The achievement on the external front has been nearly as miserable.  The only thing they have done there was that courageous decision recently to invest £500,000 of the nation's money in the hireage of out of date American planes for the privilege of painting shamrocks on them and transporting to America, not the 87,000 unemployed people, I hope, but those who could afford to pay the luxury rates which are being charged for transit across the Atlantic.  There is the home policy &mdash; more unemployed, higher prices, more emigration &mdash; and then a dive into phantasy by investing £500,000 of the nation's money in the privilege of painting green shamrocks on aeroplanes.</P>

      <P>We will see how far the Deputy is a prophet.  The Taoiseach made a lengthy speech this evening but there was no indication in it of Government policy, except airy-fairy generalities, expecting something to happen some day which would enable us to live happily forever in this motherland of ours.  No remedies were proposed and no proposals made to the House.  Although the Taoiseach spoke as head of the Government, we still do not know where we are on the Government's policy regarding unemployment. The Government has no policy and no remedies but the remedy which Wilkins Micawber found so convenient from time to time &mdash; waiting for something to turn up.</P>
      <P>The Government promised to solve unemployment.  The Taoiseach will not deny that, nor the Minister for Lands. To-day, looking back at what they promised to do in other days, I do not think we can be accused of impetuosity in asking the Government when they are going to do the things which in other days they promised they would do.  A few quotations might be helpful in reminding the Taoiseach and the Government generally of what they promised to do and, therefore, contrasting the promises on the one hand with the performances on the other hand.</P>
      <P>Because he is Minister for Industry and Commerce and only on that account, I give first place in the quotations to Deputy Lemass, the present Minister for Industry and Commerce. Speaking at a meeting of the Dublin South City branch of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Red Bank Restaurant on 23rd January, 1940, the Minister used the following profound words:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I take it that this still represents the policy of the Fianna Fáil Government and that it is as fresh in their minds to-day as it was then. Surely there has not been an abandonment of it?  The Taoiseach will like to hear it because it does one good at these times to try to draw inspiration from the greenness of the past.  The view of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It was necessary to stress the urgency of the problems arising out of unemployment.  If it persisted, their economic system could not survive. If unemployment persisted it did not deserve to survive.  There were obviously major defects in their methods of commercial organisation or in their financial system, if they were unable to provide an adequate livelihood for every man willing to <Col N="536" /> work.  If, within the limits of the present system, they could not cope with unemployment, then the system must be changed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it apposite to ask, in 1953, 13 weary years after that statement was made, what are the Government's proposals for changing the system as envisaged by the Minister when he then spoke?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was also good on this matter.  I used to like the refreshing views the Taoiseach expressed on this whole question of unemployment and I am going to make an effort to get him to come back to where he stood with regard to it.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have time and time again said that, in my belief, the solution of unemployment is easier to find in this country at this moment than in any country facing that problem, if we make up our minds to apply the remedy.  We have the remedy.  It is a question of organisation and of a proper lead from the Government.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will present these to the Taoiseach afterwards.  I think he will find them interesting when he browses over them.  He went on: &ldquo;He wanted to say definitely that the problem of unemployment was the biggest they had to face, and of all their problems he was less satisfied with the progress made towards its solution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will also remember the promises he made to the nation when taking up office in 1932 and again, I suppose, we should be insulated against any charge of being peevish, if we ask the Taoiseach what he proposes to do this year to implement, 21 years afterwards, what he then promised.  His promises have now come of age and the Taoiseach might like to have a look at the man whom he first fondled as a baby 21 years ago. Here is what he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am quite willing to admit that one of the principal things we were selected to do was to try to deal with the unemployment problem.  We are quite willing to do it and we stand <Col N="537" /> or fall by our ability to do that work or not to do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will recognise, looking at the unemployment figures, up by 22,000 in the past two years, that he must have fallen many a time in his efforts to reach that goal.  The Taoisearch went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to repeat what I said outside. I said that, looking around the world and trying to understand what were the causes of unemployment in different countries, I came to the conclusion that there was less reason for unemployment in this country than in any other country I know of.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach used these words in 1932 on the occasion of his election as Taoiseach when he was giving his views on the nation's economic difficulties. Later in the same speech, Volume 41, column 918, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be that under the present system we cannot do the full work we would like to do but we are going to try.  I am going to say this, that if I try within the system as it stands and fail, then I will try to go outside the system and will go to the country and ask them to support me to go outside the system.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach went to the country to-day, 21 years after he made that statement, the people at least could not say that he took them unawares. Here, however, is one ambition which the Taoiseach has now nearly achieved. He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Members on the opposite benches said that I went in for a hair-shirt policy.  My answer was that theirs was the silk shirt policy for some and a hair-shirt policy for others.  If there are to be hair shirts at all it will be hair shirts all round.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He has been most faithful to that promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks now as if that desirable objective is close to achievement, because there are certainly less silk shirts and less ordinary shirts than there ever were and many people are stretching out their arms to put on the hair shirt of austerity and Budget <Col N="538" /> prices which they have got from this Government for the past 18 months.</P>
      <P>I have a number of other quotations here, but they are almost too sacrosanct to be quoted, and I will pass over them.  I have given the House the Taoiseach's promises.  I do not quote even the famous Fianna Fáil advertisement setting out simply: Fianna Fáil will abolish unemployment.  I have given the Taoiseach evidence of his promise to solve unemployment and have told him that there are 22,000 more people unemployed than there were two years ago, and that the figure is mounting.  During the past 21 years, statistics will show that nearly 500,000 people left the country as emigrants, so that in face of losing 500,000 of our population, a hæmorrhage of our nation's life-blood, we still have the Taoiseach's promise to solve unemployment, notwithstanding that more than 87,000 people are unemployed to-day and are facing a bleaker outlook in that respect than they ever faced before.</P>
      <P>This problem is one for the Government to solve.  Nobody else can do it; nobody else has the resources to apply to the solution of the problem.  It is the Government's duty to unfold its plans and to indicate what its remedies are, so that the nation will have an opportunity of seeing the direction in which they are being asked to travel, of knowing what proposals the Government has in mind and of judging the merits of these proposals and appraising whatever relief they are likely to give.  But the Government have no plans.  The House has had no proposals from the Government and there is no indication whatever, beyond an acknowledgment of the fact that we have a serious unemployment situation, that the Government has any serious intention of dealing with this very grave problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest the lines on which the Labour Party think a solution of the problem should be reached.  We believe that this country has immense industrial and agricultural resources, that it is a relatively undeveloped country, with foreign investment greater per head of our people than <Col N="539" /> any other nation outside the United States.  We have idle men and women to do the work.  The work remains to be done and the nation's character and the stability of our people, together with their own accumulated assets, can all be welded into a national scheme to develop, with goodwill on all sides, our industries and our agriculture, and the whole economy must be buttressed until these reach their full optimum output by a policy of large-scale schemes of public works in order to fill here and there throughout the economic structure pockets of unemployment, and in any case to increase and enrich the national estate.</P>
    <P>We take our stand on this principle that we ought to produce everything here that it is reasonable we should produce.  Nobody wants to grow tea here and nobody wants to grow bananas or coconuts here.  There is a vast amount of manufactured goods coming into this country to-day which should be manufactured here so as to give our people employment, to provide new sources of wealth, and generally to extend the size of the national cake, making it possible for all our people to participate in the cumulative benefits arising from the application of Irish energy and Irish enterprise to the needs of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Taking our stand on that basis, therefore, the Labour Party would use tariffs, quotas and exclusions of any other kind for the purpose of encouraging the establishment of new industries, subject to conditions to which I shall refer in a few moments. Nor do I think that the establishment of these industries should be left entirely to speculative private enterprise which in many cases, while it has done valuable work in certain fields, will not enter highly speculative fields unless it is assured of a good return. In cases such as these, the State must step in and assist.  It can do that by operating some of these industries as public utility undertakings.  It can do that by erecting factories and by leasing or selling these factories on the instalment plan to those who will operate them under private enterprise. <Col N="540" /> It should endeavour, however, to place these factories in areas which might be called &ldquo;black areas&rdquo; from the point of view of unemployment, because it is not easy, as the Government will learn from experience when they try to develop industries along the western seaboard, to induce private enterprise to go into backward areas when there is a free choice to go into the more urbanised centres with greater attractions for industrialists.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient, however, to impose tariffs, quotas, or other restrictions. That should be done for one purpose and one purpose only; it should be done in the national interest and not in the interests of an individual owner or an individual industrialist.  When that method of assisting in the development of our own industries is resorted to, it should be adopted concurrently with the imposition of rigid supervisory functions in respect to an industry which is being helped by the whole nation, inasmuch as the nation subjects itself to the highest prices for imported commodities in order to assist that new and, perhaps, struggling industry.  The trouble with our tariff policy in the past is that we attached far too much importance to the high tariffs themselves and just sat down and waited to see what happened on the part of the person who established the industry.  Many of these people, having established an industry, are content notwithstanding substantial sacrifices made by the nation to assist them, to produce only 20, 30, 40 or, perhaps, 50 per cent. of the requirements of the home market.  They are quite satisfied with a limited output of that kind.  Clearly, if we are to develop a healthy economy, to produce goods at competitive prices and under decent conditions, we must not tolerate the laziness, the inertia, the feeling of self-satisfaction and smugness that will permit the development of inefficient methods and the introduction of inefficient practices in protected industries. We have too much of the mentality: &ldquo;I am doing all right, do not expect that I shall expand my business to assist a healthy economic development.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> If we are ever to get to the level of a healthy and efficient plane of development for our secondary industries, we can only do so by recognising firstly that if we do assist in the establishment of a native industry by tariffs, quotas or exclusions of one kind or another, within that tariff wall, the manufacturer must be required to produce as efficiently as possible.  He has got to produce the best possible article, with the best possible machinery in the quickest possible space of time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan has stated that he could not get an employer to fulfil these conditions and be an efficient employer.  I think he would.  There are a number of industries in this country run by private enterprise where the employer, being a good progressive employer, finds that it is to his own interest and at the same time to the national good, so to organise his industry as to provide for the maximum output.  The wages and conditions of employment in these industries are usually better than in industries where the employer is satisfied <Col N="543" /> to produce with the aid of a high tariff only a limited amount of goods which he is sure will be absorbed by the home market.  I think it should not be difficult to inculcate amongst our manufacturers a recognition of the fact that they must produce as efficiently as possible the maximum quantity of goods.  You usually find that the conditions of employment are good in any industry where that policy is pursued.  In any case, if we are going to be satisfied with this kind of half-hearted economic development under which, even with the assistance of highly protective tariffs, our employers are content with the production of a limited quantity of goods, we shall continue to fill the emigrant ships, to swell the queues at the unemployment exchanges and generally to fill the rôle of a decadent nation.</P>
      <P>Agriculture is another field in which our sources of wealth are by no means exhaustively tapped.  This country is not an American dust bowl or is not a desert island.  This country has land which is the envy of many other countries in Europe, land which, if properly utilised, could give to our people a high level of agricultural production. If we are to attain that production we have got to expand agriculture in every possible branch and by every possible assistance that it is within the resources of the State to provide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been in other days in the House a kind of feeling that tillage was the enemy of live stock and that live stock was the enemy of tillage, but I think that discussions on the question of our agricultural policy here and a wider discourse on the subject in our public Press have now produced a better balance amongst all our people or at all events amongst the greater portion of our people.  The production of live stock and the resort to tillage are two complementary agricultural transactions. You cannot have live stock unless you have tillage and you cannot have tillage unless you have live stock. What we have to try to do is to get a reasonable balance between these two complementary forms of agricultural <Col N="544" /> production, the overall aim being to produce a greater volume of wealth from the land in whatever form we would best get it from the land and provide greater wealth for the nation by providing more employment in agriculture. But, better still, because this is the bane of agricultural employment we should try to provide regular employment in agriculture for many agricultural workers who at present are compelled to accept employment for a period of six to nine months and try and live for 12 months of the year on an income got for a period of six months.  I do not believe that anybody who has spent an hour in an examination of our agricultural position will attempt to deny that our agricultural land is more under-capitalised than any other country in Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our land is not merely starved for fertilisers but for money as well, and our land is the least capitalised of any other agricultural country in Europe.  Unfortunately, many of our farmers still believe that the best place for their money is the bank.  What we have got to do either with this or the next generation is to try and convince them that the best bank the farmers have is their own land.  We have got to induce them to put money into their own land and that it will yield good dividends to them and will not be utilised to finance those people who, in some respects, actually exploit the helpless condition of the agricultural community itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order better to achieve that object the State must help to improve the land in every way.  I must say quite frankly that Deputy Dillon during his period as Minister for Agriculture did much to tackle that problem not on the perimeter but at the very core.  It must be tackled at the very core if we are ever going to make in the compass of human life any tangible progress towards the attainment of what we have in mind.  We must first improve the land in every possible way. We sought to do that by having a vast scheme of land reclamation which promised to bring back some millions of acres of land into cultivation and <Col N="545" /> gear up the whole fertility of the land. Such a scheme would, in the course of the next five or ten years, so transform the potential wealth of the land as to put us without delay on the high road to prosperity.</P>
    <P>The milk situation that now exists provides a timely reminder of the necessity of applying our talents and resources to improve our agricultural position.  The biggest blister on the nation's back to-day is the spectacle of the farmer with a 100-gallon cow trying to get the same standard of living as if he had a 1,000-gallon cow.  Perhaps, the farmer is not able to buy live stock of a quality that will give him a greater yield but the real difficulty is much deeper than that.  In our agricultural policy we have pursued a policy of getting what is generally understood to be the dual purpose animal and from the point of view of milk production we have reached a situation in which our milk is costing our people more than they can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>Our butter production is now not sufficient to enable us to export any at all.  We have now reached the stage at which we have to import thousands of cwts. of butter from the very ends of the earth in an agricultural country like this and all because of our pathetic reliance on the low yielding cows.  Our butter is now being priced out of every foreign market.  No matter what way we look at it politically, economically or agriculturally, this has a serious repercussion in connection with agriculture.</P>
    <P>This country is well blessed in connection with its agricultural potentialities. We have a fertile land and our climate is better than most other climate in Europe.  In the present and foreseeable future world conditions are likely to hold out bright prospects for our agriculturists and for our placing in world markets agricultural produce which we can produce at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>We ought as a nation, Government, Parliament and agricultural community embrace any and every policy calculated to improve the yield, the fertility and the drainage of our land.  Above all, the State has got to help with the farmer himself so to capitalise our land <Col N="546" /> that the farmer will be able to utilise the land by tilling it to the best of his ability and to the uttermost limits of the land itself at the same time stocking it with cattle of a high yielding content.  Agriculture and industry&mdash; probably agriculture to a greater extent&mdash;are the two main sources of employment for our people if we want to keep them at home.</P>
    <P>There is another field, however, in which it is possible for the nation so to organise its resources as to provide large-scale employment on large-scale schemes of public works which would not only improve the amenity of life here but would, in addition, provide substantial employment to meet demands for more industrial and agricultural goods.</P>
    <P>Every time anybody suggests in this country the utilisation of the State's resources and the people's credit to finance large-scale schemes of public works all the old ladies of both sexes immediately gang up to tell you how naughty you are to suggest any such an approach to the problem.  There is another section which has got what I might call the liquidity mania&mdash; people who imagine that it is the function of the Irish banks to take the money of the Irish people and hold it in case the Irish people storm the doors of the bank.  The only safe thing for the banks to do with the people's money is to roll it up, send it to Britain and keep it there.  Only the British can be relied on properly to husband the resources of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach well knows, if he talks to some of his advisers on this matter, that there is such a mania about liquidity, the view being that you must have the bulk of the deposits available in case the lender decides the following day to storm the bank and demand his money back.  It is not sufficient to say to these liquidity maniacs that this has not happened in the last 100 years and that it is not going to happen in the next 12 months to calm their fears.  They give a spooky kind of picture of the dire happenings to come if you resort to a greater degree of liquidity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="547" /> Look at the situation that is reached, as a result.  Look at the situation to-day in which the Dublin Corporation is seeking to borrow £5,000,000 under par at £98&mdash;and paying commission to the Minister and to the banks as well.  On a £5,000,000 guaranteed issue, and with all its assets in this city and its special position as a revenue-raising authority, the Corporation has to pay more than 5 per cent. for that money.  On the other hand, the Central Bank has lent £18,000,000 to Britain at ½ per cent.  The Dublin Corporation has to pay more than 5 per cent. in order to get £5,000,000 while the Central Bank lends £18,000,000 to Britain at ½ per cent.  The security for that money which the Central Bank lends to Britain is not Britain's gold reserves; it is not even her silver reserves.  She now has no gold or even silver backing for her note issue.  The Central Bank probably got British Government securities in return. Securities for what?  Securities for what Britain owes to somebody else or promises to the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>A sum of £18,000,000, that could be utilised for valuable national works at home, is lent to the British bank and, in return, we get an I.O.U.  We need not tolerate a situation like that.  If an honest man in this city wants to erect a factory for the manufacture of cheap boots for the bare-footed young children in this country and goes to a bank and says: &ldquo;This is a social objective.  I have £10,000 towards it. The factory will cost £20,000,&rdquo; he will have to pay 6 per cent. on the £10,000 which he borrows.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The bank will ask him what dividend he proposes to pay and, if it is not high, the well-intentioned would-be manufacturer of children's cheap boots will not get the loan of £10,000 for such a socially desirable objective.  Yet, that very same bank shovels its own money to Britain and lends it at probably 1 per cent. or 1½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an Irish manufacturer or builder goes into an Irish bank to borrow money to extend his industry or to put <Col N="548" /> up houses he must pay 6 per cent. on the money which is lent to him.  Nevertheless, the bank's money is lent to the British Government at these paltry rates of interest.  Our money is lent to a country which is, itself, hopelessly insolvent and just riding out of the storm on the character and industry of her people.  What is the effect of that on our housing economy?  It is reckoned that by the time a person who buys a house to-day at £1,000 completes the payments he will have paid £1,750 or perhaps even £2,000 for the house. That is the situation in this country to-day, because we finance house-building at these high rates of interest. Take, for example, a house costing £1,000 to build.  If the expenses of the people who provide the land, the carpenter, the plasterer, the painter, the slater, the labourer, the cost of all the materials for the house and the builder's profits amount, in all, to £1,000 then the position is that the fellow who lent the money gets £750 in respect of the house.  That situation is clearly brought about by this crazy policy of lending our money to a foreign Government at paltry rates of interest, while our own people are trying to pay high interest charges for their house-building activities.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who enthusiastically supported the policy of a capital Budget and I have no regrets for so doing.  I think it was a wise policy&mdash; carefully planned and wisely implemented. In my view, that policy, given a reasonable chance, could have wrought an immense change in the whole economic set-up in this country. It permitted us to develop in regions where it would be impossible to develop otherwise.  We were able to provide much more employment than was possible under former methods of budgetary provision for such employment schemes.  We were able to find large sums of money for large-scale schemes of development and we provided for it in this simple way.  We raised the money which was available for the purpose of financing large-scale schemes of development.  We provided for the repayment of the principal and interest over a period of 25 years.  At the end of 25 years the original sum <Col N="549" /> of money was amortised by the provisions which we made for interest and sinking fund rates.  We were able to do that on a sound basis so long as we made the provision for the interest charges and sinking fund.  Nobody who examined our methods of financing the capital Budget was ever able to say that there was anything wrong in the methods of financing it.  They satisfied the most orthodox financiers and economists.  It was left to the political economists&mdash;thrown up as the result of an election&mdash;to find fault with the scheme, because it was not of their own creation.  Changes were made in that scheme merely for the sake of change.  Is there anything wrong with the concept of a family budget?  A person wishes to obtain a capital article for the household and decides to buy it on the instalment plan.  You cannot buy your bread, butter, tea, sugar and rations on an instalment plan: these are current expenditure. If you are going to keep solvent you ought to pay for these things as you go.  If, however, you decide to buy, say, a piano, you need not pay for it out of a week's wages or a month's salary.  You can pay for it over a period of years.  You can say: &ldquo;That piano will last ten years.  If I want to buy it I will buy it and pay for it over two years, five years or ten years.&rdquo;  All the time, you will be creating an asset in the piano by reason of the methods adopted to finance the purchase.  It was on that simple basis that we proceeded to deal with the raising of money for large-scale schemes of capital development.</P>
    <P>I know of no way in which the resources of an undeveloped country such as this country can ever be fully exploited except by using the credit resources of our people and the credit-creating capacity of the State.  We are a generation behind in development as compared with other countries. We have to make up that leeway speedily unless we are permanently to lag behind the other firstclass nations of the world.  Other nations can borrow money for the purchase of guns, planes, battleships and so forth.  They can maintain gigantic armies and navies.  They can do all that in respect of temporary assets in <Col N="550" /> the form of perishable commodities such as planes, guns and battleships. If they can do that, surely there is no reason why we should not raise money for the purpose of electrical development, turf development, land reclamation, drainage, the provision of houses, schools, hospitals, afforestation and various other works of a capital nature&mdash;these permanent and enduring capital assets being there all the time.  These enduring assets are a guarantee for the repayment of the moneys which were advanced and they are much more enduring than guns, planes, battleships and so forth.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong, therefore, with utilising the savings of our people, the accumulated assets which we have, for the credit-creating capacity of the nation to finance large-scale schemes of public development.  I believe that if we want to end unemployment, to develop our industries, to expand our agriculture, to provide houses, schools and hospitals, to drain the land, to afforest the country, and to develop our turf and other resources, we can only do it on the basis of utilising every financial asset that we have, plus the character and credit-worthiness of our people to carry out schemes of that kind.  It is an illusion, in my view, to imagine that it can be done otherwise.</P>
    <P>Our attitude as a political party is that we would support any policy, which stands the test of reason and prudence, calculated to develop our industrial and agricultural resources and to give our people a decent standard of living in their own land; but we would not sit here meekly and tolerate reactionary policies as exemplified by the indifference and drift which are giving us the serious economic situation which we have to-day, a situation revealed in rising prices, rising emigration and rising unemployment.</P>
    <P>I finish with this quotation.  A man of very high standing in this nation, no matter what his political opinions may be, once uttered these words:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the duty and the interest of the community so to organise itself that every man and woman who is able and willing to work can get work to do, and that, at least until our <Col N="551" /> population is far and above its present number, no one shall be compelled to emigrate for want of employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The man who made that statement re-echoes my sympathy and approach to this problem, and that man is the present Taoiseach.  I conclude by asking him now, what is he, on behalf of the Government, going to do to indicate that people will be provided with employment and will not be forced to emigrate for want of it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think, in spite of the barrage from the Leader of the Labour Party and others who may speak on this Estimate to endeavour to persuade their followers that the Government is responsible for increased unemployment, increased emigration, an increase in the cost of living and so on, they are likely to succeed.</P>
      <P>If we are getting any value for the large sums we are spending on education, or from the discussions that go on in the public Press and elsewhere, as well as constant debates on economic questions&mdash; if all these have any result, our people must surely have realised long ago that the platitudes which Deputy Norton is in the habit of uttering in this House are very far from being either, on the one hand, a fair examation or a fair diagnosis of the position, or, on the other, that they offer a solution, through a realistic and careful examination, of the problems to which he has referred.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, in his capacity as Minister for Social Welfare in the last Government, is more familiar with, and knows probably a great deal more about the effect of the interpretation that can be placed upon the figures on the live register, than I do.  In the weekly return for the 10th January&mdash; this was issued on the 16th January from the Central Statistics Office&mdash; there is this footnote which states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Certain amendments of the Unemployment Assistance Acts, provided for in the Social Welfare Act, 1952, become operative as from 5th <Col N="552" /> January, 1953.  The effects of these changes account in large measure for the increase in the number of unemployment insurance claims current and the decrease in the number of unemployment assistance applications current between the current and previous weeks.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that, between the end of December and the end of January, there could not have been such a large increase attributable solely to an increase in unemployment.  I want to suggest to the House some of the other factors which have gone into the increased figure for the live register during the month of January, and particularly after the 5th January.  If we take the figures from January, 1951, to January, 1952, there is an increase of 22,000, and against that there is a reduction of 9,400 over the same period in the figures for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton was here while all stages of the Social Welfare Act were going through the House.  He is fully aware, therefore, that the insurability limit was increased from £500 to £600.  He knows that farm labourers were made eligible for unemployment insurance for the first time, making it incumbent on us to provide for the large number which must necessarily come in under that category.  Furthermore, persons over 65 in insurable employment are now allowed to draw unemployment insurance indefinitely without requalification.  That means a further number.  I am not in a position to state what it is, but, at any rate, under these three different headings, there cannot be the slightest doubt that persons have gone on to the live register, certainly in one at least of these three classes in large numbers, persons who, I would say, had not hitherto been on it.  If they do not account completely they account, in a considerable degree, for the swing over from unemployment assistance to unemployment insurance.</P>
    <P>The number of insured persons in employment has increased in recent years, and the numbers normally drawing insurance benefit have similarly increased.  The numbers on the <Col N="553" /> live register in recent months must have been affected also by the raising of the means limit for unemployment assistance as well as the raising of the rates for unemployment assistance.  I cannot give a definite figure, but from inquiries which have been made it would appear that it is possible that in the late autumn, 2,000 or so in the number of unemployment assistance applicants might be accounted for in that way.</P>
    <P>We know also that it is at this time of the year you get the peak figure for the live register.  Whether you take whole register, or that portion of it dealing with unemployment in the cities and towns, I understood Deputy Norton to say that at this time of the year there is an improvement.  I do not think that there is any improvement or that there has been in recent years.  At any rate, the figures are there for last year.  The figures continue to mount during the whole of January and it is only in March, when the Employment Period Order is brought into operation, that there is a reduction which then becomes very substantial and the decline continues right during the summer and up to the winter period.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that at this time of the year, due to slackness in agriculture and for other reasons, there are, not only farm labourers, but small farmers and their sons on the register. I remember Deputy Norton when he was Tánaiste dealing with this matter in the House and referring to the fact that in the West of Ireland a very large proportion of those on the unemployment assistance portion of the register were people who might be described as land owners.  We know that that has been the position.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the unemployment situation in the background of the general situation in the world outside. To hear Deputy Norton speak one would imagine that we could isolate ourselves from outside influences in the world, that we could maintain what I will call, for want of a better name, a &ldquo;closed economy&rdquo; here and that we would be able to carry on irrespective of what was going on in the world outside.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> We know that there was an artificial boom from the autumn of 1950 to the early summer of 1951.  We know that there was panic buying and that the purchases that were made during that artificial boom period were sustained by United States and sterling credits and realisation of sterling assets.  When we had in 1951 a deficit on our trade of £62,000,000, it may interest the House to know that that deficit was higher than that of Italy or the Netherlands in the same year.</P>
    <P>Comparisons were frequently instituted in this House between what was being done in Ireland and what was being done in some other country and we were told what we were not able to do here in the matter of social services.  We can reasonably claim that in the matter of social services we have done as well as or better than any other country in our circumstances. What we have to look to now is whether we will be in a position to maintain those services.  The Government believes that, generally speaking, we cannot provide any more and it is obvious that if we are to improve either the standard of living or the standard of the public services there is only one way in which it can be done, that is, to increase production. No matter how often one might listen to Deputy Norton, one would listen in vain waiting for him to address his remarks to the question of increasing production.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton and his followers apparently believe that there is some magic machine, some monetary apparatus, some currency manipulation by which everybody can have a good time and nobody will have to pay in the end&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that nobody need work any harder and that the country need not give a better output or increased production in order to provide for it all.  In my opinion, we have passed the phase now of giving and the future phase is the very important one <Col N="555" />&mdash;how we will make ends meet and how we will keep our place in the world. There is no use in Deputy Norton or anyone else telling us that we are a comparatively undeveloped nation and that just by spending more money we will be better off?  Where will the money come from?  We know what the attitude of Deputy Norton and his colleagues and the rest of the Opposition was when the Budget was going through this House last year.  We have not had any constructive suggestion from them or any helping hand to co-operate with the Government in dealing with that budgetary situation or ancillary difficulties.  Not at all. There are just the same old complaints year after year.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that after the exceptional spate of buying in 1950-51 demand relaxed, prices fell and consumers held off from buying.  It was described generally in the world as a buyers' strike.  Those who had imported large stocks had to try to dispose of them with a minimum loss. That process has been continuing for the past one and a half years. Obviously, a very serious burden was placed on industry in this country as elsewhere, in dealing with the problem of disposing of those surplus stocks, in getting new orders and in getting in the fresh supplies which were becoming available at much lower prices.  Do Deputy Norton and his Party realise how businessmen have had their energies taxed to the utmost to get out of that difficulty?  Has Deputy Norton read that a single clothing combine in Great Britain had to borrow to the extent of £4,000,000 last year to try to cope with the difficulty of dealing with excess stocks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our business people were placed in exactly the same position.  There was a fall in the flow of orders to the factories, particularly in the textile and clothing industry, in the final stages of this artificial boom.  One of the results of the changed situation last year is that we have imported about £15,000,000 worth less of textiles and clothing, with the result that our industries have been able to get into production and, gradually, wholesalers <Col N="556" /> and distributors are placing orders, and employment in the industry has improved.</P>
    <P>In June, 1952, the percentage of unemployed in the textile industry was 18.4.  In December it had fallen to 4.7. In the clothing industry, the percentage of insured workers on the unemployment list was 13.3.  In December, 1952, it had fallen to 7.2.  To put it another way, the figures for unemployment in December, 1952, as compared with 1951, show an improvement in the position of the textile and clothing industry indicated by a reduction in unemployment to the extent of 3,500.  In the return circulated to-day there is an increase of over 700 attributable to unemployment at docks and harbours and in shipping.  If you have a very large reduction in imports because of the stocking-up which has taken place in recent years, you will obviously have reduced employment. In the same way as the textile factory will not have the same activity, neither will you have the same activity at the docks and harbours.  When Deputy Norton tries to suggest that the Central Bank is determining Government policy I say that that is not correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is correct, and the commercial banks with them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct and it is not true.  When we were in office in 1946, I remember Deputy Costello from that bench over there taunting the Government about some criticisms that the Central Bank had made of our policy at that stage.  Might I remind Deputy Hickey of the comments of the Commission on Banking and Currency? We did not accept the view of that commission and, as the Taoiseach said in this House last year, we do not accept the views of the Central Bank. As the Minister for Finance said, we regard them as an authority set up to do certain things.  If the House wishes, it can change the law in that regard.</P>

      <P>We have to be careful not to have the Government come in <Col N="557" /> and control the Central Bank in the determination of the policy that is statutorily lair upon them to protect the currency and the interests of the country that are bound up with it. Deputy Norton, Deputy MacBride and the rest of them conveniently forget that we are bound up with the sterling area because 90 per cent. of our trade is with that area and with Great Britain.  If they ask: &ldquo;Is there any country in the world in the same position with regard to its credit and currency as we are,&rdquo; the answer is that no other country is so bound, you may say unfortunately, you may attribute it to historical reasons, and we have seen no evidence that any Party in this House has any alternative to this English market, or the position that the vastly greater part of our dealings is with the British.  True enough, in the last year or two years there has come about the possibility of an alternative market, but for that alternative market to become so substantial that in fact it would provide a reasonable alternative to the English market may be a very long way off.  I hope it is not.</P>
      <P>The commission which sat when the Free State was established made it quite clear that the reasons that money had to be invested outside this country which the banks say they require for their purposes should be easily realisable was the lack of a money market. If Deputy Norton, Deputy MacBride, or the rest of them can show us how a market can be provided for securities which would be easily realisable, then we would be getting somewhere on the road.</P>

      <P>The point is that it is very easy to say &ldquo;change&rdquo;, but we want to know what we are going to change and to know that we will be better off if we do change.  There seems to be some objection to monetary control.  Here is a document, not from the Central Bank, but published by O.E.E.C. and supplied by experts representing seven different countries. They state in paragraph 82:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="558" />&ldquo;We think it is no accident that, in all relatively free economies, the absence of monetary control in the post-war world has tended to be accompanied by inflation and external disequilibrium, and that, where monetary policy has been used with sufficient vigour and where perverse fiscal influences have not operated against it, it has never failed to fill its purpose.  We have already examined instances of the effective neglect of monetary policy. Examples of its efficacy are no more difficult to find.  The financial stability of Belgium in the years immediately following the liberation was undoubtedly due in large measure to the measures of monetary control carried out by the Government of that time.  Further illustrations of the effectiveness of monetary policy are to be found in the history of Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark.  The regaining of control of the issue of means of payment by the federal reserve system has been one of the chief factors in bringing under control the inflation in the United States.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In paragraph 84 they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is sometimes said that the maintenance of financial stability in this sense involves danger to the fundamental <i>desideratum</i> of increased production.  We believe this view to be profoundly mistaken.  It is true that to arrest inflation or to divert resources into channels in which they may earn the wherewithal to pay for sufficient imports may involve some temporary retardation of the pace of economic advance&mdash;as when a car is diverted from running down a steep slope over a precipice.  But, if there were not such a policy, the alternative would be a much worse check to production, the check which comes from the disorder of high inflation and from the inability to procure sufficient food or raw materials from abroad.  The maintenance of progress in production depends essentially upon policies which maintain internal and external financial equilibrium.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How it can be suggested that we should continue to follow a policy <Col N="559" /> which must lower the value of the £ and the purchasing power of wages to every workingman in this country and the week's packet of his wife is beyond me.</P>

I suggest that in the immediate future that is the task which we can most profitably consider and in fact which we will be absolutely driven to consider with more care and diligence than we have done up to the present.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Liverpool: In Liverpool and the other north Merseyside towns the unemployed now have to run to get to work.  This race for work can be seen at most local employment exchanges where there are roughly 17 idle men registered for every job that can be offered.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> According to Deputy Norton, that is the paradise to which the Irish people are fleeing at the present time and we do not, of course, expect Deputy Norton to do other than suggest that the Government is driving them over to Liverpool, every man to join the other 17.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in the United States of America one can have an increase in the unemployment figures and at the same time have far more people in employment.  I do not regard, and have not for years past regarded, the live register as a fair index of the actual position; firstly, because one has a large number of rural people who are not in the same position as workers in the towns, dependent, if they can get it, on a weekly wage for their livelihood and, secondly, because in some of the continental countries, like Sweden, the register is compiled from the returns made up by the trade unions and gives a truer picture.  In our case we have, as well as the actual persons unemployed according to the trade unions, all those who are registered because they think they can fulfil the conditions for receiving the various benefits or assistance under the social welfare schemes.  Honesty demands, at any rate, that we should make that qualification in regard to these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> In the third quarter of 1952, as compared with the third quarter of 1951, industrial production was 8 per cent. less in Britain, 6 per cent. less in Belgium, 5 per cent. less in Sweden and 7 per cent. less here.  The unemployment figures in Britain increased in December, 1952, as compared with the previous December by nearly 100,000. In April, 1952, unemployment reached a peak of 468,000.  In the Six Counties 45,600 were registered as unemployed in December, 1952.  That was 5,900 more than in December, 1951, and 16,000 more than in December, 1950.</P>
    <P>There has been a recovery in the textile and clothing industry in Great Britain, as there has been here, but, nevertheless, the unemployment figures remain very high in these consumer goods industries in particular.</P>
    <P>We have seen, and I call it specifically to the attention of the Leader of the Labour Party, where the English engineering unions and the British miners' organisations started countrywide campaigns and agitations for increased wages.  Did they get what they looked for?  They did not.  Nor anything like it.  Here there have been good increases.  According to the fourth annual report of O.E.E.C., under the heading &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; in the publication, <i>Europe&mdash;The Way Ahead</i>, in which there is a survey of the economic conditions and trends prevailing in nearly all European countries, it states in paragraph 809, with regard to our conditions here:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Between March and October, average hourly earnings in industry are thought to have risen by about 10 per cent., and a rise of this magnitude may be more than sufficient when combined with the increases in the social security payments to offset the effect of the higher prices resulting from the reduction of subsidies and increases in indirect taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the end of the paragraph it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is essential that every effort should be made to prevent the disinflationary effects of the Budget being undone by wage increases which outrun any possible increase in productivity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> I stated that the unemployment position with our neighbours and even in the northern part of this country is very serious at the present time.  In Belgium, the monthly figures for wholly unemployed workers in the first nine months of 1952 averaged 174,000, as compared with an average of 150,900 in the corresponding period of 1951.  The average number of partially unemployed in the first nine months of 1952 was 71,700, as compared with 47,400 in the corresponding period of 1951.  In the Netherlands a slowing down in industrial activity has been accompanied by an increase in unemployment. During the summer of 1952, the unemployment figure was 15,000 to 20,000 above the 100,000, roughly, considered as normal by the Netherlands authorities.  In Denmark, the percentage of insured persons unemployed in October, 1952, was 9.2 as compared with 6.8 in October, 1951.</P>
    <P>May I remind the House that while undoubtedly there was an improvement here in 1950 and in 1951 the position for 1952 does not compare unfavourably with that in 1948 or 1949?  The average on the live register for the country as a whole was 61.9 thousand in 1948; it was 61,000 in 1949 and in 1952 it was 60.8 thousand.  It has dropped in the two intervening years to 53.8 thousand and 51.6 thousand respectively.  Similarly, with regard to the towns and cities, if we take these figures which, in the words of the official note appended by the Office of Central Statistics, &ldquo;are probably a truer index of the trend of unemployment as commonly understood than are the figures for the total live register which include many small landholders and their relatives,&rdquo; we find that in 1947 the numbers registered were 29.98 thousand; in 1948, 30.3 thousand; in 1949, 28.97 thousand; in 1950, 25.56 thousand; in 1951, 25.8 thousand and in 1952, 30.58 thousand which is substantially the same as the figure in 1947, 1948 and 1949.  There was an improvement.  The figures for 1950 and 1951 are 3,000 lower than this latter figure.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that we have <Col N="563" /> had improvements in the rates of benefit for unemployed workers.  At any rate we can claim that if the numbers have increased better provision is being made for them.  For example, a husband and wife with two children at the present time will receive £2 12s. 6d. per week.  If they have three children they will receive £2 16s. 6d.  With regard to unemployment assistance a husband and a wife with two children will receive 40/6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very liberal for a man and wife with two children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  After all, we are concerned more with those with families than with single people.  If the man or woman has an adult dependent, in addition to the 18/- unemployment assistance rate in the urban area, he gets 10/- for that dependent. If the State could afford to give more I am sure they would be very glad to, but, as I have said in the beginning, when you consider the vast sums that have to be paid to the persons who, for one reason or another, find themselves in the position that they have to register at the exchanges, you will see that to improve the allowances is a very serious consideration.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the average earnings of industrial workers during the past year, according to the official returns in the December <i>Trade Journal</i> (page 234), came to 126.4 points per week as compared with 119.3 in 1951, average earnings for industrial workers, taking the base figure of October, 1948, as 100.  As Deputies will see, the number of hours worked was rather less although remuneration, whether by way of weekly or hourly earnings, had increased since the preceding September (1951).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Building consists of both private and public building.  Unless Deputy Norton or somebody else can adduce more evidence than he has given in his speech, we must regard with a certain amount of doubt whether there has been any substantial reduction in advances for building purposes.  As far as the State provision is concerned, <Col N="564" /> there has been no reduction in the demands for assistance from the State, no lessening in the drawings on the Exchequer for advances to local authorities and grants to private persons and it is not expected that there will be any lessening.  As regards private houses, I should imagine the question of the price of the houses, the cost to the potential customers, in other words, the demand for houses and the increased costs of building, must have affected that situation.</P>
    <P>Although there has, apparently, been some reduction in the advances and the accommodation given to customers by the banks, we have no proof that it has militated against any industry giving employment.  It may have in individual cases.  I notice that in Great Britain the President of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and the chairman of the British textile associations went out of their way at the annual meeting of those bodies, reported, I think, yesterday, to thank the banks over there for the understanding they have shown and the way in which they have helped the textile industry to find its feet in the new situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke of a reduction in capital investment.  I asked him a question but he did not answer it. I suppose if he were elsewhere he could have continued but he could not do so here.  As the Taoiseach pointed out, if we were to carry out the programme which has been placed before us for capital expenditure during the coming year, apart altogether from the provision for what are called &ldquo;voted services&rdquo; in the annual Supply Estimates, we would have to find about £47,000,000.  The House knows that the £20,000,000 which was raised in the National Loan has already been expended.  The Dublin Corporation is now floating a loan and we are asked to believe that the terms are onerous; but if the money is not obtainable presumably housing cannot go ahead.  Can the Dublin Corporation or the Minister for Finance, representing the Government, refuse to pay what they consider necessary to raise the moneys that are essential to carry on housing work?  It is quite true in regard to housing that substantial <Col N="565" /> arrears have been made up. When we look at the statistics of the thousands of houses that have been built both in the city and country even since the war and realise that, generally speaking, they are all within a certain limited figure of £2,000 or thereabouts, you will see that a great deal has been done, and the more that is done presumably the less remains to be done.  If you reach a very high peak figure in regard to housing expenditure based on the employment of the maximum number of building operatives, you cannot maintain that indefinitely. It must come down at some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though we have not sufficient houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Until we have sufficient houses we are bound to have fluctuations. If the price of timber or the price of other materials is fluctuating or if wages are going up to such an extent that building contractors find it difficult to carry on, then, of course, that must affect the building industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton stated that wages were less than two years ago and he seemed to complain that wage increases had not been granted in compensation for the recent increases in the cost of living.  The trouble in this matter is that we have the vicious circle, the inflationary spiral.  If prices go up wages go up and then prices must go up again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if, at the end of it all, the worker, or whoever keeps house for him, would be any better off than he was at the beginning.  In all probability, the countries that were able to stand fast on the principle that increases in remuneration would only be given where increased production followed as a result, so that that increased production could pay for the increased remuneration, are in a better and sounder position&mdash;the statements of those experts of O.E.E.C. would lead one to believe that that is their view also&mdash;than those who have taken the easier line of giving into every demand and finding themselves with a fresh demand every day.  Where are they going to stop?  Having given way to class A yesterday, they must give way to class B to-morrow, and so <Col N="566" /> things go on and on.  A good many sensible people, just as good patriots and having the interest of their countries as much at heart as these classes which seem to want more and more for less and less, believe that the only way out of that situation is to say: &ldquo;Call a halt to all increases over a period until we stabilise.&rdquo;  At any rate, if the worker or the farmer or the producer generally knows that the £ he is getting is going to have next year and the year after substantially the same value as it has now, that means more to him than to pretend, by giving him increases in remuneration or prices, that he is better off&mdash;when some other interest or some other increase is going to rob him to-morrow of the benefits of his.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way in which countries like France, and to a lesser degree Great Britain, have been carrying on their affairs, and it may be a prejudiced view, but, at any rate, the view is held that they are not getting on.  At present America is the country which counts and the advice of American experts, wherever they have examined our affairs or the affairs of any European country, is that you cannot make progress unless you get increased production, and to get increased production you have to get better and more modern methods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not believe you should turn over all your investment or capital projects to the State to be run by a bureaucracy.  They believe it is better for the nation in the long run to have private investment, that the private entrepreneur, the man who has it in him to go out and make good, who has an interest in the country, who will increase employment and build up wealth, is of far more value.  We would all agree, if we were not looking at this matter from the point of view of Party politics, that that is true.  The private entrepreneur, the industrialist, the businessman who controls his own business, knows all about it&mdash;and whoever <Col N="567" /> takes the incidental risks to-day is deserving of the support of the country. If we were to follow the policy of nationalisation, of taking over the main services of the State under Government control, we would have difficulties, as they have found in Great Britain, serious difficulty because there comes a point, even in a nationalised industry backed by the Exchequer, where it must try to make ends meet.  I would commend to Deputy Norton and his colleagues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;since they have been giving a lesson to the members of the Central Bank or the Minister for Finance of this Government, that they might read the statement of the General Council of the Trade Union Congress in Great Britain, in reply to an appeal by the Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer in June 1952 for &ldquo;restraint in wage claims unrelated to increased productivity.&rdquo;  In that statement they said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the absence of a rise in productivity, which cannot be expected to occur quickly, substantial wage increases are bound to raise costs. Rises in the costs of our exports could in themselves price Britain out of world markets and such a course may, therefore, have the most serious consequences for our standard of living.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have dealt fairly with Deputy Norton's statement that the numbers of unemployed went up by 22,000 since the Central Bank issued its report in 1951.  There is no <Col N="569" /> connection, or very little connection indeed, between the two figures and there is no use Deputy Norton or anyone else pretending that the Central Bank or any other group of bankers or businessmen dictate Government policy.  We have come in and have stated our policy and if the Oireachtas or the country does not like it they can change the policy or change the Government and have another; but before taking that course let us examine the alternative and see in what way the country will be better off. We do not know the evils that have been prevented by the action taken by the Minister for Finance last year in trying to balance the national accounts and to achieve better equilibrium in our balance of payments; but if we are honest and examine the situation we know that if that position had been allowed to continue it would soon have got completely beyond control and beyond solution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton talked again of slashing subsidies, giving the impression that the Government wantonly and recklessly reduced the subsidies so as maliciously to increase the cost of living.  When the Minister for Finance was faced with the task of having to find all these millions, he had to find them either by economies or by increased taxation.  He did some of both.  The larger part was by way of increased taxation and the smaller part, a sum of £4,000,000, by way of reduction in food subsidies.  That, as the Taoiseach pointed out, has been&mdash; I think I am safe in saying so&mdash;almost completely wiped out by the increases given in social service benefits, the cost of which, as is usual in regard to these vary large measures of social amelioration, is very much greater than was anticipated when the Estimates were originally made out.  If the people have their homes blighted by unemployment and so on, we can point to the increases, amounting to several millions of pounds, which have been given to succour the unemployed and the distressed and to help those with families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton also shed bitter tears over the price of bread, the bread which was kicked around in NorthWest <Col N="570" /> Dublin constituency and which finds its way into the bins pretty regularly, the bread for each loaf of which the Irish taxpayer is paying a very substantial subsidy amounting, according to the figure given in the Estimates, to well over £8,000,000 in the year.  We do not know the effect, according to Deputy Norton, of the Government's decision to make this very partial reduction, having regard to the magnitude of the problem we were faced with last year of finding £15,000,000 for food subsidies or having to make a reduction; but he will not get anybody to believe that the Irish are not as well fed as or better fed than almost any other people in the world.</P>
    <P>Take the case of butter.  I am sure Deputies have seen that, in the United States, with its enormous payroll and the huge wages paid there, butter is not being bought.  The consumption of margarine has increased.  What was the consumption of butter in the United States of America in 1951?  It was 9.7 lb. per year, according to a return from the Central Statistics Office.  In the United Kingdom, it was 14.6 lb.; in Western Germany, 13.5 lb.; in the Netherlands, 6.2 lb.; in Sweden, 26 lb.; in Denmark, 15.7 lb.; in Australia, 31.8 lb.; and in Ireland, 40.8 lb.  The only country which exceeds our consumption of butter, unless our habits changed very radically last year, is New Zealand, which is slightly higher at 43.5 lb.  Every other country is well below us, and even very prosperous countries like the United States, the Netherlands, until the recent disaster, and Denmark, a great butter-producing country, do not consume anything like the quantities we consume.</P>
    <P>The same is true of meat.  I have not got the figures, but does anybody question that, in spite of the prices which beasts are fetching in the Dublin cattle market and at fairs throughout the country, there is still a very large demand for meat, even at present retail prices?  Whether it is the better class of joint or the cheaper joint, the meat is being sold, and where, 20 years ago, in a country village, one saw only one butcher's shop or none, there are six to be seen now.  Deputy Norton <Col N="571" /> and his friends who try to pretend that this country is in misery under this Government will be hard put to it to get the ordinary working people to believe it.</P>
    <P>They know the contrary to be the case.  They know that their incomes are better, that their prospects are better, that their standard of living has been raised and that amenities of various kinds&mdash;electricity, water supply, sewerage schemes, roads and housing&mdash;have been provided, and that the cost of all these has gone up about two and a half times since before the war, and they know also the kind of political play that goes on in this House when the serious problem of raising the moneys to create the employment these people in opposition say is necessary has to be faced.  Then we have an entirely different story.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach or anybody else says the country is living above its means or that an individual is living above his means, he means, surely, that a person cannot continue to maintain a standard higher than his resources or circumstances permit.  He can do that for a limited time, but what is he to do at the end?  He has either to cut down on his expenses or increase his income, and what we suggest to the country, to farmers, workers, manufacturers and producers generally, to everybody who can contribute to building up the wealth of the country, is that the best policy for this country, the easiest way out of our difficulties, the quickest remedy for the problem of the cost of living and the higher costs which producers have to meet, is more production and more production, if possible, by better methods and at a lower cost per unit.  In that way, the community generally will receive the benefits, and there is no other solution.</P>
    <P>As I said, it ought to be the task of all of us and we ought to give all our energies during the coming year to try to achieve a position in which, through a great increase in our production, whether from agriculture or industry, better employment will be provided, more employment and employment of <Col N="572" /> a more permanent character.  If we are to do that, we have to produce more.  It is only by extra production that the earnings can be provided that must go back into industry.  The task of providing capital equipment, of replacing old capital equipment at present is a very formidable one.  The principle is accepted by Labour in Great Britain and in every other country where organised labour has reached the use of reason, has begun to grow up, that there is no sense in higher wages or higher remuneration so long as you do not increase the level of production, and the only way in which you can have better wages, better conditions of employment and a better standard of living is to see to it that you have a constantly increasing pool of production.  Then you can get these amenities and improvements and you will not be working yourself into the spiral, into difficulties and dilemmas involved in not facing up to that problem.</P>

      <P>It was a pity the Minister for Lands, in his rather poor apology for Fianna Fáil policy, particularly since the last Budget, did not tell us a little more about our own country, instead of taking us all over the world and trying to justify the conditions obtaining here now, due to the present Government's policy, by comparing them with conditions in countries which have absolutely no similarity whatever with this country. He has brought us to New Zealand, to Australia, to the United States, to Britain and every country in Europe. There is absolutely no similarity between conditions here and in Britain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I did, and if the Minister remains in the House I shall tell him a little about forestry.  He has told us that on Merseyside there are 65,000 unemployed or in receipt of national assistance.  What good is that to us here?  England has just emerged from the most disastrous war in the history of the world.  So has the United States <Col N="573" /> and many other countries.  Practically every country in the world suffered the scourge of that war.  Every one of those countries has had to contend, and will have to contend for many years, with the result of that war in the form of debts of one kind or another.  Again, England suffers from over-population while we suffer from under-population.  England is a huge industrial country while this is an agricultural country with little or no industries. While I have not the slightest doubt that England is faced with many difficulties in finding a market for her industrial output, we have no such difficulty.</P>
      <P>The major industry here is the agricultural industry for the products of which there is a ready market.  The Minister has no business whatever trying to justify the complete failure of the Fianna Fáil Party, and the complete turn-about which they have perpetrated on the electorate of this country since they took office in June 1951, by taking us all over the world. Let us come to Ireland.  I am not going to ask the members of the House to follow me on a wild goose chase round the world as the Minister did.  I shall try to deal with conditions here and try to depict them as they affect the ordinary man in the street and the ordinary farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government, when they were seeking office 18 or 19 months ago, put before the people of the country a so-called 17 point programme, a programme which was really ours.  The only thing they could say about it was that it was a good policy but that they would operate it much better than we did.  The people now realise what a sad and sorry mess the present Government has made of the country.  Not a single one of the 17 points has been put into operation.  On the contrary, the Government has gone back on most of the things they said they would do, cut them down and slashed them.  I shall not refer to the statement made by the Minister for Finance prior to the election on the question of the reintroduction of increased taxes on tobacco and drink.  That in itself is only a small thing but it is an indication of the absolute contempt which the present <Col N="574" /> Government have for their own promises and for the people who elected them.  I do not mind what they do in regard to those who did not vote for them but certainly when they flout their own supporters, those who elected them, it is absolutely the last word.</P>
    <P>The Budget introduced last April by the present Government imposed taxes many of which were absolutely unnecessary. The Minister for Lands in trying to justify Government policy mentioned bread, butter and a few other items that were taxed.  The Minister may not be aware of it&mdash;I have not the slightest doubt that he is not aware of it&mdash;but every household has felt the icy grip, the paralysing grip of Fianna Fáil since June 1951. The present Government were in power only a short time when the Tánaiste made a most blood-curdling statement. He said that bankruptcy was round the corner, practically on the doorstep.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, not to be outdone by him and a little bit hot around the collar that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should invade his domain and speak on the subject of finance, came out and made a still more depressing statement.  These two dismal, false statements were the beginning of the icy grip in which the country now finds itself.  They conveyed a completely wrong impression to the country.  They terrified everybody&mdash; farmer, shopkeeper and industrialist&mdash; with the result that there was an immediate tightening up of money.  The circulation of money visibly slowed down from the date of these statements. That was followed by the succession of hammer blows administered to the people in the last Budget. We were told that the people are living beyond their means, that they are eating too much, dressing too well and spending too much on motor cars and bicycles.</P>
    <P>I shall deal very shortly with one aspect of the financial situation during the period that the inter-Party Government was in office.  During that period the inter-Party Government used approximately&mdash;I am speaking in round figures&mdash;£18,000,000 of Marshall Aid. The measure of prosperity which the people enjoyed, the amount of really <Col N="575" /> constructive work which was done, and the amount of employment provided during our period of office, all were accomplished with an expenditure of approximately only £18,000,000 of that money during the full three and a half year period.  I do not think it was any more.  I am proud to say that we used that money for the development of the country and that it contributed largely towards creating a measure of prosperity which is in such violent contrast with the paralysis that seems to have descended on the country to-day.  It should not be forgotten on the change of Government we handed over to the present Government approximately £24,000,000 of Marshall Aid money which remained unexpended during our period of office.  That has already been scuttled to the last halfpenny. It had completely vanished as far back as last summer.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party, in order to justify the impositions in the Budget of last year, caused their supporters to whisper up and down the country that the inter-Party Government left behind a debt.  I am sure it would have been a bitter pill for the Minister for Finance to have to admit that, instead of leaving a debt, we handed over £24,000,000 of Marshall Aid money which remained unspent during our time.  That was all spent afterwards within a very short time.  That is one thing they have got to explain to the people of this country&mdash;why we were able to embark upon and to continue a capital development programme, to create employment as we did, and almost stop emigration with an expenditure of only £18,000,000 of that money.  They, with the £24,000,000 which we handed over to them, ought to have sufficient resources to ensure similar prosperity for the next five or six years.  That is one thing the average man in the country cannot understand.  The small farmers and the working people are asking: &ldquo;What in the name of goodness did the present Government do with the £24,000,000 you gave them?&rdquo;  They further ask: &ldquo;How much did you spend during your term of office?&rdquo; I am speaking in round figures.  One thing they cannot understand, and that <Col N="576" /> is what became of the £24,000,000, why was it not kept and why was it not used to continue the prosperity that we left to the Fianna Fáil Government when they took office.  Fianna Fáil took office and stole our programme, and then shamelessly went back on every single one of the 17 points in it.</P>
    <P>I watch the financial returns every quarter.  It seems that the inflow of revenue has diminished to almost a trickle of what it was during the time of the inter-Party Government.  Why? Simply because the prosperity of the people was deliberately damaged by the taxes imposed under the last Budget.  During the course of Question Time last week some Deputy from the Opposition side interjected a remark that the Budget taxes were imposed in order to produce unemployment.  That is the truest remark that has been made for many a long day.  I believe that the Budget impositions were deliberately framed to create unemployment.</P>

      <P>I am greatly afraid that people behind the scenes who have not the authority to sit in this House think that as great as the tide of emigration is at the present time it should be a whole lot more.  I am afraid these people have influenced the present Government and brought them to their way of thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was only a few weeks ago&mdash; Deputies will be surprised to hear this &mdash;that ordinary labourers, labouring men without any other outside income, without a patch of land to their name or enough land from which they might derive any profit or income were billed for income-tax.  One man actually worked in a forest and another man is a worker in the county council in my county.  Both were billed for income-tax.  Yet we expect these people to stay at home and be satisfied to build up their country.  In the few cases brought to my notice the young men concerned were people who went out to work at a very early age in order to try and bring a little bit of money into the house to support their fathers and mothers or their younger brothers and sisters so that <Col N="577" /> the younger members might continue attending the national school until they reached the age of 14 years.  That is a nice state of affairs to have brought about in this country.</P>
    <P>The people who supported the present Government&mdash;and there are thousands and thousands of decent people who did&mdash;were led by false propaganda into doing so.  They cannot understand how it is that the present paralysis has come about during the last 18 months and how the circulation of money has been affected.  They did not understand that imposing taxation would bring about unemployment and the flight from the land and all the rest of it.  All they feel is one hammer blow after another.  They are getting out of the country fast.</P>
    <P>In the 1930s and in the early 1940s it was usual for boys and girls to go across to England and settle down there, perhaps.  What is the story now?  Whole families are seeking permits to bring furniture with them and clear out of the country just as if there was a plague.  This is particularly the case along the western coast.  They are bringing such household articles with them as sewing-machines and articles of furniture which have been in the family for generations and for which they have a sentimental regard. That is the state of affairs which the present Government has brought about.  Yet the Minister for Lands told us about the very little amount of butter that the people in the various countries of Europe eat and that we are eating 40 lbs.  If we are who are better entitled to it than we?</P>

      <P>I learned from those among whom I was brought up.  They had little or no hypocrisy.  They were plain people accustomed to talking to a man straight from the shoulder.  I learned one lesson since I came to this House.  How can the people on the opposite side shed tears and laugh up their sleeves at those they are wounding to the heart at the same time?</P>
      <P>Whatever shortcomings the inter-Party Government had&mdash;Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta, the Independents, and those who supported that Government&mdash;we did our honest best to bring about a measure of prosperity in this country. Looking back over the past 18 months, I feel prouder and prouder every day of what we succeeded in doing.  Although the present Government have sunk the country to a low pitch, I have not the slightest doubt that if the inter-Party Government were back again we could restore the same measure of prosperity inside three or four months or six months at the very outside.</P>
      <P>I refuse to subscribe to the theory that this country is living beyond its means.  I refuse to believe that this country is bankrupt.  I know the very opposite.  We are a nation of hardworking people and all we ask from any Government is the right to live and manage our own affairs in our own way.  We do not ask for sops.  I refuse to believe that we are bankrupt. Agriculture is our principal industry. We have a very favourable climate. Sometimes we grumble at the rain. By and large, however, and in comparison with other countries, we have a very favourable climate, even including the rainfall.  This is the richest country under the sun.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was astonished at some of the facts that Deputy Norton revealed. When speaking, he gave the following figures to the House.  In January, 1951, the number of unemployed on the <Col N="579" /> live register was 50,000.  In January, 1952, it was 73,400, and in the middle of January, 1953, the figure had risen to 87,200.  But listen to the other side of the question.  In January, 1951, there were 23,000 in receipt of unemployment benefit.  In January, 1952, there were 31,000 in receipt of unemployment benefit, and in January, 1953, we had 53,000 in the pay of the Government.</P>

      <P>I believe that the vast number of people in receipt of unemployment benefit or assistance at the present time would much rather go home on Saturday night with a week's wages than go home on Tuesday from the Guards' barracks with six or seven shillings in their pockets.</P>
      <P>During the period of the inter-Party Government all the money was spent on development work in this country. I will quote some of those works at short notice.  We had a vast number of men employed on the land rehabilitation scheme, the best scheme produced in this or any other Western European country.  There is no gainsaying that.  There was a vast number of people employed under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The number employed in afforestation was doubled and trebled during the period of the inter-Party Government.  There were 101 other schemes which absorbed smaller numbers but the major schemes to which I have referred used up a vast number.  Deputy Cowan might be surprised to hear that so much was this the case that the Land Commission gangs had to be dispensed with in the West of Ireland where men were not available to turn out to work on them.  Let me tell Deputy Cowan something which I presume he could not have the means of knowing.</P>

      <P>During the inter-Party Government term of office a man had to go to the employment exchange in Castlebar to report that he could not get a man to work in that area.  By comparison, a maintenance man gave a hint on a Sunday some little time ago that he wanted a few men for maintenance work on a county road and 51 men turned out seeking employment.  That is a small indication of the difference in conditions which existed under the inter-Party Government and those which now exist under this Fianna Fáil Government.  I believe that that instance is typical of many other areas in the country.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to another piece of legislation which was enacted&mdash;the Undeveloped Areas Act. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, piloted that Bill through this House.  We all gave it our blessing and sped it through the House as fast as we could.  We all thought we should never see it law soon enough.  We all thought the time would never come until the £2,000,000 would be sent down the country and factories would be springing up so fast that we <Col N="582" /> Deputies would have to pick our steps on our way home.  That Act was a complete flop.  The advice which I then gave to the Minister for Industry and Commerce still holds good.  There are a few ways in which the flight from the land can be arrested.  They are not very attractive ways from the point of view of the politician but nevertheless they are the only ways.  If we want to bring industry and earning into some of the poorer parts of the West of Ireland, and if we want to keep our young people at home there, I still strongly recommend afforestation. During the 18 or 20 months in which I have been out of office that view has been strengthened by what I have seen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The cutting down of the forestry programme has been responsible for a certain amount of unemployment, and it is a step in the wrong direction.  The reason why I mention the matter is because I want the Taoiseach to know that I think that what he has allowed his Minister for Lands to do in that regard is completely wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> The Taoiseach, on a number of occasions, has expressed concern for the backbone of the country&mdash;the small farmer.  What has he to say about the number of holdings which are becoming vacant day by day&mdash;particularly in the congested areas&mdash;and what does he propose to do about the matter?  Is that the Fianna Fáil way of settling the problem of congestion&mdash;by allowing the people to drift from the land?  I regret to say that I fear that that is the Fianna Fáil method of settling that question.  It is scandalous that that should happen in those areas.  It may be that the people there are poor, that they have not motor-cars and, in some cases, not even a bicycle, and that they are not well-dressed, but they are the foundation stock of a very large portion of the population of this country. They are the best blood we have.  We should not lose them or allow them to go.  We should not lose them easily in this generation.  Future generations will condemn whatever Government is in control for allowing those people to go from us and for allowing our areas to become depopulated.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands asked Deputy Norton, during the course of his speech, where the money is to come from.  We are back to the same old question which the present Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Ryan, asked in this House in 1946 when he was then Minister for Public Health.  At that time we were asking for an increase of only 5/- in old age pension.  He asked where the money was to come from, and he pointed out that that increase alone would cost £500,000.  We now hear the same old cry from the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>The present Government have nobody to blame but themselves.  They took office in June, 1951.  At the time they were handed over the country there was buoyancy.  They found that £24,000,000 of the Marshall Aid money was yet unspent.  I believe that they were absolutely astounded and dumbfounded at the prosperous condition in which they found the country.  Then, just because Fianna Fáil had not established it, they set about destroying it.  I need instance only the action <Col N="584" /> of one Fianna Fáil Deputy, now a Parliamentary Secretary, who started a whispering campaign to the effect that Deputy Dillon's land reclamation scheme was but an inter-Party trick to raise the valuations on the small farmers and advising them not to have anything to do with it and not to let one of the officials on their land.  If that is a responsible and generous way of contributing to the government of a country then it would seem that I have yet a lot to learn, but certainly I will never learn it if that is what I must learn.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about the development of agriculture in this country.  Deputies make the best contributions they can.  It is not easy for any Deputy who has not practical experience to make a really worthwhile contribution on that particular subject.  The whole process of wringing a living from the land is very complicated.  A farmer has to be an expert not alone in one particular respect, as is the case in most other walks of life, but in many respects. He must be a good judge of the weather.  He must be a keen buyer and seller of stock.  He must be something of a veterinary surgeon.  To a certain extent he must be a carpenter and a blacksmith, and nowadays most of them must have a knowledge of mechanics.</P>
    <P>Without going into the detail which would be more appropriate on the Vote for the Department of Agriculture, there are a few suggestions which the present Government might consider if they are genuine in trying to put agriculture on a proper basis.  The first thing they might do is to take up where the inter-Party Government left off in all its plans for agriculture.  These are well worth examining.  One was the handing back to the farmers of approximately 4,500,000 acres of land which could be made equal to the best provided the water is taken off it.  I ask them to go back to the land rehabilitation scheme and to the Local Authorities (Works) Act which we worked hand in hand, and to speed up arterial drainage as fast as possible. The very shape of this country is <Col N="585" /> opposed to drainage.  If what I suggest is done, it will leave us with a large acreage of good useful land, second to none, if the water is taken off it.</P>
    <P>That was the aim of the inter-Party Government and of Deputy Dillon, its Minister for Agriculture, to try to restore to the farmers these 4,500,000 acres of land.  On most of that land at present rent and rates are being paid by the farmers, but they are deriving no benefit from that land.  The fact, of course, is that you cannot drain a man's land into the sea.  The drainage must go through hundreds of other people's land.  You must get the cooperation of all to make a drainage scheme a success.  Therefore, I urge on the Government to go back to the land rehabilitation scheme and to restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act, if not to the pitch we had reached, at least as near as possible to it.  I also suggest the speeding up of arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>The next thing I would ask the Government to do is to examine the prices which farmers are getting for their produce at the present time.  The farmer, in my opinion, has never got, what everybody else appears to be able to get and what he is entitled to, namely, a fair margin of profit for what he produces over and above the costs of production.  That is all he asks. I think his demand is a reasonable one. The fact that he is not getting that is the cause of the milk dispute that we have to-day.  Farmers should also be encouraged to use fertilisers and lime on their land to a far greater extent than they are doing at present.  I think that we are the smallest users of fertilisers in all Europe.  I suggest that the Government should use some means to assist and encourage farmers to use fertilisers to a greater extent. Because of the heavy rainfall, most of our land is extremely acid, and hence is not producing as much as it might. There is a cheap remedy to correct that, and that is, the more widespread use of ground limestone.</P>
    <P>There is no use in talking about increased agricultural production while we not only allow but assist in driving people off the land.  What has happened <Col N="586" /> recently to our cow and in-calf heifer population?  We are down in numbers by 90,000.  That fact is going to be reflected in the position in which we will find ourselves in two or three years' time.  It will be reflected in a very nasty way in our exports of live cattle and of tinned meat.  What are the Government doing about that?  I say they should wake up.  Agriculture is our principal industry.  The Government should face that problem as we did.  We did it in such a way that it was fast bringing a great measure of prosperity to our people.</P>
    <P>The present effort would appear to be to try and ride roughshod over the farmers, of having Ministers like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who probably knows as much about farming as our cat does about the moon talking and shouting when he does not know the first thing about it. Every small or big farmer who reads his speeches knows quite well that he is just talking through his hat.  If we want increased agricultural production the first thing to be done is to stem the flight from the land.  If that is not done there will be no one left on the land and so we can have no agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The next thing we require is more drainage with a return of the land rehabilitation scheme.  These works must be undertaken if the farmer is to be asked for increased production.  We have some Deputies here who seem to like adopting the attitude of telling the farmer how he should manage his own affairs.  The one significant fact in that connection is that not one of them would be seen within 40 miles of a farm.  Perhaps that is a good job for the land.  But they get up to talk and tell the farmers to work and produce more off the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if it has ever occurred to any of those Deputies that the only thing the average farmer has out of which to make a living for himself and his family is his farm of land. I can tell those Deputies that the average farmer does his very best to <Col N="587" /> knock the last ounce and the last penny he can out of every rood and perch of land he has.  I believe myself that if there was a proper approach made to this question, agricultural production could be improved enormously. The present cheeseparing policy of the Government is not going to bring about that result.  They should try and induce our young people to remain on the land and develop it as the inter-Party Government did.  They should put money into circulation and so undo some of the damage which they have done.  They should impress on the people that this country is not bankrupt and is not the desert island which they have tried to depict it ever since they came back to power.  In my opinion, this is one of the richest little countries under the sun.  It must be that to have withstood the damage that has been done to it during the last 18 months by the present Government&mdash;bringing about poverty, unemployment and a shortage of food.  That is a shocking state of affairs.  The sooner an election comes the better.</P>
      <P>I have not the slightest doubt that, as indicated at the by-election in Dublin North-West, the people of the country, if given the opportunity, will give a very decisive answer.  The people know how prosperous the country was when we handed over to the present Government.  They cannot understand where the paralysis and the icy blast have come from which seem to have withered up the good circulation of money there was in our time, the good employment there was, and the upsurge there was amongst our people.  We succeeded in doing all that in our time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this appeal to the Taoiseach.  It is not too late for the Government to go back and take up the programme which they stole from us and shamefully put before the country by saying that they would carry it out.  Let them try and make a success of it by putting it into operation.  If they do, they will get co-operation from every single Deputy on this side.  It was our policy and programme, and we are proud of it. <Col N="588" /> I have not the slightest doubt that, if the inter-Party Government were back in power again, inside of three months we would have restored to the people the prosperity which they enjoyed during the three and a half years we were in office.</P>

I listened carefully to the speeches made by Deputy General Mulcahy and Deputy Norton and failed to find in either of them any constructive suggestion, any evidence of serious thought devoted to the problem which is undoubtedly a serious one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton and to some extent Deputy Blowick, suggested that we must have more agricultural production, that we must have more cattle and agricultural produce to export and at the same time that we must import less and less of the goods that we can manufacture at home.  In other words, the suggestion is that there should be a one-way traffic, that we should send our cattle, beef and agricultural produce to England in ships and that the ships should come back empty.  That is the suggestion.</P>

      <P>That is their trouble.  Since that stockpiling period, there is not sufficient employment in the docks and I am perfectly certain that those dockers would not take too kindly to Deputy Norton's suggestion as to how the unemployment problem should be solved.  They want to see goods going out and they want to see goods coming in.  One of the problems that we have to face in a big way is whether, in fact, as a small nation, we can live on our own and can afford to ignore the outside world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the problems we have to consider, and I think it is worthy of some consideration. We are part of civilisation. Certainly, I should like to see as much food as possible produced in this country, but Britain can pay for food only with manufactured goods; she has no other way of paying for them and if she does not pay for them in that way, if she does not send us manufactured goods in exchange for our cattle and agricultural produce, the situation that Deputy Norton condemned, of piling up external assets in Britain, will be created.  One of the ways in which these assets are created is the export of goods and the import of goods of less value.</P>
      <P>That is why I think Deputy Norton, as Leader of the Labour Party, has not approached this debate with a clear mind.  He has told us about the particular type of manufacturer that we should encourage, some type of saint who would manufacture, not for the purpose of making any profit for himself, or only a very reasonable profit, who would give the very best conditions to his employees and workers, who would supply goods at a price the public could pay.  Obviously, there is no such man within the present system.  The present system has not thrown up that kind of man in many years.  It certainly has not thrown him up in this country in the last 30 years.  That is Deputy Norton's visionary approach to a serious problem.</P>

      <P>90,000 unemployed.  I have been discussing this problem for the last four years here.  It is a very serious problem.  I see it every day. As far as 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 people on the present register are concerned, I know that they are unemployed due to certain stoppage of building works. Outside that, there are still 50,000 to <Col N="591" /> 60,000 unemployed people, and they will be there all the time.  One of our great difficulties, which I have seen for the last three or four years, and it has existed for longer than that, is the problem of trying to find employment of any kind for a young lad of 17 or 18 years of age who has finished in the secondary school.  There has been no hope for that young lad this year, last year or the year before, or the year before that.  He can join the Army; he can join the R.A.F.; he can join the British Army; he can emigrate to Britain and get employment.  That problem has existed for the last four years. There is no doubt about that problem, and nothing constructive has been done for the last four years to find employment for that type of person.  I have seen the problem in Dublin of skilled building workers.  They cannot find employment.  Quite a number of them are taking the boat and going over with their tools to find work in Britain.  That is happening every week.  What is the solution to that problem?  I am trying to find a solution to that problem.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Dublin Corporation and we have quite a decent building programme.  We want to get our contracts out for the building of houses and get the job started, but we find every conceivable type of difficulty in the way.  There is a system of tender which has grown up over the years.  Apparently, you must tender for everything.  If the Minister does not insist on tenders he is subjected to criticism in the House.  We get tenders, some of which can be approved and some of which cannot be approved.  We have the period of waiting while we are examining the tenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only the other day we came up against this problem.  A particular firm tendered for the building of 250 houses.  That firm has been building in Dublin for a number of years, but this was the first time it tendered for a corporation contract.  I went to the meeting of our construction committee because I wanted to get work going as quickly as possible as I felt that that would contribute something to take the carpenters and the bricklayers off the register at the employment exchanges. <Col N="592" /> What did I find?  I found that if that particular firm has to comply with all the requirements there is a possibility of a hold up due to a regulation of 20 years' standing.</P>
    <P>There is a trade union regulation that any firm contracting to build Dublin Corporation houses must have a joinery works operating in Dublin. This is a Sligo firm and they have a joinery works in the County Sligo where they employ Irish workers to make the doors and windows, to plane the boards and to make the stairs.  The difficulty we came up against was that that particular firm can be employed for the building of private houses and employ trade union labour in Dublin City, but when it tenders to the Dublin Corporation for the building of 250 houses which would employ skilled workers we find that a particular rule may hold up the contract.  I do not see any reason or necessity for that. That is a restrictive practice, but it is a restrictive practice that may in fact hold up a building scheme of 250 houses.</P>
    <P>That is only one item.  We had a particular scheme in Dublin which a contractor was not able to finish, and the insurance company, as guarantor, was called in.  The insurance company selected another contractor to do the work, and some difficulty arose in regard to that particular business. Anyway, the contract has to be referred back to the Department of Local Government for their approval. If we are trying to abolish unemployment or to make some effort to ease unemployment, some of these trade union restrictions will have to be eased and some of the routine with regard to the Local Government Department which has grown up over so many years must also be removed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about easing the problem.  I am trying to <Col N="593" /> deal with a situation that I see myself and which I am endeavouring every day to improve, but Deputy Rooney shakes his head profoundly.  We have several building schemes in the Dublin Corporation, but these schemes are held up because we have to go through all the routine of the Local Government Department.  If there is to be an immediate easing of this problem of unemployment, it can only be done by means of public works such as those.  I want to say to the Government that when we are in a crisis such as this, one must consider all the things which hold up the starting of work.  All those things which prevent work starting can very readily be removed.  I know that that will not solve the whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>You are only sidestepping it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very profound comment.  It is not side stepping, it is trying to deal with a situation that I see and something which will give employment to 4,000 people or 5,000 people in Dublin is of some value.  We cannot solve the whole problem in Dublin, but at least we can make an effort to ease it.  I am suggesting that in order to get some people into work it will be necessary to alter the machinery of local government supervision.  We will have to build houses in Dublin for quite a number of years.  I think it was the late Minister for Local Government, Mr. Murphy, who set out on a target of 3,000 houses per year for Dublin. During the past three years the Dublin Corporation alone built 7,000 houses and we have been endeavouring to continue that programme which will get between 2,000 and 2,500 houses built every year for the next five years.  We can look forward to this year and next year but we cannot look beyond that in regard to employment in house-building. It is important that there should be consistency and regularity where skilled workers are employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are up against a problem that has been there for many years and to which I have referred before in this House, and that is, the problem of drainage.  There is a main sewer being <Col N="594" /> built and unless that sewer is completed our building programme must break down.  As far as I can gather, there is sanction now for this scheme to go as far as Raheny, but in order that an area of land will be opened up for housing development it is necessary that that sewer must go right under the Hill of Howth and into the sea, where the sewage will be discharged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, if one talks nonsense in this House, it is all right, but if one talks seriously about a serious problem, one will get that type of interruption.  The whole building programme in Dublin during the next ten years will depend on that sewer being completed.  It has been held up for many years now and I am availing of this opportunity to say that it should not be held up any longer. Not only will that open up an area for corporation housing, but it will open up a substantial area for private development and the building of houses by people who want to build them.  I cannot talk airily about every part of the country, but at least I can talk about the area of which I know something. I want to see any restrictions or delays on the part of the Local Government Department eased or removed so that all the work possible will be started as quickly as possible.  In that way we will be able to remove the unemployed from the labour exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blowick talked about income-tax. He said that it was scandalous that the workers here should have to pay income-tax.  It is not because the workers are badly off that they are paying income-tax.  It is because they are in receipt of a sufficient wage which enables them under the income-tax code to pay that particular form of taxation.  Deputy Blowick says that they will not pay it.  He says that they are running away to England to avoid paying it.  How much income-tax will they have to pay in England? They will have to pay a good deal more.  In fact, quite a number of workers are coming home because they <Col N="595" /> cannot pay the income-tax rate in operation in England.</P>
    <P>Our approach in a debate of this kind should be a reasonable one.  For some reason or other Deputy Mulcahy referred to income-tax also and he said that unemployment was being caused because the Revenue Commissioners were endeavouring to collect income-tax from people who hitherto were evading it.  I could not see the logic of his arguments there.  If a person is liable to pay income-tax is it not up to the Revenue Commissioners to avail of the machinery established by the Government of which Deputy Mulcahy was a member 25 years ago in order to collect all the income-tax they can and compel the employer to collect it for them?  Deputy Mulcahy says that is leading to unemployment.  That is nonsense.  It has nothing at all to do with unemployment.</P>
    <P>There has been a development here over a number of years.  I have referred to that development during the period when Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Finance.  I will refer to it again now; it is the policy of restriction of bank credit.  That policy was in operation during the term of office of the inter-Party Government. On some occasions I asked Deputy McGilligan was he, as Minister for Finance, in any way responsible for it? Had the Government given any directions to the banks?  Deputy McGilligan said he was not responsible.  He said the Government had given no direction to the banks.  Similar replies have been elicited from the present Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The fact is that over a number of years the banks themselves under direction, and probably under pressure, from outside this State have been imposing a policy of restriction of credit and that restriction of credit is undoubtedly responsible for a considerable number of unemployed all over the country.  The small businessman who may require a few hundred pounds or a couple of thousand pounds to carry out some work has not been able to get it.  Certain small business people, some of them from a selfish <Col N="596" /> motive, have dismissed employees because of the difficulty of getting credit from the banks.  All through the country that policy is causing little pockets of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is like a snowball.  It grows.  If you have a certain number of people unemployed those people are not in a position to spend a weekly pay packet and consequently the distributors and manufacturers ultimately feel the pinch.  Unemployment breeds unemployment and people are thrown out of work in the distributing and manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>First and foremost, I think it will be necessary for the Government to remove the red-tape restrictions that hold up constructive development.  The Government must use whatever influence it has with the banks to ensure that more credit will be released for private business interests and small industries.  If that is done, all our skilled workers who are now unemployed will find themselves in employment once more.</P>
    <P>We are at the moment suffering as a result of a milk stoppage in the agricultural industry.  People live on food.  They have nothing else on which to live, and there is a moral responsibility on those who produce food to ensure that the community is fed.  That is a serious responsibility.  It is one which should be considered very seriously by that section of the community which has got so many reliefs, so many advantages and so many subsidies from the community.</P>
    <P>A couple of years ago I asked Deputy McGilligan, when he was Minister for Finance, in the inter-Party Government, what the taxpayers contributed to the agricultural community and I was told that, taking into account relief in rates and other matters, the figure was £12,000,000.  The taxpayer, therefore, contributes £12,000,000 a year to ease the burden that is on the farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they are, but we must face up to the problem now that we, as a community, contribute approximately £12,000,000 per <Col N="597" /> annum to subsidise the farmers and keep them going.  There was a time when farmers perhaps wanted that particular subsidy, a time when they were hard pressed, a time when their means of transport between one part of the country and another was the bicycle or the horse.  Now they can travel in their high-powered motorcars.</P>

      <P>No.  The farmers must face up to their responsibilities.

That problem will have to be faced, and no one should face up to it more quickly than the Deputies who say they represent the farmers here.</P>

There is no use in crying out for a subsidy to the tune of £12,000,000 from the taxpayer and then destroying the milk produced for the community.  I freely admit that the farmers are entitled to drive the best and hardest bargain they can in connection with their produce but they are not entitled to destroy milk for human consumption.</P>

I am relating them to the financial discussions that are taking place with regard to the Budget and in regard to £12,000,000 which the community is contributing to subsidise agriculture.  The people who receive that subsidy from the community for the purpose of providing food for the community have no right to destroy that food rather than give it to the infants, the invalids and the sick.  It is probably better politics to go around and talk the other way, that it is right to do that, to throw acid on cows.</P>

      <P>The farmer can contribute something towards the relief of unemployment by employing more people.  Our statistics show that there are less and less people employed on the land by the farmer.  Mind you, there is a very high regard for the farmer. A couple of years ago people went out of the city offices to assist in saving the harvest.  I do not think they would go out to-morrow if the farmers' harvest was threatened; that is something we must take into account. Deputy McQuillan has a motion here in which he suggests that this House should seriously consider the whole matter of the rehabilitation of agriculture and the question of what number of people can be employed in agriculture and on the land.  Everyone would agree that it is our duty to improve our live stock.</P>

      <P>That would not suit some members of the Labour Party who can raise questions in this House because an effort is being made to improve bloodstock.  There is a serious issue involved.  If it costs £250,000 to endeavour to improve our bloodstock is it not worth it or is it just a good political item for the crossroads to say we are spending £250,000 on Tulyar rather than give employment to a few people on drainage?</P>

      <P>If Deputy O'Sullivan would only work it out and think <Col N="601" /> it out he would see that our bloodstock industry is a vital industry and it ought to be improved.  The more it is improved the more people it will give employment to and if you just consider racing and everything connected with racing and bloodstock, there is a very big number of people who have got and given employment out of it.  But we prefer to have the &ldquo;smart Aleck&rdquo; crack rather than to face the realities and look forward beyond our noses.</P>
      <P>I believe that the problem facing us can be solved.  I agree with Deputy Blowick, Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Norton, although none of them said it, that within the system as we know it there is no hope in the world.  The system as we have it is a system of private enterprise where you cannot compel the farmer to do anything, where he can do what he likes.</P>

As far as I am concerned, I believe that the present system will never enable us to solve the problem of unemployment or the evils mentioned here to-day.  Twenty-one years ago, the Taoiseach was of that mind.  He told us so.  He was perfectly right then.  He has spent 21 years in trying to improve things, but to-day we are back to a condition of 80,000 unemployed, back to a condition of people emigrating and leaving the country. One of the things that often worries me is whether a small State such as this, with a population of 3,000,000, can exist on its own.  That is a problem that worries me.  Can it?</P>

I admit that Deputy Johnston, when he spoke here 30 years ago, put the Labour Party proposals in a straighter and clearer way than they have been put to-day.  They were put profoundly then by a person who had grown up in socialist philosophy.  That is our trouble.  There is, with the exception of myself, no one to advocate socialist philosophy in this House.  I regret very much that the Labour Party has fallen on evil days.

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach spoke, introducing this Estimate, he stressed specifically the necessity for expanding production and indicated in general terms that he felt that the real capacity for that expansion lay in agriculture.  It was rather a tragedy to find one of the unrepentant four who keep the Government in office devote practically 50 minutes to unadulterated nonsense, in relation to a serious problem.  Deputy Cowan had the effrontery to talk about a subsidy for the farmer.  It is time everyone realised the stark reality of Irish economics, that all the wealth in the ultimate analysis comes from the first six inches of soil of our arable land.  It is no help either to vilify or attempt to become a moral expert in regard to encouraging increased production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take what Deputy Cowan has referred to as the milk stoppage and <Col N="605" /> find where the real truth of that position is.  The real truth may be found in the capricious nonsense of politicians.  How could they expect farmers to-day to be anything but uneasy, when some of the very people who now deny them even the right to conciliation or arbitration preach and prate throughout the length and breadth of the country that 1/8, 1/9 and 1/10 is an economic price for milk?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think they should spill milk on the public roads?  Will he answer that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy comes in here to talk about moral rights. Apparently the right given to every other section of the community to have its grievances, whether alleged or real, investigated and decided upon can be denied to the farmers with the contempt and contumely of people like Deputy Cowan.  One thing is certain &mdash; not only is the most stable section, the farmers and those who work with them, and who get their livelihood from the land, but they are also the people who played the most vital and most effective part in the securing of what freedom we enjoy in this country, and it ill befits us, who built up a huge system of administration, a costly system of government, with a Civil Service on the lines of that of a foreign State and paid for it all out of Irish agriculture to condemn them here.</P>
      <P>I want, as the Taoiseach wants, to see a tremendous expansion in agriculture. I firmly believe that, with a proper and intelligent approach, we can increase agricultural production in the next ten years by from 200 to 300 per cent.  I firmly believe that if a proper approach is made to the farmer, if the farmer is given the same rights and privileges as any businessman, shop owner or any other person engaged in work, the right to make a reasonable and fair margin of profit, there is no Government but will get his willing, full and wholehearted co-operation in that effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most unfortunate that we have had created in relation to the question of milk an atmosphere of town and <Col N="606" /> county, of city and country.  I say deliberately to the Government that I cannot understand how they allowed this situation to arise.  I cannot decide whether or not there is a sinister purpose behind it of finding a means, by pitting sections of the community against each other, of covering up the utter and dismal failure of the economic system which they have brought in.  I have listened to members of the Government inciting in this House and throughout the length and breadth of the country much of the agitation that has now boomeranged back upon them, and I ask the Taoiseach, in all honesty and sincerity, to stop the spread of this kind of falsely created dissension and to cease to deny to one section of the community, a most important section, the right of access to the type of conciliation and arbitration machinery which is available to all other sections.</P>
    <P>I go further and say that if the Taoiseach rises here to-night and says to the farming community of Ireland: &ldquo;We will have this milk problem referred to arbitration and conciliation machinery,&rdquo; I guarantee that there is not a farmer from one end of Ireland to the other who will not be with him. If the body which examines the farmers' claim finds that claim to be just, it will make an award and, if it finds it unjust, it will make a decision on it.  That decision must ultimately come back to us for us to act upon it, and I say to the Taoiseach that if he is in any way sincere about the drive for increased production, let him first give an earnest of goodwill and sincerity to the Irish agricultural community in regard to what may be one of the most troublesome basic problems of our whole industry.</P>
    <P>Not only is the price of milk involved, but the whole structure of our agricultural industry is involved.  Not only is the structure upon which our milk and butter industry is based involved, but the basis on which our production of cattle for the export trade, for the store trade and for canning is involved in where ultimately the primary producer of that stock stands in the industry. It is from the farmer in wet stock must come the basis of all that increase. I say to the Taoiseach, not by <Col N="607" /> way of criticism but by way of direct reality, that we are capable of growing in this country, with a little intelligent Government effort and with intelligent investment of Irish money in the grand green land of our own country, from three to four blades of grass for every blade of grass that is grown.  We could produce and feed for a longer period in the year increased numbers of cattle and, with a little investment, on the basis of a considered and well-judged system, we could develop a balanced ration for the feeding and development of our stock, which would leave us completely independent of the imports which people talk so much about as costing too much.</P>
    <P>There is, however, one thing we must realise before we get down to the question of production at all, and it is that the expansion of that production depends primarily on two things &mdash; first, the earnest and continued goodwill of the Irish farming community and, secondly, the intelligent and progressive investment of money in the real bank of this land, its soil.  People talk of subsidies for farmers.</P>
    <P>The Irish farmer never wanted a subsidy.  The Irish farmer has always worked within his means to the best of his capacity, but if lack of capital or resources is to hold him up in an expansion which is worth while in the nation's development, then, surely the Irish farmer has a greater claim upon the bounty of an Irish Government and on the invested money of the Irish people than any foreign State, whether for purposes of liquidity or bolstering up schemes at cheap rates of interest in England.</P>
    <P>I am not like the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I want no pound note army of occupation in Great Britain. I want Irish money, if Irish pounds are to be spent, in the occupation of improving the soil, its heart and its production.  When we speak of production, I say to the Taoiseach and the Government &mdash; I do not care what economist they consult and do not give a thráneen for all the central banks in the world &mdash; money intelligently put into the development of Irish land can increase in a startling way its production <Col N="608" /> and the general earning capacity of our country.  I am not like Deputy Norton, anxious that tariff walls and other restrictions should be used unreasonably for the development of Irish industry.  I would prefer to see our agricultural export expand to such an extent that we could afford to have a reasonable subsidiary industry built up in this country associated with our agricultural production, and, at the same time, be able to afford, at a reasonable price to the consumer such imports as we might need afterwards, because, with an expanding export trade, we could create a condition in which the earning capacity of our people, their standard of life, and their desire for an improved standard, might make necessary the import of goods which would not normally be within our own industrial competence.</P>
    <P>We get criticism of the farmer, words bandied around this House, when he seeks any kind of decent support from the Government, but apparently if you start some industry, whether it is in fact economic in its genesis or not, you can apply for the widest type of protection without criticism.  I say in a deliberate way, let the Government be very careful in what they have to say in regard to the question of increased production.  Let what they have got to say about the farmer in the present situation be very carefully chosen, lest they create by indiscreet speeches, terribly indiscreet speeches, a situation where the goodwill that is necessary, in our national interests will be deliberately destroyed.  The time has gone &mdash; and I have preached this doctrine before &mdash; for making the farmer and our agricultural industry the plaything of politics.  What agriculture has lacked for 30 years is a continuous plan and a continuous effort.  It has been subject to far too much caprice and nobody has got down to the business of preparing a basic plan.  We hear arguments to-day, well-founded arguments on both sides, as to whether the very basis of our agricultural policy exists at all &mdash; whether there is such a thing as the dual purpose cow.  On this question of production, the Government will have to direct their minds to the question of <Col N="609" /> whether it is practicable to continue to build milk production in this country on a cow that is averaging in the main 350 to 400 gallons or whether it would be more practical for a period to devise a new plan whereby it may be possible either to zone, alternate or integrate a new dual system of stock raising as distinct from the dual purpose cow.</P>
    <P>The question of expansion in production is one about which the Government has indulged in a good deal of talk, but what in reality have they done to effect it?  Apart from the temporary &mdash; and I hope it is a very temporary &mdash; situation that has arisen in regard to milk and the Government's complete mishandling of it, I want to know what has the Government done by way of price encouragement, improved marketing facilities or improved profit for the farmer to encourage him to produce more in any line?  We heard for the first six or seven months of the Government's period of office veiled threats about the reimposition of compulsory tillage.  That was abandoned.  Then we heard the question of improved prices for milk.  We heard the Minister for Agriculture himself talking of the necessity for it and then we found him in the <i>Bearna Baoil</i>, denying any right or redress to the farming community.  What is the situation going to be unless the Government can create &mdash; and I want them and earnestly appeal to them to create &mdash; real goodwill?  I want to see put into effect in this country a balanced agricultural plan because there is no use in asking for increased production unless you have a plan whereby fertilisers will be available at a price within the scope of the farmer who wishes to use them, where various types of improved seeds will be available, where various types of technical advice and skill will be at the disposal of the farmer to enable him to bring about a rapid improvement in grass land, in general crop production, and particularly a rapid improvement in the production of various crops for ensilage.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said in his speech to-day that the farmer must be made realise that the initial outlay in artificial <Col N="610" /> manures can pay over and over again for itself.  I feel that it is the Government needs to be made realise that the investment of money in Irish land can, from the Government's point of view, be made to pay very substantial and very valuable returns by way of dividends in increased production and earning capacity, when put into the land and into the strong right arm of the Irish farming community &mdash; an infinitely better result than can be earned by the standing army of occupation that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs wants wandering around England.  A prerequisite to increased production is an earnest of goodwill by the Government in making available to the farming community the facilities which must be made available if they are to buy artificial manures, to put in the right types of seed and to carry out the improvements in their holding which are necessary.  Why should we tolerate a situation in which loans can only be made available to the farmer at 6½ per cent. when much of our money is invested at a microscopic part of that return in foreign lands?  I firmly believe in making a careful and analytical study of the question, whether it is possible to expand a figure that has reached over £100,000,000 in exports this year to £250,000,000 in the next five or six years.  Something has to be done, and done quickly. What is the Government doing about the thousands of heavy in-calf heifers that are going into factories for slaughter?  What is the Government doing to preserve the selectivity, if any, of heifers for milk production?  Is the Government, embroiled as it is in a discussion &mdash; or should I say in an impasse with the milk producers &mdash; going to allow a situation to develop under which what might be the basis of our future cattle population will be sold for slaughter for the dressed-meat trade or the carcase-meat trade?</P>
    <P>That is a real live danger I want to impress on the Taoiseach.  We are only feeling now in this milk stoppage the full effects of the indiscriminate stupidity of the indissolute slaughter of calves in 1932, 1933 and 1934.  It broke down the complete selectivity <Col N="611" /> that was there of building up, if such a thing was not in existence, the dual purpose cow because with your big calf population you are able to select what type is likely to be the best heifer.</P>

      <P>I want to direct the Government's attention to the fact that we are in infinite danger of getting below a certain minimum with our milch cow population and with improving the heifer population.  If we get below that minimum &mdash; as any Deputy and particularly Deputy Cunningham knows &mdash; it will not be easy for us to build up or increase our population of cattle or cows at home.  It is becoming a real live danger.  I am impressing that upon the Taoiseach because there is too ready a market for the disposal of this type of animal to-day if the Government does not act quickly and wisely in the general milk situation.</P>
      <P>As a young man, I say to the Taoiseach that no matter what the rights or wrongs of one's opinion may be in the present situation it is the manifest duty of the Government to bring about as effectively and as quickly as possible a resumption of the normal situation of goodwill between the farmer and the Government.  That is not going to be done.</P>

      <P>That will not be done by ill advised action or speeches.  I want to come on to the second problem that the Government must face.  Of course, it is inter-allied with production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have naturally an increased intake of people on the land of Ireland. The Government has to face the second wedge of this problem which is rising unemployment but worse than unemployment even is the absolute exodus <Col N="612" /> of young people from the land.  I say to the Taoiseach in a very deliberate way that areas such as West Cork &mdash; I know from discussions with Deputies from Donegal, south Kerry and the western seaboard that a similar situation exists in their areas &mdash; are all experiencing the same difficulty at the moment.  Houses are being closed up completely and families are leaving with their belongings.  Some of them have not very much to take.  The Government can do something in regard to one facet of Irish public life. They can do something to break down this horrible feeling of uncertainty and anxiety that exists amongst the young people to-day.  It exists even among people in employment.  They are so unsettled in employment that they are trying to find somewhere else to go where they will find more permanency. It is not so much the problem of immediate unemployment which is so serious as the question of people on short time and the people under notice that they may be put on short time. It is this uncertainty of tenure of employment that is getting into the psychological make-up of the youth of this country and it needs very serious arresting.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to stress to any Government using its head that no matter how valuable or troublesome the fiscal situation may become at any stage the real wealth of the country, apart from the land, resides in the people themselves and in their capacity to produce and work the land or to work in industries subsidiary to that production.  It is the youth of this country, boys and girls 18, 19, 20 and 21 years of age, who are leaving.  They are going out of the country at a stage when their energy, capacity and everything else are at their best.  We educate, train and help those people in their youth and having done all that we seem to label them for export only.</P>

      <Col N="613" /> That was at the time of foreign oppression, at a time of devastation, famine and no harvest.  To-day the flight from the land is in full cry again.  It makes it rather ironical when one thinks of the speeches once made by Deputy Aiken, the present Minister for External Affairs that the ships would be overflowing with the returning emigrants under their administration.</P>
    <P>This has become a problem and if the Government does not do something about it immediately it may become too serious for any Government to tackle because we are allowing by idle talk and lack of effort the very basis of our future to be frittered away.  It is a poor tribute to Irish freedom that the freedom that is most common amongst us to-day is the free flight of the flower of our youth from the country.</P>
    <P>This problem needs a very quick remedy.  When I say a quick remedy I mean that it is going to involve the Government getting a designed plan for the putting into use at home all the wealth of accumulated credits and savings that should serve the purpose of preserving at home in decent occupation and employment our own people.  To what extent is it necessary to reduce this £80,000,000 that is floating around in a liquidity pool?  If the Government thought it necessary in the morning to withdraw out of the liquidity pool £50,000,000 of the £80,000,000, I do not believe there is a voice in Dáil Éireann that would be raised against it.  Pound notes are idle if we find to-day a country with too few people in it.  Such is the situation we are facing to-day in many parts of rural Ireland where only the very old and young remain.  Whatever has got into the minds and hearts of the people of this country, there is at present a lack of hope.  There is at present among lots of young people no belief in a solid future.  I know myself what the real answer to that problem is.  I think the Government know it &mdash; but they would be afraid of their life to act on it.  The Government can, in the morning, put themselves in the hands of their masters, or alleged masters.  They can put themselves back into the hands of the people of this <Col N="614" /> country by having a general election. I can give them a guarantee that, if they do so, we shall have a new Government.</P>

      <P>This problem is getting to the dimensions of creating a serious crisis.  The Government must take due notice of it and do something to arrest what is not only uncertainty but a positively increasing drift out of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands came in here this evening and in reverberating tones spoke about the situation in England, New Zealand and elsewhere.  He spoke about a country of which we know that the complete basis of its economy is utterly different from ours.  This country is a very strong creditor nation, while Britain is a very heavily committed debtor nation.  As Deputy Blowick put it, Britain is an overpopulated island which has to find an export market for her heavy industry in order to carry the bulk of her people.  We are an agricultural country. To quote the experts on whom the Minister for Lands, Deputy Derrig, is so keen, we have in Ireland some of the finest land and potential in Europe. We have an under-populated country which is rapidly becoming even more under-populated.  We have large accumulated foreign credits invested in anything but in what I feel they should be invested.  I appeal to the Government to prevent the continued exodus.  With their cry for increased production they should immediately <Col N="615" /> make available to the farmer the credits he requires to bring about that increased production.  The farmers of this country are conscious of their duty no matter what their politics may be.  If there is an appeal for increased agricultural production the farmers will make the effort.  If the Government want this increased effort surely they can do better for the farmer than they are now doing, what with all the red tape and the difficulties in connection with the Agricultural Credit Corporation? Surely they can do better for the farmer than sell him fertilisers &mdash; fertilisers which were paid for at £9 a ton and which are now offered for sale at £14 or £15 a ton?  Surely the Government can do better for the farmers of this country than make post-prandial speeches of great length about the necessity for increased production? If you give the farmer the means to increase production he will do it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the way to do so is to make available to him, not free money, but reasonably cheap money, so that he can make the necessary initial investment which the Taoiseach talks about that will yield him a bountiful harvest. If the Taoiseach is sincere in his belief that this initial investment by the farmer will yield such a bountiful return, then I suggest that it should be applied from the particular to the general.  Let the State, realising how bountiful the return from such an investment can be, make available to the farmer in a reasonable way the facilities that will enable him to put fertiliser on the land and to buy such machinery and tools as may be necessary to aid him in giving this nation an expanding production.</P>
    <P>I feel quite seriously that we want a very carefully thought out and considered progressive plan for agriculture in this country to enable us to bring it up within five, six or seven years to the production level to which we must bring it if we are to maintain a decent standard of life for the Irish people and to maintain at home in Ireland as many as possible of our Irish people. I feel that the Government, by its vacillating and inept financial stupidity that <Col N="616" /> it calls a policy, has succeeded in depressing every section of the Irish community without exception.  The last Budget, in itself, extracted infinitely more from the pockets of the people by way of direct and indirect taxation. The partial removal of subsidies caused an increase in the cost of living which immediately reacted in leaving less for other goods.  We had a deliberate depression by the Minister of the money left to the Irish people for spending in the normal way.  I should like some economist, even if he is capable of the cerebral gymnastics of the Minister for Finance, to explain to me the basis on which you can give the people less of their own money with which they can buy more and save more and maintain the same standard of life.</P>
    <P>You can reach a level of taxation which is not inequitable and at the same time get buoyancy in your revenue.  The Taoiseach talked to me the other night about being geared up to go over a precipice.  The Government have gone over the high taxation precipice and the revenue is no longer buoyant.  On their own heads be visited the very sins which that act has caused to come upon them.  You cannot ask people in this country, whether they be industrialists or agriculturists, to produce more if, by that increased production and that effort, they only put themselves more and more into the hungry clutch of the Revenue Commissioners.  High taxation was never yet an incentive to production.  The sooner the Government realise that it must get away from a policy of over-taxation and of over-burdening the people the sooner this country will adjust itself, whether in industry or in agriculture, to increased expansion.  You cannot and you never have in any economic system of high taxation, with all the portents of even a further effort at higher taxation, any sincere effort at increased production.</P>
    <P>It is not too late for the Government to throw its hat at the hair shirt policy and get down to the realism of using as much of Ireland's money as possible for the development of Ireland and for the Irish at home.  If they do that, and if they put more money into <Col N="617" /> circulation and more people into employment, they will find that for less taxation they will get a better return. As soon as they start a policy of reducing taxation there will be a sigh of relief throughout the country.  They will find that it will express itself immediately in an improvement in employment and in an expansion of industry and that, very rapidly, with any kind of Government encouragement and help, and with reasonable credit facilities for the farmers, the Government can surely rely on all the production that this country may need to maintain and improve the present standard of life of its people, as well as ensure a future for those who follow.</P>

      <P>When I listened to Deputy Cowan as a new member of the House I had a type of respect for him.  I regarded him, after listening to his first few speeches, as being a courageous little man, that is as long as he was a member of a political Party within this House.  But, since he divorced himself from the Party to which he had been elected in 1948, and, subsequently, when he broke, or alleged that he broke, with the inter-Party Government, he changed entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From his speech to-night, it is difficult to imagine him in the same political bed, either with the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance.  It is hard to reconcile the peevishness he has displayed in the speeches he made in the last 18 months when some of us remember his attitude towards the inter-Party Government, especially in the latter months of its régime.  I think I remember hearing him describe the then Minister for Agriculture as being the best Minister for Agriculture that this country ever had.  I heard him many times loud in his praise of the then Minister for Local Government in his promotion of the housing drive and of drainage schemes.  I heard him, especially, congratulate the former Minister for Finance on being able to keep down taxation.  I think every member of the House heard him ejaculate very loudly on the Second Reading of the Social Welfare Bill of <Col N="618" /> 1951&mdash;that was in March, 1951, when he invited the Fianna Fáil Party and the House generally to declare an election.</P>
    <P>It is hard, therefore, to understand the switch, and his apologetic speeches, especially the one he made to-night.  It struck me particularly when I heard Deputy Cowan say that he could not remember the exact number of the unemployed.  He was afraid of his life to mention the real figure of 87,217 unemployed.  Every time he wanted to talk about the unemployed he was afraid to talk about the number.  He talked at one moment as if the figure were a few thousand. When he was reminded two or three times that it was 87,000 he came back and said something about the 80,000 mark.  Then we heard him upbraid the farmers of the country.  I have never posed as a champion of the farmers, but I think it was a dastardly attempt on his part to blackguard the farming community, and then apologise for making that widespread attack on the farming community by saying that only a few farmers would throw acid on cows or bluestone in the milk.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan is not the main subject of this debate.  This debate is, or should be, on the introductory speech of the Taoiseach.  I listened during the odd hour in which he spoke.  What struck me was that he failed and failed miserably, to create any enthusiasm in the people who sit behind him, and failed to create any enthusiasm in the minds of the people who sit on the opposite benches.  I would say that when the general public read his introductory speech on his Estimate in to-morrow's papers they will glean little hope from the remarks which he passed, and especially will the 87,217 unemployed glean any hope or encouragement from any words that came from his lips during that hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a rehash of everything which the Minister for Finance has said in the last few months and of everything that has been said by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. <Col N="619" /> The most we heard about the unemployed from the Taoiseach himself was, in the words, that the Government was disturbed.  Those of us who have ever consulted a dictionary know what &ldquo;disturbed&rdquo; means.  I would say that the Taoiseach and the Government ought to have been shocked and that the Taoiseach ought to have expressed utter alarm at the increase in the number of unemployed in the last 12 months or, if you like, in the last 18 months during which his Party plus four Independents have made up the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>Some people outside this House, especially those who voted for Fianna Fáil, voted them in on trust.  I should not say that they voted the Fianna Fáil Party into this House to form a Government, but when Fianna Fáil did become the Government there was an element of trust amongst supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party.  That trust was minimised to some extent, when the Budget of 1952 was introduced by the Minister for Finance.  It was argued and protested by supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party that this Budget was a severe cure for the evils as announced by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This budgetary policy, and the activities of the Government over the last 12 months were designed, we were told&mdash;and the people who supported them believed that this policy was framed and designed&mdash;to cure an alleged evil.  I, as a member of the Opposition and as a member of the Labour Party, am wondering, and those people who supported Fianna Fáil are wondering, when the cure of this alleged evil is going to be effective or when it is going to kill the patient.  The country is waiting, and especially the supporters of Fianna Fáil are waiting, for Fianna Fáil policy to unfold itself.  It seems to them, as it seems to us and to the country as a whole that, rather than the evil being minimised, or the disease being cured, the disease is getting worse, and that the evil is getting greater.  That is amply reflected in the increase in the unemployment figures week by week, month by month, over the past 12 <Col N="620" /> months, especially over the last 18 months.</P>
    <P>Even though some members of this House have said to the contrary, I have always believed, and my Party has always believed, that the Government of this country or of any country should, and must, take responsibility for all the people in it, especially for those who are unemployed.  The Social Welfare Act, 1952, was all right in itself.  The concessions that were given by way of children's allowances in the Budget of 1952 were also all right in themselves.  But they are not compensation for a week's wages&mdash;£2 10s. to a man with a wife and three or more children does not adequately compensate for a week's wages.  The sooner this House and members of the Government in particular realise that and take drastic measures substantially to reduce the number of unemployed in the country, the better.  Otherwise we will find ourselves with a decreased population.  The population is very small at the present time.</P>
    <P>Those who have read the census of population issued in the last few months know that, in our own counties, towns and parishes, the population has been dwindling over the last ten years and even over the last two years.</P>
    <P>From what we heard from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Lands to-day I do not believe that the Taoiseach or the members of the Government appreciate the position in the country.  They may have an idea of the situation in the City of Dublin. I would like to talk merely about my own constituency.  It is a county of about 90,000 people.  I cannot give any figures, any more than the Taoiseach or his Department can give figures, of emigration, but I could give tens of names of men and women from the town of Wexford who have emigrated to England over the last three months especially and over the last 12 months. The Taoiseach ought to know that from the town of Enniscorthy, where the normal population is about 7,000, in a period of five weeks 100 people emigrated to Great Britain to seek employment; that in the town of New Ross one small industry which six months ago employed 25 persons is now <Col N="621" /> employing three persons; that in one county parish an agent from an English firm three weeks ago recruited 17 unemployed men for work in Britain.</P>
    <P>This is a drain on the county of Wexford, a drain on the country, that we cannot afford.  While the primary factor to be considered in the matter of emigration is the fact that men and women are leaving the country, we must all consider that these people are worth something to the State.  In education alone each of these individuals costs up to £2,000.  Not alone are we exporting men and women, but we are exporting the £2,000 that it costs to educate them.</P>
    <P>I heard the Taoiseach say to-day, in his lecturing of the Opposition&mdash;and I do not think he meant it for any Opposition; he meant it especially for the present Opposition&mdash;that they always clamour for more, that they always clamour for improvements, but never make a suggestion or never provide a solution.  I do not think that Oppositions, whether they be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, ever differ in that respect.  I would go a little further and say that the present Tánaiste, when he was Deputy Lemass in opposition, quite brazenly said that the duty of an Opposition was to criticise, to look for faults, to ask that things be done, but that it was the Government's duty to provide the solution and to suggest how money could be raised.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact I remember one particular occasion&mdash;I think it was about this time in 1949&mdash;when it became necessary, owing to lack of sufficient funds in the Road Fund, to cut down the road grants, there was a clamour from the Opposition, lead by the present Minister for Agriculture, and joined in by the present Minister for Local Government and the present Tánaiste, then Deputy Lemass.  They were no different as an opposition. They clamoured that this work be provided, that more men be employed, but they did not provide a solution.</P>
    <P>There was a similar situation when we had the second-last row about the price of milk.  Fianna Fáil clamoured. Did they provide a solution?  Did they make any suggestions?  They acted as <Col N="622" /> Deputy Lemass had exhorted them to act.  They merely criticised and shouted across the floor that it was the Government's responsibility to provide a solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said here to-day, and the Minister for Lands joined him, that public works were not cut down.  I cannot give the figures.  The Minister for Finance will probably be able to give the figures and maybe will show in the figures that the amount provided this year is greater to some extent than the amount provided last year, but we have only the evidence of our eyes.  Last year there was no necessity to lay off as many men in the county council from road work as have been laid off this year.  Housing went on to a greater extent last year.  I cannot understand, then, how any Minister on the front bench can say that there are more moneys provided this year for public works than last year.  I speak for my own constituency, but it would seem from remarks passed here to-day that the same applies to the majority of constituents. There is no doubt in the world that there is a definite slowing down, and a deliberate slowing down of the housing drive in this country at the present time.</P>

      <P>I want to say this to Deputy Briscoe: It takes men to build houses.  You do not build houses with chairs nor have we robots to build houses.  I have merely to go to the municipal buildings in Wexford or to the county manager and ask how many men are employed on house-building in Wexford town this year as compared with last year to discover that the number is substantially less.  I know, because they have approached me, that 25 men were sacked from the housing scheme in Wexford town six weeks ago.</P>

Up to recently we had something like 80 houses in course of construction and our programme meant that about 80 houses would be completed every year. The county manager glibly announced the other week that the programme for next year is 50 houses and that 50 may not be completed.</P>

      <P>Again, in regard to public works, there is a situation that has not occurred for many a year.  We have ten engineering districts for the Wexford County Council.  The county manager told me last Saturday that this week it is proposed to close down three of these areas.  It means that 30 per cent. of the small number of men who are now working on the roads for Wexford County Council are <Col N="624" /> to be dismissed and will be idle until March next until the programme for the year 1953/54 commences.  If anybody tells me that public works are proceeding on the same scale as this time last year I am afraid I just would not believe him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan went to great lengths to criticise the approach by Deputy Norton to this particular problem.  I am one of those who have always believed that in this country there is a job to be done, and that we have the men to do the job.  So far as one particular aspect of development is concerned, we have all the raw materials and the natural resources.  The one thing which holds us up is money. Surely it is a sad situation when we have men in this country, not 87,000, because I suppose some of them would not be capable of doing agricultural work, but a big proportion who are ready and available for work and when we have the work which needs to be done.</P>
      <P>Every single Party in this House has expressed its determination on assuming office to build up the country, in particular to develop the agricultural industry and to step up production in that respect.  There is much other work to be done.  There are many hospitals and schools to be built, roads to be reconstructed, afforestation to be engaged in, and rural electrification to be developed, but we are stymied completely every time because we have not enough money to do these things.  I have always believed in borrowing.  I have never been ashamed of the fact that during the three years of the inter-Party régime I supported borrowing, borrowing, borrowing all the time as long as it was for capital development.</P>

      <P>It is important, but the 87,000 unemployed are also important.  Did we ever hear any Minister exhort local authorities to provide a certain amount of money by way of rates for the provision of employment in a situation like this?  I find the statements of Ministers and their exhortations in regard to expenditure in conflict when you have regard to the number of unemployed at present and the number emigrating.  We have not the figures as to emigration. <Col N="627" /> I tabled some questions to the Taoiseach about emigration figures.  It is a very sad thing that we have people flying from this country and seeking employment in Great Britain and yet no Department of State has any records as to the number of people who have gone.  The Taoiseach promised some time ago that he would try to find some system whereby a check would be kept.  It seems to me that the Government would prefer not to have any record of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it seems to me that the Government would prefer that there should be no records of emigration because it is more or less an outlet for them as far as unemployment is concerned.  It seems to be therefore that the Fianna Fáil solution for unemployment is emigration.  It was suggested by one Fianna Fáil cumann.  I think in the Minister for Finance's constituency, that conscription into the National Army was the solution for unemployment. I hope that emigration is not the substitute solution of the Government. Apart from all these criticisms that have been made in this House, surely the Taoiseach must listen to appeals, not alone from other Deputies, but from his own Deputies to do something even as an expedient to cut down these figures of unemployment.</P>
      <P>The next problem that I am especially concerned with is the fact that when we lose these people as emigrants we lose them for good.  It is true that some of them come back but we lose the greater number of them.  The rise in unemployment has continued over the last 12 months and if there is not some hope held out, some encouragement given by the Government, some suggestions made and some policy expounded the result will be that unemployment figures will rise and emigration figures will leave the towns, villages and rural areas denuded of population.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish said that the Government had purposely interfered with the housing programme so that the building of houses had considerably slowed up.  I want to say to Deputy Corish through you, Sir, that that is completely untrue.  If there has been a slowing up in the building of houses under any local authority <Col N="633" /> administration it is definitely because of that local authority itself failing in its duty.  I can say that in the City of Dublin in this year we will have built a record number of houses as compared with any other year since this State got self-government.  That can be said without any contradiction and I can further say that the State has come to the aid of our local authority in Dublin to the extent of finding the money for us, where it was doubtful whether we could raise it ourselves, when they subsidised the interest charges in a generous fashion.  As far as the City of Dublin is concerned &mdash;and I take it it applies to the rest of the country in the same way&mdash;it is up to the public representatives on that local authority to get on with the job of eliminating slumdom and the building of houses required by our people. That is the position and it is unfair to say that unemployment has followed the slowing up of house building as a result of Government interference. There is no such thing.  People do not seem to understand the extent to which the Government goes to help to relieve unemployment.</P>
      <P>I heard recently some member of the Oireachtas criticising the manner in which the City of Dublin built roads; he believed and suggested that if we did less road building we would save a lot of the ratepayers' money.  But that poor public representative did not seem to understand or realise that in the City of Dublin we had 70 per cent. of the expenditure on roads given to us by the Government.  There is a very big labour content in the building of roads, and if it is expected that we are going to save rates by saving that 30 per cent. of the cost of the roads, I do not know why it is that from that side of the House there is criticism of us with regard to unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made only one note during the whole speech of Deputy Collins.  That was the reference to the hold up by the Government of the sewerage scheme from Dublin through Raheny out to Howth.  The amount of money required for that scheme has been sanctioned by the Government, and as that money is needed we provide for it through our loans for capital expenditure <Col N="634" /> requirements.  The hold up has been solely due to a difference of opinion among technical experts as to the best means under modern ideas of dealing with this problem of providing a sewerage scheme to meet the needs of that side of the city and to cater for a growing city and a growing population. Because the representatives of the City of Dublin do not rush off into a scheme, which might prove faulty, until Government experts, local authority experts and independent experts called in to advise, come to a conclusion as to what is the best thing to do, it is said the Government is holding it up.</P>
    <P>I would like to say this about unemployment. I realise the calamity unemployment is and I realise the difficulty as it confronts various individuals but I should like the Labour Deputies in particular to be fair about this.  In the City of Dublin&mdash;I cannot speak for the country&mdash;you may have a family of seven or eight people in the house.  The father of the house is the breadwinner in employment.  He may have four or five children of working age, some of whom cannot find employment or maybe one of whom had employment and lost it but consequently counts amongst the unemployed. When we speak of the unemployed Deputy Corish would have us believe that every one of them is a breadwinner, the head of a family trying to maintain the family on 50/-a week, when I know that a great number of the unemployed are young people living at home with their parents and their brothers and sisters.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish spoke as if every unemployed person was the head of a family.  Another thing we have to take into account from the point of view of employment in this country is that we have not yet, on this <Col N="635" /> side of the House at any rate, considered bringing people into certain specific classes of employment.  People are free to take whatever employment offers or not take it.  I do not suppose that can be denied.  There are many types of occupation available which may not be accepted by some of our unemployed.  It is not a question absolutely and entirely that opportunity for work of some kind is not available.  We all know in our own spheres of life that it is difficult sometimes to get an employee for a particular position.  That freedom is there and nobody intends to interfere with it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick, when he started to speak, reminded me of a comedian who recently limped on to a stage and explained his limp was due to a war wound&mdash;he had fallen over an American soldier in the black-out in London. Deputy Blowick told us he was afraid to go home in the dark because he might trip over some of the industries that were promised in connection with the £2,000,000 grant to start industries in the undeveloped areas.  An ex-Minister expected us to believe that was really a serious expression of thought on his part, that there was so much talk about the £2,000,000 that he was afraid to go home in the dark for fear he would trip over one of these newly-sprung up industries.</P>

      <P>Deputies who told me <Col N="636" /> I should be disposed to regard this matter in some other light will find a somewhat different attitude among their constituents.  This question concerns the proposed expenditure, so far as we have been told, of £250,000 of public money.  At the outset, in order to anticipate any misrepresentation which people may attempt to create, it it as well for me to make it clear that I have no opposition whatever to the promotion of the interests of the Irish bloodstock industry.  However, I think I am speaking the minds of the majority of the people when I say that they are seriously concerned at this expenditure.  £250,000 is not chicken feed in anybody's vocabulary, not even that of the gentleman about to receive that sum.</P>
      <P>I was interested to read in the journal published by the Government some details concerning this animal.  I do not profess to know anything about Irish bloodstock or bloodstock of any kind.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;He has a reputation for laziness. A lounger during exercise at home, his chief interests in life are eating and sleeping.  He has been known to doze off while being groomed, and glances around for something to lean against when taken out of his box.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will accept it from that authority that these are the particular virtues, these are the qualities which are attributed to this animal, which I believe we have purchased from the Aga Khan.  I would like to know some facts about it and I want to get some information.  I would like to know if there was a Government decision to purchase this animal.  This matter of £250,000 is a very considerable <Col N="637" /> sum&mdash;was it the subject of a Government decision?  I have not seen any reference in any Government Estimate to the expenditure or expected expenditure of this amount.  I would like to know on what basis this horse was valued and by whom it was valued.  I am told by people who are regarded in this country as experts in the bloodstock industry, that we will not be in a position to say whether this animal will be of any good to this country or not until 1957, when the first group of two-year-olds will be racing, and that it cannot be before then.</P>
      <P>I am told also by these same experts that, unless this horse is run as a four-years-old in certain races in England, none of its progeny will qualify for competition in the major classics in England when the time comes.  These are important things.  A lot of propaganda has been put out that something great was being done for the country by the purchase, that our prestige was being boosted&mdash;but the facts do not seem to tally with that.</P>

I would like to know whether or not there is an undisclosed agreement covering the vendor's retained nominations. This is the interesting point. We are told we got a great bargain in this animal; we are told that we were lucky in defeating the Americans, that they might have got this Tulyar.  But what is the position?  We are paying to the owner, a man who struggles to live, as we know, and who has an international reputation of struggling to live, while being weighed in gold and jewels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is no more than a reckless gamble.  We have no guarantee whatever that it will pay off, either for the bloodstock industry or for the nation as a whole. On the other hand, we do know, and we have no doubt about it, that we have 87,000 unemployed and we are told by the Government that they cannot find the money to relieve that unemployment. I know that in the town of Balbriggan, in my constituency, we have a record number of unemployed, and the same applies in every part of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the question proper, I want to know also if it is a fact that the vendor of this animal will have priority in regard to use in this <Col N="639" /> country.  Does it not amount to this, that we have made a present of £250,000 to this international figure to whom I have referred and, at the same time this animal will be kept in this country and its service and use will be made available to the person who sold it for such a colossal sum?  If every member of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;and Deputy Cowan, an <i>ex officio</i> member&mdash; wants to agree with that, that is their business; but I can say that the majority of the people in this country do not agree with it&mdash;and everyone knows that.</P>
      <P>I should like to know, too, what amount of insurance falls to be paid in respect of this animal.  According to the paper I quoted, its maximum earning capacity is in the neighbourhood of £16,000 per year.  We do not know how much attendant expenses there are upon its purchase, and we do not know what it is going to cost to have it brought here in safety, cared for, and so on.</P>
      <P>Neither do we know how much will be paid in insurance, if any insurance will be undertaken in respect of it at all.  If insurance is to be undertaken, will it be taken out with an Irish company? Will any Irish company be sufficiently strong to insure the animal? I know that there have been inquiries and I am told that the annual premium on this animal would come to something like £9,000 per year.  Add £9,000 per year to £250,000 and take into consideration the fact that it will be 1957 before we will know the result of this reckless gamble and then ask yourself if this is a prudent step for the Government to take.  Nobody in his senses would believe it is.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of what the employment potential of the bloodstock industry is.  I venture to say that while it may be important, there are other industries which needed an injection of £250,000 far more urgently than does this industry.  I should think that, if, for instance, the Minister for Finance had been anxious to obtain the maximum amount of money for the loan which he foisted on this country recently, he might have had the money invested in that national loan.</P>

I want to contrast two important things that stand out in the public mind and that have been the subject of comment in the public Press and in the streets and everywhere people meet.  On the one hand, we spend £250,000 on a horse, and, on the other hand, we have the greatest number of unemployed that we have had for the past 11 years.  Is that sane? I think it is an absolutely insane act. If we lived in a condition of prosperity, it may well be that we could undertake some such step as has been taken in this case, but surely nobody would suggest that this is a prudent action on the part of the Government.</P>

I should like to mention this fact to those who are interested in racing and who follow the quadrupeds to any extent and I am sure it will be fortified by some of my friends in the House.  This animal beat by a neck an animal known as Gay Time.  This animal Gay Time was sold for £50,000, so that we are paying £200,000 for a neck.

I have put a certain number of questions to both Ministers who are here because there appears to be some divergence as to the responsibility in this matter: but these are State funds. This is public money being sent out of the country on a very risky proposition. It is, in my view and in the view of many people, a reckless gamble and an unjustifiable step.  I should be glad to hear from either of the two Ministers just what the answer is to this. Nobody knew anything about it until we read of it in the papers.  Let us hear some more about it.  The people of this city have been demanding and crying out for milk and Fianna Fáil's answer was to give them a horse.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Dunne raised this question this evening, I was surprised by the manner in which he raised it. Usually, when a Deputy requires information, he puts down a question, but on this occasion the Deputy saw fit to announce at the end of questions that he proposed to raise a question regarding the purchase of Tulyar. When he started his speech, he said he knew nothing about racing or about bloodstock, but he went on to describe in very great detail more about racing than I know myself.  I do not know a terrible lot about it, but although Deputy Dunne said he knew nothing about it, he was at no disadvantage. He talks about the laziness of Tulyar. Did he look up the record of Tulyar in the past 12 months?  He has won about seven races to the value of £70,000.  That is a record, and it does not seem to fit in with the description <Col N="642" /> of him as a lazy and indolent animal who wants to lie up against his box.</P>

      <P>The only function the Government has, so far as the National Stud is concerned, is to provide capital.  In 1945, a certain capital was provided for the National Stud, but down through the years it has been discovered, due to many causes, that that capital was not sufficient, and when it is proved that it is not sufficient, it is the duty of the Government, if the National Stud is to carry out the functions it is designed to carry out, to provide the necessary capital.  That is the only function the Government has in this matter.  When Royal Charger was being purchased in 1946 there was an outcry in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It was raised by several Deputies here, I understand.  At that time, in 1946, he cost £52,000 when horse flesh was not as expensive as it is to-day, and when they were not purchasing a horse with the same record that Tulyar has.  The value of this horse has increased considerably.  I have no hesitation in saying that if he were put on the market to-morrow he would fetch probably double that price. Last year there was not a word when the directors of the National Stud went to Newmarket Sales or Doncaster Sales -I could not say which&mdash;and paid the highest price at these sales for a filly, Staffa&mdash;£11,750.  These are the functions of the directors of the National Stud.  The directors are there charged with the full responsibility of working the National Stud in the interests of the country.  The Government has no function in that matter and it was not a Government decision to buy Tulyar. It was the decision of the directors and the directors alone.</P>

      <P>Tulyar will be one of the sires, and only one of the sires, at the National Stud.  There are others.  Let me quote some of the prices paid for these sires.  Royal Charger, first of all, cost £52,000; Preciptic cost £15,000; Black Rock, £8,000, and Whitehall, £6,825.  These are the four sires at the stud.  Star Sapphire, a mare 13 years old, cost £6,720, and it was a wonder that Deputy Dunne did not raise a question in 1946 when that sum was paid for her.  Neither did he raise any question when Staffa, a three-years-old at the time, cost £11,550.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of the National Stud is to build up the bloodstock industry and this country holds a very proud place so far as bloodstock is concerned.  For the past 50 or 60 years we have supplied more than half of the English Grand National winners. We have on numerous occasions produced winners of the Derby. St. Leger <Col N="644" /> the 2,000 and 1,000 Guineas and other classics.  We have produced horses in this country that have held their own with the best in the world, and it is the function of the directors of the National Stud, if they are doing their duty to the country, to see that it is going to hold its own in the future by buying the best horses, which have proved themselves the best horses, in the world.  They are fulfilling that function so far as this country is concerned.  I say, further, that it is the duty of the Government, if the National Stud requires capital, or moneys for capital purposes, to see that that money is provided, because the bloodstock industry is as important for this country as any other industry. It gives as much employment as any other industry.</P>

      <P>If these people are prepared to do their duty&mdash;and they are doing their duty&mdash;and they require capital for that purpose it is the duty of the Government to provide them with that capital.  I believe myself personally that they have done a good job.  Royal Charger has proved himself, for the last few years, a really good horse.  Last year he was No. Two sire in England and Ireland for two-years-old <Col N="645" /> and he was the first in Ireland for two-years-old.  He came seventh in the general list of sires in England and Ireland.  That was a good purchase and it proved that those who bought that horse knew their business.  So also in this case, in the purchase of Tulyar the directors have gone out in a businesslike way to buy this horse.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne seems to be in a critical mood as regard the former owner, the Aga Khan.  The Aga Khan himself has stated that this horse was bid for by the Americans.  They were prepared to give him a $1,000,000, £321,000, for the horse.  He has a regard for this country, he claims, and he has proved that regard by selling us this horse at £70,000 under the price at which it was valued by the Americans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to doubt it, and I do not know if the Deputy has any reason to doubt it. Whether it is true or not, I have as much right to believe that it is true as the Deputy to believe that it is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely asked if you believed that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do believe it.  I see no reason why it should not be so.  If the Americans were so anxious to buy Tulyar they had a high opinion of him. I believe, and I suppose everybody else does, that they will be just as anxious to buy his progeny.  If that is so, there <Col N="646" /> is a market for the progeny of Tulyar, a dollar market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>He must prove himself first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has tried to prove himself on many occasions in this House.  We will take a chance on that. I do not think the Deputy is on a winner to-night either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Time will tell that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have tried to explain to the Deputy, if there was any information he wanted in regard to this matter he could have got it by way of question and answer in the usual way. I hope it is now quite clear to him that this horse was not purchased as a result of a Government decision.  The Government had no function in that matter.  Their only function is to provide the capital required for the National Stud.  They have done that so far.  As a matter of fact, the sum voted as capital was not fully called up so far.  For the past two or three years the directors have been trying to get a long-distance horse.  They went to France, Italy and Britain for that purpose, but they were unable to get such a horse.  This horse then came on the market and they went out and purchased it.  I hope, and I am sure Deputy Dunne hopes, that it will prove to be a lucky purchase.</P>
