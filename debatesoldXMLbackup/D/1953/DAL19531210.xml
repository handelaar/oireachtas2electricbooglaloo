    <Title>Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, 1953&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to continue for a further three years, including the present year, the greatly increased agricultural grant introduced in 1946, by the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act of that year.  The Bill also proposes to make a change in the method of distributing the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system of allowances which began in 1946 and continued up to last year provided for an abatement of three-fifths of the rates on land valuations up to £20.  Where the valuation of land in a holding was greater than £20, two types of additional allowances could be paid in relief of rates on the portion of the valuation over £20.  The first was a supplementary allowance of one-fifth of rates and the second an employment allowance of 10/- in the £ of valuation where one or more men <Col N="1930" /> were at work on a holding.  The employment allowance was limited to £6 10s. per man, and the Act provided that these two types of allowance taken together were not to exceed the actual rates on the valuation over £20. In other words, a ratepayer could not get more in allowances than he was liable to pay in rates.</P>
    <P>In February, 1952, when I was speaking on the Bill which was to extend the 1946 system to the year ended 31st March last, I told the House that I was examining the whole question of this form of rate relief, with a view to giving greater help by means of the agricultural grant to farmers whose methods of farming afforded maximum employment and who were best serving the needs of the community as a whole in regard to agricultural production.  I said then that I did not see why this very large subsidy should be paid out without exploring what we might do to induce farmers to give more employment.  The Bill now before you represents what I think we can fairly do within the framework of the present system, to use the agricultural grant in the drive for agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to merge the two types of allowance hitherto payable for land valuations over £20.  The supplementary allowance paid irrespective of numbers employed will disappear and the employment allowance will be increased to a figure of £17 for each man employed on the holding. No change is being made in the three-fifths abatement in the rates on land valuations up to £20.</P>
    <P>The Bill will apply the new scale of allowances to the current year and to the two following years.  A three year trial period is necessary in order to give the revised system a chance of proving itself.</P>
    <P>The other main provision of the Bill relates to the amendment of rates. That is necessary because the Bill will govern the making of allowances during the year which began on the 1st April last.  When I spoke to the House on the Bill which applied the 1946 allowances to the year 1952-53, and to which I have already referred, I said that I would have liked to make <Col N="1931" /> these changes for that year in view of the situation that existed.  I was not able to do so then, but I considered it essential not to lose a further year, and although the necessary legislation could not be prepared in time, I wished to introduce the new system in the current year.  This presented certain difficulties, since the extensive work of applotment of the county rate and making out demand notes has to go ahead as early as possible after the beginning of the local financial year if local finances are to be kept on an even keel.  For this purpose county councils must know beforehand the general lines on which the agricultural grant is to be allocated for the year.  The provisions of the present Bill show a departure from the circular letter issued to county councils in May last. The departure is, in fact, an extension of the new scheme and provides an employment allowance of £17 per man instead of £13 as suggested in the circular.</P>
    <P>If the 1946 Act had been applied unchanged to the present year, it is estimated that the agricultural grant would have amounted to approximately £5,000,000.  It is estimated that the grant under this Bill will not be less.  The change proposed means, therefore, that the total amount will be distributed on an improved basis. Some will gain and some lose under the new system but, taking the country at a whole, losses and gains will balance out.  The main difference, and the whole idea of the Bill, is that the farmer who will gain will be the farmer engaged in those forms of agricultural production which claim most attention, most supervision and care and, more important still, provide most rural employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the speech which has just been made in so very few minutes by the Minister on such a very large subject, I must say that nobody could accuse the Minister in any way of having a sense of humour.  The Minister, without a smile on his face, spoke of the extensive work of applotment of the work that has to be undertaken by local authorities in regard to the rates and the <Col N="1932" /> necessity of having that work done at an early date and immediately after the close of the financial year.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that the financial year ends on the 31st March.  Everybody knows that local authorities, after their estimates meeting in February or the beginning of March, set about straightway the completion of the applotment of their rates and that they set about at a very early date in their financial year the completion of their rate demand notes.  Yet the Minister, who has just paid lip-service to the necessity for early work, waited until the 20th May last to give any indication to any local authority in the country of what he intended to do for the current year.</P>
      <P>It was only on the 20th May, that is to say, seven weeks after every local authority should have started on the work they had to do, the Minister told the local authorities that the work they had done was, to some extent, useless and would have to be scrapped. If ever there was an example of pure bungling in the administration and execution of any plan that was before a Government, the manner in which the Minister handled this Bill is an example of such bungling.  Although it has probably meant on an average about £600 wasted money per local authority on pure official red tape, as I know one Deputy opposite would describe it, that is not all.  We are going to have now, as a result of the Bill, additional paper work that could have been avoided if only the Minister had properly worked out the plans at the beginning and had properly considered whatever proposals he was going to bring before the House at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason is plain and simple. When the Minister sent his circular letter of the 20th May last to the various counties he was merely trying to implement the decision of his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance, we all know, issued his famous edict in the Budget that taxation bears lightly on the land and the Minister for Local Government came along on the 20th May and with his letter that he then issued he, <Col N="1933" /> too, joined in that chorus; he, too, showed that he was not going to be behind the times in effecting, at the expense of the farmers, savings that the Minister for Finance announced during the passage of the Budget he intended to make.</P>
    <P>The circular that was issued on the 20th May last would have meant a reduction in the agricultural grant that would have been paid this year&mdash;as near as anybody can make the calculation totting up the figures that were available to each member of each county council, or available in the Department&mdash;a loss to the farmers of the country as a whole of approximately between £400,000 and £450,000. It was because the Minister for Local Government got such a roasting and because the Fianna Fáil Party got such a roasting throughout the country from Fine Gael and others over that project to reduce the agricultural grant by approximately £400,000, that this change was made in the Bill that is now being introduced.</P>
    <P>Those owners of agricultural land from the end of one county to the other who are having the increases in their rates somewhat reduced from the intention of the Minister on the 20th May last can only thank those people who started a campaign throughout the country and succeeded, particularly in East Cork and in Wicklow, in opening the eyes of the farmers of the country to what was proposed to be done by the Minister for Local Government following on his colleague the Minister for Finance.  It was as a result of the fright that Fianna Fáil got from East Cork and from Wicklow that at last they decided to withdraw their hand from the pockets of the farmers to the extent of that additional £300,000 that was proposed in the circular of the 20th May last.</P>
    <P>This Bill, the Minister has told us, will mean the distribution of the same amount of money as would have been distributed otherwise under the old scheme.  His line has been that some will gain and some will lose.  I want to challenge the Minister on that and to say categorically that he is wrong.  I have been at some pains to get from various counties the figures of what <Col N="1934" /> those counties will receive under this Bill, and what they would have received if the legislation that was in existence on 31st March last had been re-enacted.  I have not got the figures for every county.  I have not got the figure for Cork and I will be glad to hear from Deputy Corry what that figure is.</P>

      <P>The Minister gave figures a second ago in his speech, showing that the position was the same.  I want to state categorically that if the Minister is right the local authorities throughout the country are wrong.  I am going to take each county down the line.  The estimate of the officials of the County Carlow County Council is that there will be a gain of £758 during the current year. In County Cavan, the Minister's own county, the official estimate is that there will be a loss of £863; that in County Clare this Bill will mean a loss <Col N="1935" /> of £8,793.  I have not got the figures for Cork and Donegal, but in County Dublin there will be a loss of £11,051.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In County Galway the official estimate is that there will be a loss of £13,139; that in County Kerry there will be approximately a gain of £1,000; that in County Kildare there will be a loss of £16,587; that in County Kilkenny there will be a loss of £2,371; that in Laois there will be a gain of £329; the ratepayers in Leitrim as the result of this Bill will find great solace, great benefit, because the official estimate of the effect of this Bill on the ratepayers of Leitrim is that they will gain a solitary £1; in County Limerick it will make a difference of £196 to the good; in County Longford it will mean a loss of £3,267; in County Louth it will mean a loss of £4,956.  I have not been able to get the figure for County Mayo, but in Meath it will mean a loss of £5,862; in Monaghan the loss will be £6,296; in Offaly the loss will be £4,817; in Roscommon they will receive under this Bill £4,425 less than they would have received if the legislation that expired on the 31st March last had been re-enacted; in Sligo the gain will be £343; in the North Riding of Tipperary the figure of loss is £4,060; in the South Riding of Tipperary the figure is £5,433; County Waterford, in Munster, will lose £13,562; Westmeath, in Leinster, will lose £16,324.  I have not got the figure for Wexford, but Wicklow will lose £646 6s. 9d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless my arithmetic is wrong, and I have had it checked, the total losses which I have just read out&mdash;the figures I gave were not my figures but were figures which the members of this Party obtained from the various local authorities in the constituencies they represent&mdash;amount to something over £122,400, and the total gains are approximately £2,400, leaving a net loss for those counties of £120,000.  I have just heard Deputy Blowick mention some figure for County Mayo.  I have not got any figure for that county. <Col N="1936" /> Deputy Browne, of this Party, was not able to get it from the officials there as they had not worked it out.  I am only giving figures which I am prepared to stand over.  They were furnished to members of this Party by the officials concerned, who had before them the basis on which they are going to have to applot the rates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are completely inaccurate.  The Deputy must have got them from the local Fine Gael executive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I got the figures from the secretaries of the respective county councils.  I mentioned a number of counties where the figures were not available to me.  In every other case, the figures which I read out were given officially to the members of this Party by the responsible local authority officer concerned, and he is the officer from whom the Minister himself said he had to get his information.  When I put down a question earlier this year asking for this information, I was told in the first instance, that the Minister would give the figures for each of the counties on the Second Reading of this Bill to-day.  He has failed to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made any such statement in this House at any time.

I claim that I made no such statement at any time in this House or outside of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

      <P>I have sent for a copy of the Official Report and when I get it we can read what is in it.  There was no doubt left on my mind as to what was the implication in what the Minister said.  There is, equally, no doubt in my mind that, whether the Minister said that or not at that time, it was his duty to-day to give the information officially to the House if he had it.  I suggest that he must have some information available to him when he contradicts the figures which I have given, and which have been supplied officially to members of my Party by the secretaries of the different county councils.</P>
      <P>I want to say categorically, so far as this Bill is concerned, that far from being merely, as the Minister has stated, a way of redistributing the existing sum&mdash;it is not so serious as was the intention when the circular was issued in May&mdash;it is still a method of ensuring a reduction from last year's basis in the allocation of the agricultural grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to show, in relation to this Bill, that it is not the Bill which the Minister alleged it was when he was bringing it in.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to save the Exchequer at the expense of the local rates that are going to be paid on agricultural land.  In that purpose, the Minister is merely following on the line that has already been set by his colleague, the Minister for Finance. It has, unfortunately, been the purpose in many things lately to shift the burden from central taxation to the local rates.  This Bill is going to continue that shift because, regardless of whether the figures for the present year which I have given are correct or not&mdash;I have said they have been obtained from the secretaries to the <Col N="1938" /> county councils&mdash;or whether the figures which the Minister has refused to disclose are correct, the fact is that every increase in rates in any county will mean, under this Bill, that there will be a reduction in the agricultural grant which would have been given if the legislation up to the 31st March last had been renewed.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the rates have been increasing.  It is unfortunate that that tendency is there.  All of us agree that the trend in regard to rates seems to be towards an increase.  The effect of this Bill will mean that, every time there is an increase in the rates, what the farmer-ratepayers will get by way of relief under this Bill will be less than what they would have got under the legislation that was in force prior to the 1st April last.  That is, of course, because the supplemental allowance was worked on a sliding scale in relation to rates, whereas now the employment allowance will be on a fixed basis and not on a sliding scale, having regard to the amount of the rates.  If the rates were to go down, it would mean that the local authorities would gain, but I am afraid few of us see much prospect of a reduction in the rates.  The likelihood is that the rates will tend to increase as they have been doing.</P>
      <P>So far as I could understand the meaning of what the Minister said in regard to Section 2, it was that he has a doubt as to whether the existing rate demands that have been struck are legal or not.  In that connection, I should like to know whether the Minister was merely referring to the credit note situation that will arise in respect of the additional £4.  Whether that is so or not does not affect the general principle, but the fact that the Minister delayed the introduction of his proposals, whatever these were going to be, until the 20th May, shows at best slackness and at worst indecision as to what was intended.  A very unnecessary amount of work was done then following the applotment of rates that had already taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further unnecessary pen-work will now have to be done by reason of credit notes that will have to be issued, all of which could have been avoided if <Col N="1939" /> the Minister had brought his proposals to the House in time.  The House knows that the existing legislation terminated on the 31st March last; that without some legislation there would not be any grant in relief of rates for the current year; that therefore if we are to oppose this Bill, if the Dáil does not pass this Bill on its Second Reading, it will mean that there will not be any relief in rates for agricultural land for the current year.  Because of that, it is clear that all of us must agree that the principle behind the Bill for the relief of agricultural land from a portion of the rates is a principle which we must all accept.  We of course accept that but on the Committee Stage, within the limits provided by the rules of order which prohibit Deputies other than Ministers from putting down amendments which involved a charge on public funds, we shall submit to the House certain amendments, and particularly an amendment for the continuation of relief which is in existence and which it is purported to remove by sub-section (1) of Section 1 of this Bill before the House, in regard to supplementary allowances.</P>
    <P>We have here&mdash;I want to be quite fair to the Minister&mdash;the question of the 27th October last in which I asked the Minister for Local Government if the amount payable to each local authority under the Bill now circulated would be the same as it would have been if last year's system had been continued.  The Minister then made it clear that he had not the information available in the Department and that it could be supplied only by the local authorities concerned.  I suggested a second ago that the Minister said then that he would circulate that information on the Second Reading of the Bill.  That is not correct.  I think that must have been in regard to a question I asked in July about the cost of his circulars because he did give that reply in regard to some question I asked him.  But he is quite correct in stating he did not give that reply in regard to the question I asked on the 27th October last.  It does not <Col N="1940" /> excuse him from giving the information to-day.</P>

They were the people whom the Minister said would be the only people able to give the information. On that basis, excluding the Counties of Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Wexford, it means that £120,000 less is being given in relation to rates this year than would have been given if last year's legislation were renewed <Col N="1941" /> and re-enacted.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a great pity that the Minister in his opening statement could not have given us the figures which Deputy Sweetman gave us.  After all a Minister in control of a Department has opportunities over and above those of a private Deputy and it seems quite unreasonable to suggest that the Minister in introducing a Bill such as this, a Bill that is bound to be controversial, could not have given us the facts, and all the facts as he was in a position to obtain them.  Since he has not given us the facts, we in the Opposition have got to try to make it crystal clear to the Minister and to those on the benches behind who are supporting him, that this Bill is not acceptable to the farmers of Ireland and is not going to be of benefit to the economic position of the country and to production generally.  It is a bad Bill.  It is an ill-conceived Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman has made it clear that we on this side of the House will not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill because the purpose of it is to make a belated attempt to give the farmers that which they should have had since 31st March last.  I can see no reason why there was not a continuation of the state of affairs that existed then and the Minister has given no reason as to why this Bill was not introduced six months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, if the Minister intended to make a change in the rates position as applicable to agricultural land he could have worked out his scheme with the assistance of his advisers beforehand and then come in <Col N="1942" /> here and given us the detailed statement to which we, as public representatives, are entitled.  I take it other Deputies have had experiences similar to mine, irrespective of whether they are sitting on this side of the House or on the Government Benches; I am sure they have had innumerable letters from their constituents asking if it is legal for the Minister to do what he proposes to do in asking the farmers to pay the full rate.  The position would appear to be that it is legal.  Quite frankly, I think it is sharp practice, and nothing more.</P>
    <P>The Minister is himself a farmer. Most of us here are farmers.  Anyone concerned with or associated in any way with land knows that it is essential for farmers to make arrangements well in advance.  If there is one profession in the world in which it is necessary to plan not only one year in advance but several years in advance, it is farming and for that reason the farmer is entitled to know what his charges and his costings for the ensuing year, or years, will be.</P>
    <P>I submit to the House&mdash;I think it is a fair submission&mdash;that the farmers have no indication from the Minister or from the Government as to what their rateable charges will be in the coming year.  I know that that is so because of the letters I have received from my constituents in relation to this matter.  Deputy Sweetman has given the House certain figures.  The Minister has said that those figures are inaccurate.  I do not know whether or not they are accurate but they have come from the only source from which it is possible to procure such figures. They were obtained from the secretaries of the local authorities who replied to Deputy Sweetman.  I fail to see why all the secretaries of all the local authorities should not have answered Deputy Sweetman.  It is our function and purpose here to debate Bills that come before the House.  We are not a pack of yes-men.  We are entitled to offer our opinion.  As the main Opposition Party we are entitled to receive the courtesy of a reply from local authorities when they are written to by Deputy Sweetman on behalf of this party.  There was a certain amount of sneering on the Government <Col N="1943" /> Benches because certain county councils did reply.  As a responsible Deputy I assert that every local authority should have replied, the more so as we did not have any information from the Minister and the only means left to us of obtaining the information we required was through the medium of the local authorities themselves.  It would have considerably simplified this debate if we had had replies from every local authority.  Those that we have had speak for themselves.  The farmers will lose approximately £120,000 this year.  That is a hypothetical figure. They may lose a great deal more than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was an accurate figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew it would not be long before Deputy Allen interrupted. If Deputy Allen would keep quiet for a few moments and allow me to develop my argument we would get on more rapidly.  I am sure Deputy Allen will give us a discourse later on local government affairs which will enthrall this House.  The only people who are in a position to produce a figure are the secretaries of the local authorities.  That figure is a hypothetical figure.  It is hypothetical because the Minister is basing his claim in relation to this Bill on the fact that it will give more employment. That is one reason why the figure is a hypothetical one.  He is also founding this Bill on the fact that the rates will remain static.  Does any Deputy believe that the rates will remain static?  Has it not been acknowledged by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare that the rates will go up by 2/- in the £ as a result of the Health Act?  That, again, is a hypothetical figure.  The figures we have procured&mdash;we should have had these figures from every local authority &mdash;are hypothetical for two reasons: they are based on the assumption that the rates will remain static; and, secondly, that the level of employment will remain static.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who will be hit most by this Bill? The bigger farmers will lose most.  It is, of course, good political tactics to <Col N="1944" /> hit the bigger farmer and commend the small man.  Up and down the country we have heard public appeals by Ministers for increased production. Who is the man who bears the heaviest load in agricultural production? Who is the man who takes the biggest risk?  Who produces most?  It is the big farmer.  Who is the man who will lose most by this?  It is the big farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Definitely, in proportion to the number of acres he holds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, because the small farmer is himself a working farmer.  In the main, the major portion of agricultural employment is provided on the bigger holdings. I am not now arguing the case of the big farmer as against the small farmer.  It may be economic to have more small farms.  It may be the policy of Fianna Fáil to seize the large farms and break them up.  But, if it is, there has not been much sign of that policy being implemented during the years in which Fianna Fáil has been in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last analysis we depend on what we can produce and what we can sell.  The cities and towns depend for their very existence on what the farmers can produce and sell.  This Bill will take money out of the pockets of the farmers and, irrespective of whether it will take that money from the big farmer or the small farmer, it is sharp practice and nothing else.  The one-fifth remission is to go.  Originally the allowance ceiling was £13.  That is now to be raised to £17 as a result of public outcry.  Deputy Sweetman stated to-day that that increase was given because of the by-election and for no other reason.  Is there any guarantee that that £17 will encourage the farmers to employ more labour? Is there any guarantee that it will force them to employ more labour? The more we can put into employment <Col N="1945" /> on the land the better it will be.  Is there any indication, judging by the trend of circumstances, that more people will be employed on the land? There is no indication of that and there is no indication that this Bill will confer any benefit on the agricultural community as a whole.  There is no reason for removing the one-fifth allowance <i>qua</i> agricultural rates relief over the £20 valuation figure unless it is that the Government wants to save money or hold more money back in order to devote it to other purposes.</P>
    <P>There is no use in Ministers going about the country paying lip-service to agriculture.  There is no point in the Government's attitude in relation to this Bill.  I said in the beginning that we were entitled to proper information on this Bill.  We have not got that information and we have a very strong suspicion, when all is said and done, that it will not be a question of £120,000 being taken away from the farmers; it may be a far bigger sum than that.</P>
    <P>What every agricultural worker wants and what I would like to see him getting is employment the whole year round.  The more the overhead burden on the farming community is relieved the more employment will be created. That is common sense.  This Bill, it is stated, is designed for that purpose. Personally I cannot see it.  The best thing that the Minister could do would be to restore the one-fifth allowance which he has taken off so that the farmers may know where they stand. I repeat that if it were not for the pressure exerted by this Party, and the fact that we showed the people throughout the country what was behind this scheme, the Minister would not now be offering the farming community the reliefs he is offering them to-day.</P>

      <P>I interrupted Deputy Sweetman's statement about gains and losses by various counties.  I was not present for his opening statement but I understood that he said that Kerry would gain £1,000 under the arrangement. <Col N="1946" /> I am not clear as to whether he meant that the ratepayers would gain £1,000 under the original arrangement or under this new arrangement.  The Deputy read out a list, I understand, giving the advantages and disadvantages to the ratepayers in each county under the previous legislation and this new legislation.  Am I to understand that the Deputy stated that Kerry would gain £1,000 under the old arrangement?  If that is the statement made, I would question it.  At our county council meeting last Monday, there was a motion put down by Mr. M. J. O'Connell as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That we consider the effect of the Government's decision to reduce the agricultural grant in Kerry.</P>
      <P>In reply to that, the county manager allowed the county secretary to make a statement that we would lose £6,000 under the previous arrangement made by the Minister.  How does that contrast with Deputy Sweetman's statement that we would gain £1,000?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I contradicted the county manager's statement and the secretary's statement and that of the <Col N="1947" /> mover of the motion by saying that this legislation was being put through in the same financial year as the year for which we were considering the rate in Kerry and that the county manager was not yet in a position to say whether he would have a loss or otherwise, before the end of the financial year.  I stated at the meeting on Monday that we did not have a loss because our valuations are, comparatively speaking, low valuations.  I made the case that before final figures could be produced by the county manager, even if we did have a loss, the new legislation would be retrospective and the whole position would be readjusted. They seemed to realise as a result of my statement that they could not make a bald statement to the effect that the ratepayers would lose £6,000 as a result of the arrangement made by the Department some time ago.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I say that this camouflage, as I call it, this propaganda, is of no service to the ratepayers.  It is misrepresentation of the position as between this arrangement and the previous arrangement in order to gain a political point.  In counties like Kerry, where the valuations are low as compared with other counties the circumstances are different.  I was amazed that any county manager or county secretary would give a definite figure of a loss of £6,000 when he was not in a position to have the whole period under review and the whole question examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one important matter that concerns Kerry which I would mention to the Minister in the hope that he may be able to do something about it in this legislation or at a later date as a result of this legislation.  The farmers in Kerry have been agitating for years for some adjustment of the employment period.  It is a well-known fact that in our county and in other southern counties farmers cannot get employees to give the full 12 months' period of employment.  The nearest we can get to it is a nine or ten months' period, and under the arrangement if they cannot at the end of the year show through their returns and through their statements and all the rest of it <Col N="1948" /> that they have been employed by the farmers concerned for the full 12 months' period, that allowance cannot be granted and no allowance in respect of their work can be granted.</P>
    <P>What I have been asked to do and to make representations to the Minister on is to ask if an arrangement could be made that where a farmer can show that he has a man employed for ten months of the year he would get the necessary allowance in respect of that employee.  A number of farmers were unable to avail of any concessions that were available in the ordinary way owing to this position.  That is the system.  We realise that it was no fault of the Government or the Department concerned that this occurred, but owing to our system.  It may be a peculiar system, and I understand that it does not obtain in County Dublin, where the employment period is the full 12 months, but in Kerry, in any case, that is the position.  I would be grateful if the Minister would examine that. Perhaps it cannot be done now under this special arrangement and under this legislation, but nevertheless I think that it is more or less appropriate to mention it now in the passing through of this proposal, and that is all I have to say at the moment.</P>
    <P>We appreciate what the Minister has done for us under this proposal, and despite the misrepresentation and statements that have been made about his actions in regard to the loss to the ratepayers I think there is no justification for it.  The facts will prove and have proved that, as I have stated the case here, Deputy Sweetman when it suits him up here will make a certain statement and down in Kerry his colleagues and his friends will make a different statement, and when you examine both of them you have only to come to the one conclusion, that it is a distortion of the facts and misrepresentation.</P>

      <P>He had already calmly submitted to the reduction in the Local Authorities (Works) Act of £250,000 which might go some way towards assisting the farmers to offset any further charge.  He had accepted that weakly.  He was then entitled, I submit, as Minister for Local Government to insist that no further demands would be made on the farming community. I would like to say now that I think there is a terribly erroneous feeling in this country with regard to the position of the farming community. There are people in this country who believe that the farmers are rolling in wealth.  I do not want to suggest that the farmers are not pretty well off but I do say that the present price obtaining for live stock is not yielding the returns to the farmers which many people believe, because while it is true to say that the farmer gets good prices for his live stock which he has to sell, he must replace that stock at considerably enhanced prices and his margin of profit is not what the prices obtained would indicate.  If the Government imagine that they can come along and put further burdens on the farming community <i>ad lib.</i> they are making a very serious mistake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned mainly with the effects of this Bill in my own county, and from the information which was put at my disposal yesterday we will lose approximately £5,000 in Roscommon. It is true to say that the larger <Col N="1950" /> farmers will suffer that loss, but I want to make this clear, that the larger and middle-sized farmers in any event make the greatest contribution.  They make the main contribution to the social services, from many of which they themselves can derive no benefit. That has always been my attitude in regard to this whole question.  The middle class farmers who will be hit most by this legislation are the men in many instances who will not qualify for any of the benefits for which the Government claim so much credit in their social welfare services, but on the other hand they must finance it.  I do not think that is just or fair.</P>
    <P>I want to say quite frankly that I do not think the increase in the employment allowance, especially in this part of the year, is going to mean any benefit at all to the larger farmers, because it is well known now that any farmer who really is intelligent and serious about farming is every year mechanising his farm more and more and dispensing with employing labour, and it is not likely that he will derive any benefit whatsoever from the increased allowances in many instances.</P>
    <P>I want to say in that connection that I have always felt it was grossly unfair to confine that employment allowance to males only.  I think the Act worked very unfairly, because in many instances a man has two or three daughters and no son and those daughters do good work on the farm and are still doing it, but there is no employment allowance for them.  I think that the Act should be made applicable to any male or female employed on a holding to give some compensation to the man not in a position to claim for an adult worker.</P>
    <P>I do agree with Deputy Flynn on the point which he has raised in connection with the man who does not employ a man the whole year round. It might impress the Minister if I tell him that in my county there was a man who had a regular workman employed during the first months of the year&mdash;from the 1st January until 3rd May last year.  On the 3rd May his workman left him and he was unable to get a permanent man until the 1st June, and because of that and although <Col N="1951" /> he had a casual workman employed he was deprived of his whole 52 weeks' employment rebate.  When he brought the matter to the attention of the county council, they said that if he supplied the name of the casual workman who was employed they would consider the matter, and he did.  He sent in the name of the casual workman, but when they discovered that that workman's valuation was over £5, they disallowed the rebate.  I think that is sheer absurdity.  I believe we could alter this Act very sensibly by allowing a <i>pro rata</i> remission&mdash;that in the case where a man is employed for six months the farmer should get 50 per cent. of the rebate and if he worked nine months, 75 per cent.  I think it is unreasonable to deprive the employer of the full rebate because he has not his man in continuous employment from the 1st January to 31st December.  It is most inequitable and unjust, and I hope that an amendment I intend to put forward will be allowed by the Chair so that the Minister will be in a position under the Bill to use his discretion and deal fairly and equitably with those men.  I want to say in conclusion that we of this Party are entirely disappointed at the introduction of this measure, because we feel it is a further attempt to put more liabilities and burdens on the farming community, and for that reason we are opposing it.</P>

      <P>We have had this pattern of legislation for some years past, and although the Minister is making certain changes in the Bill this year on the whole the Bill follows the general pattern of our rates legislation so far as agriculture is concerned. But observing the operation of this Act up to the moment and listening to some of the speeches here to-day, I am tempted to ask whether, in fact, we get any real value from legislation based on the principles set out in this Bill.  Under the Bill approximately £5,000,000 will be spent by the State in the relief of rates on agricultural land. Five million pounds is a very substantial amount of money, a sum which would more than service a loan of £100,000,000.  I wonder if we are getting <Col N="1952" /> any adequate return by paying out that £5,000,000 a year on the basis that we assume&mdash;and it is the most facile and unwarrantable assumption I know&mdash;that the paying out of this large sum does in fact make the farmer employ labour which he would not otherwise employ?  The present allowance is £6 10s. for every adult worker employed the whole year round, that is 2/6 per week.  Does anybody imagine that a farmer employs a man for 52 weeks and pays him £4 per week for the privilege of getting 2/6 per week in return by way of relief on rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not cost £5,000,000 a year to pay that 2/6 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This whole legislation is based on the assumption that agriculture needs to be assisted and one of the devices adopted for that purpose is to give the farmer £6 10s. by way of relief for every man he employs. No man employs an agricultural worker because he gets 2/6 a week rebate.  He employs a man simply because he wants him, simply because he cannot do without him.  The man would still be in the market place if the farmer did not need him and he would never be induced to employ a man merely because he gets 2/6 a week for relief in his rates.  I do not think we can get any really effective return from the payment of this £5,000,000.</P>
      <P>Quite frankly, I think that if we were to float a national loan for £100,000,000, buy £100,000,000 worth of fertilisers and say to the farmers: &ldquo;Here is £100,000,000 worth of fertilisers free&rdquo; in lieu of this £5,000,000, at the end of 20 years we would have better farmers than you are likely to get by pouring out this £5,000,000 every year because it is putting nothing positive into the land. It is making no special contribution to the small farmer who, because of his financially impoverished condition, is not farming his land; he is quarrying it.  He is taking everything he can out of the land but he is putting nothing back into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think from every point of view it would be better to buy, say, £5,000,000 <Col N="1953" /> worth of fertilisers, load it into aeroplanes, and drop it at random on the soil of the country.  The farmer, who at present cannot afford to buy fertilisers, would have a better farm by a process of that kind than he is ever likely to have on the basis of paying him 2/6 a week for every man he employs.  I think there might have been a more thorough examination of the whole problem and that some effort might have been made to ensure that this £5,000,000 would be used in a way which would bring us some return from the land and that it would not be used in the money-changing sense, on the facile assumption that we are in some way aiding agriculture. I doubt very much if it does aid agriculture. I think substantial evidence can be produced to show that, in fact, it renders practically no assistance to the agricultural industry as a production unit in the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>The assumption in the existing legislation and in this Bill is that because of the aid given in respect to the employment of labour, farmers will be tempted to employ more workers but the facts show that in the 12 months between June, 1952, and June, 1953, more than 21,000 people have left the land.  There has been a bigger decline in the employment on the land between June, 1952, and June, 1953, than in any similar period in the last 30 years. Notwithstanding that fact, we still proceed on the assumption, because we prefer not to think about it, that a Bill of this kind induces the farmer to employ more labour than would otherwise be employed.  I do not think that one additional person will be employed as a result of this Bill.  A farmer will only employ a person because he needs his services.  If a farmer puts down on the one hand what it costs him for wages and, on the other hand, the relief he gets under the Bill, I do not think he is going to be attracted by the microscopic subsidy he gets towards the employment of agricultural labour.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I think the farmer might be assisted in other ways, in ways that would certainly enhance the value and the productivity of his land. If, however, there is to be any <Col N="1954" /> emphasis in respect of where the money is to go, I agree that that emphasis should be put on the employment of labour.  In so far as the Bill does that, I think it is preferable to have the emphasis on the employment of labour than on the mere ownership of land unrelated to the employment of labour. I still doubt whether, in fact, a Bill of this kind does make a real contribution towards providing additional employment but, in so far as anybody believes it does, I am completely out of step with the viewpoints expressed by Deputy Flynn and Deputy Finan in the course of the discussion.</P>
    <P>One of the most detestable things about agriculture is the casual nature of the employment in the industry. Agricultural workers are employed when the farmer wants them and they are &ldquo;fired&rdquo; when the farmer does not want them.  That may be due to the type of agriculture we follow, it may be due in some measure to the size of our holdings but the plain fact is that the agricultural worker has got to live for 52 weeks in the year.  You cannot say to the agricultural worker: &ldquo;I have got nine months' work for you.  I will pay you wages for nine months but you can go and hibernate for the other three months and keep your wife and children for these three months as best you can.&rdquo;  The agricultural labourer has got to live for these three months and he must get some wages, otherwise he will have to be maintained by the State.  Anything that puts a premium on the casualisation of employment in agriculture will beget my fiercest opposition.  I think, therefore, the view expressed by Deputy Finan and Deputy Flynn was short-sighted. Anything which would put a premium on putting off the agricultural worker with less than 12 months' work in the year, in other words, casual employment, is something that should not be tolerated by this House.</P>

      <P>I should like to see an individual who makes that assertion brought before some tribunal and examined with regard to it.  I refuse to believe that a fellow will not work in Roscommon but that he will go to work in Birmingham to face all the evils associated with employment in large industrial cities.  I think if you give him decent wages he will work here.  If he is not getting decent wages, he is a free man and he is entitled to go to work wherever he likes.  At all events there is a residue of 70,000 unemployed in this country and, so long as you have that residue, you cannot at the same time plead that you have an insufficiency of labour. I hope the Minister will set his face against any proposal which would aid the casualisation of agricultural employment by giving an employment allowance for employment of less than 12 months' duration.  Every effort should be made to step up the amount of employment which the agricultural worker gets each year and the immediate aim ought to be to try to get regular employment for the agricultural worker in the same way as the industrial worker can, in the main, secure that type of employment.  It <Col N="1956" /> is because of the fact that work in agriculture is so often casual that the agricultural workers leave the rural areas and go into the towns where they look for jobs in industry or in commerce because they know that there is regular employment in these jobs as distinct from the casual character of their employment in agriculture.</P>
      <P>There is no question at this stage of voting against this Bill because to do so would be completely to deny agriculture all the benefit which it has had for years and which it still requires.  But there is a good case, not from the point of view of the farmers in this county or in that county, but from the over-all national point of view for examining this question of aiding agriculture through this medium with a view to seeing whether we could not find some better scheme which would put something more positive into the land and enable us to take out of it a greater volume of production for the nation and a greater return for the farmer who owns the land.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman has indicated that it is his intention to support this Bill.  We may take it, therefore, that the Bill will be unanimously approved of by the House.  That is all to the good.  But it does seem rather peculiar that the official organ of the Fine Gael Party, or should we call it the Fine Gael <i>Izvestia,</i> describes this Bill in very large type as a bitter pill for ratepayers.  It appears now that the Fine Gael Party have decided to impose this bitter pill on the ratepayers. I think, however, that Deputies who view this matter fairly, impartially and objectively will acknowledge that it is not a bitter pill.  The Minister indicated that there will be gains and losses in regard to this alteration of the allocation of the agricultural grant as between individual ratepayers and as between counties, but that these gains and losses will balance out and that the relief given this year will be equal to that which would have been given under the previous arrangement which was first introduced in the 1946 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm to consider this matter fairly, leaving these little eruptions of <Col N="1957" /> Party feeling on the Opposition side out of account.  It is no harm to consider whether this Bill does or does not improve the allocation of the agricultural grant.  I hold that it does definitely improve the allocation.  It gives greater relief to the man who gives the maximum of employment. The man who provides reasonable employment, not excessive employment, on his holding will gain very substantially by this Bill, and the man who refuses to give employment and who thinks he can sit back and forget that there are other citizens living in this country, forget that he has neighbours with children and ignore their wants will lose something under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us examine how this Bill affects the ordinary farmer with a valuation of £120.  The first £20 of that valuation will not be affected in any way.  There is a three-fifths rebate of rates on the first £20 valuation regardless of the size of the holding or of the valuation. Under the previous legislation the farmer would get a rebate of £30 or one-fifth of the rates on the remaining £100 of valuation, assuming the rates would be 30/- in the £.  Now under this Bill he will lose that supplementary allowance. Instead of that, he will gain £10 10s. in respect of each man employed. Where he formerly got £6 10s. he will now get £17.  If a farmer employs three men, on £100 of his valuation he will receive £31 10s. over and above what he would have got under the previous legislation.  In other words, he will lose £30 and he will gain £31 10s.  That is the position of an ordinary farmer giving, not an excessive amount of employment, but just the minimum employment that would be required to carry on a holding valued at £120.</P>
    <P>Somebody may say that three men per £100 valuation represent a very high rate of employment.  I wonder will anyone be so foolish as to suggest that.  In the ordinary course of events we do not refer to our own business, but it is in regard to our own farming operations that we can speak with authority.  I have an agricultural valuation of £75 and I employ three men. I find I could not carry on that farm <Col N="1958" /> with fewer than three men, or one man per £25 valuation.  I think a farm would not be worked efficiently or well with a lesser number.  So that the farmer who employs one man per £30 valuation is not giving excessive employment. If he wants to farm intensively, he has to employ more, and if he employs four men per £100 valuation he will gain £18 10s. as a result of that.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that any farmer might employ an additional man simply and solely because of the relief given under this Bill or under the previous Act.  There is, however, always the question of giving encouragement to the man who is doing the right thing and this Bill certainly does that.  For example, a man may be weighing in his mind whether he will till a little more extensively and employ an additional man or carry more live stock for the winter and employ an additional man.  If he knows that he will get £17 additional, it will help him to decide on giving that additional employment.  That is where the merit lies in this Bill.  But even if it did not have that effect, it would still be desirable in justice and in fair play to give the maximum amount of relief to the man who is giving the maximum amount of employment. That is the chief merit of this Bill.  I was glad to see that Deputy Norton accepted that point.  I would compliment him on his approaching the Bill in a fair and reasonable way, although I profoundly disagree with the majority of the points he made.  He asked whether it is right or proper to go on paying out of the Exchequer £5,000,000 per year for the relief of rates.  I would like to indicate to him that it is not quite as simple as that.  Rateable valuations on land are high, having regard to its income producing capacity.  The whole idea of the initiation of this agricultural grant was to offset the injustice to agriculture through the relatively high valuation of agricultural land, having regard to its income earning capacity.  Therefore, it is not a question of a subsidy to help agriculture but a question of doing justice to agriculture. The allocation of this £5,000,000 is an attempt to offset an <Col N="1959" /> injustice which was found to exist in the rating system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton suggested we might do better by borrowing £100,000,000 and dumping it on the land in the form of fertilisers.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy Norton.  He probably expressed the view in good faith but it shows a lamentable ignorance of the use of fertilisers.  If you dump a very large quantity of fertilisers in one year you are not going to reap a reward over a considerable number of years.  They tend to operate only for a very short period.  Modern agricultural science indicates that the farmer should seek to use fertilisers with a view to getting the utmost value within one season.  In fact, the suggestion that ordinary fertilisers other than lime would have a life of over one or two years at the outside is quite a mistake.  In addition to that, fertilisers can be applied only on the basis of a scientific soil analysis. Therefore we have to take it that it is desirable to allocate this £5,000,000 per year to equalise or help to equalise the burden of taxation as between agriculture and the rest of the community. It is not a question of giving a dole to the mendicant farmer or anything like that but of spreading the burden of taxation as fairly as possible over the community.</P>
    <P>Having decided that this £5,000,000 ought to be allocated to agriculture, the next question is to decide the fairest method of allocation.  As far as the first £20 is concerned I think it is generally agreed that the three-fifths rebate is a fairly substantial benefit, and that three-fifths rebate is being continued under this Bill.  A farmer under £20 valuation is not affected in the slightest way by the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to a farmer over £20 valuation, he will gain substantially by the Bill provided he is able to employ one man to every £30 of his valuation over £20.  That is to say, a farmer of £50 valuation employing one man will gain slightly by the Bill.  If he happens to employ two men on a £50 or £60 valuation he will gain fairly substantially. <Col N="1960" /> Is there anything wrong with the principle that the man who is farming his land intensively and giving the maximum amount of employment on the land should get the maximum benefit that is provided by the State for the relief of rates?</P>

      <P>It is a sound principle to help the man who is helping the country by providing employment.  The whole campaign which has been waged against the Bill by Fine Gael, a campaign of misrepresentation, is utterly harmful.  Surely our most important asset is the land&mdash;and land is no use unless it is worked.  Is it not a reasonable suggestion that a farmer who employs one man to every 30 acres of good land&mdash;that is all that is provided for in the Bill&mdash;should gain, whereas a man who does not do so will lose? There is a big principle involved.  We have a limited acreage&mdash;12,000,000 acres&mdash;of agricultural land.  It should be the aim of any Government to see that that land is utilised to the best advantage.  Socially, it is desirable to ensure that every 20 or 30 acres are supporting a family.  We know a family can live on a farm of £30 valuation. They are living on it in many cases. Here in this country and all over the world there are bishops, judges and other people in prominent positions in Church and State who were reared on farms of £30 valuation.  Therefore, there is nothing wrong with the suggestion that such a farm will not provide enough to pay the wages of one man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill seeks to ensure that the farmer who employs one man to every additional £30 of his valuation will gain by the allocation of the agricultural grant.  A man who employs less than that will lose.  The man who employs no one on a £500 to £700 valuation farm will lose substantially&mdash; there is no doubt about that.  The suggestion was made by Deputy Esmonde that this Bill is designed to hit the big farmer.  It is not; it will help him.  I know big farmers of £400 or £500 valuation employing men and farming intensively.  They will gain substantially by this change in the distribution of the agricultural grant, as <Col N="1961" /> they are employing more than one man to every £30 of their valuation.  This Bill does not hit the big farmer but hits the farmer, big or small, who refuses to give employment.  It hits the selfish man who says: &ldquo;I can make a living for myself on the land without regard to my neighbours, without regard to my country, without regard to anyone else and without trying to help to give employment and I refuse to employ any workers on my land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is true that that man will be adversely affected by this Bill.  However, such men are in a very small minority in the farming community. Most of our farmers, big and small, try to provide the maximum employment on their holdings.  They try to get the most they can out of their holdings and to improve them.  In my opinion, it is impossible to work a farm of even £75 valuation with less than three men.  It is impossible to work a farm of £25 valuation without one man, even with the aid of modern machinery. Of course that is provided you are growing a fair acreage of beet and a fair acreage of wheat and that you are growing feeding stuffs for your live stock.  If you are doing that, then not alone are you working your farm well and in your own interests, but you are also doing a service to your country. You will find that it is necessary to employ at least one man for every £25 of your valuation.  If you do that, you will gain substantially by this change in the allocation of agricultural grants.</P>
    <P>The general principle of the Bill is sound.  It is a marked improvement on the 1946 Act and the 1946 Act was an improvement on previous legislation. This Bill will give that little incentive that is needed to the man who is doing the right thing.  This Bill will encourage him.  He is not employing labour merely in order to get the £6 10s., as the amount formerly was, or the £17 provided under this Bill: he believes in giving good employment and he believes in working his land to the best advantage.  That farmer will get an increase of £10 10s. per man in the allowance.  That represents a substantial gain.</P>
    <P>There are some minor matters in regard to this Bill upon which I should <Col N="1962" /> like to comment.  Under the 1946 Act, an allowance of 10/- in the £ was provided in respect of each man employed, with a maximum of £6 10s.  An allowance of £6 10s. was provided in respect of each man.  Now, there is no question of any allowance in the £. What we have instead is a clear and straightforward allowance of £17 per man employed.  Take, for the sake of example, a farmer with a valuation of £30, who employs one man. Assuming that the rate is 30/- in the £, the rate over and above the first £20 would be £15.  Over and above the first £20, the rate in the £ on his valuation would be £15.  Under this Bill, that £15 will be completely wiped out. In other words, the farmer will be completely derated in respect of every £ over the first £20 of his valuation&mdash; that is, assuming that his valuation does not exceed £30 or £31.  Under this Bill, the valuation of a number of farmers will be completely derated for the first time since this type of relief was introduced.  I think that that is rather a good thing.  There may be some little inequities as between different valuations but, on the whole, I think the man whose valuation is between £20 and £40, and who has a grown-up son, or who employs a worker, will gain very substantially inasmuch as every £ of his valuation over the first £20 will be completely derated.  It is no harm to stress the fact that in this Bill we have for the first time in legislation a measure of complete derating.</P>

      <P>I think we may take it that when the rate collector, on his visits, goes around handing out money to the ratepayers, we will have reached Utopian conditions.  I do not think that that stage is in sight at the moment.  However, it is no harm for the farmer to know that if he employs a sufficient number of men in proportion to the size of his holding he can have a substantial portion of his holding derated.  Of course, it is only on very intensively worked farms that that would be effective.  Some people farm very intensively and they must, therefore, keep a considerable number of man.  There are other smallish farmers with valuations of £40 or £50 who may have grown-up sons working and helping them.  They have no rates to pay on that portion of their farm over £20.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal now with one or two smaller points mentioned by some Deputies.  Deputy Finan, Deputy Norton and Deputy Flynn mentioned casual labour.  Farmers have always felt a grievance because they do not get any abatement in respect of short-time workers, weekly workers or workers employed at piece rates.  I think that the main objective of this Bill, as of previous legislation, is to encourage the employment of workers all the year round.  Everybody will agree that that is a good objective. As Deputy Norton pointed out, the workers have to live during the 52 weeks of the year.  In so far as it is possible for a farmer so to organise his work as to provide employment for his workers over the whole year, it is all to the good.  Between the termination of a worker's employment and the re-employment of another worker in his place, there is often a gap of a few weeks.  In that connection, I think it would be no harm if there were a provision in the Bill to allow for a period of three or four weeks, so that a farmer who has lost the services of one man could get a little time in which to employ another.  A farmer who employs a man for at least 11 months of the year should be entitled to qualify as giving full-time employment to his worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the matter of the age qualification.  I have not checked up <Col N="1964" /> on this, but I understand that a claim for abatement can be made in respect of a paid worker between the ages of 16 and 70.  If a member of the farmer's own family is working with him on the farm, abatement can be claimed only in respect of the ages 17 to 70. If that is so, I feel that the Bill should put the farmer's son on the same footing as the agricultural worker and that there should be abatement in respect of every worker over the age of 16.</P>
    <P>There may be some minor amendments which it might be possible to introduce in connection with this Bill: I do not know.  On the whole, the Bill is fundamentally sound and represents a substantial improvement on existing legislation.  It marks the beginning, I should say, of a concentrated movement on the part of the State to give the maximum amount of encouragement, incentive, protection and aid to the man giving the maximum amount of employment, and that is a very substantial advance.</P>
    <P>It is not true, as some Deputies have suggested, that mechanisation will eliminate the agricultural worker.  I believe that the good farmer can keep as many workers on his holding with mechanisation as without it but the change he will make in his agricultural operations is that he will farm his land more intensively, increasing the area under cultivation and relying more on home-produced feeding stuffs than on imported feeding stuffs.  In that way, he will ensure continued remunerative employment for his workers.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note that this Bill, so far as we have heard up to the present, is being unanimously accepted by the House, and it is also gratifying to note that the campaign directed against the Bill has completely broken down and that those who sought to represent the change as something in the nature of injustice to the farming community have been shown up as being very foolish indeed.  Those who condemned this Bill were merely condemning the employment of additional workers on the land.  We have an outcry about the reduction of employment on the land and about the flight from the land of our male agricultural <Col N="1965" /> workers, and, if we are sincere in deploring that, and most Deputies are, irrespective of the side of the House on which they sit, we ought at least do something to offset it, to give encouragement to the man who is trying to maintain the existing number of employees on the land or to increase the number of employees on his holding.</P>
    <P>The flight from the land did not happen only under the present Government. It happened under the previous Government also.  It was very marked during the years of the inter-Party Government and I commented on it at that time.  It is still a marked feature of our economic position.  It has got to be tackled and this Bill is a move in the right direction.  The tendency of workers to get away from the land is not confined to this country; it has been noted in most other European countries, and, I suppose, in every civilised country in the world.  In Denmark, Holland and other countries, however, the number of employees per 1,000 acres is much greater than the number here, so we cannot afford to be complacent in regard to the reduction in employment on the land.  That being so, we must welcome the Bill and give it, not the grudging support which some Opposition Deputies have given it, but our wholehearted and enthusiastic support.</P>

      <P>This Bill is an improvement on the Bill envisaged in the Minister's circular of May last, and, in so far as it is an improvement on that Bill, I support it.  I am glad the Minister has gone some way to remedy the weaknesses involved in the scheme outlined in that circular, but there is still one very objectionable feature in this new Bill.  Under the old system, there was an abatement of rates of one-fifth, on the basis of the supplementary grant, of rates over £20 and the fact that the Exchequer had to contribute one-fifth of the rates, no matter what the size of the rate, had a deterring effect on the sending by Ministers of Orders to county councils, corporations and other local authorities instructing them to incur certain expenditure which eventually went on the rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>On rates over £20, the Government had the responsibility of contributing one-fifth.  The rates are progressively increasing and we can expect further increases next year when the health scheme charges come into operation.  The Government now, however, more or less fix the amount they will pay by way of this grant and as the rates are rising progressively, and, so far as we can see, will continue to rise, there will be no deterrent to the sending down of Orders to local authorities to increase rates and transfer certain commitments which should be national charges to the rates.  I do not like that feature of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I support the suggestions made by Deputies Flynn and Finan with regard to the period of employment.  I agree that every help should be given to the farmer who gives full-time employment but there will be cases of men who will not be able to get an employee for one week.  He may have six employees for six weeks but unless he can show that he has a man employed for each of the 52 weeks he will get no credit in respect of the payment he has made in wages to that employee, even though he may have had six or seven men employed for three months as well.  At times it is impossible to replace an employee within a week and I think some provision should be made in the Bill for cases in which it is obvious that it is the intention of the employer, and that he has done his best, to employ a man but through circumstances outside his control a week or two weeks elapse before he can get a man.  That employer should be given the benefit of the allowances.</P>
      <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Sweetman saying that a member of his Party had succeeded in getting a good deal of information from local authorities.  I am a member of a county council but when I asked for certain information from that council I was told that the council could give information only to the Minister or to the chairman.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton spoke about paying out £5,000,000 a year to the farmers.  Actually, this is only an effort to give back to the farmers some of the money that was taken from them.  Considerable sums of money are collected from the farming community by way of rates.  We collect about £30,000,000 each year in tariffs which are eventually paid by the farming community.  The cost of production and <Col N="1968" /> cost of living have increased because the farmers have to buy their products behind a tariff wall.  In addition to that, Deputy Norton should remember that in the Six Counties and in Britain there is derating of agricultural land. The £5,000,000 he referred to is to permit the farmers to continue in production. It is an effort to prevent the killing of the goose that lays the golden egg.  I think Deputy Norton should remember that.  I should like the Minister on the next stage of the Bill to try and make some arrangement whereby the farmers will not be deprived of the benefits of the allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to delay the House very long on this particular measure but I do feel that the time has come to get to grips with what I consider the most iniquitous feature of recent legislation.  All the talking that anybody can do will not in any way offset the fact that this Bill in relation to last year is raising a further concealed tax on the land of Ireland.  It is possibly the result of the cynicism of the Minister for Finance who suggested that taxation had lain lightly on the land.  There is no doubt at all but that it is a continuation of the policy of shedding responsibility for the raising of money.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Minister for Local Government was the pawn in a different way when a considerable sum of money was raised indirectly for certain purposes.  This whole type of legislation is difficult.  The conception of it originally might well be argued as wrong.  We are in an extraordinary cleft stick position done, I would say, with a deliberate political adroitness of which the Government are the masters. This Bill is somewhat like the curate's egg and leaves us in the position that we cannot deny the people in Ireland limited relief such as this Bill offers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, one realises its political significance.  It is an effort to save the face of the Government Party. Had not the situation developed when a vote of confidence arose, and subsequent to that by-elections, there would have been a bludgeoning through of the Bill as conceived in the original <Col N="1969" /> circular of the Minister.  I do not care who claims credit for it, whether it is Deputy Lehane who might be entitled to some bit of credit, or Independent Deputy Cogan, as he then was, who apparently boasted that he had twisted the lion's tail.  That makes no difference. It still does not in any way take from the fact that there is going to be raised from the farmers of Ireland a substantially increased sum by way of taxation.</P>
    <P>I want to say in a deliberate kind of way that this is a bit of political codology.  Even though Deputy Cogan may unctuously talk about unanimity in this House, unanimity can be gained in peculiar ways, particularly when one recollects the passage of the Republic of Ireland Bill through this House.  Unanimity, as suggested by Deputy Cogan, is claimed simply because we cannot deny to people who are going to get relief that relief.  We accede to what might have been the pious desire of the Government in opposing the Bill on Second Reading because we believe we have to assist agriculture in every way possible.</P>
    <P>But that does not for one moment gainsay the fact that this is a shabby, contemptible measure.  I have seen Deputy Cogan trying to gibe cheaply at a daily newspaper, trying to tie it up in an association that I do not really think exists.  To be quite honest, I feel that paper attacks me as often as it praises me.  That is its journalistic privilege.  Deputy Cogan, the champion of the ratepayers and the political gyrist, who might be described as the acrobatic king of cerebral gymnastics, might find in that article an indication that this shifting of responsibility from one Department to another is an unwelcome feature.  The responsibility of raising money is being bandied around in a dangerous way.</P>
    <P>We can take the general experience of this House.  Whether it was the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs or the Minister for Local Government we have had as a continuous feature of the last year in this House the raising of money in an indirect way.  I think that is more than worthy of comment in the public Press of this country.  Had it not been for the capricious or, possibly, <Col N="1970" /> voracious appetite of the Fianna Fáil Party when it swallowed and digested Deputy Cogan, I am quite sure he would have been the most vociferous denouncer to-day of this type of indirect increase on the rates throughout Ireland.</P>

      <P>This Bill only carries out and is a continuation of a policy for which you, a Cheann Comhairle, and I stood in this House for the last 25 or 26 years.  I remember in November, 1929, the policy as announced was one of seeing that a man who made use of his land, who tilled his land and employed workers, received a relief in rates from the Government aspect alone on that.  Away back in November, 1929, I had the honour of introducing here a motion proposing that the relief of rates would only be given to any man who had at least 15 per cent. of his land under tillage.  That is a long time ago.  That policy was followed by the Ceann Comhairle himself in this House as an ordinary Deputy in 1931, two years later, when he supported a proposal brought in by another Deputy of the Labour Party, <Col N="1971" /> Deputy O'Connell, that the relief of rates on agricultural land would only be given to a man who had 20 per cent. of his land under tillage.  Those are fundamental policies and they were opposed then, as now, by the Party that represented the bigger landholders in the country.  The ratepayer is a rather funny individual and when I look back and quote figures that were given by the Ceann Comhairle, then Deputy Patrick Hogan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>These figures were given by Deputy Patrick Hogan of the Labour Party in this House in 1931. He then pointed out to us that in 1914 the rates on agricultural land were 1/10 in the £.  They had a long way to go.  In 1917 they went up to 2/2; in 1919 they were 3/9; in 1920 they were 4/4; in 1923 they were 5/10; and in 1931 they were 7/-.  At that time the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, as they were then, opposed a motion for £1,000,000 relief of rates brought in by the present Taoiseach, then Deputy de Valera, and seconded by me; it was opposed by the Party which held the balance of power and relief was given to the extent of £725,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>At that time, the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, sitting here on these benches, had one rule: &ldquo;We will give you £1,000,000 relief in rates; we do not give a hang how high they go, that is all you will get.&rdquo;  Although rates went up from 5/- in 1924 to 7/-, the same amount of relief was given. There was this difference as well: it did not matter whether the farmer had 500 acres or 100 acres, he got the same <Col N="1972" /> relief.  Neither did it matter whether he had a man and a dog on the 500 acres or whether he employed 40 men. The policy then announced by the Fianna Fáil Party was that the man who tilled his land and gave employment was entitled to whatever relief was going.  That policy was brought into force and this is only the continuation of it.</P>
      <P>I remember very well the nice things that were said in the by-election in Cork.  Deputy Sweetman alluded to that to-day.  I admit at once that although we are an intensive tillage area, this particular measure will weigh heavier on the people in my constituency than on those in any other because the valuation per statute acre in my constituency is somewhere between 25/- and 30/- per acre.</P>

      <P>This is a Bill which will weigh heavily on the people in my constituency although the amount of labour employed there is higher than in <Col N="1973" /> any other part of the county, taking it on an acreage basis.  This is an area where tillage is carried out intensively.  In no case will you find there any holding on which less than about 40 per cent. of the land is under tillage.</P>
      <P>I suggest that, before we go much further with legislation relating to rates on land, there should be a complete revaluation of the land of the country.  Values have changed completely. The proximity value that was attached to land at the time of Griffiths valuation has, in the present transport age, gone.  I have seen holdings in other portions of Cork County which would carry as many milch cows, and produce as good crops as the land in East Cork and having only one-third of the valuation.  I have seen land in the Coachford area of Cork where the valuation is 10/- per acre as against 30/- in the Midleton and Cloyne areas. I think that, instead of having this constant chopping and changing, if rates are going to continue on agricultural land, there should be a complete revaluation of the land.</P>
      <P>There are some defects in the Bill to which I would like to refer.  One refers to non-payment of the allowance if there is a break in the 12-month period in which an agricultural worker is employed, a break that may be due to illness or some other cause.  In that connection, I might say that we hear a lot of shouting about the flight from the land.  We hear a lot about it from Deputies on the opposite side and from Deputies on this side, too, but in my opinion the flight from the land will continue under the present conditions of affairs where you have the agricultural labourer being paid roughly 50 per cent. of the wage that is paid to an industrial worker.</P>

      <P>I could give the Deputy cases of the kind I have mentioned. The father of a family is working as an agricultural labourer at £4 5s. a week.  Two of his sons, who used to work with farmers, are now in industrial employment, earning £8 a week each.  Cases of that kind are quite common in my constituency.  In view of that, how can you expect agricultural workers to remain on the land? One brother, say, is working with a farmer.  He has to work on seven days a week because cattle have to be fed and cows milked on Sunday as well as on Monday.  His brother, who is in industrial employment, finishes his work at 12 o'clock on Saturday and is getting nearly twice the wages of his brother who is with a farmer.  Is it any wonder, in view of those conditions, that there is a flight from the land?  Nothing is going to stop it as long as those conditions prevail, and there is no use in pretending otherwise.</P>
      <P>I suggest to Deputy O'Sullivan that he should take a ramble out about six miles from the town of Mallow.  If he does, he will find that the conditions prevailing in that area are exactly the same as they are in my area.  The father of a family there may be working with a farmer at £4 5s. a week. His brother is working in the Mallow factory and is getting £7 or £8 a week.</P>

      <P>I am speaking of men in constant employment, of men working for Irish Steel.  We had, for a number of years past, and at present, a number of agricultural labourers working in my area.  A gentleman comes down from Dublin and starts to build a sanatorium.  I have seen 18 agricultural labourers in my district walk away on a Saturday night from the farmers by whom they had been employed to take a job on the building at Glanmire.  At once, of course, their wages went up at least one and a half times.  I agree that the ordinary worker has nothing for sale but his labour and who is to blame him if he tries to get the highest price he can for it?  I certainly would not <Col N="1975" /> blame him.  I have described the conditions which obtain in rural areas to-day, and I suggest that while those conditions are present there is no good in talking about the flight from the land.</P>
      <P>To come back to the point that I started on, that a farmer must have a man in his employment for the 12 months of the year before he can get the allowance, I should like to point out to the Minister that an agricultural labourer may get sick or he may leave a farmer to better his position. When the employment period is broken in that way, the Bill will deal unfairly with the farmer.  It will take the farmer at least a fortnight or three weeks to replace that man.  In the event of that happening, the farmer loses his grant. Any break such as I have referred to destroys continuity in the employment of the worker on the land.  I suggest that the Minister should remedy that by introducing an amendment, because I think that any man who employs labour on the land should get the full allowance, and that breaks, such as I have referred to, should not count against him.  I also think it is unjust that because a farmer had a break in that employment, because a man left for one reason or another and it took him a fortnight or three weeks to replace that man, he should lose a benefit or allowance for that year, because of what will happen, I might say, with 50 per cent.  of the men employed.  No man can blame a labourer for bettering his conditions&mdash; they will try to better themselves, anyway, whether you like it or not.  If a man working for me is offered £6 or £7 a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I cannot blame him for going, and if he goes and leaves this gap there is no reason why I, as a farmer, should lose the allowance that I would be entitled to in the ordinary way because of that gap, and because it took me a fortnight to find a man to replace the man who had gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1976" /> country you have this tendency increasing every day and every week, this tendency of workers to change.  I also consider that in some crops at present you have an enormous amount of employment being given by farmers for which they can get no credit, and I wonder how the Minister is going to consider matters like that.  I allude to the 150 men we brought down from County Mayo this year for the purpose of singling beet.  We brought them down again for the purpose of harvesting beet.  It was a laudable thing to do.  It gave needed employment to men who otherwise would have to go to the foreigner looking for this employment and I suggest that those are matters&mdash;now that we are changing and a greater benefit is being given to the farmer who does employ labour&mdash;that deserve consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>If we are going to meet this system at all, if we are going to have this standard that a man is to be paid on the amount of labour he employs, and as it seems to be an accepted thing now on all sides of the House that it is a laudable thing to employ workers on the land, then I think the men who find that they cannot get sufficient labour and who go out of their way to other counties and bring down labour from other counties should be given some allowances.  I think this yearly basis should go out.  If a man proves that he employs labour&mdash;if you put it on the basis of £17 a year&mdash;then if the man proves that he employs 20 men for a month and another 20 men on another location for another month, that should all be made up, and for every month he has a man employed he should get a credit of £17.</P>
    <P>Tillage and the old type of employment of labour on the land in this country are completely changed.  You no longer have happening what occurred in my young days, and up to ten or 15 years ago.  I had one man for 19½ years.  Other neighbours of mine had them for 19 or 20 years.  A man came in as a young fellow, got married and lived in a cottage on the farm all his life.  That is gone in this country. The young men now growing up look</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> In my particular portion of the forward to the half-day on Saturday, and to being free from Saturday at 1 o'clock until Monday morning.  They look for the employment in which they will get that condition of affairs.  They look further than that.  They look also for the higher wage that they will undoubtedly receive in any industry in this country as against farming.  Those are the facts.  Therefore, I would suggest to the Minister that the particular points I have put up are points that should be considered and put into effect now in the shape of amendments to this Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman mentioned this morning that the Minister bungled the situation for both county councils and county council officials and rate collectors.  I do not think the Minister did.  I think that the Government did&mdash;the Government of which the Minister was only the spokesman.  The Minister was carrying out the considered policy of the Government as expressed by the Minister for Finance, that taxation lay lightly on the land of Ireland and that they must pay up.  I appealed at that stage, when the Minister for Finance spoke, to Deputy Corry to get busy as the farmers were going to suffer this impost.  Now, for whatever reason, the Government and the Minister have changed their minds, and the £13 per labourer grant is being raised to £17. I am not going to argue as to what brought that about, because it does not matter.  It has been increased from £13 to £17.  That, of course, is a considerable advantage to farmers who have a son or two working on the land with them.  It is an advantage where there are a number of men employed, where the valuation is up to the standard that can carry the allowances upon the men, because in the case of the £30 valuation farmer or the £20 valuation farmer, it does not matter how many men he has, he gets no reduction of rates notwithstanding all the tears that Deputy Corry shed about the farmers in 1927, 1928 and 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with that, I would like to remind the House&mdash;now that <Col N="1978" /> Deputy Corry has brought it in&mdash;that when £750,000 of agricultural grant was available in 1929 it was almost one-third of the total rates of this country. At that stage the total rates of the country were around the £3,000,000 mark, and Fianna Fáil wept tears of sorrow&mdash;crocodile tears, I admit&mdash;but they pretended to weep for the hardships that the farmers were suffering because the rates were 5/- and 7/- in the £.  They told the farmers of Ireland they should have complete derating of agricultural land and that £20,000,000 central taxation was an outrage and that Fianna Fáil would reduce it by £2,000,000.</P>

      <P>I will get the advertisements for you.  All you had to do in order to get complete derating, and central taxation reduced by £2,000,000 was to vote Fianna Fáil.  All you had to do, was do that and the people would be in clover.  Another thing mentioned was the remission or the non-payment of land annuities, but I only touch on that.  These were the tears of sorrow that were wept for the agricultural community of that day, but to-day the total rates of the country which were then £3,000,000 per annum are now over £15,000,000.  The farmers are being loaded more heavily than they have ever been.  Deputy Corry wept for them in the past and said we were opposed to a differential payment as between the large and small farmer. I would like to point out that for the first time it is the large farmer who will get the benefit under this Bill <Col N="1979" /> because he will employ a number of men and the more men that are employed the greater the benefit will be. I am not complaining of that.  I am merely making the point that that is the effect this measure will have.  What benefit will the farmer with the £30 valuation get?</P>

      <P>The Minister likes to get away from the problem of making an allowance for the women who work on the farm.  I am putting it to him that he should consider their position. The female, remember, is recognised as an agricultural worker under the national health insurance scheme though the stamp is cheaper than that necessary for a domestic worker.  Why not afford the same recognition right through?  Of course, the object of this measure is to save £300,000 to the Exchequer.  Deputy Cogan, Deputy Corry and the other Fianna Fáil speakers say that there will be no reduction and no saving effected.  That is not correct.  Deputy Sweetman showed clearly through the medium of the replies obtained from the secretaries of the county councils&mdash;and we got replies from practically all the <Col N="1981" /> county councils&mdash;that increased rates will have to be struck and increased payments will have to be made by the agricultural community.  We gave both; we gave the county councils that will lose and the county councils that will gain.  We did not suppress anything.  Where the information was against us we gave it.  It has been established by statistics that 27,000 men left the land inside the last 18 months.  Now, the secretaries of the county councils have based their calculations upon last year's returns in relation to the number of men employed on the land.</P>
      <P>It will be clearly shown when the time for accounting comes that the proposed saving to the Exchequer will work out, assuming that figure of 27,000 is correct, at something in the region of £359,000 and, therefore, next year there will be a saving of something like £90,000 over and above what the Minister for Finance budgeted for. We have the situation then in which the Minister budgets for £x, but that £x will never be paid, because the men will not be there to earn that employment relief.</P>

      <P>What the Government is doing now is holding a nice red carrot before the donkey's nose: Fianna Fáil would not dream of taking anything from the farmers&mdash;the Deputy Corrys, the Deputy Lehanes and the Deputy Cogans.  Not at all! The Government would not do that. But the Government will do it and do it in the most ignorant way and the costliest way it can be done, because the ratepayers will have to pay more than ever before in rates.  We are supposed to like that and do well with it.</P>
      <P>I think when you consider that 21,000 men left the land last year&mdash;I stand corrected on that because I am taking from the figure of 27,000 as the figure of the men who have gone off the land since 1951&mdash;if there were 21,000 last year, it may be more or less than that, but whichever it is, on the basis of 27,000 since 1951 it shows that even at £17 or even at £25 per person the Government still effects the saving that they set out to achieve, and remember that the object of this Bill was to effect a saving.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this &mdash;and there is nothing that the little Deputy from Donegal can do about it &mdash;was indicated when the Minister for Finance stated that taxation bore lightly on the land and they were going to take something off it in a direct way <Col N="1983" /> or in an indirect way.  Therefore they are saving that.</P>
      <P>I assert that the Minister now should extend the grant to the woman or girl who is working on the land and in that way give some relief to the smaller farmer whose daughter is working on the land and working hard on it. Nobody knows that better than the Minister himself.  In the old I.R.A. days he knew the amount of work the women of Ireland put in on the land of Ireland and it would be a recognition and give them the same standing as the male of the species; and when you give them the grant you are only observing the Constitution that says that everybody is equal.  Every person, male or female, man or woman, has a vote.  A woman has a vote just as well as the man&mdash;I want to remind you of that&mdash;and you will have to think twice about this thing and not still make them the slaves and refuse to recognise their worth to the people.  When you consider that everybody, even the Tánaiste, admits that agriculture is of paramount importance, and that agricultural produce and the export of it and the consumption of it at home&mdash; but particularly its export&mdash;is one of the most important factors, I am perfectly satisfied that if the grant were extended not only to the male but to the female worker we would increase production to a great extent.</P>
      <P>There are other factors, of course, which I will go into on the Taoiseach's Vote, please God.  I would like to add a word of support to Deputy Corry's appeal to extend it to the part-time worker, that that would in itself be an assistance.  I join my voice to Deputy Corry's in making that appeal.  In doing that the Minister will bestow considerable benefit and it will be an improvement; but if he does not do it and he sticks at the figure and remains tied to that figure that he has given of £17 and does not change the Bill in any way, then next year&mdash;this year perhaps not so much&mdash;the saving to the Exchequer will be the best part of £350,000.  Therefore the Minister will have achieved the object which he set out to secure when he made his Budget speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite evident to anyone that this Bill is nothing more or less than the outcome of the Minister's statement in his Budget speech that has been quoted so often since this Bill came into the House this morning, that taxation lies lightly on the land.  This Bill is nothing more or less than a very clever, cunning device to squeeze at least £300,000, if not more, out of the ratepayers of this country for the benefit of the Exchequer.  It is one of the many hidden or concealed forms of taxation which Fianna Fáil so loudly disclaim but yet are so active in putting into effect every chance they get.  There are a few aspects of this Bill that are very disquieting.  Most Deputies who have spoken so far seem to think that the effects of this cutting down will not touch the under £20 valuation farmer.  I hold the very opposite view. Outwardly it would seem that the remission which the farmer of over £50 valuation gained would be lost to the farmer himself and he would have to contribute it.  That is all very well, perhaps, for this year, but next year and each succeeding year that will be levied over the small farmers of under £20 valuation, farmers who are not getting a penny relief under this Bill and whose rates instead will be increased, in my opinion, next year and the year after and more as time goes on.  When we bring it down to brass tacks what we find is that the small farmer of under £20 valuation is now being asked to contribute towards the £17 remission that the farmer who can employ five or ten or 15 men will enjoy for each one of the number of men he employs.  I want to say this, that I do not think any farmer who employs a man wants his neighbour on a smaller valuation of under £20 to contribute towards the payment of his wages, but that is exactly what this Bill is doing, but doing in a fairly cunning, concealed way.</P>
      <P>My county, I have been informed on very reliable authority, will lose between £11,000 and £12,000 this year. In other words, the Government grant is being cut down by between £11,000 and £12,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take into account that the Local <Col N="1985" /> Authorities (Works) Act cut amounted to over £70,000 this year, that means that the present Government will be salting Mayo ratepayers to the tune of almost £80,000 all told this year alone, and more as time goes on.  Outwardly the Bill appears to confer benefit on the man who employs a man.  It proposes to increase his allowance from £6 10s. to £17 remission for each man employed.  But in my county there are very few farmers who employ more than one man.  The number who employ even one man is very few, because we have the very opposite kind of problem in County Mayo, and indeed, I might say, over the whole West of Ireland, to the problems of the other two provinces.  It was only just now that Deputy Corry pointed out that 150 men from Mayo were seeking work at thinning beet in his constituency this year.  That is a fairly accurate account of what is happening.  The result is that our problem, instead of being one of employment, or, rather, one of trying to induce the farmers to employ, is that most of our farmers are looking for employment themselves. The majority of them have not sufficient land to live on.  The holdings are too small.  That is one of the reasons why, in County Mayo particularly, the work of the Land Commission is one of outstanding importance and why it is that the clamour to relieve congestion is so much there.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that the Government, instead of conferring a benefit on the western counties, is blistering them.  Galway is losing £13,139, Roscommon about £4,825, and Mayo will be denied between £11,000 and £12,000.  I have not an accurate figure, but I am informed on reliable authority that between £11,000 and £12,000 is the amount the ratepayers of Mayo will be levied this year if this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton said that he hoped that the casualisation of agricultural workers would be stopped, but the very nature of agricultural work is casual in itself.  When somebody can provide crops that will grow uniformly and yield uniformly all the year round, <Col N="1986" /> or when somebody can give a guarantee that the weather will follow a very strict pattern&mdash;then and only then can continual employment be given on the land.  I could quote several cases in the West of Ireland.  Take those engaged in strawberry and fruit growing.  At one season of the year&mdash;this might seem strange&mdash;some of those people have actually to employ casual labour perhaps for a matter of only a few weeks, but at another end of the year those very people who employ casual labour at one period are seeking employment themselves in order to make ends meet.  That class of people will not benefit under this Bill, but on the contrary they will lose by it.  Deputy Corry seemed to be of opinion that all farmers, particularly the farmers who employ men, are a very poor crowd altogether.  He took up the attitude that he took up here some years ago when he described the small farmers of the West of Ireland as a crowd of hen roosters.  That was his attitude, showing his contempt for the small farmer who claims to employ men.</P>
    <P>Now I want to refer to farmers who have a man or two in employment. Perhaps some time during the year between 1st January and the 31st December such a workman for various reasons may decide to change his employment.  Perhaps family reasons may compel him to give up his work. Perhaps he may decide to emigrate to better himself.  Perhaps he may decide to go to different employment in the same locality to better himself.  None of these things can be helped.  As a matter of fact I have not yet met the man who would not seek to benefit himself.  What happens to the farmer who makes a claim for that period? He finds that because the man left him, say, in April or May or June and a week or a fortnight or a few weeks elapsed before he could get a man to replace him, he loses the remission completely over that little technical slip.  It is no fault of the farmer and certainly no fault of the worker who wants to improve his lot and better himself.  I think that the Bill could be very usefully amended so that where a worker walks out and leaves his employment with a farmer to better <Col N="1987" /> himself a statement to that effect should be quite sufficient to cover the farmer, and would avoid the possibility that in some cases a farmer might try to fire his workman and at the same time to get the benefit of the remission. I think the Minister should look into that side of it.</P>
    <P>Many have spoken on the question of the womenfolk of the household who work on the land.  It is quite true that very often they give very good help and very good assistance on the land, yet at the same time they are never counted, there is no remission for them and they are never even mentioned here in the House.  I can quote whole districts like Achill, particularly, and every place where there is congestion and where migration has been adopted all down during the years and will be continued I suppose for some time to come to make ends meet.  The male labourer clears out to work and it is the women who look after everything, put down the crops, raise them and care them during their period of growth and harvest them in most cases, from the month of March right up to the end of October.</P>

      <P>Is that a sensible policy?  The earlier that this Bill will apply to that kind of occupation the better.  Why not?  I do not see why these people should not be entitled to some help or some inducement to stay on the land, because it is the neglect of all that type of person that is the <Col N="1988" /> cause of all the rural depopulation and flight from the land that we hear so much about but about which so little is done.</P>
      <P>Now we will come to those whom Deputy Allen would like to speak about, those over £20 valuation where womenfolk work on the land.  Why should they not be included in this Bill?  When Deputy Allen is speaking he might give us one sound reason why they are not included or should not be included.  I do not see why they should not, because in most cases it would be impossible to work the land to full capacity without their help.  I think that it is a grave fault in the Bill that they are not being provided for.</P>
      <P>I want to impress again that the saving which the Exchequer will benefit by under this Bill will fall ultimately on the back of the small farmers.  It might be said that it will affect only the farmers of over £20 valuation, but that is a fallacy, because when the county council comes to strike its rate they will have to take account of the drop in the previous year, and that will be spread over the small farmers, and eventually it will work out that while a farmer who is paying men will get a remission of £17 on his rates for each man employed according to the scale of valuation up to £30 and above £30 and so on, the farmer who has a small valuation in the same county will eventually be contributing some of that £17, and that is a condition that I am sure the man who is paying the labourer does not want to have.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan seemed to think that all unemployment on the land is now going to end so long as any farmer is going to get £17 remission.  I hold the very opposite.  I hold that this Bill, this £17 inducement, will not induce any man or cause the employment of one extra man all over the whole country, because if we take it to pieces we find that it means that if a farmer gets a remission in full that will mean 6/6 per week for men, but who, in the name of goodness, is going to pay a workman £4 a week because he will get a remission of 6/6 a week in that workman's wages?  The thing is absolutely silly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1989" /> I want to ask the Minister why is it that it is only now that this Bill is being brought in?  It is being talked about since last March but all the county councils of the 27 we have in this country are completely befuddled and do not understand where they stand.  They are issuing credit notes, withdrawing demand notes and issuing new demand notes, and the result is that there is not a single county which has not been put to expense, ranging from £300 to £800, in the withdrawal and countermanding of orders and the issuing of fresh orders, demand notes and credit notes.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister why he did not bring out the Bill last May or June before all this trouble had arisen?  If he anticipated any delay in drafting the Bill because of necessary consultations with the Department of Finance why did he not adopt the procedure which has been the practice in former years, namely, make an announcement in the House as to his intentions in the matter until he was ready to give the terms of the Bill? Even when the Bill reached the white draft stage before it came up for consideration by the Government would have been time enough to have given notice of his intention, but his action in first giving the terms of the original Bill, withdrawing it and then rehashing it again has left the county councils in a complete mess.  Even yet they are not quite clear as to their position under it.  They cannot be as, naturally enough, no county council dare anticipate legislation as it will ultimately emerge from the two Houses here.  I think the whole thing is part of the scheme that was envisaged by the Minister for Finance in his Budget speech when he said that taxation rested lightly on the land. The Minister for Local Government seems to be in the unfortunate position of being kicked about by the Minister for Finance.  He was compelled to come in here last year to blister farmers who used tractors, to blister hackney car owners, lorry owners and every person who purchases petrol for any reason.  Now he has to come in here and make another contribution by hitting the farmers again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1990" /> As Deputy MacEoin pointed out, 27,000 men have gone from the land inside the last 18 or 19 months. In the last 12 months 21,000 have gone. This further taxation of land is part of the bungling and mismanagement to which the whole agricultural industry has been subjected since 1932.  It is difficult to understand why that bungling should be supported by farmers, some of them good farmers like Deputy Allen.  One thing I could never understand is why the present Taoiseach, after having repeatedly proclaimed that agriculture is the principal industry of the country, should proceed to give us the worst Minister for Agriculture he could find, each one knowing less about the industry than his predecessor.  I believe that in the Fianna Fail Party there are some good farmers.  Although we may differ politically, I believe that Deputy Allen, for instance, would make a better Minister for Agriculture than Deputy Dr. Ryan, Deputy Smith or even the present Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>They apparently think that this is a new duty that should be performed by county councils, to undertake to provide propaganda material for the Fine Gael Party machine.  This Party have always been in favour of the relief of rates on agricultural land and we have accepted the principle that the largest possible amount of the money provided should be given to the small farmers, who are the backbone of the producers of the country.  The amount of production from the small farms is far greater proportionately than it is from the larger farms.  It is right, therefore, that the Government, in giving relief of rates on agricultural land, should give the relief to the smaller farmers in the first instance; and, secondly, to the larger farmers who employ labour.  That is a sound principle and this Government can be proud of the fact that they initiated that principle and have carried it down through the years.  I am sure it is one with which Deputy Davin and his Party will thoroughly agree, because a great many years ago they were prepared to support that principle.</P>
      <P>From what we can gather from Deputy Norton's speech, I think he is supporting that principle.  But Deputy Sweetman cannot get away with it.  He would love to get away with it on behalf of the large ranchers that there are still in County Kildare and some other parts of the country, and see that they get relief of rates, even though they are giving little or no employment.  The Government, I think, have a right to indicate to farmers who hold a substantial amount of land that they should provide a fair share of employment.  I think that is a right principle, and that it could not be argued against on any basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year as the relief on agricultural land comes up for review, it is <Col N="1994" /> quite obvious that a considerable sum of the total amount of money provided goes to the people whose valuation is under £20.  I think about £3,250,000 out of a possible £5,000,000 is being paid to those people who get an abatement of three-fifths of the first £20 valuation. The sum is over £3,000,000 anyway. Many counties benefit very much by that.  The ratepayers in Deputy Blowick's county benefit very considerably as a result of that.  That principle was first brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government some years ago and counties with a very big proportion of small farmers, such as Monaghan, Cavan, Kerry, West Cork and the counties on the western seaboard have benefited very much by it.  I suppose about two-thirds of the holdings in this country are under £20 valuation, and the owners have three-fifths of the total rates paid for them by the State and have only to pay one-fifth.  People over that valuation who give employment are entitled to an allowance.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that my county, where there is a big lot of employment given, instead of being one of the 20 counties which Deputy Sweetman stated would lose by this, will gain roughly between £8,000 and £10,000. The sum will be over £8,000 at any rate.  The people there will gain that because of the fact that they give a big lot of employment as some 6,000 persons are claiming the employment allowance in County Wexford.  They produce more than a fair proportion of the wheat, beet and other cereal crops, as well as cattle, pigs, etc., and they are entitled to that relief.  The same applies to any other county where the farmers give employment on the land.  If they are over £20 valuation and give employment, they get the balance of the money that the State is providing out of taxation, and they are entitled to that.</P>
    <P>I do not think that principle can be argued against by anyone.  We know that there are people with large farms who are best able to bear the burden in most cases and that exceptions can be pointed out.  But we are told that exceptions make bad law.  There may be people in certain counties who will be badly hit by this, but they are very <Col N="1995" /> few.  Those who will be most affected will be the people with the higher valuations who are giving no employment.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Fine Gael Party and the Clann na Talmhan Party have come to see common sense.  We would have liked them to oppose this Bill on principle here just as they have been opposing it for the last four or five months.  Why did they not do so to-day and argue against the principle embodied in the Bill?  If Deputy Sweetman was honest he, as one of the leaders of Fine Gael, would come in here and argue against the principle embodied in this Bill, that relief should be given on three-fifths of the first £20 of valuation and on valuations over £20 that £17 per person employed whole-time should be given.  Let him argue against that principle and then we will know where we stand.  But he cannot now tell the people who did not understand this that the Minister for Finance wanted to save £250,000 by this Bill.  There was no foundation for that whatever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There was very definitely foundation for it in the circular issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no relation whatever between this Bill and the Minister for Finance's Budget.  I am aware of that and I am aware that the principle of the Bill was being considered six months before the Budget came to be drafted.  There was no question of saving money for the Exchequer. That was not the intention of this Government.  If the rates increase in the coming year&mdash;I hope they will not &mdash;that will mean an increase in the amount which the Exchequer must provide in respect of the three-fifths relief on holdings up to £20 valuation, and if there is more employment given on the land it will also mean an increase in the contribution from the Exchequer.  There is nothing in this Bill to prevent that increase taking place.  If county councils put up the rates by 1/-, 2/- or 2/6, under this Bill the Minister for Finance next year and for the next two years will provide an <Col N="1996" /> increased grant from the Exchequer. It is nonsense to say that it was for the purpose of helping the Minister for Finance to balance his Budget that this Bill was brought in.  It had no possible relation to it whatever.</P>
      <P>There are a few matters in connection with this Bill which were adverted to by Deputy Corry to which I hope the Minister will give consideration in the Committee Stage.  One is the question of a short break in employment during the year.  Some years ago when this employment allowance came into operation, if there was a break in employment for a month or six weeks during the year, the county councils allowed for that break and paid the full employment allowance for the year.  Things have stiffened up since the coming of the manager.  The local government auditors have stiffened up and unless there is full and absolute employment for the 12 months the agricultural grant is not allowed in respect of any employee.  An amendment should be brought in to cover that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A case or two was brought to my notice in the last year where, because a man was out sick for a month and was not in the employment of the farmer at that time, the farmer lost the agricultural grant.  That is most unfair and there should be some provision in the legislation to cover such cases.  Ordinary sickness can overtake anyone.  The farmer should not be penalised because the employee, through no fault of his own, is ill for a short period or for any period.  The farmer tries his best to get help or an employee if he can, but they are not always available.  A man may leave a farmer's employment, having changed his employer, and the farmer may not be able to find another employee for a week or a month.  He should not be penalised on account of that short period.  If provision is not made in law, it will tend to make farmers dishonest in making returns.  They will find ways and means of covering it up. When they find out why they are penalised&mdash;because an employee is sick for a month or they are without a man for a few weeks&mdash;they will find ways of covering it up.  It makes for dishonesty. The law should not leave <Col N="1997" /> any loophole for any section of the community to be dishonest and certain provision should be made in that respect.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputies Blowick and MacEoin that provision should be made for female employees.  I do not know in my county of any female employee working on the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I challenge him to do it.  He suggested it could be done. It is a new point that needs to be covered, according to Deputy Blowick. The majority of farmers in Mayo and other counties like it are getting a big part of the agricultural grant; and it is quite right they should, as they are small poor farmers.  Many of them have <Col N="1998" /> the three-fifths rates.  Some people have asked how the ratepayers in Mayo are able to pay £2 in the £.  The big majority have three-fifths of it paid by the State.  That is how they pay them. I suppose that if there were larger farms the rates might not be £2 in the £.</P>
      <P>This legislation considered to-day has been accepted in principle by this House for a good number of years now. It is a long way back to the time when there was a fixed agricultural grant. The fixed agricultural grant was £680,000.  Fianna Fáil from the beginning have stepped that up and it is £5,000,000 now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a fixed grant, no matter what the rate was.  When the rate was 3/- in the £, it was £680,000, too.  Deputy O'Sullivan should be aware of that.  Now you have a changing agricultural grant.  It goes up now as the rate increases. Fianna Fáil first brought in that principle. At that time the counties were not getting half the health services grant.  The cost of mental hospitals was subject to a small fixed grant also, but 50 per cent. of it all is being paid now.  With all the new charges on the ratepayers compared with 20 or 25 years ago, they are not paying as high a rate in proportion as they were at that time and the charges on land are not as high.  The State from central taxation is meeting a greater portion of the total charges on land at the present day than it met 20 or 25 years ago.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Opposition Parties are afraid.  They are running away from everything they said in the last four months on this Bill.  They ran away from it in the House to-day and they are not prepared to oppose the principles embodied in this Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad I did not intervene in the debate until now, as I find that every succeeding speech from the Government side brings extraordinary revelations <Col N="1999" /> to the House.  Deputy Allen has just informed us that this Bill was actually in preparation six months ago; that the Party had given its benediction to the principle of this Bill six months ago.  Am I being unfair in asking why the circular of last May was issued?  What good purpose was that intended to have?  Is the Minister, the Government and the Party aware of the confusion and expense caused to every local authority in Ireland as a result of the original circular sent out?  At the very time, the Government were facing two by-elections, in Cork and Wicklow. Deputy Corry will recall that the Fianna Fáil candidate and Fine Gael candidate were lodging the nomination papers on the morning on which it was announced by the Minister in the Press that it was the intention of the Government to extract an extraordinary amount of money from the farmers in the coming year by way of this change.  It was accepted by the local authorities and by the ratepayers that there would not be any change. There was no intimation whatever of the far-reaching changes that were to be made in this method of rate abatement.</P>
      <P>The House is well occupied with ascribing to various individuals and Parties the reason for the extraordinary change in the Bill now before the House as compared with the original proposals.  The author of this business, which was intended to be a tragedy, somewhere around the end of the first act found&mdash;as a result of the propaganda of this Party, as quite truly said by every Fianna Fáil Deputy who has spoken; and in particular by the emphatic results in East Cork and in Wicklow&mdash;that this indeed was something which the Government could not stand behind.  Therefore, a letter was sent, post-haste, to the local authorities changing in some way and reducing the drastic effects that were originally intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not a Deputy who has spoken from this side of the House who has not cited one sentence of the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance.  We are not taking that from <Col N="2000" /> one another.  None of us was aware that every one of our colleagues put down at the top of his headings for reference to this measure the following statements from the Budget speech of the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;Taxation presses lightly on the land....&rdquo; and &ldquo;Economies will be effected in the coming year....&rdquo;  The economies were not detailed.  This is a very minor economy.  We have had others in the course of the past 12 months.  To give the Minister for Local Government his due, he has certainly taken much of the blame off the shoulders of the Minister for Finance by raking in so much in the way of taxation on vehicles, and so forth.  This is merely a small addition.</P>
    <P>Government Deputies seem to be amazed at the information which Opposition Deputies have.  In my two and a half years in this House, I have never seen a measure in respect of which the Opposition have had such effect in changing the Government's mind.  I have often heard arguments for a strong Government, arguments for a Government with a very narrow majority and arguments for a strong Opposition.  I think that this is the greatest proof we have had of a Government with a very minor majority because the Government have been brought to heel by the feelings of people throughout the country, reflected in the statements of the Opposition and the activities of the Opposition over the past few months since this matter was first mooted.</P>
    <P>Earlier to-day, Deputy Sweetman gave details relating to the counties which will lose and the counties which will stand to gain a very small amount. In the aggregate, the Exchequer will benefit&mdash;that is, assuming that as many will be employed this year as were employed in past years.  Looking at the evidence of past years, is there any indication of even stopping the flight from the land?  Is it not clear that in the past 12 months 21,000 employees left the land?  Consequently, in view of this diminishing return, the Government may, in the years to come, look forward to considerably greater savings than it is proposed to rake off this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2001" /> We are not opposing the Second Reading of this Bill, but surely we are entitled to give our reasons and to state here that, were it not for the light brought to bear on the matter by this Party, the Press, and the people throughout the country, there would not have been any change in the proposals that were made by the Minister for Local Government in the course of the by-election campaigns in Cork and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that Deputy Allen should inform us that the Government were considering this matter six months before the circulars were issued to the local authorities. Will every member of a local authority make a note of that and consider the expense that was involved by local authorities in the matter of changing the demand notes, and so forth, apart altogether from all the confusion that was created in every local authority throughout the country for months past in relation to this matter?</P>
    <P>I consider that the members of this Party and anybody else who made an approach to the secretary of a county council since this Bill was circulated were quite entitled to do so.  How were we to make up our minds on our approach to this measure without the information which we required?  I am not a member of a local authority.  I have not had as much experience as some other Deputies of the iron curtain that hangs over many of our county council offices as a result of the County Management Act, but on this occasion it was forcibly brought home to me in my own county when the secretary informed us that he did not think he was at liberty to give us the information we sought and that it could be furnished only through the chairman of the county council.  I am not well versed in the legalities of the County Management Act but I understand that the regulations set out that the manager and the chairman must give information.  The Minister may correct me later in this if I am wrong, but I know of no regulation which prevents the manager or the secretary from giving information to any person regarding a matter of this nature.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs if <Col N="2002" /> the elected representatives of the people are to be treated in such a manner by officials of the local authorities. In any event, we have sufficient replies before us to indicate that a saving is to be made in relation to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>It is said by some people that the intention is to encourage more employment on the land.  Can any Deputy make the case that, as a result of this change, a greater number will in effect be employed?  I contend that there will not.  Those who have higher valuations are the people who could afford to give this extra employment but they are the very people who have mechanised their holdings.  I claim that the people who are giving real employment in agriculture to-day are those who have not the wherewithal to purchase machinery.  There is not any relief in this measure for the people who are giving real employment.  Take, for instance, a man in a dairying area with a valuation of, say, £25.  If that man has a young family none of them will qualify under this Bill and, even though his children help him in various ways on the farm and bring the milk to the creamery, and so forth, he will lose the allowance under this Bill, whereas his neighbour who has a higher valuation and a grown family will possibly gain, somewhat.  I ask the Minister and the House if that is equitable.</P>
    <P>A case has been made here for some recognition in respect of female labour in this country.  Deputy Allen stated that female labour is unknown in his constituency, but it is easy to recognise that it is not a dairying county. If Deputy Allen lived in a dairying area he would know that, in the matter of assessment of claims for workmen's compensation, and so forth, it is obvious that there is a considerable female employment content and that they are rated by insurance companies in relation to accident on the same basis as agricultural labour running the same risks and so forth. If that is so, then why not include them in respect of the abatement of rates?</P>
    <P>Government and Opposition Deputies have made a case for some approach to the matter of occasional employment. <Col N="2003" /> It is rigidly stated in this Bill that employment must be for a period of a full 12 months.  Deputy Corry mentioned that additional and seasonal employment is given in his constituency in relation to beet-lifting operations, and so forth.  I have a simple suggestion to make to the Minister whereby it would be possible to get an accurate and, I would say, an honest statement in relation to occasional help employed, in addition to regular employment, and that is by giving a farmer credit when he furnishes to the local authorities his wages declaration for the previous year in respect of accident insurance.</P>

In such cases arrangements can be made for the provisional payment of unemployment assistance pending determination of the transfer position provided, of course, that the applicant is otherwise eligible for unemployment assistance.</P>

    <P>As regards disability benefit, the position is that during the first six months of residence in this country, the British or Northern Ireland Ministry continues to be liable for the payment of benefit.  It is not until the end of this period that the insurance is transferred to my Department and every effort made to reduce to a <Col N="2014" /> minimum the interval between cessation of benefit under the British or Northern Ireland schemes and the commencement of payment of benefit by my Department.  Cases do, however, arise which require protracted inquiries to establish title to benefit here.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 7 of the Censorship of Films Act, 1923, provides that if the official Censor of Films is of opinion that any picture is not fit for general exhibition in public he may grant a certificate for exhibition subject to such restrictions and conditions in regard to the places at which or the special conditions under which the picture may be exhibited or the classes of persons who may be admitted to see the picture, as in his opinion are necessary to prevent the exhibition of the picture in public being subversive of public morality.</P>
      <P>The power of issuing such &ldquo;limited certificates&rdquo; has been seldom exercised because the censor takes the view that there is a danger that films with &ldquo;limited certificates&rdquo; would arouse unhealthy curiosity.  He thinks it better to endeavour to ensure that no film is passed if it contains anything which would be seriously injurious to young minds.</P>

      <P>I have had the matters referred to by the Deputy investigated and have found that the position was as follows: In October, 1952, a junior officer, presumably the one in question, submitted a document in Irish to his next superior officer.  This officer, who received his commission during the period of the emergency and not through the medium of a cadetship, not having an adequate knowledge of Irish, returned the document to the junior officer.  There is no evidence that he returned it in a contemptuous manner.  The junior officer was subsequently tried for having used insubordinate and obscene language to the superior officer in the presence of a third officer and two noncommissioned officers on the occasion and he was found guilty and awarded a severe reprimand.  The junior officer tendered his resignation on the date of the trial.  I am not aware of his movements since he left the Forces.</P>

It was a junior officer and, as I have stated, he was awarded a commission not through the ordinary means of a cadetship in which case they must have a competent knowledge of Irish, both oral and written.  In the case of the emergency officer that was not required, and I can give this assurance that as far as the officer was concerned he merely returned the form to ask for information which was contained in it so that he could deal with it.  It might have been more sensible if he had referred the document to an officer with a thorough knowledge of Irish and dealt with it in that way, but, having investigated the case, I am satisfied that there is nothing whatever in it.</P>

      <P>A suitable site has been offered for the proposed new school at <Col N="2025" /> Doohoma, but documentary evidence of title to the site will require to be furnished and certain other preliminary arrangements will require to be made before the Department will be in a position to sanction a grant towards the cost of the erection of the school. The procedure in connection with the production of evidence of title has proved to be complicated and protracted and necessitated an application to the courts.  It seems, therefore, that it may be some time longer before proof of title is forthcoming.  It is expected that the other necessary preliminary arrangements will be completed at an early date.</P>
      <P>Regarding the proposed new school to replace the present Trienbeg National School, it will be recalled that in my reply to the Deputy's previous question in this case on the 30th July, 1953, I adverted to the difficulty of obtaining a suitable site and mentioned that the Commissioners of Public Works were being asked, in the circumstances, to resurvey the site originally offered by the manager.  This has now been done and the site in question, though far from ideal, is being accepted, as there is no other site obtainable in the district.  A grant for the erection of the new school cannot be sanctioned, however, until documentary evidence of title to the site has been obtained and certain other arrangements have been completed.</P>
      <P>In view of their urgency both of these cases will continue to receive every possible attention, but I cannot say at present when it will be possible to have them brought to the stage at which work on the erection of the new buildings can be commenced.</P>

Such inquiries will, of course, continue to be made periodically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should point out, however, that as the milk purchased by some of the <Col N="2032" /> co-operatively-owned factories from creameries is used in the manufacture of other non-butter dairy products such as dried milk and cheese in addition to chocolate crumb and chocolate couverture, the actual prices paid for such milk do not necessarily reflect the value of the milk for chocolate crumb alone.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of clarity, I might also add that milk used for the making of chocolate crumb is not obtained by the crumb factories direct from farmers but from creameries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister turned his mind to the return got by farmers for milk supplies to the various categories of chocolate crumb factories, bearing in mind that in respect of those factories partially owned by farmers' co-operative societies they not only get the price of the milk but get an annual share of the profit of the chocolate crumb factories which is passed on to them in the shape of a bonus on their milk prices, and would he consider the relative return got by those who supply commercial factories in which the farmers have no interest in comparison with the farmers who supply factories in which they have a participating interest?</P>

      <P>When dealing with this matter last night I pointed out the enormous improvement that has taken place in our agricultural position to-day as compared with 1951.  I pointed out that the increase in the value of our exports of cattle alone for the first nine months of this year, as compared with the first nine months of 1951, was roughly £6,000,000 and that the exports of our other agricultural produce amounted to £43,530,000, as compared with £21,125,000 in 1951.  The total increase in the value of our agricultural exports was £27,500,000 in two years.  That clearly shows the change that has taken place in so far as our agricultural policy is concerned, due to the change of Ministers, and the change of policy has worked out to the improvement of agriculture generally and of the farming community in particular.  That gives the lie to those who have argued up to recently that the agricultural community were not doing their share in relation to increasing production.</P>

      <P>That shows that we have now got over and brought back into production again the 52,000 milch cows that vanished out of the country on the declaration by Deputy Dillon of a price of 1/- per gallon for milk.  That is one instance.  We have now an increase of some 80,000 cattle since 1951.  We have 80,000 more to-day in the Twenty-Six Counties than we had when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture. Clearly there has been an enormous improvement in the numbers of our cattle.</P>

      <P>I have pointed out that we have not yet got the results due to the improvement brought about in the sowing and harvesting of 98,000 extra acres of wheat.  That shows that the Irish farmer has not yet sent wheat up the spout after the peat and beet&mdash; God speed the day! Neither have we got the results of the 112,000 extra tons of beet grown this year.  Our milk and chocolate crumb industry shows an increase as compared with 1951&mdash;a rather extraordinary increase from £2,000,000 in 1951 to £14,000,000 in the first nine months of this year in the exportation of that commodity.  These are somewhat extraordinary figures and they prove that in so far as agriculture is concerned Fianna Fáil policy is the correct one.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with this Estimate as I find it.  I would normally welcome any increased grants for the purpose of putting the county roads in order.  When one remembers that the bulk of the money received through the medium of taxation for these roads is not used on them but is put to other uses there is undoubtedly a sound argument and a firm argument for an increased grant for roads, particularly after a period of three and a half years when these roads were robbed of some £6,000,000 in grants.  That was the amount of the reduction in grants for public roads during the period of office of the inter-Party Government.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the general policy as regards roads is a bit overdone, that there is an inclination on the part of the Government to give grants for main roads and not to worry about the road that is used by the ordinary taxpayer.</P>

      <P>I was dealing last night with the position as regards industry and urging that a large portion of the development grant should be used to establish industries.  I was suggesting that permanent employment should be provided for our people in industry rather than partial or short-time employment on roads and drainage.  I cannot see any reason why a large portion of this money should not be used to extend the steel industry.  I have raised this matter by question and in debate in the House from time to time.  There is a part of a tin-plate mill that has been lying idle for nine or ten years while we are importing tin, tin plate and tin cans to the value of £2,500,000 per annum.  In these circumstances that factory should be put under way with a view to providing permanent employment for a certain number of men instead of spending this money on relief schemes.  There is scope for doing that and there is an opportunity to provide such permanent employment.</P>
      <P>A number of towns in this country suffered severely in the past by the change-over from a British Government to an Irish Government.  It is about time that industries were set up in these towns that would provide permanent employment.  I cannot help wondering at the delay there has been in establishing industries.  I have made a suggestion here on previous occasions which should be carried out that the so-called Industrial Development Authority, which is blocking the advance of industry in this country, should be got rid of.  The sooner it is got rid of the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2040" /> I noticed from a reply to a question by Deputy Desmond yesterday that there has been practically no change in the number of civil servants in this country in recent years.  The burden that has been created in this matter is one that the country could very well do without.  The figures speak for themselves.  As compared with 1939, there has been an increase of some 9,000 civil servants.  If a certain number was sufficient to do the work in 1939 the same number should be sufficient to do it now.  There is no justification for the extra burden of some £3,000,000 that has been caused by this increase in the number of civil servants. I had hoped, when the matter was dealt with here before, that there would be some change in the Government attitude on this matter.  The people of the country have to be careful. Taxes are mounting.  The general burden on the taxpayer has mounted. While there has been an increase, as I have shown, in the value of agricultural exports, that money should be put back into providing productive employment for our people in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a welcome sound to hear from the benches of Fianna Fáil rejoicing in the increased output of the agricultural industry.  The House will have noticed and attach due significance to the fact that when those rejoicings were voiced they related to the increased exports of cattle and the increased exports of agricultural produce&mdash;pigs, sheep, beef, mutton, pork, cattle.  It is not necessary for me to remind the House that the cattle that were exported in 1952 were born in 1949 and the cattle that were exported in 1953 were born in 1950, and the cattle that will be exported in 1954 were born in the spring of 1951.  But I remind the House that that trend of expanding production dates back to 1948 and it is visible in 1949 and in 1950.  There will be Deputies in Fianna Fáil who say: &ldquo;Well, if there was expanding production then, was not it the cattle that were born in 1945, 1946, 1947?&rdquo; Yes, it was; everyone of them; but, there is this difference: that if Fianna Fáil had remained in office in 1948 they would have got their throats <Col N="2041" /> cut, but in 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952 and 1953 there were no calves' throats cut.</P>
      <P>What is the statistical fact?  Fianna Fáil was in office from 1931 to 1948. The statistical and inescapable fact is that the average annual loss of calves from death and slaughter during those 18 years was 80,000 calves.  There were factories in this country devoted to the business of slaughtering calves, and there was a loud outcry when I closed them down.  As a result of a campaign for the elimination of disease in calves, initiated in 1949, and as a result of our closing down the calf factories, the annual mortality of calves in this country was reduced from 80,000 to something in the order of 10,000.  Let the House remember that the first 70,000 calves that were born and survived in 1950 were exported this year, and if we estimate their value conservatively at £50 per head it would represent an addition of £3,500,000 sterling per annum to the value of our livestock exports, not for one year but for year after year after year.  Well may Deputy Corry rejoice.  I welcome that at last in the ranks of Fianna Fáil we have got one voice to proclaim that the performance of the farmers in this country is deserving of high praise.</P>
      <P>When did they change their tune? Are people's memories so short that the White Paper of 1951 is forgotten? Do Deputies forget that the financial policy of this Government was founded on the statement in the White Paper of 1951 that the most optimistic forecast could see no contribution being made to the restoration of our balance of payments by an expansion of agricultural exports?  Are people's memories so short that they forget that Fianna Fáil campaigned this country on the slogan that the farmers of Ireland were not able to show increased production commensurate with any other agricultural country in Europe?  That was their theme, that if we looked at Denmark, Holland or any other agricultural country, they were forging ahead but that our farmers were stuck in the mud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said then that our farmers were doing a better job than the farmers in any country in Europe and, starting <Col N="2042" /> with a greater handicap than any other agricultural country in the world, they were going ahead at a rate that reflected credit upon them and that held high hope for the economy of this country.</P>
    <P>Who was right?  Show me a country in the whole of Europe that can show an expansion of agricultural production and exports commensurate with the expansion that our farmers can show over the last five years.  Remember where our farmers started from. In April, 1948, there were less cattle in Ireland than at any time in the 20th century, less sheep, less pigs and the land was in a state of greater dereliction than at any time since the Famine of 1847.  That is where our farmers started and they caught up on and surpassed every agricultural community in the world at a time when, by their own election, they determined to withdraw from the international butter market by stipulating for prices for milk that made Irish butter unsaleable in any competitive market in the world.</P>
    <P>I ask this House to reflect on two fundamental economic facts because if they are lost sight of or if they are incorrectly interpreted, as certain as we are in this House, this country will go down to economic ruin.  They are two perfectly simple facts.  One is that the agricultural industry of this country must export or this nation will die.  Every industry, every economic activity in this country depends on our ability to export agricultural produce profitably, and if that power should ever perish in our people the standard of living of every creature in Ireland, whether he be a trade unionist, a civil servant, a doctor, a lawyer, or anybody else, even a farmer, will sink down to subsistence level.  In the last analysis every citizen depends for his standard of living on the land and the people who live and get their living on the land.  If they make a profit, the whole community will prosper.  If they are driven back by losses to subsistence farming, the whole community's standard of living must sink down to that of a pauper.</P>
    <P>We tried the experiment of compulsory wheat.  We tried the experiment <Col N="2043" /> of forcing the farmers, whether they wanted to or not, to grow a crop.  I told the Government of that day that they would get nowhere with compulsion, that compulsion meant a steady diminution of yield and there was only one way of getting production from farmers, that was to take steps to make the product of their labour profitable for the producer.</P>
    <P>You can get as much wheat as you like grown in this country if you pay 80/- per barrel.  You will have a surplus of wheat.  You will have out of next year's crop an exportable surplus of wheat from this country&mdash;that is as certain as we are in this House&mdash; and we will join the French who are paying their farmers 39/- per cwt. for wheat and are hawking their flour in the City of London at 25/- per cwt., and are unable to get anyone to buy it.  We will be doing exactly the same but that is our own business.  If we want to grow wheat in any quantity, we can grow it by paying a price for it.  You will never get a crop in any satisfactory way by trying to compel farmers to grow it because the net result of it will be that you will get a steadily diminishing return per acre on the land both in quantity and in quality.</P>
    <P>Fix a price that makes it remunerative to produce wheat and you will get as much wheat as you want but that production of wheat does not matter a damn to the fundamental economy of this country.  You can produce wheat, butter, sugar in this country at any price you like to mention; it becomes purely a question of what our people are prepared to pay for it or what the Exchequer is prepared to pour into it by way of subsidy but it has no economic significance whatever, except in so far as it represents a charge on the public purse.  The only thing that matters is profit and the amount of commodities that can be exported at a profit to the man who produces them.  It has become clear to everybody now, though it used not to be so clear to the Fianna Fáil Party, that profitable production consists of live stock and live-stock products.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2044" /> Here is a warning, the first fundamental economic fact, that I ask Deputies to grasp and to remember. Profit for a farmer is not primarily a question of price.  Profit for a farmer is the difference between the price he can get for his finished product and what it costs him to produce it.  We are back in a world where we do not control the price available for our agricultural exports any longer.  We have got to go out and seek the best price we can get.  I want to warn Oireachtas Eireann that when we are out looking for markets for our farmers, for pigs and pig products in competition with the Danes who have all the maize they want at £22 per ton, our farmers cannot profitably compete with them if they have to pay £32 per ton for the same maize.  I warn this House that, whatever codology is talked here, there is no escaping the fact that there is no degree of efficiency, no degree of industry, no degree of skill which will enable any small farmer to offset the handicap of having to pay £10 per ton more for the raw material of the pig industry than his competitors in his principal market.</P>
    <P>There is a rough approximate calculation that it takes 8 cwt. of meal to rear a pig from the point of conception to the point of slaughter.  If we have to pay 10/- per cwt. more for our feeding stuffs as compared with what our competitors have to pay for the same feeding stuffs, on every pig we produce the small farmer of this country has to give up £4 per pig. £4 per pig! Think of what that means. If you keep a sow and she produces ten bonhams at a litter, the first thing that happens is that you lose £40 before you make a penny.  If a man is struggling to get two litters in 12 months, if he has a pretty good sow and is a careful farmer and can bring ten pigs out of each litter to maturity, can you conceive an Irish Parliament laying on that man the obligation to forgo £80 of his profit before he can even enter the market with his competitor? Then he has got to be sure that the factory that processes his pig is going to put his pig, in the form of pork or bacon, on the market in as good a condition as the Danish factory <Col N="2045" /> or he will have to take another cut because of this, be sure; the bacon factory or the slaughterers are only going to pay the farmer what the end product realises on the export market, less the processor's margin of profit, less the trade unionist's rate for slaughtering the pig.</P>
    <P>All these charges represent a reduction in the profits that ultimately go back to the farmer.  He has lost £80 on two litters of pigs.  He has got to meet his competitor in London and he has just to hope in God that the processor who put his product on the London market will treat it as well as the Danish processor treats the Danish pig.  If he does, the Irish farmer in Mayo, Sligo, Donegal, Clare, Kerry or West Cork is going to get £80 less for the two litters of his sow than the farmer who lives ten miles outside Copenhagen.  It is not that the Danes have some power or that the British have some power to frustrate us, because we grasped the British under the 1951 trade agreement whereby we linked our price for pork and pigs, not to the Danish price but to the price payable to the British farmers. Our farmers' loss is due to nothing that the Danes do or that the British have power to do.  It is due solely, entirely and exclusively to what our own Government does to our own people.</P>
    <P>Think of what we are doing.  The claim is that you must keep the price of maize at 32/- per cwt. so that the farmer who has a surplus of barley that he does not want to use himself can sell it at a profit.  We are to get the profit for that farmer who sowed so much barley that he cannot consume it on his own holding, not out of the Exchequer, not out of the British consumer but out of the small farmer who breeds pigs in Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Clare, Kerry and West Cork. Is there anybody in this House left with a capacity for <i>saeva indignatio</i> against the exploitation of the small people, for whom we stand trustee, by the powerful and the well-to-do?  I see small farmers growing their couple of acres of barley and potatoes and feeding their pigs.  But in the industry there <Col N="2046" /> may be a man who has used up his own patch of land to produce all that he can, and he goes out to buy more feeding stuff so as to expand his output. He then comes up against the fact that his own Government taxes him to the tune of £4 per pig the moment he goes to buy the raw materials to expand his production.  I want to ask this question: is there a factory in Ireland, in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford or any other city which finds itself confronted with a demand that it will pay for its raw materials 10/- per cwt. more than its competitors and which must try to export at a profit at the same time? There is not a factory in Ireland that would not close its doors and sack its employees without hesitation if any such demand was made upon it.</P>
    <P>I remember that we were not 12 months in office when a factory not 100 miles from this city presented the Government with an ultimatum some three weeks before Christmas that they would lock their doors and put every man working in the factory on the streets if they did not get the tariff on their commodity raised by 50 per cent.  When they were asked to pause and allow an examination of their application to be made, the answer was: &ldquo;There will be no pause; they are all under notice and we will shut down on Saturday.&rdquo; I often regret that we did not harden our hearts and deal with that situation, but we did not want to see the men turned out on the eve of Christmas and we gave way.  I would have taken over that factory and taught them that they had a responsibility to the men who worked in it as well as to their own pockets.  But the one thing they were determined on was that if their profit was not provided for there would be no work and there would be no production, and it never dawned on any one to say: &ldquo;Your duty is to tighten your belt, lower your standard of living, sell your Chrysler car and go around in a Ford Anglia.&rdquo; They would have laughed at him.  Their answer was: &ldquo;No profits, no work.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Not if I had the handling of it.  It is a privilege by which the tariff racketeers put a charge on the farmers.  What I object to is this.  If you want to run rackets of that kind, at least exempt the raw materials of the agricultural industry from their depredations.  I believe that if we had the right to operate the agricultural industry in this country without an increased cost on its raw materials thrust down upon it, we could carry them all.  But I am warning this House that if the raw materials of the agricultural industry are to be perenially enhanced in price and our farmers are required to sell competitively in a foreign market, we are walking head on into disaster.</P>
      <P>There is no use telling me that if you increase the price of netted wire, if you increase the price of barbed wire, if you increase the price of timber, if you increase the price of cement, if you increase the price of feeding stuffs, if you increase the price of fertilisers, that that has no effect on the agricultural industry.  Think for a moment of the camel's back.  You can lay on straw by straw by straw and the camel staggers on, but when you lay on the last straw and the camel falls, it is not only the camel who dies in the desert but the man who is riding it dies with it.  As sure as we are in this House, the whole Irish nation is riding through a dangerous desert on the back of the agricultural camel, and it would be well for those who depend on the camel's survival that they should see in time the peril of continuing to raise these costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was reading an oration delivered by the Tánaiste recently.  The brazen-faced audacity of that man fills me with awe.  He took upon himself to deliver a lecture to agriculture to remember that the days of the feather-bed were over.  My God; feather-bed ! Think of all the crazy structures that man has been responsible for erecting in this country, not on a <Col N="2048" /> feather-bed, but on a feather mountain, and if you take one feather out of the mountain the whole structure he has put up will come cracking round his ears.  Think of the agressive insults of some of the tariff racketeers in this country, who demand not only a 90 per cent. tariff but a quota so as to ensure that if anybody resists their demand, if any consumer hesitates to pay their maximum demand he will be brought face to face with the fact that he will either pay their demand and like it or do without, because our own Government will say that no more than a certain limited quantity of that commodity is permitted into the country. If the consumer is not prepared to pay the racketeers' price for the substitute he will blooming well do without it, and then I am told that agriculture should get off its feather-bed.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is carrying about 40 feather-beds on its back and on top of each feather-bed is reclining a stout industrialist and, not infrequently, he is riding round the feather-bed in a Chrysler or Rolls Royce to show how independent he is.  Agriculture is told by the Tánaiste, the patron of these gentlemen, that it must get off the feather-bed.  We are told that the Minister for Agriculture is going to open negotiations with the British Government for a new trade agreement in January and he is going to London to discuss with the British Government prices for Irish agricultural produce with a notification from the Deputy Prime Minister of Ireland that agriculture is on a feather-bed and it is time for them to wake up and get off it. What will he say in London when that <i>obiter dictum</i> is produced and he is asked to face reality and to realise that his own far-seeing colleague discerned the fact that his predecessor, Deputy Dillon, put them on a feather-bed and it is damn well time to wake from Deputy Dillon's feather-bed and face the hard realities referred to by the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass?  It is nearly as stimulating as the Taoiseach was on the eve of the National Loan when he said that he was going to run a national loan every 12 months.</P>

      <P>I wonder how many people in the Department of Industry and Commerce or how many of the people who frequent that Department would care to join with us on our feather-bed?  There is not an industrialist in this country who would not die of starvation in six months on the feather-bed to which the Tánaiste, Deputy Lemass, referred.  There is not a small farmer in Ireland who would not retire in affluence after five years in trading under the conditions which the most minor industrialist habitually enjoys at the expense of the farmers at the present time.</P>
      <P>Let us have no more talk about the agricultural community living on a feather-bed.  The previous Government got for the farmers of this country from the British Ministry of Food no more than they were entitled to, and it was no feather-bed.  If Fianna Fáil has any idea in its mind that it is a feather-bed, they had better wake up to the facts of life.  If they claim that the small farmers are to go back to the level of peasants, they ought to remember the advice I gave Mr. Webb, the British Minister of Food: &ldquo;You will get no more cheap food from Ireland; if you reduce the price you are prepared to pay, you will get no eggs from Ireland.&rdquo; If this Government proceeds on the assumption that they can continue to whittle away the margin of profit available to farmers on their production, by raising their costs of production steadily, they are going to wake up one day, when it is to late, to the fact that the land of this country has gone over to subsistence farming and there will be no surplus margin for the trade unionist, the industrialist, the public servant or the professional man to live out of.  And remember, if that happens twice in our time, it will take much better men than anybody in this House to put it right.  That is a very grave thing to realise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government came in, consider what has been done.  We put prices of essential feeding stuffs anything from £6 to £10 a ton higher than anything our competitors in the British market have to pay.  We put a tax on fertilisers.  We raised the <Col N="2050" /> tax on a tractor drawing milk to the creamery from £6 10s. to £36 per annum.  We are about to pass a Bill through the House which will levy a further £100,000 on the rates chargeable on land.  We are going to increase the rates by at least 2/- and it may be 5/- per £ per annum in respect of the Health Act.  All that expense has to be met out of agricultural production on the land and out of the profit.  We all know by experience of compulsory wheat that there is only one way to get production out of the land and that is to make it profitable. Surely it is time we woke up to the fact that, if we make every branch of agriculture unprofitable the whole thing will dry up, with consequential disaster for this country.</P>
    <P>Do you remember the time you were told the method of resolving our balance of trade difficulties was a reduction of imports?  That is when it was fashionable to say nothing could be hoped for from an expansion of exports.  Have any of you looked at the trade returns?  Deputy MacEntee, I rejoice to understand, is rapidly returning to his full and normal health and we may expect to see him active in the public arena again at an early date.  Most of us in the House appreciate that, after the hard knocks which are given and taken in this House, underneath we entertain for one another a warm solicitude.  Deputy MacEntee stated publicly that by reducing domestic consumption he hoped to redress the balance of trade by reducing imports.  He, accordingly, formulated a proposition that our people were eating too much and living too well.  He raised the price of all foodstuffs and most commodities our people consume, so that they would be able to afford less and thus cut down imports.  He then proceeded to point to the trade returns and say: &ldquo;Behold! Imports have gone down.&rdquo; He hoped that nobody would discover that one of the reasons for the decline in the volume of imports was that the stockpile, the existence of which he vigorously denied, was being used up.  His colleague, the Tánaiste, proceeded to produce the stockpile as his alibi for the unemployment that was beginning to manifest itself and the alibi for the <Col N="2051" /> unemployment was the stockpile: &ldquo;There can be no production until we have used up all that we have here.&rdquo; So Fianna Fáil used up the stockpile.</P>
    <P>Now look at the trade returns. Domestic&mdash;total imports: June, 1952, £11.45 million; June, 1953, £14.46 million; July, 1952, £12.62 million; July, 1953, £15.61 million; August, 1952, £9.88 million; August, 1953, £13.07 million; September, 1952, £11.89 million; September, 1953, £13.40 million; October, 1952, £15.05 million; October, 1953, £18.44 million.  The stockpiles are gone and the imports are now running from 20 to 30 per cent. in excess of what they were last year when the stockpiles were under process of consumption.  What would have happened to us already if the dismal forecast of the 1951 White Paper had not been belied by the events?</P>
    <P>The 1951 White Paper could see no hope of any early contribution by exports to the solution of the balance of payments problem.  But what is happening? The domestic exports were: May, 1952, £7.17 million; May, 1953, £9.14 million; June, 1952, £8.13 million; June, 1953, £9.18 million; July, 1952, £7.88 million; July, 1953, £9.86 million; August, 1952, £8.50 million; August, 1953, £9.57 million; September, 1952, £9.43 million; September, 1953, £11.27 million; October, 1952, £9.06 million; October, 1953, £10.40 million.</P>
    <P>By the end of this year our exports will have attained the total of £105,000,000 sterling.  Ask yourselves what they were in 1947?  Ask yourselves, if the trend in 1947 in our exports had continued, where would we be to-day?  On our beam-end.  Ask yourselves what is going to happen if the present trend in import prices and volume continues.  Remember this. Import prices have been steadily falling. Look at the volume of imports. The increase in June over last year is 33 per cent. in volume; the increase in July is 30 per cent.; in August, about 40 per cent.; in September&mdash; speaking now in terms of volume&mdash;it is from 4.14 to 4.71.  Look at the increase in the volume of exports in every one <Col N="2052" /> of the months, beginning in June: June, from £3.12 to £3.60 million; July, from £2.71 to £3.41 million; August, from £2.83 to £3.15 million; September, from £3.16 to £3.78 million. What would have happened to us if the increase in our agricultural exports had not redressed the balance of our increased imports and in addition&mdash; and lots of people forget this&mdash;replaced £4,000,000 worth of exotic exports represented by sweetened fat and minced meat&mdash;which disappeared completely&mdash; and the gap left there by it had to be filled before our agricultural exports showed anything upwards on the previous year on the total figure.</P>
    <P>I am asking this House to face this problem.  Either we make it an absolute economic rule of this State that no fiduciary measures by the executive and no legislation of this House will operate to increase the cost of agricultural industry or we shall all perish.  I add, as an addendum to that, that if that rule be accepted and the same agricultural policy is pursued in the future, we have here in this country the prospect of a better living&mdash;I am saying &ldquo;a better living&rdquo;&mdash;I am not saying a richer living or a more remunerative living, but a better living for our population than is available in any country in the world&mdash;and I include the U.S.A. Denmark, Holland, or any place else you like to name.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to see our people adopt the standard of living acceptable to the Danes or the Dutch.  I have no comment or adverse criticism at all to make about it except to say that I would be a damn sight happier as a farmer in rural Ireland than I would be as a farmer in Jutland or in Holland. Let the Danes and the Dutch have any kind of life they want, but if any man in our country wants to swop our way of living with that of the Danes or the Dutch then I think he is just crazy. Our method of life and our system of living is much preferable to that obtaining in the U.S.A.  Others may disagree with that statement.  That is why a great many people go to America although they have perfectly comfortable homes here in Ireland.  They want to go.  I have no complaint about it.  In our day, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle <Col N="2053" /> and I went to the U.S.A. and we came back again.  Plenty of others stay there and they have as much right to stay there as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I had to come back.  Is it not madness to throw away that potentiality for the want of thought?  I wonder if it is for the want of thought or whether it is some crazy malice.</P>
    <P>Let me draw the Taoiseach's attention to a very strange transaction.  The Taoiseach may remember that while we were in office I formulated the parish plan.  The purpose of the parish plan was to bring within easy reach of every farmer in Ireland the most modern technical training available for the exploitation of the land.  That plan was contemptuously rejected by Fianna Fáil.  Yet, last week, I saw that the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Education went down to Boherbue and announced that one of the greatest revolutions in agricultural practice in this country was the making of agricultural instruction of a high degree of efficiency immediately available to approximately a thousand farmers supplying Boherbue creamery. If the Minister for Education and the Minister for Agriculture consider that the greatest boon that could be conferred on the farmers in the Boherbue creamery supply area is to have brought within their reach the parish plan formulated by our Administration three years ago, why will the Taoiseach not tell his Minister for Agriculture to take out of the file in the Department of Agriculture the scheme that was formulated and that is ready for operation to-morrow?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was it not put through?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you.  It was one of the most damnable things ever done.  I got the 27 instructors appointed.  I was ready to take over South Tipperary, Longford and West-meath. A brat organised a strike because the salary scales available to agricultural instructors could not be fixed until there was a general realignment of the scales payable to all public servants.  The Appointments Commissioners appointed the men. When the fellows went down to get <Col N="2054" /> their warrants of appointment there were pickets outside, operated and run by a brat who was himself in a good job and is still in it.  That is the reason. It took me 12 months to circumnavigate that conspiracy, smash it and get back under way again.  Then, and only then, was the plan to go forward.  Then we went out of office and our successors said the whole scheme was a fraud. All I am asking is that we do for the three parishes in every part of Ireland what the Minister for Education say is eminently desirable in Boherbue.  I agree with them 100 per cent.  I would be delighted to see my successor acquiring all the kudos of the groundwork I did in that regard.  The maps are there, the counties are divided up into parishes, the whole administration is devised.  Even the officer technically qualified to administer the plan is there in the Department, I believe, with nothing to do at present.  He is there for that purpose&mdash;to run the particular kind of instruction and technical services identical with those envisaged for the Boherbue creamery administration area.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with the Minister for Education and the Minister for Agriculture. The key to increased production is not compulsion, not telling the farmers where to get off but putting within their reach, for those who want it, access to the best methods and to the best information and providing the link with the Department of Agriculture which will bring the farmer on his land into contact with the admirable schemes made available by the Department of Agriculture but which it is extremely difficult to get the farmers to bring into operation on their own holdings partially because they do not know about them and partially because they have nobody in the locality to explain them to them.  Do Deputies realise this astonishing fact?  When I wanted to communicate to the farmers of this country the value and the urgent need for the use of phenothiazine and hexachloroethane, I had no means of contacting them except by sending out ½d. postcards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sent out about 250,000 halfpenny postcards because there was no other <Col N="2055" /> way in which I could communicate directly with our farmers.  I had to get the postman to bring a postcard to their homes and to drop it in their letter-box&mdash;a postcard explaining the value of these two things.  The Minister for Agriculture has no direct contact of any sort, kind or description with the farmers of this country. If he wants to communicate with any farmer on any particular problem he must detach a member of his staff and send him down the country with a special assignment.  The Minister for Agriculture has no means of making direct contact with the farmers of the country at all.</P>
    <P>In my judgment, the Taoiseach is daft about most things but, in regard to matters of education, he is usually pretty rational.  It is a source of constant surprise to me.  On this matter of agricultural education, I assure him, he could with great advantage employ himself and the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Education.  If he will urge them to extend to other areas of the country exactly what is being done in Boherbue, he will make a greater contribution to agricultural production than anything else done in the 16 years of his first administration and the two years of his second.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to what I regard as the second fundamental economic fact in our lives.  It is not how much money the Irish Government think it expedient to borrow at any time that matters so much.  What really matters is what they spend the money which they borrow upon.  We can borrow money with great advantage and spend it on the capital development of this country, in the confident anticipation that our expanding national income derived from increased production will carry the burden without the slightest difficulty, if we spend the money right; but if we borrow money and fritter it away, we can cripple the country, or if we admit the principle that the moneylenders of this country have the right to hold the community up to ransom for 5 per cent. interest on the money they require for national development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2056" /> Remember that the acting-Minister for Finance has laid it down that the sole reason we elected to pay 5 per cent. on the National Loan was that the Irish Government thought it was a good thing to give any investor in that National Loan an attractive return on his money.  That is his own testimony repeated and emphasised. What does that mean?  That policy resulted in the past two years in this phenomenon that a young man who got married in 1949 and borrowed money from a local authority under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act wherewith to build a house for himself and the family he hoped to raise, who bought the land, built the house and went into possession was told: &ldquo;You will have to pay 22/6 per week for 30 years and then the house is yours,&rdquo; while his brother, three years later, who bought an identical piece of land side by side, who borrowed from the same local authority and who built the very same house, subject to this consideration, that the cost of building materials had come down in the meantime, was told, on going into that house, that he would have to pay 32/6 per week over the same period of years.</P>
    <P>Who in this House does not know that hundreds of such fellows gave up hope of building their houses and joined the queue of people asking the municipality to build houses for them, with two consequences?  The first was that on every house not built under the Small Dwellings Act the municipal authority and the Government lost £500, because it cost the municipal authority and the Government £500 more to provide a municipal house for rent for that man than it would have cost them to help him build a house for himself.  The other consequence is that a friend of mine living with his wife and two children, one an infant of about four months and the other two and a half years, in a single tenement room in Dublin is told, when he asks for a house, that they cannot even consider his case for another 18 months because of the queue of people who are living six and five in a room who must be provided for before they can attend to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2057" /> Can anything be dafter in a sane community?  Can anything be dafter when we have money, raw materials, idle men, condemned to the labour exchange or to emigration, and fellows wanting to get married and to build their own houses, than to say: &ldquo;No, we will not let you.  We are going to lend £62,000,000 sterling to the British Government so that their citizens can build houses at 2 per cent., but if you want to borrow money, you must pay 6 per cent.&rdquo;?  Is that not daft?  The British Government have before Parliament now a Bill identical with the Bill which Deputy Keyes brought in here when he was Minister for Local Government, providing that, if a man can put down £100, the British Government will either advance the money to him to build his house or will indemnify the building society who are prepared to advance only 80 per cent. of the valuer's value of the house.  The British Government say: &ldquo;Give him the balance, and, if he puts down £100, you carry the risk of 80 per cent. of your valuer's valuation and we will indemnify you for the differential.  We want to provide that young men earning weekly wages who have a reasonable prospect of being able to pay the rent and who put down £100 are certain to get the necessary finance at a price they can afford to pay to build their houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is in a country where building is most rigorously controlled because there is a shortage of workers, a shortage of materials and a shortage of money&mdash;they are borrowing money from us&mdash;but here in our country where there is a surplus of materials and of money&mdash;we are lending it to Great Britain&mdash;and a surplus of unemployed men who are emigrating to Great Britain to build houses for the British people, we say: &ldquo;No, not less than 6 per cent., and, if that means 32/- per week which you cannot afford to pay, go and live in a tenement room.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here, however, is the most remarkable miracle of all.  Look around the House at Deputies on every side.  There is not one who wants that, except the Minister for Finance and the acting-Minister for Finance, one of whom is <Col N="2058" /> ignorant and the other silly.  Not one average common sense Deputy who lives amongst his neighbours, either in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or any other Party in the House, wants that; but there is a kind of mysterious enclave into which the common people must not intrude and at the portals of which Deputy Aiken and Deputy MacEntee stand like Gog and Magog, except that one is a big Gog and the other a little Magog, saying: &ldquo;Let none of you enter here where angels fear to tread, and we are the angels. Keep out&mdash;you must not discuss these matters.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>They did not.  You had a silly, vain little man as Minister for Finance who wanted to present himself to the country as a pillar of orthodoxy greater than the crisis that confronted him.  He sold that gag to the Fianna Fáil Government who knows as much about public finance as my foot.  It was only when they were in it up to their necks that it suddenly dawned on them they were travelling a ruinous and iniquitous path.  Why did they swallow it?  Here is something which I think is shocking and wicked.  I believe the Taoiseach was party to it.  I think he committed a crime.  I think he did all <Col N="2060" /> that as part of their dirty campaign of trying to denigrate the work we did. I think they did all that in order to provide circumstantial evidence for the allegations they were making that we had crippled the national finances and had been recklessly spending the assets of the nation.  In order to lend verisimilitude to that slander they made an announcement.</P>
      <P>First of all, let us remember the story.  They said they would not have enough money to pay civil servants at the end of the year and that they dare not float a loan in the autumn of 1951, as Deputy McGilligan had declared his intention of doing.  Actually, while he was going out of office he converted a 5 per cent. loan to a 3½ per cent. basis. He got two-thirds to three-quarters of the total loan converted.  The following autumn his successor said he dare not seek a loan and he spent in five months £24,000,000 in cash that we left for him out of the American Loan Counterpart Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He said we left him in debt until we nailed that to the desk. In the autumn of 1952 he went to the country and borrowed money at 5 per cent. and the loan has ever since stood at a premium.  The consequence of that decision which Deputy Aiken said from these benches three days ago was taken freely by the Government was to throw thousands of men into the ranks of the unemployed builders' labourers, thousands as emigrants to Great Britain and it prevented hundreds of people from building houses who would otherwise have built them.  It drove a number of small contractors themselves into the ranks of the unemployed. I met a small contractor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He was now bankrupt and had to seek a job himself, and all that because Deputy Aiken, the acting-Minister for Finance, said they determined it was a good thing and that if people were going to lend the Government money <Col N="2061" /> they should get a good rate of interest on it.</P>

      <P>A national development fund is to be established by statute if you please. We are planning to borrow £43,000,000 this year for capital works but we had to pass a Bill to borrow £5,000,000.  We know what that is for&mdash;the two by-elections. Remember the biscuit factory in Ballina?  &ldquo;Vote for Deputy Calleary and you will all eat chocolate biscuits in Ballina.  Vote for Deputy Lahiffe and you will all be making frills in Loughrea.  Vote for whoever they are going to put up in Cork and Louth and there is £5,000,000 of good public money.&rdquo; Can you picture them licking their chops already as to how that is going to be spent but in case there should be any doubt about it the Tánaiste has taken up the theme already?</P>
      <P>He says that he is going to borrow £1,000,000 from the Development Fund for the roads.  Is it necessary to pass a Bill to establish a development fund to get £5,000,000 in order to borrow £1,000,000 for the roads? There is £500,000 for urban and rural improvements schemes so that Dundalk and Drogheda can be catered for with the right hand and Dunleer, Louth and Ardee can be catered for with the left hand.  And in case anybody should be overlooked there is a further sum for minor drainage works.  Under what statute?  The Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>

      <P>Did those minor drains cease to carry water since 1951?  We heard of the chosen people coming to the shores of the Red Sea, the waters of which rolled back and they walked <Col N="2062" /> dry-footed across it.  Was there a miracle performed on the minor drains of Louth from 1951 to the eve of the Louth election?  Were they all dried up at source until the by-election began?  Why was it deemed expedient to stop the Local Authorities (Works) Act two years ago and borrow £500,000 to start it again to-day?  Is not that good substantial evidence of malice? Was it not stopped because they wanted to represent the thing as being ineffective and unprofitable?  Why have they slowed down the land project?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What was their first great executive act in respect of the land project when they came into office?  I am told, though I have never seen it, that Deputy Thomas Walsh so far degraded himself&mdash;I am going to state his further title though he ought to be ashamed of this gesture as a Minister&mdash;as Minister for Agriculture as to make an executive Order under some statute with a long title changing the name of the land project.  Can you believe that?  An Order has been made, sealed with the Minister for Agriculture's official seal, signed by Thomas Walsh, Minister for Agriculture, changing the name of the land project.  That was his first contribution to the work.  His second contribution was to announce that he wanted to sell the machinery; and the third contribution, to announce that the whole project in Connemara was a fraud and that he proposed to wind it up.  And he made a bold bid to wind it up until the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Bartley, came up from Connemara and said: &ldquo;My life would not be worth an hour's purchase if you stopped the project in Connemara,&rdquo; and I am sure Deputy Duignan had a word in season to say, too, about it.  But whatever was said by either of them the project is going ahead in Connemara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach may be told that work under the land project is not being damped down.  Would he be surprised to hear&mdash;for I would be glad to send him the letter if he would&mdash;<Col N="2063" /> that a farmer who put in his application to have his land drained in County Waterford on the first day the project was made to apply to that county received a letter within the last couple of months telling him that although the pipes had been piled on his land two years ago, as certain outlets required to be cleared before the land could be suitably drained and the limitations of public finance forbade the undertaking of the clearing of these outlets in this year, the work on his farm had not been undertaken heretofore and could not be contemplated until next year, three and a half years after he had put in his first application?  Remember, probably one of the reasons why the outlets could not be cleared was that you suspended the Local Authorities (Works) Act with which the land project was interlocked and working closely.  The Waterford County Council would have cleared these outlets and all these works on the various farmers' places could have been undertaken once these outlets had been cleared but you wound up the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would send for those responsible for the project and ask them how many applications they have filed with which they could have dealt if they had not been told to stop.  Perhaps he would ask the Deputies of his <Col N="2065" /> own Party to tell him how many representations they have had from their own constituents about applications to have land drained which are outstanding for over three years.  I put it to him&mdash;unless there is a very different rule obtaining in his Government from that which obtained in the Government of which I was a member &mdash;if the attention of the then Taoiseach was drawn to the fact that applications were waiting for three years to have the benefit of the scheme which was supposed to be administered by my Department, I think Deputy Costello would have inquired from me, as Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;How is it that the people who applied three years ago to benefit under a scheme administered by your Department can write to me and enclose a letter from officers of your Department to say that the work cannot be contemplated for another 12 months, although you, as Minister for Agriculture, authorised the deposit of drainage pipes on their holdings three years ago?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the face of those facts will anybody deny that the project was slowed down?  I think you did these things for no other purpose than to denigrate your predecessors.  That was a criminal wrong.  That exceeds the bounds of decent politics.  You have no right to leave people in tenement rooms; you have no right to deny a farmer the opportunity of having his land rehabilitated in order to lend verisimilitude to the slander you wish to promulgate that your predecessors dissipated the national resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could speak on many things but I would like to focus the attention of the House on these two fundamentals if I could: if you go on raising the cost of production in the agricultural industry you will destroy us all.  If you continue on the principle that it is right to pay 5 per cent. or 4¾ per cent. for money borrowed to develop our own country while you are lending it to Great Britain at 2 per cent. you are defeating the best interests of our people; and as an addendum to that if you borrow money and then spend it to buy votes in by-elections you will ruin this <Col N="2066" /> country irretrievably.  You charged us, when we were in office, with dissipating the resources of this nation, and you said that when you came into office you found debts without the wherewithal to pay them.  We demonstrated that there were no debts, but that there was £24,000,000 of cash money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Observe the old war horse how he skips from debts to commitments.  That is a jump we made you take in Wicklow&mdash;off the debts, on to commitments.  Yes, you found millions of pounds worth of commitments that we proudly and confidently made, resolutely determined to fulfil them to the last farthing.  Show me a single one of them that you brought into this House to cancel.  There is a challenge.  This is the Taoiseach's Estimate, and I glory in the fact that when he came into office in 1951 he found millions of pounds worth of commitments into which we had proudly and resolutely entered in the name of the Irish people.  Show me a single one of them that Fianna Fáil brought into this House to cancel.</P>
      <P>I will give now a catalogue of the commitments that we found when we went into office, that we brought into Dáil Éireann and said: &ldquo;There is a commitment that our predecessors entered into and we are now going before the people to cancel it; we are not going through with it.&rdquo; We found a plan to buy Constellations and to operate them.  That was a commitment that we brought into this House and we cancelled it.  We said that we would not keep that commitment.</P>

There was another commitment that we found when we came into office. C.I.E. was building a bus station, and it was going to cost them, was it £3,000,000?  We got notice from C.I.E. that they had no money to buy coal to run the engines.  We wanted to know what they were going to buy the coal for.  We said there was no use in having a bus station if they had no buses to run into it, and that they ought to buy oil for the buses.  We bought the bus station, and we planned to take the civil servants out of Árus Brugha and put them into the bus station.  We said that we could evacuate the Castle and so dispose of Fianna Fáil commitment No. 2.  There was another commitment.  There was a plan to spend £9,000,000 on Dublin Castle.  In connection with it, there was a beautiful model which had cost £1,500 to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we came in that model was there.  It took up the whole of the table in the ante-room to the room where the Government met.  It was so big that there was not room on the table to write a halfpenny postcard. The plan was to spend £9,000,000 on the Castle.  That was commitment No. 2.  We came into Dáil Éireann and we cancelled that.  We said that it could wait until we saw how many civil servants we could evacuate from the Castle, from Árus Brugha and from 17 other buildings in the city.  We said that, when we had evacuated the College of Science and had provided alternative accommodation for University <Col N="2068" /> College outside the city, there would be much more accommodation for civil servants, and that we were not going to spend £9,000,000 on Dublin Castle.  We cancelled that commitment. We told C.I.E. that we would take over the bus station.  If we had not taken it over it would never have been built, because C.I.E. had not the money to pay for the slates, the glass or the cement to cover the steel girders that had been put up.  Deputy Norton took it over, paid for it and made it available for the Department of Social Welfare.  That was commitment No. 3. These were the commitments that we brought into Dáil Éireann and cancelled them.</P>
      <P>We had debts of £10,500,000 which our predecessors had left us and which Deputy McGilligan had to repay out of the £12,000,000 which he raised by way of a public loan in the autumn of 1948.  We paid them.  Then we had coal sailing up the Liffey to us in boat-loads. We did our level best to cancel that commitment.  In connection with it we were told: &ldquo;No, that is a contract and there is Government signature to that contract.&rdquo; Deputy MacEoin used to be interviewed every now and then and asked when was the commission going to be paid on that contract.  We did our best to turn back the boats which were coming up with African coal.  We found that we could not turn them back, and we had to pile the coal in the Phoenix Park, where it poisoned the ducks in the President's pond, and, having buried the ducks, we had to pay commission on the blooming coal. Then we found that we could get no one to burn it.  It was African coal.</P>
      <P>There was another commitment which we tried to cancel.  Some Deputies may have forgotten this one. When we came into office logs were coming into the Park at the rate of 200 tons a day, or was it 1,000 tons a day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not make it 1,000,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach can check the figures, but everyone knew that the State was losing a very large sum on every ton of logs that was coming in.  Was there an impending fuel <Col N="2069" /> shortage in the city at that time?  Was there the danger that grates in humble homes would go without supplies? There was a certificate from the Department of Supplies to the effect that there were enough logs in the Phoenix Park to furnish a prospective demand for logs in the City of Dublin for the next ten years, and that it was then a problem of extreme complexity to know where they would put the blooming logs.  We asked: &ldquo;Well, if that is so, why do the logs keep coming in?&rdquo; We discovered that a decision had been taken to stop the logs on the eve of the by-elections in 1947.  And then somebody said: &ldquo;Oh my God, such a time to stop the logs coming in! Let them come!&rdquo; And they got such a shock in the two by-elections that they forgot all about the logs and they kept coming in, like the dip candles in Windsor.  It was like the time that George III ordered that 1 lb. of dip candles be delivered to Windsor in 1750 and they kept coming in.  The dip candles were forgotten about until 1847 when Prince Albert discovered that they were still being delivered.  Similarly they forgot here that the logs were coming in, from where they were coming and where they were going.</P>
      <P>We stopped the logs.  That was a commitment of Fianna Fáil, and we came into Dáil Éireann and told Dáil Éireann that it was a commitment of Fianna Fáil which we proposed to terminate.  That is the way to deal with commitments.  Let me ask this question of the Taoiseach who says he found commitments from our Government when he came into office&mdash;I have catalogued for him a tithe of the commitments we found when we came into office and had to cancel&mdash;let him catalogue for me one single commitment that he found in the whole of the Government that he thought it prudent or right to cancel when he came into office?  There was not one.  There was not one that he dared to cancel.  He discovered on examination that every one of them was good for Ireland and the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is a very orderly Deputy as a rule except when he shakes down that lock in front of his brow and then he is liable to become skittish.  Well, it is no thinner than my own.  If he wants to make Delphic interjections I cannot complain, but I do not know what he means when he says his attitude was not the same as mine.  I regard him as the greatest curse and affliction that ever came upon the Irish race and I would regard it as catastrophic if he and I had the same attitude or if we thought alike.  The fact that he is the greatest curse and affliction of the Irish people does not alter the fact that he is a very agreeable man with whom to spend an evening.  Apart from that I would not expect to find him thinking as I do but I do not know to what particular aspect of our activities he refers when he makes that observation.</P>
      <P>My purpose is to prove that he found no debt when he came into office but that he found £24,000,000 of cash in the Loan Counterpart Fund and £6,250,000 of cash in the Grant Counterpart Fund and that he has the £6,250,000 of cash still and accrued interest thereon, and instead of going for a loan in the autumn of 1951 he elected to spend the £24,000,000 in cash that we left there as a reserve fund and postponed his borrowing to the autumn of 1952 when he negotiated it at 5 per cent. with the consequences I have described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So I ask him to grasp a simple fundamental economic fact that it is not the quantity of money spent that matters but how we spent it and on what terms we borrowed it.  I want to make a clear distinction between a commercial loan on the one hand and Government borrowing for national development on the other.  I want to ask this question in Dáil Eireann with fullest deliberation: where is the Deputy or the Minister who will get up to argue with me that it is right and proper, prudent and conservative for the British Government or the United States Government to borrow <Col N="2071" /> £600,000,000,000 sterling free of interest to purchase guns and ammunition and the machines of war, all of which are to be dissipated in smoke leaving no asset after them but victory (God bless the mark), and that it is criminal, reckless, revolutionary and Bolshevik to borrow money on similar terms to house your own people, to rehabilitate your own land, to hospitalise your own sick and to increase your own national income?</P>
    <P>I do not understand how that case can be made.  I do not understand how it is prudent or right to require the municipality of Dublin to pay 5 per cent. to an insurance company on a loan of 20 years' duration to house the people of our city while we lend £63,000,000 to the British Treasury at less than 2 per cent.  I do not see why it is right that the Government of this sovereign Republic should of its own volition elect to pay 5 per cent. to the moneylenders for money we require for the benefit of our own country while we lend three times as much to the British Government at 2 per cent.</P>

If he wanted to give him dollars, he could have gone to the Minister for Finance and said: &ldquo;Instead of buying prunes and raisins to make into mincemeat to send to Great Britain, buy dollars.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Very well.  He knows that in 1948 the European Payments Union was in dire distress for want of dollars.  In fact, they were buying more from the United States than they were selling to the United States and they had no dollars wherewith to pay. The Deputy knew that.  He also knew that his Government had made an arrangement to become a member of the Sterling Pool in 1932 or 1933 after Great Britain and the United States went off the gold standard.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want to know on what they were spent? They were spent on petrol because we did not want the Deputy travelling up and down to and from County Wexford on a bicycle.  They were spent on rubber.  They were spent on oil because we felt the Deputy might like to lubricate the wheels of a cart he might be using for fear they would screech going along the road.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not require it. There was a variety of commodities that we could not get anywhere else except in America, and we, therefore, wanted dollars.  We told the American Government we were prepared to take advantage of dollars for the purchase of these things on the clear understanding that when the terms of the loan provided that we should repay them we could not give any undertaking in the year after that we would have any dollars, but we would certainly have sterling; and the Americans replied: &ldquo;Is not that our headache? If we are prepared to lend the dollars and prepared to take the risk that you will only have sterling wherewith to repay them, why should you worry about that?&rdquo; We said: &ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; and we borrowed the dollars we required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened?  It is as well for Deputy Allen to understand this.  We wanted petrol.  A petrol importer purchased a tanker of petrol at Baltimore and he had to pay for that petrol in dollars.  He came to his own Government and his own Government lent him the dollars.  He took those dollars and paid them to the oil company at Baltimore and the oil company then released the tanker.  When the tanker <Col N="2075" /> sailed up the Liffey he sold its contents to garages all over the country and when the garages paid him for the petrol he came around to the Department of Finance and he paid into the Department the sterling equivalent of the dollars he had been lent.  That sterling was put into the Central Bank to have it there ready wherewith to repay the American Government when the debt fell due in respect of the Marshall Aid Loan.  Now, does the Deputy understand that?  There was never one penny net debt due by the Irish Government to the United States Government.  For every dollar we borrowed we had the dollar equivalent in sterling sitting in the Central Bank, there available to be drawn out to pay the Americans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>You got rid of all the dollars anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite mistaken.  I know the Deputy will find difficulty in grasping that.  But our forecast was right, because now the instalments are falling due and the Minister for Finance has no difficulty to-day in getting all the dollars he wants to pay every instalment as it falls due.  When he seeks the wherewithal to pay the instalment, the money wherewith to purchase the dollars to pay that instalment is there in the Central Bank to his credit. There is not a penny net debt&mdash;not one penny&mdash;and we had every dollar there on interest for five years. £48,000,000! Remember, if that money had been borrowed on the same terms as those upon which the Minister for Finance borrows we would have had to pay £12,500,000 in interest on it over the period for which we actually had it free of interest from the Americans. Now, does Deputy Allen say that was a bad bargain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Our problem is that we have too many dollars at the present time.  That is our problem.  Our problem is that we do not want all the commodities from the United States for which we have dollars available for <Col N="2076" /> purchase.  We would be entitled to draw more dollars from the Sterling Pool than we are actually drawing, if we wanted them.  Our problem is to put up a case for keeping our claim on the Sterling Pool alive.  Is it not time that Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party opened their eyes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did we not get value for that expenditure?  Remember, the Government did not spend a penny of it. Every penny of it was spent by businessmen who used it to import commodies that were necessary and that our people wanted.  Is not that what money is for?  Would the Deputy have preferred to have put it in a stocking? We used it to buy crawler tractors and machinery to develop our land.  We used it to provide the commodities that our people wanted.  Was that wrong? We thought it was right.  We thought it was a good thing to do.  Now the Deputy finds that there is money in the Central Bank wherewith to buy the dollars that are in abundant supply to pay every instalment that falls due, and there has never been the slightest embarrassment or difficulty in meeting these instalments as they fall due.  The Deputy has discovered two years too late that the whole business was a mare's nest, that he was made a fool of and sent down the country to prophesy that the country was going bankrupt.  But it did not go bankrupt. He was sent down to tell the people that the farmers were lazy and indolent and incapable of expanding agricultural production and that there was no prospect of expanding agricultural production or of doing anything to redress the balance of payments; this year he has discovered that our exports have gone up to £105,000,000.  It is not the sins the Deputy and his Party has committed that matter.  It is the sins they have in contemplation.  It is not too late to redeem his often perjured soul.  If the Deputy looks back on the litany of destruction the Government have wrought on this country over the last 20 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad that Deputy Allen reminded Deputy Dillon that it is rather a pity he had not in mind these excellent financial principles about which he has discoursed to us so long and so volubly, not to say tediously, when he and his colleagues were entering into their commitments for the borrowing of £48,000,000 in dollars, to which reference has been made.  Deputy Dillon spent a good part of his time twitting the Minister for Finance because he had the temerity to say that if we are to pay interest, let it be 5 per cent. or whatever it may be, it is better that our people should secure the benefit of that interest than the foreigner in Wall Street or Lombard Street or wherever he may be.</P>
      <P>Away back in 1935 Deputy Dillon warned us against the dreadful fate of countries like Newfoundland that had to go borrowing with their hats in their hands.  During the course of our term of office we have seen what happened to New Zealand, one of the most prosperous countries on the face of the earth from the agricultural point of view.  We have seen New Zealand and Australia in dire straits because they were unable to get their affairs in proper order and had to borrow in London to carry on their trade and economy.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dillon for his kind good wishes to my colleague, the Minister for Finance.  If he had been here I am sure he would have reminded Deputy Dillon of what he stated in this House on the 19th March, 1953&mdash; column 808:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Now, one of the very substantial items in the bill which the country <Col N="2078" /> will have to vote next year will be the sum of £1,200,000 to be paid as interest on the Marshall Aid Loan. As I have said before, if that loan had been raised in this country and the interest were to be paid free of tax as the interest on the Marshall Aid Loan is being paid free of tax it would have represented an interest rate of all but 5 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the interest&mdash;£1,200,000.  The question has been frequently asked in this House, where are the assets, where is the production as a result of the transactions in connection with that loan which will enable that interest of £1,200,000 per year to be cleared?  Remember that in 1956 not merely the interest but the principal on all these millions of dollars will have to be repaid, not in sterling but in dollars.</P>
    <P>Living in this fantastic fairy world where Deputy Dillon believes dollars can be had for the asking, does he believe that the Irish people are fools, that they are completely devoid of intelligence, that they do not understand that the great British Empire was brought almost to bankruptcy early in 1952?  Deputy Dillon and his leader&mdash;if he is his leader&mdash;Deputy Costello, have been trying to persuade us that we in this country are very badly off, that we are in a terrible plight, due entirely to the misdeeds and diabolical machinations of the present Government whose only interest and object in political life, apparently, is to discredit their predecessors even though by so doing they are injuring the interests of the country. We will fight Deputy Dillon and beat Deputy Dillon in any constituency, as we have fought and beaten his colleagues and himself in many an election on that question.  We can leave it to the Irish people to decide whether the leader of this Party and his colleagues are honest or not in the policy that they have put before the people and in the steps they have taken to right the situation, steps that they considered necessary since they came into office.</P>

      <P>We will declare the election when it is necessary.  When Deputy Costello came into office he went to the trouble of assuring the Irish people that he did not want elections, that elections were very expensive and costly, were upsetting to the trade of the country and created a great deal of uncertainty.  So long as the Government have a majority in this House and so long as they have not gone beyond the normal term of office it is a question entirely for them as to when they will go to the country.</P>
      <P>It is a perfectly scandalous state of affairs that a Deputy, a former Minister of a Government, should try to pour odium on the Minister for Finance because he paid those who invested in the recent Irish National Loans the interest which was necessary in order to raise the money. Deputy Davin may laugh.  Deputy Davin should read the newspapers and compare what the Australian Government had to pay recently for a loan of a much smaller amount of money, in London, with what we paid here.  They were not successful in rasing the finances they were looking for.  If Deputy Davin looks at the terms of the New Zealand loan he will see that they compare very favourably with the terms that we gave.</P>

      <P>We have no apology to offer.  If it would not be wearying the House too much I would quote the learned Senator Dr. George O'Brien, Professor of Political Economy in University College, Dublin whom Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance, called to his aid.  If Dr. O'Brien was satisfied with a policy and passed it as suitable then, of course, it was to be taken as absolutely A.1.  Senator Dr. O'Brien has recently given us certain facts to ponder.  He certainly has suggested that we ought to pay our people or whoever we can get to invest in our national capital development sufficient to enable us to raise the necessary funds.  I do not know what the alternative to that may be.  May I remind Deputy Davin, who is very fond of interrupting when these financial questions <Col N="2080" /> are under discussion, that when his friends over in Britain had charge of the affairs of that country they were forced under Sir Stafford Cripps to bring in large Budget surpluses amounting over a period of years to over £2,500,000,000 in order to finance capital expenditure?  You either have to finance it as they did through Budget surpluses or you have to raise it by way of loans, and in order to raise the necessary funds you have to pay the price that the borrower considers reasonable having regard to the competition which you will meet in the money market.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;let it be either State capital projects or private undertakings, but I would remind my friends on the other side that their adviser Dr. O'Brien has suggested&mdash; and I think his words merit careful consideration&mdash;that the credit of the country is an asset of great value indeed. Like many another thing when your money or your credit is good you do not value it, but the moment your credit goes, the moment your assets disappear and you are reduced to the position of making the very best terms you can with the foreign lender in order to try and secure funds from him at almost any cost to get you out of your difficulties, you will then realise the value of having your finances in order and your credit sound.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been reminded and advised over and over again by foreign experts who have studied our position in regard to our international trade and in comparison with the affairs of other countries to look, for example, to Switzerland.  How did Switzerland get <Col N="2081" /> into the position that a country like Australia goes to her to borrow money, that she is in the position that her currency is the hardest in the world, and that it can look the American dollar, even, in the face?  Has it attained that position by deficit budgeting, by not paying its way, or by establishing a name for itself in the world as a nation which will live up to its undertakings, which will see that its budget is balanced, that its currency does not depreciate, that its credit is unquestioned, and will take all necessary steps to see that its financial position is maintained in a sound condition?</P>
    <P>We have not that tradition.  We have to build it up, and the first task is to try to induce our own people first to buy Irish goods and, secondly, to invest their savings in Irish enterprise. Deputy Davin does not understand that even nationalised undertakings, even in socialist countries, must secure the necessary savings either through taxation, through contributions from the working population, or through loans, let them be forced loans or voluntary loans. Capital investment projects of the type that he would like and that we all would like to see brought into operation entail very heavy expenditure and the funds necessary are large for this country.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that they come to about £39,000,000 during the present year apart from the £5,000,000 which the Government is to provide annually for the National Development Fund.  That money has to be raised and has to be paid for, and it is not in the same category as industrial investment used to be, what is called equity investment, where the investor took the risk.  He saw what he considered was a good proposition and put his money into that proposition. If it succeeded and he got a good profit, well and good.  If through unexpected circumstances or competition or something else occurring he was not able to reap the profit he had anticipated and in fact he suffered a loss he had to put up with that. Under the system of State capital investment the charges on the Central <Col N="2082" /> Fund are very heavy.  They are about £2,000,000 larger in amount this year than they were last year.  All of that money is going to pay the charges on capital that has to be raised.  Deputy Davin and his friends are in the happy position that they can criticise and be wise after the event.  Whichever way the cat jumps and whatever way the story goes we may be sure they will have criticisms.  The Government after full consideration of all the circumstances in their negotiations with the banks in order to raise the funds that were necessary considered that the payment of the interest at the rate mentioned was necessary, and that is all there is to it.  We are a Government of collective responsibility, and it is just nonsensical to pretend that the Minister for Finance is doing something or carrying out some policy with which his colleagues are not in agreement.  In budgetary matters or in financial matters, while the responsibility rests mainly on his shoulders, undoubtedly he naturally takes into consultation and takes advice with his colleagues.</P>

The money in the Irish banks is the money of the Irish people, whether they be farmers or workers or business people.

It is their money and they are quite free to invest it where they wish.  We are doing our utmost to encourage them to invest it at home; but this is not a totalitarian State, and if you try totalitarian methods in this delicate and important matter I wonder whether you will get just the results you expect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a publication by an English <Col N="2083" /> economist, Mr. Durban, which has been described as a textbook to which the former Prime Minister of England had recourse&mdash;there are very few social economists, but being rather curious as to the lines on which they would work I read Mr. Durban's book &mdash;I find statements like the following: &ldquo;The only way in which accumulated capital can be financed is by withdrawal of part of the funds earned by the socialised industries through the workers employed in them to finance the capital items in the industrial budget.  Surpluses arising in socialised industries must not belong to the workers in such industries.  They must belong to the state.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Even if we went over to complete socialisation, we would still have this problem.  If we do not secure investment in the normal way through the well-recognised channels, then it will be found, as it has been found by the Labour Government in Britain, that to run nationalised industries, if finance cannot be raised in any other way it must be raised through the internal funds of the organisation of the industry and, if necessary, by contributions from the workers themselves. The myth that you can create credit and the necessary finance for the capitalisation of these industries out of nothing has been exploded.  Everyone knows that if the Central Bank, the banks as a whole or the financial institutions generally of this country were to adopt that policy, you would simply have runaway inflation.</P>

      <P>Neither the Department of Finance nor any of his colleagues knew anything about the land reclamation scheme until he went to some obscure part of the Midlands and, without taking cognisance of anybody, announced to the world this wonderful scheme for the reclamation of the land of Ireland over a ten-year period at a cost of £40,000,000.  He is learning now that there are farmers who applied to have work done under that scheme when it was first introduced who have not yet been reached, but how many thousands of applications did Deputy Dillon leave behind him when he left office?  Has he ever made a calculation as to how long it would take, working both the Government machinery and the other side of the scheme, before all the farmers who had sent in applications would be reached? If we were to take the figures of expenditure on the actual work of land reclamation and the amounts payable to farmers or about to be paid during the first few years that the scheme was in operation, it is quite obvious that the work would not be done in 20 years, 40 years or maybe 100 years. Even the thousands of applications that were in could not be reached for several years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This scheme was in operation before Deputy Dillon and his famous land project were ever heard of.  It was then called the land reclamation scheme and was operated by this Government for many years on a system under which we paid 50 per cent. of the cost of the actual work <Col N="2085" /> carried out by farmers for the improvement of their land.  That was not good enough for Deputy Dillon.  He must buy hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of machinery, create a bureaucracy, a regular hierarchy of officials, and have the situation that only one-fifth or one-sixth of the total expenditure in the early years went on the actual work, the remainder going into overheads and the provision of machinery.  How long would it take before the ordinary small farmer would have been reached under Deputy Dillon's wonderful scheme or did Deputy Dillon consider the small farmers and their circumstances at all when he was getting in all this machinery at an enormous cost?  Was he thinking of Pat Murphy in Mayo or Pat Jones in Kerry, I wonder, when he paid out as much as £100 per acre for the fertilisation of the rocks in Round-stone or £60 or £70 per acre for the reclamation of land belonging to large landholders, some of whom received many thousands of pounds?  Did he pay more for the reclamation of land than the Land Commission was paying for the most fertile land in this country when they acquired it?</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the present Minister for Agriculture took over this commitment that Deputy Dillon left behind him but he did take it over and he has succeeded in reducing the cost, not in any endeavour to discredit Deputy Dillon but because, as the Taoiseach pointed out, we must have regard to the value we are getting for the money.  The £2,500,000 we are spending on this land reclamation project must be measured against the various other schemes upon which £2,500,000 could be profitably expended, from the point of view of the employment given, the amenities created or the increase in the productive power of the country secured.  Therefore, the Minister for Agriculture, I suggest, was acting in the best national interest and in the interests of the scheme itself, if it were to be made rational and to have regard to the real circumstances of the country, particularly of the small farmers, in encouraging a situation by which we would get the farmers themselves to do the work, make their own arrangements with <Col N="2086" /> contractors and then recoup them to a greater percentage of the cost than they were actually getting under Deputy Dillon's administration.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage the farmers to do that we increased the grants.  We did that because we realised that it is the small farmers who should benefit by this scheme.  We realised also that the less administrative costs, the less overheads and the less bureaucracy you have and the more you get people themselves, whether they be the farming community or others, to operate these schemes themselves, the better they will be and the more efficient and the more economical in the long run.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go over again the historical references that Deputy Dillon has made to the Opposition when they came into office.  He said they found certain debts and he denies that they left debts behind them.  He first used the word &ldquo;debts&rdquo; and then changed it to &ldquo;commitments.&rdquo; The first thing I did when I became Minister in 1951 was to go down and tell the people in my constituency that very formidable financial obligations had been left by our predecessors upon our shoulders, and particularly upon the shoulders of the Minister for Finance, to clear up.  One of them was in regard to C.I.E. to which reference has been made.  C.I.E. was nationalised by the last Government but they took no steps either to increase the transport charges to enable that organisation to reduce its losses or to secure the necessary finances from the national Exchequer to have it subsidised.  Neither one thing nor the other had been done and when we came into office we found that there was a recoupment of interest amounting to £433,000 and there were losses amounting to £1,900,000 to be met.</P>
    <P>There was also the question of the Civil Service arbitration award.  It is true that the last Government could say that they left office before they had an opportunity of carrying into effect their intention of honouring the arbitration award.  They specifically promised, however, that they would carry the award into effect and we considered it necessary to fulfil that <Col N="2087" /> undertaking and we had to provide the necessary finances to do that.  To put that award into effect in the first year cost £3.6 million and in the following year about £3,500,000.</P>
    <P>There was also a sum of a £1,000,000 for old age pensions.  When, under pressure, the social welfare legislation was introduced by Deputy Norton, the then Tánaiste and Minister for Social Welfare, he had a clause introduced into it to satisfy the back bench supporters of some of the Parties, and secure their support for the measure by increasing the old age pensions.  No provision was made for that, and it cost, roughly, a £1,000,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon now, apparently, suggests that all the Government had to do when they came into office was to throw overboard commitments like those to C.I.E., the Civil Service and the old age pensioners.  He knows that that was quite impossible either politically or, I venture to say, morally. There are certain commitments which Governments enter into, and it would be dishonourable, whether we agree with them or not, and damaging to the national interest in a different sense if, except in very exceptional circumtances, Governments were just to refuse to carry out particular financial commitments of that kind entered into by their predecessors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello spent a good deal of time telling us how badly off the country was, but he admitted that. it is perhaps a little better off than it was last year.  With the exception of the general catalogue of complaints and platitudes, I find very little depth or very little of value in his contribution to the debate.  It bespeaks rather the advocate from the courts who hurriedly seizes a brief and uses it in the short time at his disposal to make his appearances in An Dáil to traverse the same ground he has already covered so frequently in the past few years.  In the first place, there must be more than a few people who are a little better off than they were last year.  Looking at the figures, I notice that the note circulation, which for the ten months ending in October, 1952, averaged £60.374 million per month, <Col N="2088" /> has risen in the corresponding period of 1953 to, £65.818 million, an increase of £5.4 million or 9 per cent.  There is, therefore, nearly £66,000,000 in circulation in each month and, presumably, it is being spent; it is being exchanged.</P>

      <P>The bank deposits during the first part of the present year increased over last year's figure by 6 per cent.  Even the railway receipts are up since January.  The chairman of C.I.E. has announced that he hopes the company will be £500,000 better off this year.  He has expressed his belief that when the new programme of capital construction is in operation it will be possible to bring about a reduction in the present heavy losses and he is hopeful that in time it may be possible to eliminate those losses altogether.  I am sure that we all wish the board every success in their efforts.  But, while C.I.E. is making progress, endeavouring to cut its losses and hoping to eliminate them altogether eventually, the number of private motor-cars in the country is increasing.  That is not a proof that we are in the terrible state of misery and penury which Deputy Costello suggests.</P>

      <P>He may be.  The number of new private motor-cars registered in the September quarter was 3,818, or 1,003, as Leperello would say in the opera, more than in the same quarter last year.  Last year the national income increased by £30.8 million or by 8.3 per cent. over 1951 to the figure of £404,000,000, and the real national income is estimated by the statisticians to have been 16 per cent. higher in 1952 than in 1938.  Due largely, no doubt, to increased agricultural output, the national income is steadily increasing, but the figures I have quoted represent only an income of £136 per head of our population, which is still low in comparison with the figure for other countries.  It is quite clear that a higher level of production and output and, therefore, an increased national income are necessary to maintain our economy in a prosperous condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon was referring to the dreadful things the Government were doing&mdash;how they were in league with the financiers, some extraordinary secret kind of organisation which the bankers have, as if the bankers are not, as I have mentioned, simply the custodians of the savings and deposits of the Irish people&mdash;he conveniently forgot, as did Deputy Costello, that we had a devaluation crisis which came on rather suddenly in 1949 and which seemed to take the previous Government unawares.  They had to take a hurried decision and they decided to follow the English example and devalue&mdash;there was no way out of it.  In doing so, just as in investing the Counterpart Fund moneys in sterling assets, they admitted that there was <Col N="2090" /> a certain situation there which it will take time to alter.  It cannot be altered overnight or suddenly.  That devaluation which the Irish Government felt themselves compelled to put into operation here was described by the present British Prime Minister as the penalty the British people had to pay for the failure to take proper measures in time.</P>
    <P>Later on, we had the Korean war, with the boom in prices&mdash;fantastic, in some cases.  There, again, the Government of the day got into rather a state of panic and instructed wholesalers, distributors and business people to stock up for all they were worth. We are still suffering the effects of that stocking up, that building up of huge stocks at a time when prices were reaching fantastic levels.  It was obvious that, when prices began to fall, there would be difficulty in liquidating these stocks and the cost of financing them and enabling the people who had these stocks to carry on with their business must have been very considerable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello went on to refer to unemployment figures and said that the percentage unemployment had grown here more than in other countries; but, in order to examine that question, I suggest one first has to ascertain what the basis and structure of the register of unemployed persons in other countries is.  For example in the Scandinavian countries it may be as I think it is the case that only those who are unemployed trade unionists are registered.  In this country, a very large number of rural people are registered&mdash;in normal times up to about 45 per cent&mdash;and in taking 1951 and comparing it with the present year Deputy Costello conveniently forgot as did all the critics of the Government who have used the increase in the figures on the live register as a means of trying to prove that unemployment has increased under this Government and so on, that a very large number of people are now registered, due to the operation of the Social Welfare Act of 1952 who were not registered before.  Persons of 65 years of age can draw unemployment benefit right up to 70 years.  That <Col N="2091" /> was one of the benefits granted to the working people under that Act introduced and passed into law under the guidance of the present Minister. That has brought a large number of people on the register.</P>
    <P>The means test has been extended and persons who were not eligible for benefit and assistance before are now eligible.  Moreover, a large number of people are on the register and still are not in receipt of assistance because their means are too high.  Let us take landholders, for instance.  A certain number of these will have been taken off the register during the currency of the Employment Period Order and will come back on the register, but these people may be in the category in which, although under the recent legislation they are in receipt of credits, and up to the passage of the Act should not have been on the register at all, they will not actually receive assistance until their time comes round again.  According to the official returns for mid-November, 1953, an increase of 3,265, as compared with last year, which is largely under the heading of agriculture, is attributed wholly to the operation of the Social Welfare Act and it has been calculated that, prior to the coming into operation of these Employment Period Orders&mdash;at that period of the year&mdash;a total figure of perhaps up to 6,000 persons were on the register who would not have been on it before the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>The live register does not tell us the numbers in receipt of unemployment assistance who were in employment last year.  It does not tell us whether they were in casual employment, how many have come on the register for the first time or how many have returned from Britain&mdash;I believe there is a large number&mdash;who are drawing their benefit here.  What we do know with regard to the numbers in insurable employment is that, on the 18th November, there were 495,270 men and 229,027 women&mdash;a total of 724,927&mdash;in insurable employment.  Last year's figure which, I admit, is not entirely comparable by reason of the fact that the Social Welfare Act has changed the conditions <Col N="2092" /> somewhat, was 500,000, and the figure at the same period in the previous year, 489,000.</P>
    <P>The Opposition, I suggest, are finding it difficult to have it both ways when they tell us they are delighted the farmers are receiving high prices for their produce, and, at the same time try to reconcile the desire we all have that the agricultural community should be as prosperous as possible with the argument that the Government are responsible for the increase in the cost of living, which is due in large measure to food prices.  Last night, we had a motion to have the question of milk prices considered before the costings commission reported, and the House did not feel it should take action until it had the full facts before it.  Deputy Costello stated not once but several times that the reason his Government left office was that they refused to increase the price of milk.  I believe that, milk being an essential foodstuff, particularly for children, and since milk has to compete with beef and various other products which I need not enumerate, those who tend animals and have their care day after day, week after week and month after month should receive an economic price for their produce.  I think they deserve it far more than other sections of the community who are clamouring either for relief or increases.</P>
    <P>In any case, it is recognised by all Parties that the State has a certain duty, let the level of prices for milk be what they may, to keep milk producers in production and, if possible, to increase yields and output, and it is recognised that the quickest and best incentive is the incentive of price.  In the case of wheat and beet, it is common policy that the prices guaranteed by the Government so far should be continued.  The increased acreage, the better yields and the satisfactory position with regard to these important crops means that we are going to have more sugar and more wheat and will be less dependent on foreign supplies, and, although it may involve adjustments and certain difficulties which will have to be resolved, nevertheless, the money will be in circulation <Col N="2093" /> in our own country, benefiting our farmers, our workers, our transport organisation and our towns.</P>
    <P>The agricultural price index has increased between September, 1952 and September, 1953 by 30 points, to 322 or roughly 10 per cent. and it is very satisfactory that the level of prices has been so good for farmers during that period.  It has had the consequence also, as we have seen in the case of eggs, that at certain periods the housewife may find it very difficult to pay the price demanded, but we cannot have it both ways.  If we want agriculture to be prosperous and want the farmers to get a good return, we have to put up with these difficulties, and I think that, on balance, the general national interest, the interests of the people as a whole, are better served by having a prosperous and, I hope, a very prosperous, farming community than otherwise.</P>
    <P>We have the example of the United States of America which has made it a firm keystone of its policy that the prices of farm products must be maintained. It may involve at certain periods a reduction in acreage, but the maintenance of economic and fair prices for the producers of farm products is the very basis of prosperity in the nation's economy.  The Government have, through many schemes in operation under the Department of Agriculture and otherwise, done a great deal to provide State moneys for amenities and conveniences for farmers. We would like to see ways and means devised by which assistance to the agricultural community would be directed into channels which would achieve the speediest return in the way of increased output from our land.</P>
    <P>No doubt, that is largely a matter for the farmers themselves.  It is a process of education that they should adopt better methods, but the Government has not neglected any occasion to bring home to them the importance of putting land under the plough and treating it with adequate supplies of limestone and fertiliser, if we are to get the best return and to be able to compare the output from the land of this country with what has been secured elsewhere.  The Minister for <Col N="2094" /> Agriculture recently referred to the main problem before Irish agriculture, that is, the stepping up of the yield from the areas under permanent grass. There are certain counties in the State which have a comparatively small amount of land under tillage&mdash;some of them perhaps only 8 per cent. and certainly less than 10 per cent.  There is no doubt that the country would benefit immensely, agriculture would be more prosperous and our productive capacity permanently improved, if we could get our farmers to bring the plough right around their farms and to use the various Government agencies which are there to assist them in improving their land, in fertilising it and getting the utmost out of it.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the work being done by the veterinary services and it is rather alarming that the Minister for Agriculture has had to call public attention to the fact that stock owners are not availing themselves of the facilities in existence.  He has reminded us recently that one of the most costly and damaging diseases of our live stock, contagious abortion, could probably be eradicated, if livestock owners would only take full advantage of the opportunities which offer and the facilities given for vaccination.</P>
    <P>I started my remarks by referring to the question of national investment and the problem of raising moneys to finance these large capital projects. Last year, current savings, estimated at £30,000,000 as compared with the disinvestment in the previous year, are stated by the official statistical returns to have financed up to 77 per cent. of our domestic capital requirements.  The Government would like to urge upon our people to invest their moneys in Irish enterprises.  They believe there is security here and a yield which cannot be equalled elsewhere and it was for that reason that, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, I called the attention of the Irish banks recently to the fact that the increase in their resources and assets enabled them to stock up their portfolios with larger holdings of national or municipal stocks.</P>

      <P>And the Central Bank, by law, has to exchange every legal tender note for sterling or vice versa. In my opinion, that situation can only be remedied when we have a position, as was recently suggested, in which we have established our credit and financial soundness as a nation in which foreigners will not be averse to, but rather will be attracted to invest in this country not alone because there will be political peace and security here but because they can rely on the Government of this State to fulfil their obligations to the last penny.  If they are interested in developing non-State enterprises, they will know that this is a State where free enterprise is welcomed, where private enterprise is encouraged and where all the incentives that the Government can reasonably give to investors from outside are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been unemployment, due to the recession following on the boom that I have referred to at the time of the outbreak of the Korean War.  Perhaps there may be another recession.  We are told that there is a downward trend.  It may not be significant.  It may be one of these adjustments which take place in the American economy.  However, it is very notable that European countries generally are up and doing.  They are not living in a fool's paradise, like Deputy Dillon, believing that dollars can be produced by some sleight of hand or by some conjuring trick.  They are doing their utmost&mdash;they are doing their damnedest, we might say&mdash;to increase their exports and their trade with the U.S.A.  They are doing their utmost also, to balance their trade with their neighbours on the Continent of Europe.  They do not intend to be taken unawares.  If it should happen that there is a change&mdash;and, as I have said, these changes can come rather suddenly&mdash; they will find themselves in a strong position because they will have <Col N="2096" /> measured up to the situation.  They will have strengthened their economies, their industrial and agricultural position and their productive capacity so that even if there should be a fluctuation or a falling-off in activity or in prices, they will still be able to carry on without suffering any serious or any permanent losses.  What we have to realise is that these changes can come very suddenly.  We hope no such change is coming.</P>
    <P>I believe that the outlook for Irish farming is bright and that a very prosperous future is in store for our farmers if they will only take full advantage of their present opportunities. But, as has been said by some of my colleagues and by others, with the decontrol measures that are about to take place in Britain, there will be an entirely new situation.  It is obvious&mdash;as has happened under the decontrol measures that have taken place up to the present&mdash;that there will be more freedom of choice, more competition and that the buyer will feel he is in a stronger position to exercise his choice and to leave his business and his custom, as the saying is, where it profits him best.  These matters will receive all the attention that is possible from the Government when the situation demands it.  But, in the long run, it is on the efforts of our producers themselves to improve their methods, to keep up with the times and to take advantage to the utmost extent of the schemes that have been provided for their benefit that this country will prosper.</P>
    <P>What is quite certain, in my view, is that unless we increase our output both from farm and factory and achieve a much higher level of production we will not, if there should be any recession or downward trend, be able to maintain our standards of living to our satisfaction.  If we do not throw our whole efforts into increasing our production, it will be doubtful whether we can maintain these standards and whether the State services and the benefits which are being conferred upon large sections of the population through the extension of social and health services, and other services, can be continued.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2097" /> I think we have reached the limit of what we can do with the present level of production.  Taxation is as high as it can be.  To reduce expenditure considerably and on a large scale is not easy but it is a matter to which the Government have given a good deal of attention during the past few years.  They realise that, there again, a general increase in the level of output and greater efforts on the part of all concerned will mean that the burden that has to be borne will be lighter upon the individual producer and the individual worker.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello suggested that taxation has been increased beyond all justice.  May I remind him that the purpose of the taxation is largely to provide benefits for those sections of the community which, under the Constitution, we have an obligation to assist.  The revenue is not raised for purposes that are not genuine, that are not necessary or that are not desirable in the general national interest.  The Deputy forgot to mention that even in the 1952 Budget the Minister showed his understanding of the situation of the white-collar workers, the middle class&mdash;who claim that they are not able to take advantage of the schemes and that they have not the facilities and the advantages which persons in business or in farming occupations often have&mdash; by increasing the allowance of those people who form such a large section of the income-tax-paying population.</P>
    <P>It was very amusing, also, when Deputy Costello and Deputy MacBride again went over the old well-trodden ground of trying to suggest that in some way the Government are responsible for a restriction of credit which, they alleged, the banks are carrying on in this country that Deputy Finan should be able to say that money is being provided&mdash;as it seems to be&mdash; and that credit is being made available for such projects as the building of cinemas.  The Deputy, who has as good an understanding of conditions in the Irish countryside as anybody else in this House, gave very little credence to the suggestion that if a project was a good one it would not merit consideration and not have the necessary <Col N="2098" /> finances provided to enable it to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the relations between the banks and their customers one thing is certain.  We will not permit our policy to be dictated by Central Banks or by anybody else in the banking world.  Deputy Dillon said&mdash; I think we can all re-echo his words in this particular connection&mdash;that this House is the authority and it is for this House to decide if they believe that the law should be changed in regard to banking or credit to do it.  But we have had commissions of inquiry. We have had examinations of these matters.  In the end there is no easy solution.</P>
    <P>Credit is only one aspect of the problem. There is organisation.  There is the provision of raw materials.  There is the training of the population for industry or for modern agricultural methods.  There is the provision of markets.  There is the putting of your products on the market in the most attractive way so that they will appeal to the consumer on the other side.  All these factors enter into the economic well-being of the country as well as credit.  If everything else in the economy were right and if everybody realised his duty to the community and to the country and tried to carry it out, I am quite sure that these difficulties that are stated to be there in regard to the provision of credit for worthy objects would be got over.</P>
    <P>No examples have been given.  We in the Government have not heard, recently, at any rate, of any such restriction. We know that there has been a restriction of credit in the building industry.  I do not know what foundation there was&mdash;there would seem to have been some foundation, but that was some time ago&mdash;for the suggestion that there was some holdup in the provision of credit for fertilisers and for farmers in getting on with their spring work.  I need hardly say&mdash;I am sure everybody interested will agree&mdash;that it is of the utmost importance to the country that farmers should get every possible facility by way of credit to enable them to carry on with their spring work and increase the output which is so badly required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate affords <Col N="2099" /> us an opportunity of dealing generally with Government policy or the absence of Government policy.  Most of my speech to-night will be devoted to the absence of Government policy.  Before I go into the details of economic disaster and lack of foresight and conception by the Government, I should like to deal briefly with the external situation that presents itself <i>vis-à-vis</i> ourselves and the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Reference was made here by other Deputies to the recent very regrettable arrest and imprisonment of an elected member of the Northern Parliament. I feel it necessary to inquire from the Government what policy they will pursue in relation to Partition.  I was not silent in recent years on the issue of Partition.  I constantly questioned the Government on that policy. I feel that we have arrived at a situation now where young men entering the political arena or the field of political thought in this country should know what our policy is, if we have any.</P>
      <P>I do not want to aggravate the situation.  I do not want in any way in this particular problem to try and embarrass the Government, but I feel the time has come when we should take some firm stand in relation to the outrages that are being perpetrated. Let us not blind ourselves to the fact that outrages are being perpetrated on the principles of democracy at our very doorstep.  I will not dwell on that subject.  It is one that might lead to a good deal of heat.  It is a subject that might tend to inflame a good deal of passion when one considers the full implications of this type of activity.</P>
      <P>I do not believe in paying lip service to our belief in the 32 Counties of Ireland.  I believe we have to make some gesture in the real sense of the word to show our belief in the ultimate achievement of this goal and to at least give some kind of sympathetic support to the people who have the courage, as I feel young Kelly has, to express abhorrence of the travesty on democracy that is being perpetrated in the Six Counties.  Let that much suffice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strangely enough, I do not to-night <Col N="2100" /> intend attacking this Government, but the general pattern of government over the period of the existence of this State.  I think that to find the real basis and root cause of many of our difficulties here we have to take the general pattern of government and discover the recurrent deficiencies that have led to our troubles.</P>
    <P>I resent bitterly the implications in the observations of the Minister for Lands with regard to this nation and its credit-worthiness.  Fearlessly and unashamedly, I regard this Republic of ours as one of the most credit-worthy nations in the world to-day and that it ill-behoves any Minister to cast slurs as to what might become of that credit.  I am going to address this House in a spirit of anxiety, and in the course of my argument endeavour to prove that without trying to justify, actions on one side or other of this House we might have got together to evolve a plan that could be gradually implemented for the benefit of the nation generally.</P>
    <P>This country has been cursed by one thing not only under this Government but under all Governments, for its planning nearly always consists of the two walls of the Book of Estimates from year to year and we find ourselves constantly forced into the position of finding expedient remedies for situations. I firmly believe that if we had a little bit less political codology and a little bit more realistic, integrated planning on a national basis we would have advanced in the 30 years we have had our self-government into one of the finest nations in the world.  It is only if we can make a Government realise the necessity for long-term planning and the necessity for planning its financial system and its financial development to implement and augment that long-term plan that you can really start talking of investment in capital development on the proper lines.</P>
    <P>There have been many ills which possibly have become more pronounced under the dead Administration under which we are labouring at present.  It is possible that the return of Fianna Fáil to office has aggravated emigration, has worsened the employment situation <Col N="2101" /> and has led to many varying conditions, but they are only exaggerations or aggravations of a situation that already exists.  Because of what&mdash;that is what I want to find out.  To-night I will endeavour to direct the mind of the House to the type of government and the type of plan that this nation requires.  I have been preaching relentlessly for a number of years that we cannot hope to build a prosperous Ireland, whether it is industrial or agricultural, on a rapidly diminishing population, that we cannot hope to find strength and virility in our economy if our main exports are to be the young boys and girls of Ireland to the farflung corners of the world.  The problem this Government and this Dáil has to face is the problem of getting to grips with a realistic plan to stem the flow that is getting down to the very vitals of our nationhood.</P>
    <P>I have had sneers and cynicism from the Government when I said before that it is a poor and a very poor compliment to native Government that after a period of complete freedom enjoyed within the Republic, we are back to the system of emergency or Government schemes to relieve unemployment. When one goes back over the expenditure in this country during its years of government, one wonders why it has not been possible yet to find an over-all plan into which in everincreasing amounts the resources of the nation could have been poured to build more and more real assets at home, at the same time increasing not only employment and output but also the standard and quality of output.</P>
    <P>We have heard lip service from all sides of the House to the fundamental corner-stone of our economy, namely, the Irish farmer, but the fact remains that we have endeavoured in a situation of expediency to build all kinds of industries, many of them not germane to the basic economic set-up of the country and many of them not practical at all.  Therefore, to-night my accusation against this Government is that it is continuing the ills that have been rampant not only in the period of office of this Government but have been rampant over the period of our self-government, the ills of expediency and <Col N="2102" /> emergency dealing with situations instead of having a sound, basic plan. If it cannot be implemented in a five-year period let it be implemented in so far as it can and let the process of implementation gradually build up to the realisation of that plan.  You cannot keep young boys and girls at home in Ireland unless you can offer them a reasonable prospect of security and continuity of employment and a substantial prospect of development within the field of their employment.  That cannot come in an economy that is ill-planned. We find ourselves in the situation to-day of having quota restrictions, quota licences, tariff protection, duty-free licences, supply and counter-supply in Irish industry.  The fault is not in the main that of the Irish industrialists. The fault is in the system that has been evolved.  Under the system that has developed the responsibility for many of the abuses that have occurred with regard to the use of quota and tariff restrictions fall on the shoulders of the few <i>glic</i> boys as distinct from those anxious and willing to invest in and develop Irish industry of a lasting and permanent type.</P>
    <P>In the years I have been in this House I have heard infinitely too much talk and, unfortunately, very seldom of the existence of practical development. There is no doubt at all about it that the platitudinous announcement of the Minister for Lands is something that stares everybody practically minded in the country in the face. This country is starved of investment and it is completely under-capitalised. I cannot for the life of me see why we should be in any way apologetic about conceiving a plan to put more and more of Ireland's resources back into the development of Ireland at home and not Ireland abroad because the present financial structure and the present financial policy of this Government is allowing Irish money in large quantities to be used cheaply abroad while Irish emigrants, be they men or women, can avail of cheaper facilities in regard to money to build their houses in foreign lands than they could at home.  There is something chaotic and there is something fundamentally <Col N="2103" /> pathetic about the system of allowing that to go on.</P>
    <P>I was appalled at the campaign carried out one time by the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to putting the country into pawn because I feel a sense of responsibility and a duty to the Irish people that we should use our resources in every practicable way to keep those Irish people at home, to get efficient Irish industries under way and to encourage and foster every possible type of agricultural expansion. When I hear talk about foreign experts for this or foreign experts for that or when I hear about this economist or that economist making pronouncements, sometimes I would love to say: &ldquo;To Hell with the whole lot of them; let us get down to the business of building this nation into a practical reality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Communists will argue that black is white, depending on what particular concept they take of a problem and will build their argument on that premise.  Foreign experts&mdash;and I do not mean any disrespect to them&mdash;will come in here from various nations to decide the merits or demerits of certain Irish projects, but they will examine them in the light of their previous training and experience without taking into consideration many essential matters in relation to the character and type of the people who are engaged in particular avocations.  They give their views, whether these views be American, Swiss or German.  I think that for too long we have been of the frame of mind of allowing outside people to tell us how to do our job.  I believe that we have within ourselves the full capacity and capability of getting down to the job of work of developing our country for the Irish people.  It may be necessary, of course, in certain ways, to get highly technical advice in respect to particular matters, but I do not for a moment concede that we have not got within our national capacity, with the limited type of technical assistance available to us, the full strength to enable us to carry out a scheme of complete development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2104" /> I want to press on the Government that they are charged with the task of preserving this nation in its continuity. In order to do that, we have to face up to the responsibility of providing ourselves with an integrated plan that will put more and more people into employment, and more and more capital back into Irish land, that will enable greater productivity to come from that land, and that will enable us to produce better and finer qualities of goods so as to maintain our industries and the general standard of life of our people.</P>
    <P>I suggest that can be done very simply.  Deputies should have no doubt at all about it, despite the sneers or jeers that may be made about it.  I say that every pound of Irish money that is ploughed back into the land by way of fertilisers or drainage is going to give a yield not merely of a 100 per cent. dividend but is going to be of inestimable value in the ultimate improvement of our country's productivity.  We should not in this Dáil be arguing about the problem of money.  We should get down to the problem of considering what we can best do for the Irish people and, after that, come hell or hot water, it is the Government's job to find the money to develop worth-while projects.</P>
    <P>There have been violent denials by Government spokesmen as to any curtailment of credit.  There can be no doubt, however, that there has been a definite and a serious curtailment of credit.  I know of some industries where plans for expansion and for increased employment have had to be closed down completely by virtue of the fact that this restriction of credit is there.  The Government say that they did not tell the banks to do it. The banks will more or less imply that it is the Government's responsibility, but when you try to pin somebody down by asking them to give that as an assertive fact in writing, they will shy away from it.  Yet, the situation that I speak of exists.  The type of expansion I speak of is necessary now when we are running into difficulties in regard to employment, but it cannot be undertaken because of credit restriction. We will hear denials that it <Col N="2105" /> exists.  There is, however, one thing certain, that for some strange reason industries are not expanding.  If you ask industrialists about it, they all give the same answer that it is due to this restriction of credit.  Therefore, there is something wrong in the system under which we are encouraging industrial development.</P>
    <P>What is the situation in regard to agriculture?  It is that up to now we have been nibbling at this problem. Even the conception of the Dillon reclamation scheme of £40,000,000 is only a flee bite when one has had regard to the way the Government should be thinking in regard to capital investment in the land of Ireland and of its development.  We should remember that the land is our real fundamental wealth.  The Minister for Lands said that the Government were considering ways of putting money into Irish land which will give the quickest possible return.  That is something which can be regarded as a short-term policy.  Again on that I am at complete variance with the Government. It is true that we have to expand quickly in order to keep the standard of living of our people right and possibly to face the competition of a very competitive market in the near future, but the Government cannot do that on the basis of the exploitation of Irish land.  We should have learned a lesson that you cannot take more out of the land than you put into it, and it ill-behoves any Government to deal with Irish land on the basis of a short time over-use of it.  One could conceive a plan, on a short term basis, for the rapid improvement of good land, but the Government should certainly implement a plan for gradually bringing up to a proper level of fertility every acre of land in the country, and of putting it into decent heart.  Nobody should be able to gainsay the implementation of the plan which the Government would then design.</P>
    <P>What is the good of an emergency scheme here or a relief scheme there when we have at our hands, if we have the will to do it, the means of ensuring a better standard of life for our <Col N="2106" /> people and an indefinitely higher yield per acre from our land if we have the courage to put Irish money and Irish savings into that land?  Where better could that money be put.  In this modern world of credit and sterling fiction, where currency is backed by no more than a promise, I ask myself the practical question, why should we deny ourselves the right of pouring more and more money into all types of aid and assistance for increasing the productivity of our agriculture? At the same time, this Government&mdash; or any Government that takes its place&mdash;should be planning the gradual building up of Irish industry that can draw to whatever extent is possible on the raw material sources available at home.  That can be built up on the basis of the three Fs&mdash;fair prices for the consumer, fair conditions for workers and fair profits for the investors.  It is better for this Government to get down to the business of planning industries that have markets at home and potential capacity for export markets than to describe as factories many of the things we have seen scattered around this country and which dealt with certain types of shortages that arose in the immediate post-war period in England and which made inordinate profits without reflecting any credit on this nation in the type of products they marketed in that situation.</P>
    <P>I came into Dáil Éireann believing that it was possible with sincerity of purpose to try to get something on a broad national concept planned and effected for this nation.  Each succeeding year only heaped disillusionment on that belief but I have no hesitation in saying, no matter what the theorists or economists may say, that there is nothing unsound or impracticable in any Irish Government having the courage to use all the resources at its command to deal with the problems of the day as they find them.  If we have immense credits to-day&mdash;as we have&mdash; how can they be better used than in ensuring the maintenance of employment and the improvement of our country at home.  Is there any commitment that we should be more pleased to honour than that of trying to main-suppl <Col N="2107" /> tain our people at home and give them an opportunity of working and living at home?  Is there anything wrong&mdash;no matter what the theorists may say&mdash; about Irish money being poured into bricks, mortar and slates to make homes for Irish men and women to live in?  Is it not a negation of all reality that we cannot have houses at home in Ireland for our own people but we can subscribe through our Central Bank in its portfolios of British securities, £60,0000,000, £70,000,000 or £80,000,000 to enable cheaper facilities to be given to people in other lands to do the same thing?  I am not as conservative as some of my colleagues in my own Party and in the main the general block of the Government Party, and I think if necessity arises for the Irish Government to use our credit resources for the immediate benefit of the Irish people in an hour of difficulty, I would not let any standing banks committee or any type of banks committee stand in my way, and I do not see why this country should not find itself in the position that many Governments throughout the world find themselves in when there is necessity for vast State expansion, that they can levy at a reasonable rate, or at no rate of interest, the necessary money to meet that necessity.</P>
    <P>When one considers, as I have said, the fact that modern currency is no longer backed on the basis of gold or on the basis of anything other than the written promise on the front of the note, I cannot see why one should suddenly have all the apprehensions that have been mentioned about the deposits that banks hold for their customers.  Can anybody tell me of anything more secure for the use of that money than the development of Irish land, the building of Irish homes and hospitals where they are necessary, the creation of solid visible assets here at home?  Is there not more real security in that than there has been in the financial policy up to date?</P>
    <P>Surely devaluation taught us one lesson.  In the situation that arose then, we were powerless to stop in any way an overnight 33? depreciation of the sterling value of our assets.  If that money had been at home here in <Col N="2108" /> Ireland, whether in the form of drains or drainage pipes on the lands of Ireland, or in fertilisers to improve the quality of the land, it would not have been possible to depreciate it overnight in that way.  Rather would we be sitting here to-day to watch the ever-increasing spiral of our agricultural productivity.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that we really grappled with this problem in the right way.  People in this House talk of £1,000,000 for this and £1,000,000 for that without realising the fundamental truth that all those millions will be of no avail if we cannot arrest the emigration of the flower of our youth, whether male or female.  We do not realise, apparently, in this Dáil&mdash;and the Government certainly has given no indication of a realisation&mdash;that you cannot bolster an economy on a dwindling population.  Now, to arrest this everincreasing seepage of emigration a Government will have to take bold action.  It cannot take it within a concept of £5,000,000 national development plan.  The plan that this Government should conceive does not run into £5,000,000.  I would far rather see them on the point of looking for £500,000,000 for Irish capital development over a period of years than falling down on the side of a lack of courage.</P>
    <P>Where better can our resources be used than here at home?  Where better can we find fruitful use for all this credit built up by the energy and effort of the Irish people than by putting it back again into that same energy and effort that made the first credit possible? That is why I resent what I describe as the gross impertinence of the Minister for Lands in making implications against our credit-worthiness. Let us glance briefly in retrospect over the history of this country before ever it became an independent State.  The Irish people were always capable by their own energy and effort, even in the most difficult circumstances, to build up enormous credits.  Before we ever became an independent State we had credits of over £100,000,000 in England.  Now that credit has reached somewhere in the region of £600,000,000 or £700,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2109" /> What amazes me is the fact that nobody seems to have the courage&mdash; possibly that is due to increasing age&mdash; to conceive and implement a practical plan.  This House has been too long engaged in justification of this act or that act, whether it be my own colleagues on this side of the House or the Deputies who occupy the Government Benches.  They are all too easily embroiled in their own personal self-justification and personal difficulties to get down to the problem that the nation wants this Parliament to get down to, namely, the problem of dealing with the difficulties of the ordinary men and women throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>
    <P>I grow impatient not only with the Government spokesment but with those of my own Party when they begin to talk about what someone did or did not do.  The fact remains that, irrespective of who did or did not do something, there is a mountain of work still to be done if we only have the courage to face the task of doing it.  In particular, I want to emphasise that it is time we got over the growing pains and got down to the task that is at hand. It does not matter to the unemployed man, faced with economic hardship or the threat of emigration, a row of pins, who was right in 1922 and who was right in 1932.  His problem is where will he find a job in 1954.</P>
    <P>My main attack on Government policy is that the Government cannot offer any solution to that problem. Even in the big State and semi-State concerns, such as Bord na Móna, we have a tremendous impact of unemployment falling at the close of the year, all due to the fact that there is no co-ordination and no planning.</P>
    <P>Let us face realities.  This country is suffering not only from the disease of underinvestment but also from strangulation by the Civil Service.  I do not say that by way of being uncomplimentary to the work done by the Civil Service.  I say it from the point of view of the system under which Government has developed here, a system which has allowed, as Government succeeds Government, <Col N="2110" /> bureaucracy to grow and the power of Government to diminish.</P>
    <P>Never in the history of this country did we so badly need a young, virile, energetic Government.  Generally speaking, this House does not seem to get down to grips with the problems of youth to-day.  It does not seem to get down to grips with the problem of where the future lies for the young people leaving our educational institutions. This problem exists not only in relation to those who might normally be absorbed into our various industries; it is a problem that presents itself equally to the young people leaving our secondary schools and our universities.  Those coming out of our universities equipped for a professional career, who should be able to find themselves absorbed into their own professions in their own country, are faced with the task of choosing anywhere, other than Ireland, in which to find work.  That is a poor compliment to 30 odd years of effort on the part of native Governments.</P>
    <P>I do not want to indulge in petty criticism.  I want to impress upon the Government that they will not get away from their difficulties until they have the courage to plan and take into their own hands the power to make available all the money necessary to finance proper capital investment schemes.  Such schemes cover an amazingly wide field.  I often think we are inclined to take too seriously the views of orthodox economists who work out problems in the environment of their own learned institutions, in the quietude of their sombre studies, rather than in getting down to grips with the practical realities of the problems that occur in our present-day world.</P>
    <P>I do not disrespect the views of these learned gentlemen but if half of them appreciated the problems of severe hunger, the trek to the labour exchange and the anxiety about young families in a situation where the bread winner cannot get employment they might find themselves able to apply an infinitely more practical yardstick to what one might call justifiable capital investment on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2111" /> The only thing that deters capital investment is ill-conceived projects.  If there is any economist anywhere who can say that there is anything improvident or impracticable in projects that lead to the provision of homes of decent standard and quality for the Irish people, adequate hospitalisation, proper drainage, proper fertilisation of the land, the procurement of technical advice and improved methods of agriculture, I invite him to voice that opinion in his own professional journal or any public journal that he cares to choose and I will argue with him on the basis of his own economic theory.</P>
    <P>Why do Governments, when they have had a long taste of office, start to go extreme right of the extreme right?  Why do they suddenly become moribund in outlook and stultified in effort?  I tell this Government, irrespective of politics, irrespective of anything else, there is a clamour in the country for something practical to be done to arrest the twin disasters that beset our nation.</P>

There are people throughout this country in the age group 18 to 25 who do not give a fiddle-de-dee about all the politicians in this country and who have not the least interest in them because they believe that every one of us is as bad as the next.  That does not alter the fact that, if we are to survive as a nation, we must evolve an integrated, over-all plan that will bring the land of Ireland, year after year, into increased productivity, that will bring, year after year, the industries of Ireland into increased productivity, that will at the same time ensure improved methods in agriculture, the maintenance of standard and improvement in quality of industrial output.  That is the basis on which the plan must be laid.  We have the money.  We have the credits.  Thanks be to God, we have still within the Irish nation a wealth of brain and energy and strength that makes it possible to reintegrate our economy when <Col N="2112" /> we get an inept and incapable Government out of the way.

      <P>Deputy Collins has posed a question which a number of members of the Labour Party are very anxious to have answered.  He asked why does the Government go to the right even of the right; in other words, why do they become more conservative than they were when in opposition.  I feel that the answer is that although they know what should be done they are living under and working a capitalist system.  When as members of an Opposition Party, they took a detached view, not having the responsibility of government, they realised that the ills of this nation in these modern times will not be solved by a capitalist system.  That system has served its purpose.  It is outdated, rotten and this country, as well as every other country in the world, must face the fact that that system must be replaced.  The profit motive alone, which is the basis of the capitalist system, is not sufficient to give that state of wellbeing to the people that is now recognised as the minimum to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins has shown an outlook in the younger members of the chief Opposition Party which I, as a Labour Deputy, welcome and appreciate. It is well to see those who in the past had rather narrow views as to the requirements of the State and the standard to which people were entitled, beginning to realise that the solution does not lie where they thought it did.</P>
      <P>Anyway movement away from that right of right or even from the right itself towards the left or any policy that includes a right to welfare benefits is welcomed by our Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to take advantage of this debate to examine general Government policy and its effects on the lives of the people.  It is natural that I as a Labour Deputy should see things from the standpoint of those who may be called the working class. I recognise no class distinction but there is a difference in the incomes of citizens.  If we in the Labour Party <Col N="2113" /> represent anything we represent the people in the lower and middle income groups, in its broadest sense, the working people.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that the removal of food subsidies affected the lives of the working class.</P>
    <P>I suggest that whether it is up 2/6 per week or a sum bigger than that, according to the size of the family, the removal of the subsidy on bread and butter and tea and sugar, which are the ordinary household needs of the average family of this country, has an effect of very minor importance on any of the families of the 259 people who last year, according to the figures given in statistics and in Dáil replies, shared an income of almost £4,000,000. What matter to them whether the household budget increased by 2/6 or even 10/- or even £1 per week?  The effect must have been of little or no consequence, and equally so on any of the families of the 5,000 odd people who shared an income of £20,000,000. The effect on them, to say the least of it, must have been insignificant.</P>
    <P>What a contrast when we examine the effect of that hunger Budget on the old age pensioner, he or she who has to live on the sum of 21/6 per week.  How does the increase in bread, butter, tea and sugar, the four essential commodities of their daily life, affect them?  It is well-known from Dáil replies that at present-day value of money you would require 24/- per week old age pension to equal the purchasing power of 10/- in 1939.  Equally so a single unemployed person with 24/- per week at the present moment due to the removal of the subsidies and the consequent increase in the cost of living is now living on the equivalent of 10/7 per week.  In 1939, when it was admitted that unemployment benefit was only an aid to a single person to exist, the figure of purchasing power was 15/- per week. After the number of years that have gone since then, notwithstanding all our cries of increased benefits and better standards of living for the people of this country, we find that an unemployed single person has to exist on the miserable pittance which in real money values is only worth 10/7.  What a contrast! How difficult to get an <Col N="2114" /> answer as to how Government policy has affected the people! There is, I suggest, no way that anyone in my Party, representing as they do the ordinary people, could look upon Government policy during the past year, as it was in other years, but that it was a disastrous policy for the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in the Dáil on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce I repeated the promise I had already made on behalf of the Labour Party speaking on the Budget of 1952 when I, in the name of the Labour Party, pledged in this House that we would not either take part in a Government or support a Government that would not undertake to restore in full the subsidies which were removed.  On the Estimate for Industry and Commerce, I repeated the promise, but stated that because of the fact that rationing had been discontinued it would be practically impossible to implement the promise as made; but I reiterated that promise in the form that we in the Labour Party would not enter or associate with any group in government, any Party, that did not restore in the form of allowances for those who received benefits under the social welfare scheme an amount equal to the difference between the cost of food then and in 1952.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, in his closing speech on his Estimate saw fit to say that: &ldquo;Deputy Kyne and his colleagues in the Labour Party can now enter the ranks of Fianna Fáil because we have done exactly what he says his Party will require to be done by anyone that they will join in a Government.&rdquo; In a box in the <i>Irish Press</i> it appeared that the doors of Fianna Fáil were open to me and that if I would take the trouble to examine the Estimates, according to the Minister, I would find that the thing I was crying out for had already been done by the present Government.  I want to say this, that what I stated in 1952, and what I reiterated on the Estimate for Industry and Commerce, I intended without any camouflage or without any hedging to state&mdash;that the amount of £8,000,000 or so that was saved by the removal of the subsidies should be added to the present social welfare <Col N="2115" /> benefits, and that is what our Party asks for.  Deputy Lemass very carefully ignored the fact that in 1949 we had in this House under an inter-Party Government a Social Welfare Act, or a Bill as it was then, in which benefits equal to if not better than the present Social Welfare Act were outlined.</P>
    <P>I consider the present social welfare increases scarcely sufficient to meet the increased cost of living other than that caused by the removal of the food subsidies; and our promise is this&mdash; that we will demand that the sum saved on food subsidies will be restored to those who are unable to provide for themselves and are entitled to benefit in the form of cash before we will be satisfied.  Either that or the cost of those foods will so have to be reduced that they will have the same purchasing power as they had at that time.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party makes no secret of the fact that they consider the present social welfare benefits inadequate.  We believe that a children's allowances of a weekly sum of even 5/- per child is not an excessive amount at the present moment in view of the high cost of living.  We believe that it is an absolute necessity that old age pensions should go forward to make their purchasing power equal to what 21/6 was in 1949, to a point of roughly 24/- at the present day.  Anyone who wishes to tie the Labour Party to that statement is perfecly welcome to do so.  We are prepared, if necessary, to vote for increased taxation on indicated commodities and services such as cigarettes, cinema seats, racing, entertainments of all kinds, petrol or any other commodity once we are satisfied that the concessions which we seek cannot be achieved through other means.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that a number of Deputies who in 1952 were Independent Deputies in this House indicated&mdash; principally Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll&mdash;that they did not agree with the removal of the food subsidies but by their action in joining the Party which removed the subsidies and which continues to keep them in abeyance, <Col N="2116" /> they now endorse the very policy they condemned.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling.  I was about to suggest to them that if they agree with the policy of the Labour Party in seeking to restore the subsidies and to reimpose the excess profits tax, then the Labour Party will be with them.  I suggest that the people of this country will judge them by their reaction to that suggestion. When I state that the old age pensioners are entitled to 24/- or 25/- per week and that a children's allowance of 5/- a week is not excessive, considered in relation to the present cost of living, I want to make it clear also that other people dependent on social welfare allowances&mdash;the blind, the widows and orphans, the sick and the unemployed&mdash;are perfectly entitled in our opinion to an increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a motion tabled only last week in this House by Deputy Norton, Deputy Larkin and myself we said that we were prepared to vote with any Government that would give these increases, even if it were necessary to increase taxation.  The Minister for Social Welfare thought fit in his reply to state that if the Labour Party were sincere, they should put down a motion demanding such increases indicating where the money could come from.  I should like to reply to that by stating, as the Minister knows very well, that if we were to put down a motion now it would have to take its place in the queue and very likely would not be debated in this House for another 12 months.  If the Minister and the Taoiseach give us an undertaking that if we put down that motion and if we indicate where we believe the money can be got and how we are prepared to support them, then the Labour Party will accept that challenge because we do not believe in lip service to the working people.  We consider, and I think I proved it on the motion, that had the 1947-48 excess profits tax remained in operation, in the year 1952-53 the £28,000,000 profits <Col N="2117" /> would have yielded a tax of £10,000,000 whereas in actual fact the tax collected was just £2,500,000.  The difference between £2,500,000 and £10,000,000 is a considerable amount of money.  It would be sufficient, I suggest, of its very own, assuming that profits remained at the same figure as last year, to finance, without adding one further penny of taxation, the difference between the present benefits and the benefits that we believe the ordinary people should get.</P>
    <P>I want to say on behalf of my Party that we do not believe in just saying that social welfare benefits must be increased, that people must get work and wages and leave it at that.  We have a live economic policy.  We know what we intend to do and what should be done.  In connection with the external assets of this country, we believe in a system of repatriation, not as suggested by Fianna Fáil speakers in squandering our external assets on consumer or luxury goods.  We believe that the money invested abroad should be brought back to this country in the form of machinery, of equipment or of materials to develop the economy of this country.  Deputy Seán Collins spoke of investments abroad and he made an appeal for measures to secure the return of that money for investment here at home.  Let me support him in his plea.  I find it difficult to believe that money invested abroad, mainly in gilt-edged securities yielding a small profit of roughly 3, 4 or 5 per cent., could not be invested in this country in agriculture or in some other industry in a manner that would give a bigger percentage yield and that would, in actual fact, serve a double purpose because the fruits of that investment would give us the raw material for further exports from this country.</P>
    <P>There is a ready market abroad for all the agriculture produce that we can produce in this country.  As I have said, I agree with Deputy Collins, and I support him in his plea that that money should be returned in some form that will help national and economic development.  I am aware that the attitude of this Government is that the <Col N="2118" /> interest earned by our external assets helps to finance the difference in the balance of payments between imports and exports.  That is a perfectly correct and a perfectly sound policy, but the very same interest earned at home would do the very same job with, as I have said before, the added attraction that we would have Irish people employed in Irish industry, and we would have goods and materials available for further export.</P>
    <P>It has been an old trick of this Government, and even of other Governments, when challenged about the difference between imports and exports, to claim that the price of imports had gone up, that there was no relation to former times, that things were imported over which the Government had no control, and that they had gone up in price while the price of exports had gone down.  That was accepted as a legitimate excuse and nobody can deny that, if it were true at the time, it was a legitimate excuse.  But accepting that, does it not presuppose that if import prices have gone down and export prices have gone up, we have a right to expect from the Government something to show the effect on the life of the country and that a higher standard of living is available here? With such a state of affairs, one would have expected a vast improvement.</P>
    <P>The import price index for September, 1951, at its peak period, was 324; in September, 1953, it had dropped to 285.  That means that things we imported were 12 per cent. cheaper in 1953 than they were at the peak in 1951.  Would it not be only natural to expect, then, that the standard of living here and that the employment here would have improved?  What do we find?  We find 70,000 men and women and boys and girls walking the streets of Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, and towns and villages in our country.  What do we find with regard to emigration?  An estimated figure of 30,000 people leaving this country every year.  We know from the returns for last year that 22,000 males had left agriculture as compared with the previous year, the highest known figure since records have been kept. <Col N="2119" /> One would have looked for an improvement, but unfortunately we find that the reality is different.  The fact is that not only is there no improvement, but things are gradually getting worse.</P>
    <P>We heard the Tánaiste indicating how his Government propose to allocate the National Development Fund of £5,000,000.  The Local Loans Fund is to get so much and the Road Fund so much more.  While I agree that in the present position in this country there is an absolute need for money to be allocated to the Road Fund, to emergency employment schemes, and to financing the Local Loans Fund, let me make it clear that we look upon that as only a temporary measure, as only an expedient to take hungry men off the dole and put them in employment at any cost.  We visualise a Local Loans Fund, not for giving grants for temporary special employment schemes, but being used for development of such a kind that the national income will increase.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Labour policy, we have a saying that the national cake must be so shared out that all sections of the community will receive a share, but we add to that that not only must it be shared out, but that the national cake must be increased by development of our home industries so that in the share out the people will receive a bigger and better share in order that the standard of living will rise from the present level to a height never known before.  Our policy is an extension of national income to finance a proper standard of living and a better social welfare scheme.  We believe not only that the working people and the producers should share in national improvement in this country, but that by means of social welfare benefits every person who is incapacitated or who is unemployed through no fault of his own should receive an equal proportion of the increased standard of living so that this country would be a model Christian country in which all the people would secure their share of the profits to be got by proper development of our resources.</P>

As a matter of fact, we on this side of the House are trying to improve our country economically and otherwise.  We will continue in the future, as we have done in the past, to give the maximum protection to industry.  We have encouraged people to invest money in industry and we have told them that if they invest money in industry we will give them the necessary protection to enable them to go ahead and develop that industry.  We would not dream of doing what colleagues of the last speaker said.  They said that we locked these people behind closed doors because they invested money in industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the agricultural side, on many occasions during the three years of the inter-Party Government I was forced to ask questions of the then Minister for Agriculture.  They are talking now about men going off the land.  The <Col N="2121" /> bad turns men do often live after them. The inter-Party Government was supposed to have collective responsibility, but when I and a few other Fianna Fáil Deputies tried to get protection for certain agricultural and horticultural interests, I was told I was concerned in a vested interest.  The then Minister was more concerned with giving employment to foreign labour to produce the things we should produce ourselves.  It was trotted out here that it was a question of expediency, that I was concerned about those people and was not concerned about the consumer. I was and am concerned about the consumer, but I hold that we ought to give the maximum protection to agricultural and horticultural industries. We did that, but the Parties opposite tried to destroy that economy. In three years they succeeded in doing more harm to that economy which we had gradually built up.</P>
    <P>Wheat, beet and peat were the three industries often slighted and insulted, along with the people who supported them.  Then gradually, after having been in office three years, they began to learn something.  They saw an election coming.  They are asking now why so many people are going off the land.  In one year they destroyed the economy we had built up, giving encouragement to our farmers by grants and various schemes, including the relief of rates on agricultural land, schemes for land improvement and the improvement of farm outbuildings.  In one year after we left office that economy was killed.  In the second year more of it was killed and in the third year it was worse.  As a result, when we came into office again in 1951 we found the ship going down the stream.  We tried to bring that ship back up the stream to where we had it before we left office.</P>

I spoke of various commodities flooding the market at a time when we had our own produce here for the home market. There was the usual old cat-cry that <Col N="2122" /> they were too expensive.  If they were too expensive, it was the responsibility of the Minister dealing with that Department to see that the market was made right and he had the means at his disposal to do that.  That was another economy they succeeded in destroying.</P>
      <P>The very year we left office, a number of beet growers in County Dublin were advised to grow oats immediately. There were no inspectors to go across the fence.  Deputy Dillon was boasting no inspector would go to see anyone. No inspector was sent by us, only to get the farmers to do something for the benefit of the nation, of themselves and their families.</P>

If the last speaker were in the same position, he would have asked the people to do it, too.  Those who were not inclined to do it were visited by inspectors employed by the Government of the country, which had to take direct responsibility to the individual and to the collective masses of the people at that period.  The inspectors were advised not to compel but to encourage as far as humanly possible. If a man is not worthy of being encouraged in a time of national emergency, he deserves no respect from any Government.  I would say that even against myself if I were unable to rise to the occasion and do as required to do, in order to try to feed our people when the war was on.</P>

      <P>We have here to-night some of the speakers who should not have stood for that, at that particular period.  We hear them to-night accusing us about the number of people who have left the land.  I heard the last speaker and others using those phrases.  They are the people who are responsible for upsetting our tillage economy which we were gradually building up.  Thanks be to God, a number of our people are beginning to see that tillage is paying again.  This year we had a remarkably good harvest.  Farmers are growing wheat again voluntarily, just as we desired.  We are giving them every encouragement and they may rest assured the Government will stand behind them and will not let them down in any tillage commitments they may make.  We will continue doing that.  I hope we will succeed in convincing good farmers throughout the country to continue that policy until we can produce everything we require in agriculture.  We will then reach the time in our agricultural economy when we will be able to export the surplus that is not required at home.  This can be done only by the method adopted by the Fianna Fáil Government.  The farmer knows now that when we ask him to do a thing we will not do as Deputy Dillon did in 1948.  He advised farmers to grow more oats and go away from wheat, saying the wheat was costing the country too much. Then the country was flooded with oats.  There had been a good and guaranteed market for wheat.  He adopted that attitude against wheat because Fianna Fáil had advocated wheat, which was responsible for saving the nation during the war. Deputy Dillon and Deputy Blowick must take full responsibility for that heresy.  Deputy Blowick carried on in support of Deputy Dillon and tried to destroy our wheat economy.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blowick and other Ministers at that time must take their share of the responsibility.  Their short speeches across the House and interjections will not put me off my trend of thought.  That will not get them out of their difficulty in facing the nation on these matters.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputies speak of public works and of housing and of various methods of providing employment.  We heard some of the usual able white-washers talk of the rebuilding of Dublin Castle and the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament.  We heard all these things from the other side.  May I ask Deputies who are members of local authorities, do they want the Government to abolish all county councils and start building houses themselves? Is that their approach?  It is not on the records of the Department of Local Government that the Minister there refused to sanction the building of houses in any area in County Dublin or any other of the Twenty-Six Counties.  If there is anyone responsible for the slowness in building houses, it is the local authority.  If those Deputies want to uphold the local authority system and if people who are responsible councillors cannot see that their work is carried out, it is very strange that they should say here they want more houses built and do not want Dublin Castle built.  These calls and cheap interjections are dishonest and have no foundation in fact. No Minister for Local Government in a Fianna Fáil Government ever prevented the improvement of housing conditions.  Every Bill to improve housing was brought forward by Fianna Fáil.  The present President of Ireland, when Minister for Local Government, made one of the first big advances on the housing problem.  His colleague who succeeded him was supported by the Party as a whole in continuing that work.  I appeal to the speakers opposite not to continue with the thrash and misrepresentation they have indulged in on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a good deal about roads and public works.  I would like to see a lot more money spent on <Col N="2125" /> roads.  If the resources of the nation can afford it, I would like to see up-to-date roads in every part of Ireland. The first thing the inter-Party Government did was to cut the road grants by £2,000,000.  When they saw that was a political mistake, they brought in the Local Authorities (Works) Act as an expedient to try to cover up that mistake.  Every Deputy knows that in some places we have a number of prairie tracks, not roads, and that we have a long way to go to improve them.  I am talking about the third-class roads there are in some counties still.  Some counties have advanced reasonably well, but others have not and have a long way to go to get anywhere near perfection. The Minister for Local Government has made an intelligent approach to this and is anxious to see our roads improved.  We had the usual mean cat-cries from Deputies opposite, that wide roads for big cars are not wanted.  That comes very badly from responsible men who should have a national outlook.  We should have advanced from the time of parish pump politics and should not have that kind of talk across the floor of the Dáil.  We all know that more money should be spent on roads and that we have a long way to go before they will all be perfect.  We in Fianna Fáil will continue with the work, which was interfered with by three years of inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said we need better social services.  No one has ever said here that we have given as much in social services as we should give.  No man has ever said we have gone as far as we should go or that there should be a stop to the amount of money being spent on social services. When we were trying to get money during the recent Budget in order to improve social services, and when the Minister for Social Welfare challenged, in a recent debate, some of the responsible Deputies who voted against increases in certain taxation, and pointed out that a lot of this money was intended for the improvement of social services, they voted against it.  That reminds me of the play, <i>The Merchant of Venice.</i><Col N="2126" /> They want the pound of flesh all right, they want the social services but they dare us to look for any increase in taxation for that purpose, or to spill one drop of blood.  That is the policy of Labour and Fine Gael.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt slightly with economics. I have tried to deal with the broad principles of our policy, without going into details.  I should like now to deal for a moment with the proposed rebuilding of Dublin Castle and some other public works.  Fianna Fáil gave the maximum protection to industry, to agriculture and to horticulture. Fianna Fáil increased the road grants and encouraged rural electrification. We have done our best with bog development.  We initiated national drainage schemes.  Despite all these endeavours, we find that we still have unemployment in our midst.  We are trying to develop public works.  What is wrong with that?  Public works have been developed in other countries. However, the moment we say we want to improve public property we are greeted with the protest that it would cost £10,000,000.  If the work is necessary and if it provides employment for our people instead of the dole, even if it does cost £10,000,000 surely it must be agreed that the work will be of national benefit?  Are we to adopt the policy and the outlook of the Coalition Government that &ldquo;the house my grandfather lived in is good enough for me&rdquo;?  This House of Parliament is too small.  The Deputies of each <Col N="2127" /> political Party are all crowded into one little room.  In my view, it would be well if we had a House of Parliament of a size sufficient to enable a Deputy to interview his constituents, or any other callers he might have, in private.</P>

A Deputy needs a room where he can interview his constituents in private or where he can interview anybody who calls upon him.  We need additional accommodation, and yet when the Government propose to erect a new House of Parliament Deputy Dillon and his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party go down the country and begin complaining about the amount which the project will cost the taxpayer and the ratepayer. Then again, we hear them talk about unemployment.  They shed crocodile tears over the plight of the unemployed. I can assure the House that the policy which was pursued by the Coalition Government is responsible for much of the unemployment which exists to-day.</P>

      <P>We cannot forget that the Coalition Government were in office for three years and that they did a great deal of damage to our national economy in that period of time.  When this Government decide to spend money on public works I hope that <Col N="2128" /> members of the Opposition, who like to cry now and again over the plight of the unemployed, will not complain that the works will cost so many million pounds and that the Government ought to be ashamed of themselves for wasting money.  For my part, I should dearly like to see every person in this country usefully and gainfully employed.  The policy of the Fianna Fáil Party is to bring about that position as far as possible.  If we are stopped or frustrated, through the force of economic circumstances beyond our control, in our attempt to provide employment, at least it must be admitted that we are making an honest effort to bring about a satisfactory employment situation.  We will continue these efforts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Ever since he became leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, he has contributed more than any other person in this country to the cause of our political freedom.  Every political move he has made during his leadership in this house has been the move of a statesman.  Whenever he had occasion to speak on the international position he always began by referring to Ireland. Nobody in this House can say that the present Taoiseach was ever afraid to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; when the interests of this country demanded it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are people in this House who are anxious to misrepresent the Fianna Fáil Party and who wish to make the public believe that we are not anxious to get back our six northern counties. Many men on the Fianna Fáil Benches spent a long time in jail in their efforts <Col N="2129" /> to bring our Six Counties within the jurisdiction of this Parliament.  I am delighted to note that we are all as one on that particular matter.</P>
    <P>My only endeavour now is to make it clear that I take exception to some statements which were made and to some questions which were asked at a time when the Government are doing everything in their power to see that we have the government of our 32 Counties.  Nobody can ever say, with truth, that the Fianna Fáil Government are doing nothing about the sundered part of our country.  We are doing everything we can.  I might point out, in passing, that any move which was made in that matter by Fianna Fáil was successfully made and made by a statesman.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy J.A. Costello, the former Taoiseach, speak here yesterday. I must say that I was rather astonished that a learned man should speak in the vein in which he spoke. One would expect that his contribution to a debate of this importance would be more statesmanlike.  One would not expect that he would stoop to try to score some small political point by way of a trick or that he would try to misrepresent the present Government on important political matters. I do not intend to go over past history now or to create any bitterness.  I should like to kill any bitterness that might exist.  Sometimes, however, it is very difficult to restrain one's tongue when one hears a man such as Deputy J.A. Costello, who should know better, try to misrepresent the Fianna Fáil Party so far as the international position and our Six Counties are concerned.  We will never relax our efforts to bring in our six northern counties as soon as it is humanly possible to do so.  A number of people outside this House, especially young people, have often been misled by people holding responsible positions in this country.  There are men on both sides of the House who have an honoured career as far as the country is concerned and nobody can take that from them.  Their record is an honourable one.  I do not want to deal with that but I do say, having read the parts of Deputy Costello's speech <Col N="2130" /> which were published in the paper, that it is very unworthy of a man of the ex-Taoiseach's standing to make speeches of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Estimate is always a very important one and I regret that the Taoiseach departed from the practice that has been established for a considerable time of giving a survey of the past year and an outline of his proposals for the coming year so that not only the members of this House, but the people of the country as a whole, would know what are the intentions of the Government for the future.</P>
      <P>During the past year we know that the Government's intentions changed many times.  These changes were brought about by sad events in some cases, through the death of Deputies and by the reverse which the Government Party suffered in the by-elections. Let me give an indication of what I mean.  The Government, through the Minister for Local Government, issued a circular last May to the county councils telling them that they were to frame their local taxation demands upon a Bill that was to be introduced. They gave an outline of what the proposals were going to be but, as I say, the by-elections took place in Wicklow and Cork and the Government switched overnight.  It is only reasonable to assume that the change in policy was due in no small way to the reverse which the Government suffered in these two by-elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Galway by-election, in my own presence, the Taoiseach announced the £5,000,000 Capital Development Fund.  It was the rabbit he took out of the bag for the people of Galway.  I was listening to him so that there is no hearsay about it.  The impression he gave to the people in Galway was that there were £5,000,000 for them and that all they had to do was to send a postcard to him or the Fianna Fáil Party and a new factory for making spinning tops would be established in Galway or on the western seaboard.  The exact words he used were that the Development Fund would be for proposals that were otherwise looked upon as not being a <Col N="2131" /> sound commercial proposition.  Therefore, if you could make a proposition that was in any way reasonable at all the money from the Development Fund was available for it.</P>
    <P>The important point I want to make is this.  The Taoiseach today, in answer to Deputy Dillon, said they never said there were debts when the inter-Party Government went out of office but that there were commitments. The Taoiseach in Ballinasloe, again in my hearing, declared it was true that there were £24,000,000 of the Marshall Aid money left behind but he asked what was the use of talking about that £24,000,000 when they were left debts greater than that amount. In that cute way of his he put this one across.  He said it was like a man making a will and bequeathing £400 but leaving debts of £500 to pay and what good was that?  The people of Galway and Ballinasloe listening to him cheered him to the echo.  He was positive and definite that we left debts.</P>
    <P>I want to support the assertions of Deputy Dillon and Deputy McGilligan that there were no debts left but that they did leave the commitments&mdash;any amount of them&mdash;and this Government made no effort to cancel a single one of the commitments we had made.  Then you hear Ministers talking about financial problems.  I will quote a few gems used by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs quite recently.  Deputy Kyne, the innocent man, talked about the repatriation of sterling assets. Would it astound him to learn that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when speaking in his own constituency, declared that there were no sterling assets left, that we spent them all?  He made that astounding statement without any hesitation.  I will give the reference and the extract so that there can be no misunderstanding about it. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, as reported in the <i>Longford Leader</i> of June 27th, 1953, said that those who were talking about the repatriation of sterling assets and capital development were talking crass ignorant nonsense. He then went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The whole of the assets, totalling <Col N="2132" /> some £151,000,000 abroad, saved up during the year, had gone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They were all gone.  What use is there in Deputy Kyne talking about bringing them back when, according to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, nothing is left?  If that is not nonsense, what is?  The Minister went on to say that anybody who talked about prosperity during the time of the inter-Party Government was talking about a Government who lived beyond their means and who did not tax sufficient to bear the day-to-day expenses of Government.</P>
    <P>There is not a halfpenny left of the £151,000,000 that we had saved and, mind you, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was quite clear as to what it meant: &ldquo;The whole of the assets, totalling some £151,000,000, saved up during that period, had gone.&rdquo; He was speaking to the Fianna Fáil Comhairle Ceantair.  When that sort of statement is made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs we must take it that he was talking on behalf of the Government because the Fianna Fáil Government are the only Government in this country who speak with full collective responsibility.</P>

      <P>Was the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs saying what the Government meant and believed to be true when he said the whole of the £151,000,000 was gone and that it was repatriated?  If the Minister for Justice says that he was, then I am going to contradict that because it is not true. There is no difficulty in getting from the Government's own statistics the proof that that is not true but the charge was made that the inter-Party Government extended and increased those sterling assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again the Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee, in his broadcast as reported in the daily papers of 11th May, 1953, declared that because of the unwise and improvident spending of <Col N="2133" /> the former Government the current Budget for many years to come would carry a lot of dead weight.  Therefore, what anyone would expect from this Government was that they would not have any borrowing and that there would not be any improvident spending. However in Ballinasloe, at that same meeting, the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;There is greater capital expenditure than ever.  This year we propose to spend £39,000,000 to the inter-Party's £24,000,000.&rdquo; What was the inter-Party Government spending this money on?  Land, housing, schools and hospitalisation.  As Deputy Dillon asks, which one of these commitments did this Government alter?  None except two of them, which they restricted&mdash; they did not say they would stop them &mdash;land rehabilitation and schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Their defence for the restriction of the local authorities works is that they are going to spend more money on the roads.  Before building roads it would be much better to improve the land and have something to carry on the roads.  Improve your land and do the drainage first; let the roads come after.  After the roads by all means let the buildings that Deputy Burke was speaking about be erected, including the Castle if he likes.  It is when you have this work done that you could talk about doing public works that would be of value of the country generally.</P>
    <P>I heard a Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches to-night&mdash;of course, sometimes it is not wise to take notice of them&mdash;praising Senator George O'Brien for the views he expressed recently in the Seanad upon finance generally.  They forget that Senator George O'Brien and several other eminent economists and advisers were on the Currency Commission and that they advocated even a further restriction of capital expenditure.  When the war came and when they were challenged about it, their answer was that their decision was based upon peace and a continuation of peace but that, if they had to envisage the outbreak of war, the report on capital expenditure would be completely different; in other words, great economists as they are, they made a ghastly mistake.  Therefore, <Col N="2134" /> I am not going to be impressed by any speeches, no matter who makes them, so long as the policy they are advocating is going to create more unemployment, more hardship, and a lowering of the standard of our people generally, because that was the policy of the people we tried to put out of this country 30 years ago.  Although we put them out, unfortunately we did not succeed in expelling with the armed forces in so far as they left our country, the financial system they left behind them and which has done so much damage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The failure to do it by the first Government was not their fault.  There was here a situation that makes people to-day regret that it ever had to occur but that does not get us anywhere.  The fact remains that at that stage the Government of the day could not undertake the alteration of the financial system.  When the change of Government took place in 1932 an economic war came upon us and I presume the Government then felt unable to alter the position although that was the best day they could ever have for doing it.  If at that stage, instead of Ministers boasting&mdash; and I do not want to resurrect things &mdash;that we could do without the ships, without the exports of cattle, about which there was so much talk, and without all the things we were importing and exporting, we had broken away and established our currency, we would have been much better off, because the economic war would not have pressed so hard on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1947&mdash;and I cannot understand this&mdash;the Government came to the conclusion that the people had too much money and they introduced their Supplementary Budget in that year, imposing £7,000,000 extra taxation.  We said in these benches at the time that that was not necessary.  There is one thing for which the Fianna Fáil Party will never forgive us and that is for taking off the £7,000,000 taxation to prove they were wrong, because Fianna Fáil are the only Party in this country, according to themselves, who never made a mistake.  They are <Col N="2135" /> always right, no matter what happens. No matter how many twists they take and no matter how many times they change their course, they will tell you they are still on the same one.  Even the youngest schoolboy knows how silly that is, but when they came back into office through the support of Deputies Cowan, Browne, ffrench-O'Carroll, Flynn and Cogan they published 17 points, one of which was to the effect that they were not to remove the subsidies. In the general election the Minister for Finance declared that those of the Fine Gael and the other Government Parties who were saying that if Fianna Fáil got back into office that taxation would go back on the stout, whiskey and so on, were talking sheer nonsense, and that it was an outrage for us to say such a thing.  Nevertheless, it was the very first thing they did when they came back to office, to abolish the subsidies and put on taxation. Why?&mdash;to get back to the position they were in in 1947 and to show by the campaign against their predecessors that we failed to tax enough, that we were in debt and that we ran the country into an impossible situation. The Minister for Finance declared, and the Taoiseach declared in practically the same words, that they did not put on taxation for pleasure.  I do not know what they put it on for except, as I have asserted, for that one reason, to punish the people who voted against them and put them out of office in the past, and to damn the reputation of every one of us whether he was a Costello or a McGilligan, a Norton, a Blowick or whoever the Minister might be.  You have a back bencher like Deputy Burke getting up to throw that about.  It is true that none of the Ministers to-day will do as he did, but you will get the back benchers after they have been primed to do that.</P>
    <P>I often wonder why, when Fianna Fáil comes into office, the people as a whole have to suffer so much.  Remember, that when Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932 they promised faithfully that they were going to reduce taxation by £2,000,000, and that they were going to increase the income of every worker on the land by an average of <Col N="2136" /> £11 10s., or at least that there would be £11 10s. per head of the population for every person engaged on the land over 14 years of age.  But as soon as they came in, what did we find?  The first thing that happened was that the income of those of the agricultural community was reduced by exactly £11 10s.  Similarly, in the years 1951, 1952 and 1953 the Government set out to reduce the income of every person in the country, either by direct taxation or by leaving them unemployed, so that they had not the wherewithal to meet their day-to-day requirements.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach declared that there was no restriction of bank credit.  Of course, everybody in business and everyone in contact with the agricultural community knows that that is not correct, and that there is restriction of credit.  I am aware that that is so in the case of the building trade, in the industrial end as well as the agricultural end.  I know industrialists who have been called upon to reduce their overdrafts, even though they have very substantial means, treble what their liabilities are.  Yet, the bank has called on them to reduce their overdrafts.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if a farmer to-day tries to get credit, or a loan, from a bank, well he might as well be trying to get a snowball into the lower regions.  He cannot get it.  I wonder is it only in my constituency that this hardship is being imposed?  My information is that it extends all over, but I am aware of it in my own constituency where successful business people have been called upon, within the last 12 months, to reduce their overdrafts by very substantial amounts.  As soon as that happens, either in industry or in business, it immediately has the effect of reducing the purchasing power of the businessman or of the man in industry, in regard to stocks and the result is that there is a reduction in employment.</P>
    <P>As I have said I often wonder what is the cause of all this hardship that is being brought about by Fianna Fáil upon our people.  While, again, I do not want to resurrect old things, I find that it has been the view of the Leader of the Party, the present day Taoiseach, for a very long time that <Col N="2137" /> a life of ease, or a life of comfort of the Irish people, is not one to be brought about.  As a matter of fact, he declared on one occasion in Cork that the people who were then opposed to him would be offering an inducement to a life of ease, and he said that he resisted that, that if we got that then we would live the life of the beast. Now it is very hard for anybody to think that the very gentle Taoiseach at the moment would say a thing like that, but yet I can document it and prove it and it is strange to see that every time when he comes into office he imposes hardship.  The result is that you have people walking the streets of Dublin, Cork or Limerick, and whether they are marching in unison or singly they are idle and hungry and their wives and families are in the same way.  That always comes about and that is to be deplored.  The Taoiseach declared at one time that there was no trouble whatever in solving the unemployment problem, but after sixteen years of office he throws up his hands and says: &ldquo;If there is anybody who can come in with a plan to end unemployment we will put it into effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House, but when you consider all the fine things which Government speakers pretend are happening in the country you get disillusioned.  There will be more people going out of the country than have been going, and the result will be that, bad and all as the countryside was before the establishment of the State, it will become worse.  The countryside was described&mdash;and conditions in the countryside were described before the establishment of the State&mdash;as a torrid desert in ways&mdash; in which people were getting a miserable existence.  We thought that, when we had done our work, a change in that respect would be brought about, but it did not bring that change.  Now, the whole plan and the whole solution for all our problems is to rebuild the castle and have new constellations. Remember, a Bill was passed through this House since this Government came back into office restoring the constellations. I do not know what has happened to it.  We have not heard <Col N="2138" /> anything about it since and it is about time that someone put down a question to ask what has occurred.  As I say, all that has been brought about by this particular Government in this particular way.</P>
    <P>I want to finish with my word of protest against the conduct of the Northern Government in arresting an elected representative for utilising freedom of speech during a so-called free election.</P>
    <P>I think that the Taoiseach should, in our names, have protested against that arrest.  The fact that he says that there is nothing he can do about it is a very grave reflection upon himself and upon many of his supporters in the past, because I remember the day when, to end Partition, all you had to do was to vote Fianna Fáil.  It was just as simple as that.  This is the position after their many years in office.  Of course, during the years from 1932 to 1938 the economic war was being fought, a great battle was being waged, and you were not to embarrass the Government in any way. They then made further agreements on Partition, and some still remain.  I am quite prepared to leave it at that and to say that, in my opinion, this Dáil should seriously consider the whole question of reinviting all the elected members in Northern Ireland into this Parliament.  We should issue the invitation and afterwards reconsider the whole matter.  If the thing goes all right very well&mdash;we will be very proud and very happy&mdash;but if they refuse to come and still want to remain outside, then I think this Government&mdash;upon whom, of course, the whole responsibility rests for policy at the moment, because I subscribe to the view that nobody can put any policy into force in this country relating to Partition only the elected Government of the country that now sits in those benches &mdash;has responsibility to do what is the correct thing at the time.</P>
    <P>With these few remarks on the matter I leave it.  I conclude by again protesting against the failure of the Government and the failure of the Taoiseach to make the survey of the past and the portrait of the future.</P>
    <P>I did want to mention two other <Col N="2139" /> things, but because one of them is <i>sub judice</i> I cannot go into any details&mdash;that is the Ballinalee Post Office case&mdash;but I want to condemn the Taoiseach for his refusal to receive the deputation from that village.  He said that no purpose would be served by receiving it.  I think if it had been received perhaps much good would have been achieved.</P>
    <P>The other point is that the whole conduct of Radio Éireann and the appointment and dismissal of employees there perturbs me very much, but as that Vote is passed, I do not intend to say anything on it, except to protest to the head of the Government on this Vote against the handling of that whole situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the reunification of this country is a vital one for our nation and it has been said here during the past few days that this Government has been silent on that issue.  That is not so.  Here at home, and in the councils of the nations in Europe and throughout the world our representatives have done their best to keep it a live issue, to fight the people who are the representatives of the nation which has the main responsibility for continuing that unjust division of our nation&mdash;by force if you like, by gerrymandering, and by many parliamentary methods which would not find international approval.  Anything that occurs to keep Partition a live issue, to my mind, is all to the good because this question of Partition at the present time is not one applying to our country only.  In Germany, in Italy, in Korea, and in Egypt and elsewhere the same issue has come into the international plane in a very real way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy MacEoin speaks of his method of solving it, I think he would just put a veneer over the whole problem which would perhaps lead other nations to think that this Partition problem was now solved because all the elected representatives of the nation were in one Parliament, while in fact the same injustices would be perpetrated as are being perpetrated to-day and the elected representatives <Col N="2140" /> coming in here, or there, or elsewhere would not be able to lift a hand to remedy that position.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back over the whole history of this very knotty problem but the Partition issue in this country is being used abroad by Britain's representatives from the very first days when it was enacted by those who then had responsibility in this country.  Even though they had the same numbers then as now, 42 or 43 members, and had a different name&mdash; they now have lost part of their name if not their identity.  Some members of the Party are new perhaps and do not know the history of these times, but I would advise those on the opposite benches to go back and read in the records of this House what happened at the time that the Boundary Commission was set up and what happened to the request of the Nationalists of the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good thing we are all agreed on the one point, and that is that every effort that possibly can be made to end that position will have the united support of all Parties and all members at present in this House.  Even though Fianna Fáil got part of the way by getting back the ports, their efforts in the direction of a general unification of the country have not been so far successful.  These efforts have not ended and I hope that in our time we will see that ideal achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next problem to the unification of our country is, I am sure, to secure the economic stability and general well-being of our nation, the employment of our people, the promotion of our agriculture and the extension of our industries to give more employment to our people and to preserve the credit-worthiness of our nation.  Some people here to-day talk very glibly <Col N="2141" /> about this question of national credit, external assets and all the rest, and they speak as if we were a mighty nation with unlimited resources not involved in the international system of finance which has in its embrace the credit of countries far greater than ours and with greater resources and potentials.  But we have seen in our own day a financial crash in America where many of our exiled people suffered intensely.  We have seen England go off the gold standard with all her might and Empire intact, at the time and in that particular phase, it is estimated that this nation, through being involved with her financially, lost at least £15,000,000.  When the inter-Party Government was in power we know that there was a devaluation of the British £.</P>
    <P>We followed the British at that time even though some people here now talk about establishing our own currency, our own credit and so on.  When that opportunity offered they did not stand on their own and say: &ldquo;Now is our chance.  We will not devalue the Irish £.  We will see what we can do with the American dollar and we will stand on our own feet in relation to our own finances.&rdquo; But they did not do that.  It is very easy to come along here and criticise and talk when, having the power in their own hands, they did absolutely nothing.  Perhaps they could not do anything about it but, if they could not, would it not be honest of them now to admit that and say it could not be done?  It cannot be done, though many people will not agree.</P>
    <P>That was the situation at that time and no action was taken in relation to it.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, we are involved in the international financial system and, like oppression from outside, that has brought many ills to this country.  If the national unity of the country had not been broken at a vital time we would have been able to take that further step, because things can be done in revolution which cannot be done subsequently. Unfortunately national unity was broken and we were unable to do what we set out to achieve.</P>
    <P>We were told by Deputy McGilligan that our financial position is unparalleled due to the fact that our currency <Col N="2142" /> is tied to the currency of another nation.  Consider the fact that other nations much bigger and more resourceful than ours have had at times, in order to back up their currency, to get the advantage from other countries of stabilisation credits; if Deputy McGilligan examines that position he may not consider our position quite as unparalleled as he appears to think it is.</P>
    <P>I am sure many Deputies saw the quotations from the American papers when another devaluation of the British £ was threatened, to the effect that only if England balanced her own economy and the trend was in the right direction would the United States consider using stabilisation credits to back up her currency either through the financial resources of the United States or other international financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Our own Government warned us when they came into office against the dangers of allowing the international financial position to drift because, as they said, in two years our credits abroad would be exhausted and we would be at the mercy of other nations in our trading and even perhaps in maintaining our national position.  I wonder did the Deputies within the last three or four weeks see a statement made by Mr. Wilson, who was a member of the recent Labour Government in England: he said that since this threat to the British financial position every concession given from abroad had, as far as he could see, a military tag or condition attached to it.  That statement was made by a man who knew what he was talking about and that is exactly what our Government stated would happen to us if we allowed the international position to drift.  But it has not been allowed to drift.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hickey and myself make different comparisons in matters of this kind, but in case Deputy Hickey has any illusions in the matter I will pass from the Labour Minister and I will come to the Minister for Finance in his own inter-Party Government.  In Volume 125, at <Col N="2143" /> column 1880 of the Official Report Deputy McGilligan stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Unless we are building up our productive capacity to an adequate degree, so that by increasing our exports or reducing our imports we can within a few years equalise our external receipts and payments, we must inevitably suffer a decline in our living standards....  Increases in remuneration offer no escape from this unwelcome development.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, at column 1906, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I must, therefore, sound again the note struck at the beginning of my speech by emphasising the critical importance at the present time of increased savings....  In other countries where private savings are deficient it is necessary to impose taxes to make up for the savings that the public ought to do.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Whichever view is taken, those are the views of people for whom possibly Deputy Hickey may have some regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of our national economy, it has been stated that this Government did not borrow at the right time and did not offer the proper rate of interest, namely, a low rate of interest, which would be more advantageous to the people, and so on. What is the actual position?  The Government has to get the money from the people, and their savings come from their own efforts.  Those savings are preserved in one way or another. Possibly they are lodged in the bank at a low rate of interest.  Some may have invested their savings abroad. If a man has saved £100 and if he does not get a proper offer from the Government he is quite likely to say that he will take the chance of using the money himself and he will not give it to the Government for national development.  One Deputy pointed out to-day that farmers lodge money in the banks at a low rate of interest.  If the Government offers a rate of interest which will induce those farmers to lend that money to the Government for national development, is not that better financial policy than to have the money tied up in the banks at a low rate of interest?  Even though <Col N="2144" /> a little more may have to be paid from time to time for the use of that money, and rates of interest fluctuate just as do the payments made for the use of other commodities according as circumstances change, is it not better that the Government should have the use of that money for the benefit of the community as a whole?  People know that very well but they argue around the point as if there was some easy way out of these difficulties.  Markets have to be examined in the same way as they have to be examined when people have something to buy or sell.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <P>If Deputy Hickey would give us the easy way out the Government would be the first to seize it.  If the suggestion is to turn on the printing machine and print money as required, I am not prepared to face the consequences of that policy.  Money is only a medium of exchange at best but without that medium you cannot enter into trade or commerce or the other elements that make life revolve around us and keep people employed and interested.</P>
      <P>The Government got the money they were seeking.  It was said here to-day that it is not a question of money but of what is being done with it.  The previous Government increased the national debt by £81,000,000 and I would like to know where the return is from any of their projects to pay off that debt. Personally I cannot see it.</P>

He had to abandon the idea and turn to tourism as a means of advancing the national interest.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was published in the Press at the time that he could not get anything done in agriculture. The Government has given a new impetus to the industries it established. When Fianna Fáil returned to power, in the suburban area of the city that I represent, where the textile industry is so important, having a long tradition, the mills were practically closed down and the other industries in the city were equally hard hit.  From the report of the Chamber of Commerce it is clear that the industries are going full blast and have orders months ahead.  If the Government did nothing else but inspire new confidence in those in charge of these industries and give employment to the workers, it has done a great job.</P>
      <P>The Government has not been content to expend its energies only in the cities.  It has established towns in the heart of the country and instilled new life where there existed only desolate boglands and moorlands. Generating stations are being erected and workers can visualise good and regular employment in their own country for years ahead.  People are becoming confident of getting employment. The revival is very evident and shows the confidence of the people in the Fianna Fáil Administration.</P>
      <P>Certain criticism was expressed of employment on the roads which is regarded by some Deputies as a temporary employment scheme.  Work on the roads has gone out of that category long since.  The roads have their own economy.  Income is derived from the users of the roads.  The roads must be kept in proper repair. It may be possible to plan so as to provide work on the land during harvesting and other busy times and work on the roads and quarries when land work is not available.  Machinery is used to a greater extent on farms. The work can be carried out more quickly and there is increased production but there is a reduction in labour content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of talking around questions and criticising, we should devote our <Col N="2146" /> minds to the question of how to serve the rural population, how to maintain them in employment, how to improve the national economy.  Deputy Dillon referred to increased agricultural exports and Deputy O'Donnell has made reference to it now.  We all know that dairying and mixed farming is the basis, and should be the basis, of agriculture because, if we have not dairying and mixed farming, we will not have the meat or other farm produce for export to Britain or anywhere else. The dairying industry suffered a severe setback during Deputy Dillon's régime and is only now recovering.</P>
    <P>We are encouraged to improve the land.  A great deal has been said about the efforts under the land reclamation scheme.  The Fianna Fáil Government was the first to establish these schemes and the first to advocate the fertilising of land by lime.</P>
    <P>On 19th June, 1947, in Volume 106, at columns 2250 and 2251, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am a believer in lime....  I have a map, produced by those who know more about the subject than I, showing the areas of this country in which there is a lime deficiency, and, looking at that map, it is obvious that we can never hope even to touch the fringe of the problem of introducing into that land the lime required, unless it is approached in a very big way....</P>
    <P>I have a scheme in mind about lime which I am considering in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.... We have gone a long way in determining the type of organisation we require, the cost at which this ground limestone might be provided, the area in which it would be required and so on.  That will take money.  If it is to be done in the way it must be done it will take a lot of money....  If lime is to be used by the farmers it must be provided for them in such a way that it can be handled easily, in such a way that it can be got at easily, and it must be provided cheaply.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We did not wait for anybody to tell <Col N="2147" /> us about the utility of fertilising the land in that way.</P>
    <P>Now we are told that the Government did nothing to cancel the commitments of our predecessors if we did not agree with them.  They cancelled, the Lord knows, enough of the projects of Fianna Fáil to make the country right sick of them.  One that Deputy Dillon did not mention, of course, was the chassis factory, the start of one of the heavy industries in this country that they scrapped and put in a position that it will not be easy to revive. It was the same thing with some of the other things that they scrapped at that time and put in abeyance.  We would have been in that flood-tide had we taken some of them and promoted them at that time, but now bigger nations and vested interests have associated themselves in a way that it would be very hard for a country of our size to compete with them in certain spheres where if we had taken action at that time we would have been the pioneers.</P>
    <P>I think it is not necessary at this stage to say very much more.  It has been said that the housing drive has slowed down in consequence of our increased rent charges.  That is not so, because this Government has not left any housing authority without money for the building of houses, and housing authorities have established direct labour units and given big contracts to various firms for the building of houses for our people.  The plain fact of the matter is that many housing authorities through the country have practically finished their building schemes. These have been announced in the papers week after week, and in order to provide employment for our people, every effort must be made to promote the industries we have, to pay more attention to our basic industry, agriculture, to go on with the drainage of catchment areas which will enable these lands to be improved, and, if our towns are not just to be trading and distributing centres, as far as possible some little industry must be established in all of them.</P>
    <P>When the statistics of the things still being brought into this country <Col N="2148" /> which could be manufactured at home are examined it will require only very little local enterprise to get the Government interested in these matters, because you all heard when a certain town was mentioned here in the Dáil recently and a complaint was made that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had let it down because he had not established an industry there, the Minister retorted that the town had let the Government down because they had put up no proposal, there was no local initiative to give an impetus to any new industry and no check up of what would be appropriate for the particular area.</P>
    <P>It will require the united efforts of all of us to solve our national problems, our economic problems, our employment problems and all the rest, and it is not by criticisms of long years ago, I presume, that we are going to get anywhere now but by considering the right road ahead of us, thinking over the line of progress that we are going to follow and throwing our unselfish efforts in on behalf of the nation&mdash; that we will think of Ireland and our own people first, their welfare and the comfort of their homes and the future years of their children, and that the ideals of those who have suffered for this nation will not be forgotten in our efforts and that with these things we will preserve, too, the art and the culture, the language and the traditions of this nation for which countless generations have suffered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker, Deputy MacCarthy, seems to bewail the fact that his Party was out of office for the period of the inter-Party Government.  He has no business crying over that now because the best thing he can do about it is to examine the causes that put them out; and the causes can briefly be described as a policy of voting money here in the House for the apparent benefit and welfare of certain sections of the people, particularly the farming community, and taking great care that that money was never spent.  The present Government is back again at the same policy now of voting sums of money just like the £5,000,000 development fund we are promised.  This time next <Col N="2149" /> year or two years it will be interesting, if the present Government is then in power, to find how much they will have spent out of that £5,000,000.  My guess is that it will be like the Undeveloped Areas Act.  It will be passed through the House here with a great flourish of trumpets, a great amount of noise, and the net result from it after it is passed will be nil.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that the Taoiseach when introducing this token Estimate in the House did not give what is usual and customary here, at least an outline of what the Government's policy was for the year, what it had achieved, and what they hoped to do for the coming year.  It is not good enough for the Taoiseach or Prime Minister of a country to walk into Parliament and just merely say: &ldquo;Well, I am asking for this much money for my Department. You can give it or not as you like. You will not hear any explanation from me of what we propose doing.&rdquo; There can be only two explanations of his attitude.  One is sheer contempt of the House, and the other is that he was afraid of criticism of the year's turnover, the year's output, of the present Government.</P>
      <P>One of the principal things that this House should devote its attention to is in my opinion the shocking flight from the land and emigration that is draining the lifeblood of this country away.  That seems to go on day in and day out.  While the present Government was in opposition they were deploring it very much until we almost brought it to a standstill.  Then they became remarkably silent, but it is a remarkable thing that since they have come back this emigration and flight from the land has got back to its old proportions.  I do not think I would be exaggerating in saying that it is now even worse than it was prior to 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had succeeded in creating an atmosphere in this country wherein the young men particularly were only too delighted to take off their coats and work for the development of the country. Now they are back to the state of mind in which their only desire is to flee the country and to spend the best years of their lives either in <Col N="2150" /> England or the United States in an effort to get a little money together in the hope that some day they will be able to return and settle down here again.</P>
    <P>It would be much better if these young men could be induced to remain at home to develop the country and to take an interest in its development. After all is said and done, Ireland has the first claim on them and it is a sad commentary that after 30 years of self-government, we cannot give our young men a decent wage, provide work for them and give them a headline to develop our own country, as every one of them would be only too glad to do if they had the opportunity.  I have said before in this House, and I repeat it, that I have yet to meet the young man who leaves this country willingly.  It has been asserted by some Deputies that they go simply because the wanderlust is in their blood.  I have known a good many young men in the country but I have yet to meet one of them who left it for either of these two reasons &mdash;that he wished to go because he hated Ireland or just because he wanted to wander and see the world.</P>
    <P>Government policy, so far as I can see, can be summed up in the statement that the Government is striving or straining to establish heavy industry in this country, industry that would suit highly industrialised countries like England, Germany, Japan or the United States and, while they are failing to do that, they are completely and totally neglecting the principal industry that they have here under their very noses, agriculture. I suppose the very fact that the inter-Party Government was chiefly concerned with the development and building up of agriculture and that the policy of the inter-Party Government could be described as putting the agricultural industry on a sound basis, was quite sufficient for the present Government to wreck every single scheme we had initiated for the development of agriculture.  It seems that the farmers are to be singled out as the political football for Fianna Fáil whether they are in office or out of it.  Our schemes&mdash;the <Col N="2151" /> rehabilitation of land, the ground limestone scheme, the fertiliser scheme, the Local Authorities (Works) Act, arterial drainage, the relief of congestion by the Land Commission wherever it existed, and the extension of forestry&mdash;have been either completely wrecked or throttled down by the present Government and the only reason for that is simply that they were sponsored during our period in office.</P>
    <P>The present Government has been back in office for two and a half years and anything that has happened in that time has served only to convince me that the policy which we adopted during our period in office was right and that the policy of the present Government is wrong.  While we were putting these scheme into operation there were times when I just wondered whether we were right because when a person is doing anything, putting his heart into it and wishes to make a right good job of it, there are occasions when he will ask himself: &ldquo;Am I doing the right thing?&rdquo; Sometimes a certain amount of doubt will arise when you are at a cross-roads and you will ask yourself whether you are right or wrong in the step which you propose to take, but everything that has happened since we left office convinces me that we were right in the policy which we adopted.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk in this House about the land rehabilitation scheme and it was only last night when a motion introduced by Deputies Lehane and Finucane was being discussed, that the Minister told me across the House that more money was being spent on land rehabilitation this year than ever.  Unfortunately, I was not in a position to go into the details on that occasion because the motion under discussion would not allow of my doing so.  Let me now inform the Minister for Agriculture that under the Land Rehabilitation Act it was proposed to spend £40,000,000 on that project, that is at the rate of £4,000,000 a year, inside ten years.  That scheme was commenced <Col N="2152" /> in 1949.  The aim as I said was to spend approximately £4,000,000 a year for a period of ten years.  A new Department virtually, or at least a large section of the Department of Agriculture, had to be mobilised and had to get the necessary training.  New machinery had to be purchased to get the scheme going.  A very important factor was that the officials who were in charge of the land rehabilitation scheme had to accumulate a certain amount of experience so as to administer it properly.  During that first year and a half or two years, the money that could be spent on the actual scheme itself, until the departmental machine was set going, could not amount to very much.  I think in the first year we spent something over £250,000, something less than £500,000 anyway.  In the second year, the amount spent reached £1,000,000.</P>
    <P>However, when the present Government took office the scheme was going full blast.  The necessary staff had been recruited and they had acquired the requisite experience.  Deputy Dillon left behind him all the necessary machinery.  Then the present Government stepped in with plenty of money at their disposal, because we left them £24,000,000 of Marshall Aid which had not been expended.  That has been admitted by the Minister for Finance. Of that money, £6,100,000 belonged to the Marshall Aid Grant, one penny of which had not to be repaid.  The land rehabilitation project, with an experienced staff in charge, was running like a new machine in every single county of the Twenty-Six when the present Government took over.</P>
    <P>What was their contribution to that scheme?  Instead of running it up to the pitch that we had intended if we had remained in office, a pitch which would have involved an expenditure, approximately, of £4,000,000 per year, the sum asked for this year is just a little over £2,000,000, half what it should be.  Yet the Minister for Agriculture tells us that more money is now being spent than ever before.  While that may be literally true, technically it is a falsehood, a complete and absolute falsehood.  The present Government <Col N="2153" /> have cut down the expenditure on the land rehabilitation scheme. Coupled with that, expenditure under the Local Authorities (Works) Act has been whittled down from £1,900,000 to £400,000 this year.  Mayo, my native county, is getting something only in the region of £5,000 by way of grant, as much as would be spent in one parish in one year.  As regards arterial drainage, they have just carried on where we left off.  They have just carried on with the three schemes we had started on the Brosna, the Brick and Cashen and the Glyde and Dee. Not one single new scheme has been started in the two and a half years since Fianna Fáil came into office.  I am sure the Minister for Education has taken sufficient interest in arterial drainage to know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the first year we were in office we had to buy well over £250,000 worth of machinery.  Deputy Killilea will not put that across me because from 1945 to 1948 the Fianna Fáil Government could have made some effort to start on at least one catchment area to show that they were in earnest about the matter.  It will not do for them to come along and say they had not the machinery.  The Board of Works had machinery left over from the Barrow drainage, which was an excellent scheme I am told, although I never saw it.  The machinery was taken from there away back, I think, in 1928 or 1929 to the Board of Works workshops and it was in fairly good condition&mdash;in good enough condition to start off with.  I know that the war years were not the time for buying heavy machinery but the war was over three years before we took office in 1948 and there was not one machine ordered during all that time.  If I am saying anything that is wrong I ask for a contradiction of it.</P>

When he was questioned some time later about it he told us that it would start in the fall of the year.  Now it is to be next June.  I will make one prophecy to Deputy Killilea: next June will-come, and if Fianna Fáil are in power, it will not be started. Probably then it will be June, 1955, and when 1955 comes, it will be 1956. I think Deputy Killilea is in a very strong position to change all that.</P>

      <P>The survey of the Corrib was almost completed.  It would only take three or four months to complete it and we have been out of office for some years past.  Is it not a fact that some of the heavier machinery which could not be used on the Brick and Cashen scheme is lying up rusting on the coast of Kerry? Is that something for a Government to be proud of?  Perhaps Deputy Killilea when he speaks will tell us why that heavy machinery is down there instead of having it working on the Corrib or some of the other schemes we had practically ready for operation when we left office.  If I am saying something that is wrong or if I am exaggerating, the Deputy, having all the information which the Government have always at his disposal, will be in a position to contradict me and point out that I am making an exaggerated statement.  Let Deputy Killilea, if he likes, leave the House and get all the information he can find to contradict me and come in here and I will be glad to listen to him.  Of course he will not do that.  He knows too well <Col N="2156" /> that what I am saying is the truth and that there is no answer to it.</P>
      <P>The decent attitude for him would be to admit that they do not mean to go ahead with arterial drainage.  I remember that during the war when it must have been very unpopular, Mr. Churchill told the English people that he had nothing to offer them except blood, sweat and tears.  The truth proved to be the soundest policy in the long run.  I suggest to Deputy Killilea to go to Galway and say: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil does not intend to go ahead with the Corrib catchment area or any other catchment area.  We have been two and a half years in office and we do not intend to go ahead with arterial drainage.  When we passed the Bill in 1945 we meant to hoodwink the Dáil and to stick the Bill into a pigeonhole and allow the dust to accumulate on it.&rdquo; What they have done in regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act is proof of that.</P>

      <P>I tell Deputy Killilea that whoever is telling him that is fooling him.  I suggest to the Deputy that he should stick a pin in himself and waken up.  The Undeveloped Areas Act was passed two years ago and I must admit that I was foolish enough to have high hopes of it.  The Dáil gave the board power to make grants under that Act to the tune of £2,000,000 over a period of seven years, I think. As far as County Mayo is concerned, one factory has been started in Kiltimagh employing about 35 girls.  I understand that that Act is intended for the undeveloped areas and the undeveloped areas followed almost exactly the boundary of the old congested <Col N="2157" /> district board's area.  I thought that much more would have been done for the West of Ireland and Connaught counties in particular.  We find the Fianna Fáil organisation promising factories to this town and that town. I am sure Deputy Killilea is going around Galway offering factories to every town.</P>
      <P>We have been promised a carpet factory somewhere in Mayo.  I think the only solution for that factory, which Deputy Moran and Deputy Seán Flanagan are offering to various towns in Mayo, is to mount it on some kind of bus chassis and have it one day in each town, because it was promised to Westport, to Ballyhaunis, to Clonbur, to Ballinrobe and to Hollymount.  The next place I heard it has landed is in Ballyvary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that I would not be outside the bounds of relevancy if I dwelt on the failure of the Undeveloped Areas Act.  I admit I had high hopes of it, but these hopes have now gone overboard.  We are proud of the one factory we have in Kiltimagh.  I hope it will be successful, if for no other reason that if one factory can be a success it might be an incentive to others to get going to try to establish some industry in their own town.  Some Deputy said that he would not like the towns to be nothing more than centres for shops and traders.  That is correct. The town is the community centre of a countryside or strip of country, and it would be nice to see some industries, light or heavy, in the towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the Undeveloped Areas Act going ahead.  We thought it would do much better, but in practice it has been a complete flop. I do not say that in any disparaging sense.  I want to come to the advice I gave the present Government when that Act was going through the <Col N="2158" /> House.  It aims at establishing factories, under-the-roof industries, in the towns.  That is grand and we would like to see it, but it will not stop the flight from the land.  Deputy Killilea must be aware of that, being from a rural constituency, as I am. It is good to have industries in the towns, but if we are to hold the young men on the land we must bring industries of a permanent nature to their doorsteps.</P>
    <P>I would speak now of the failure of the Government to develop a useful weapon I left them&mdash;the forestry programme.  In areas where forestry was unknown, people were beginning to take a live, active interest in afforestation.  They wanted to see the waste land under timber.  It was ideal employment for young men, especially in areas where the quality of the land was poorest, and it was there that the flight from the land was greatest. Deputy Killilea knows that, as certain parts of his constituency are affected in that way.  I do not want to disparage the Undeveloped Areas Act, but I regret&mdash;as perhaps the Government Ministers regret&mdash;its complete failure.</P>
    <P>Afforestation offers a cheap and ready means of stopping the flight from the land to a great extent in most areas, especially in mountainy districts where the quality of the land is poorest.  We import between £8,000,000 and £8,500,000 worth of wood products, mostly raw timber, from countries that buy nothing from us in return.  We should not forget that in any six consecutive years, at the present rate of consumption of timber, we would have paid in sterling, to countries that do not buy anything from us in return, the whole of the Marshall Aid Loan, for timber we could produce at home.  People not interested in forestry and certain officials of the Department of Finance, and the Minister for Finance argue that afforestation does not give a return quickly enough for the money spent.  Unfortunately, I must agree that that is true. It does not give a return quickly in the sale of mature timber.  Against that, if some Government does not take its courage in both hands and spend a <Col N="2159" /> little money in this generation to establish live forests, the next generation will find just a barren country, devoid of trees, as we have found.</P>

      <P>I would not like to have the problem of nursing Deputy Killilea.  I wish to refer to Land Commission work, but will not dwell on it. I deplore the go slow policy of the Department in the last two and a half years since Deputy Derrig took it over. When I took over the Land Commission in 1948, I found a close-down Order <Col N="2160" /> had been given by the last Government in April, 1944, prohibiting the Land Commission from acquiring or resuming any land for the relief of congestion. The commissioners had power only to proceed with the cases in the machine, and even then only with the most urgent ones.  By the time of the change of Government in 1948 I had the unpleasant duty of taking over a Land Commission which had not one single perch of land on hands for the relief of congestion.  They had only some bits and scraps in various counties, amounting to 6,000 acres, of very poor quality land which they offered to congests and tenants and they would not take them.</P>
      <P>I had to start anew and get the commissioners to establish a pool of land, 30,000 or 40,000 acres, in order to function properly for the relief of congestion.  Now we find they are back to the same attitude, acquiring little or no land.  Inspectors seem to have a definite direction from the Minister to take things easy and they are definitely doing that.  It should be the policy of the Government and of the Taoiseach to see that the relief of congestion goes on until congestion is finally relieved.  When I was Minister sitting over there, I remember that responsible Deputies, including Deputy Moylan, the ex-Minister, were asking when there would be finality in the work of the Land Commission.  Definitely there would not be finality if they were allowed to remain, as instead of keeping the Department geared up to deal with the work, they were working with the brakes on and using a deliberate, go-slow policy.</P>
      <P>I believe that if the work were tackled in a business-like and a workman-like way, the job of the Land Commission could finally be completed and a winding-up Act could be brought in within five, six or seven years from now.  The present Government seem to be content to let things drag on from one day to another.  So long as they do not have unpleasantness and do not lose funds they will not divide or take up any land.  They are just going from one day to another and hoping that things will keep fine for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2161" /> When I left office I left a fairly considerable pool of land in most of the nine counties that come under the Undeveloped Areas Act.  However, not the slightest effort has been made to allot that land since the day I left office, with the exception of one farm alone.  I was forced to table a question to the Minister for Lands just before the Dáil rose for the Summer Recess. I discovered that since I left office the Land Commission had collected £2,800 in grazing fees from that farm alone. That gave me the solution of the question I was constantly asking of the Government about their reluctance to divide the land.  Since I left office, they are using it as a money-making business.  I went through all the various Acts which were passed in relation to land acquisition and division and I could not find in any one of them a provision whereby the Land Commission could hold the land for the purpose of making money for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer now to the Minister for Finance's mania for unproductive spending.  The policy of the inter-Party Government was to spend money fairly liberally, but always wisely, on productive works, such as drainage, land rehabilitation, limestone, fertilisers, afforestation and other schemes which would show a return to the country sooner or later. <Col N="2162" /> Some of these schemes&mdash;drainage and land rehabilitation&mdash;show good results after a short time and start yielding a profit in as short a period as three months after the work has been completed. The present Government seem to be back again to their pre-1948 policy&mdash;a policy of non-productive spending.  We heard Deputy Burke try to justify this evening the rebuilding of Dublin Castle at a cost of approximately £10,000,000.  We found that scheme when we took office in 1948.  I remember that, in the Council Chamber, there was a circular model of the proposed work covered over with a glass dome.  I must say for the man who made the model that it was a work of art.  It included even toy motor cars lined up outside the new Dublin Castle under the glass dome and certainly it was a pleasure to look at it.  I understand that it cost something like £600 to complete that model.  We scrapped that scheme.  It was one of the commitments which Fianna Fáil left us.  We had no hesitation in cutting that particular baby's throat.  What is the position now? We find that the surgeons are back again on the job.  They have stitched up the baby's throat and they are going to present us now with a much more elaborate Dublin Castle than was proposed in 1948.  They justify that step on the grounds that, in addition to providing suitable accommodation, the work will give constant employment over a period of years to 80 or 90 men in Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from the West of Ireland and I do not, therefore, know a great deal about the people of Dublin.  I cannot help wondering, however, how the people of Dublin will mark their ballot papers at the next election in view of the steep rise which was brought about in the cost of living by this Fianna Fáil Government.  The only thing now that this Government have to offer them is to rebuild Dublin Castle in seven or eight years' time and to provide constant employment on that work for 70 or 80 or 90 men. Quite a good proportion of the people of Dublin are my own county men and <Col N="2163" /> women.  I wonder if they take kindly to the idea, in common with the rest of the people of Dublin, of paying 4/2 per lb. for butter which cost only 2/8 per lb. while the inter-Party Government were in office and of paying 9d. for a loaf which cost them only 6d. while the inter-Party Government were in office.</P>
      <P>When the new Dublin Castle is erected, there will probably be a very big party at its official opening.  The Army Band, the Garda Síochána Band, the President, the Taoiseach, members of this House, Dublin Corporation, the Diplomatic Corps and many others will be present at the function.  There will be great noise and flying of banners, and so forth.  We shall hear the same old story to the effect that the people of Dublin will never see a poor day again now that Dublin Castle has been rebuilt at a cost to our community of several million pounds after years and years of privation and a higher cost of living to produce this monster on the banks of the Liffey.  I hold that that money would be far better spent on drainage work down the country, or on some similar productive work.  I do not want to take any money from Dublin City and to transfer it down the country&mdash;money which could be used to better advantage in Dublin.  Without knowing the first thing about it, however, I am sure that there must be productive work of some kind costing £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 that could be carried out in Dublin besides the rebuilding of Dublin Castle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke said that we want a new House of Parliament.  Perhaps I am stodgy, out-of-date, and early Victorian in my outlook, but I must say that I think that Leinster House is a lovely home for a Parliament.  I am quite satisfied with it.  I should not like to be called out-of-date.  I like to keep pace with the trend of modern events, just as much as anybody else. In my opinion, this Chamber, the Library, the Committee Rooms, the Party Rooms and all the other advantages and amenities which Deputies need in the course of the discharge of their public duties are very satisfactory here.  Whenever a motion for the <Col N="2164" /> erection of a new House of Parliament is moved here I will oppose it, if I am a member of this House, until the time I see an earnest from the Government that they mean to go ahead with other development and improvement works in this country.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing a great deal of talk about emigration.  No such consideration is given to the matter of the flight from the land which is going on at the present time.  Very little or no attempt at all is made to stem the flight from the land, to bring the cost of living within reasonable bounds and to give employment at home in an effort to induce our young men and women to remain in their own country. These days, every single train from the West is carrying load after load of our young people away from the country and over to Britain.  I am sorry to say that some of these people will never come back again.  I have yet to meet the young man or woman who is willing to leave this country.</P>
    <P>Of late, the Government seem to be easing the stringent policy they adopted in the earlier period of their office but they are not doing enough. It is not merely a matter of throwing money around in fistfuls.  I do not advocate that.  The inter-Party Government spent money wisely on productive works and I think that the support we got was proof enough of it.</P>
    <P>I remember the fierce opposition we met from Fianna Fáil in every single scheme which our Government put forward.  I remember the filthy campaign which was carried on by Fianna Fáil when the land rehabilitation project was being put under way. Even Fianna Fáil supporters among the farming community were told not to touch that project.  They were told that it was a mean device by the inter-Party Government to try to increase the valuation of holdings all over the country so as to obtain higher rates from the farmers.  That was not a very nice attitude to take up in relation to such a beneficial scheme as the land rehabilitation project.  We find, to-day, that the Government have budgeted for only half the amount that we would have provided, were we in office.</P>

      <P>That left this Government with £37,000,000 to spend, and, if they wanted to work to the terms of the land rehabilitation project they could and should spend £4,000,000 per year.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach at by-elections and in the House has spoken about various commitments which we left the Fianna Fáil Government.  We did leave a number of commitments, but when the Taoiseach took office it was very simple for him to cut out any of these commitments he wished and cast them aside.  Included in the commitments which his Government left us were Store Street, the Constellations, Dublin Castle and the new houses of Parliament and we had no hesitation in going through the list and casting into the drain those which we considered to be nothing more than daft and foolish spending.  We were not going to tax the people to put up monuments of that kind.  Instead, we devoted the taxation to certain jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out that since this Government came into office they got on the day after taking office a sum of £30,000,000 in Marshall Aid money, £24,000,000 in loan and £6,100,000 in grant.  They have raised since then over £30,000,000 in taxation of various kinds&mdash;telephones, telegrams, stamps, the taxes on petrol, cars and tractors and the abolition of the food subsidies, which drove up the prices of butter, bread, milk, meat&mdash;every item of food <Col N="2166" /> in the cost of living.  That makes £60,000,000.  They floated a £20,000,000 loan last year at 5 per cent., which brings it to £80,000,000, and a £25,000,000 loan a few weeks ago, of which £21,000,000 was subscribed, which gives us £101,000,000.</P>
    <P>They have got all that money over and above the normal inflow of revenue from tobacco, drink, tariffs and the 101 other things which contribute to the Exchequer.  I want to ask the Taoiseach to let us know what is being done with all this money, because it seems to be the policy of this Government to store up a huge sum of money in readiness for the time when the general election comes.  I believe the policy of the Government is a hair-shirt policy until the election comes and then there will be umpteen carrots dangled before the people to mislead them.  We want to know what has become of that money.  It is not the Government's money; it is the money of the people, and the Government are getting enough in normal revenue to run the country.  We have been told that so much is being spent on capital development, but I do not see any of it.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the commitments which we were supposed to hand over to them.  We handed over the land rehabilitation project, the Local Authorities (Works) Act, Land Commission works, a forestry programme and a Forestry Department working at full blast.  I could name half a dozen more.  The Taoiseach has no business grousing about these commitments which we handed over, because it was in his power to cut out any or all of them if he wished.  That is what he was voted to power for by the House and complete and absolute authority was given to him when he became Taoiseach on 13th June, 1951.  Why did he not cut them out?  He has, in fact, no business calling them commitments, because they were projects which the people had sanctioned and the proof of that is that he had not the courage to cut out a single one of them.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Government now to cut out the foolish squandering of public money which they propose to <Col N="2167" /> proceed with.  The people will not have it.  I cannot for the life of me see how the people of Dublin have kept their temper all this time, and, as one who is absolutely unfamiliar with city or town conditions, I do not know how the average person in town or city at present is making ends meet.  I wish Deputy Burke would give us the benefit of his experience, coming as he does from a city constituency.</P>

      <P>Admittedly, those who live on the land have certain raw materials at first cost.  They have their own eggs, milk, butter and so on, which help considerably to ease the household bills, but I cannot imagine how people in a city like Dublin who have to pay for everything except fresh air, are managing to live.  They have to pay for light and even for water; they have to pay enormous rates and shocking prices for every single thing they buy.  Even the ordinary head of cabbage which is sold by the farmer for 1d. or 2d. sells at 1/6 down the town.  The same is true of potatoes which are sold at 2/- per stone and finish up being retailed to the poor of Dublin at 4/- and 5/- per stone. Apples are being sold down the country at a price as low as £3 per ton.  I wonder what price they are sold at here?  These are some of the things I should like the people of Dublin to know because the suggestion made when we were in government was that the farmers were blistering and fleecing the townspeople wholesale.  These prices are some of the prices that were obtaining for years before the inter-Party Government came into power.</P>

      <P>I hope I will always have good eyesight, but I would not like to see Deputy Burke engaged in any game of hurling.  Like myself, he has too much upholstering under his skin for the game.  I want to advise the Government to try to do something to stem the flight from the land.  I appeal earnestly to them to do something to put the principal industry of the country on its feet.  We have no business going around like Johnny-Head-in-the-Air, with our heads in the clouds.  Our basic industry is agriculture, and if agriculture were put on a sound, firm basis once and for all and we had a decent exportable surplus&mdash;the only surplus we have is agricultural produce &mdash;we could maintain a good industrial output within the country, because, before we can bring in raw materials&mdash; and most of the raw materials for our industries must come in from outside&mdash; or keep a level balance of trade, we must export something, and the only possible means I see&mdash;I am sure the Taoiseach will agree with me&mdash;of keeping a level balance of trade is by increasing agricultural output to the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to see that exportable surplus increased by the simple and easy expedient of cutting down on our own people&mdash;by increasing the prices of agricultural produce at home to the consumer to such a point as makes it impossible for the consumer to buy.  I do not want to see an increase in our agricultural exports brought about by that expedient, because it will not be much comfort to us to know that, as the Minister for Finance told us last year, we have an exportable surplus of £20,000,000 more than in the previous year when we know that that £20,000,000 worth of food was denied to our people, simply because the price was so high that they could not purchase it.  The wages were cut down in most cases.  Agriculture should be put on its feet first, and if some real solid attempt were made to put our principal <Col N="2169" /> industry on its feet, then I would say that we were drawing nearer to the day when we would have a happy and prosperous country with a healthy economy.</P>

Yet, last night I understand that he voted for an increase in the price of milk.  We in Dublin feel that we are paying through the nose for milk.  Yet, Deputy Blowick comes along and sheds crocodile tears for the people of Dublin and at the same time he wants to increase the price of milk.  I think that we in Dublin have treated the farmers very well.  We are very good customers of theirs and we are made pay through the nose.  Deputy Blowick will want to examine his conscience when he begins to worry about the people of Dublin.  He attacked this proposal in regard to Dublin Castle and said we should spend the money down the country.</P>

      <P>What useful purpose do the Deputies opposite hope to serve by suggesting that conditions in this country are really worse than they are?  If they would only face the facts, I am sure they would be forced to tell the truth.  They complain bitterly that we are not spending enough money on the land.  My knowledge of the land is very small, but still it is quite obvious to me that more money was spent on land improvement since Fianna Fáil came into office than was spent during the Coalition régime. They complain about our attitude to agriculture.  There, again, the facts are that agricultural production and exports have increased.  The Deputies <Col N="2170" /> on the other side of the House know that.  Yet, they attack us at every available opportunity.  I think they should face up to the facts and tell the people the truth.</P>
      <P>They attack our attitude towards afforestation although the acreage of afforestation has increased since Fianna Fáil returned to power.  That is a fact.  I think Deputy Blowick will not laugh when I tell him from what little I know about agriculture that the production is definitely on the upgrade. Does the Deputy deny that?</P>

      <P>We heard a great deal in this House during recent months about the question of housing and in that field I think I would score points over Deputy Blowick.  I would <Col N="2171" /> suggest that I know a little bit more about housing than Deputy Blowick. I would not say that I know as much about housing as he does about land but I certainly could teach him a few wrinkles when it comes to housing. We are inundated in Dublin with applications for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  I will be very fair to the Opposition and take their peak year, which was 1950-51.  As the result of an answer I got to a parliamentary question on the 21st October, 1953, I received a list of figures in respect of applications approved for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  In the year 1950-51 there were 1,209 applications approved in Dublin City and County and for the six months from the 1st April, 1953, to the 30th September, 1953, the number of applications approved was 1,241.  Those are the correct figures for Dublin and County.  If anyone tells me that that is a slowing up of private house-building I will eat my hat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures are there in black and white and I cannot see how anyone could suggest that we in Fianna Fáil are not doing our best to promote private house building.  The same can be said of the Dublin Corporation output which has been maintained ever since Fianna Fáil were returned to power.  Every effort is being made to wipe out the slums in the city and provide homes for close on 11,000 people who are still on the waiting list in the City of Dublin.  It is a difficult task and I think that any Deputy who is a member of the Dublin Corporation will agree with me that we are doing our very best.  I think we can do no more. Every week we hold meetings of our housing committee and the agenda is very long.  Deputies on both sides of this House who are members of the Dublin Corporation give a great deal of thought and time to this problem. In fact, some of them give more time to it there than in this House.  The Dublin Corporation's output of houses is certainly very good and the number employed on housing in Dublin has increased a great deal.  I want to emphasise this matter of the applications <Col N="2172" /> for loans in Dublin under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. The Opposition complain that there is a slowing down.  I have given the figures and they speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick, as I said, attacked us about this proposal in relation to Dublin Castle.  We in Dublin feel that the old castle is crumbling away and needs to be put in repair.  If we wait another five or ten years it will cost twice as much to repair it.  Deputies who read the official organs of the Civil Service associations will see there that the civil servants are complaining of having to work under unhealthy conditions in the castle.  A great deal of tears were shed by the Opposition in regard to civil servants during the past two and a half years.  Here now is an opportunity to get, if you like, more work from them under better conditions. We are sneered at by the Opposition.  As I say, the proposal in regard to Dublin Castle will give a good deal of employment to Dublin men and I think that should not be sneered at.</P>
    <P>When I spoke on this question before I suggested that there should be a residence qualification in the contract ensuring that people getting a job should have resided for at least five years in the City of Dublin.  I am not entirely opposed to people coming from the country, but I think it is only right that Dublin men should get priority in a matter of this kind.  I understand that the work on Dublin Castle will give constant employment to between 150 and 200 men for a good many years.  Does the Opposition suggest that the pay packets provided by the work on Dublin Castle should be taken out of the pockets of the Dublin housewives?  I do not think we should approach the matter in that way at all.  I appreciate that Deputies opposite who come from farming constituencies should fight their corner and do everything possible for their constituents.  I think that the few Deputies who represent the City of Dublin should hold their own also and fight their corner.  I am doing that in a fair manner.  We intend to give employment to Dublin people and I do not think any Deputy on any side of <Col N="2173" /> the House could laugh or jeer at us on that score.  I hope the Taoiseach will make sure that plans are set in motion right away in order to give us an opportunity of doing that work.</P>
    <P>Deputy John A. Costello yesterday referred to the Modern Homes action against the Dublin Corporation and he felt we should not have gone on with that action, that is, in connection with the town planning scheme.  I do not wish to go into this too much, but I, for one, in the early stages was against taking this action, because I had certain knowledge of what would happen; in my own business I received information that we had no hope of winning.  However, we took the advice of the lawyers and it may surprise Deputy Costello that when this question came before the city council in the City Hall as to whether we should take action or not, I, for one, spoke against it.  Immediately up jumped the lawyers, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil lawyers, who said: &ldquo;We must go to law.  We have the opinion of our law agent, of our counsel, and we should fight it.&rdquo;</P>

It is badly needed and it was too long delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Costello was sincere or not in regard to the O'Connell Bridge structure.  Unfortunately, I have not got a copy of the speech, but some other Deputy told me he mentioned my name in it, and said that I had more or less changed my mind on the question. Apparently he felt we should get in touch with the Arts Council.  I feel the same, that in a matter like this we <Col N="2174" /> should certainly seek the aid of the Arts Council.  I am satisfied we have on the Arts Council some eminent people who would appoint adjudicators who would arrive at some decision in regard to a monument or some other suitable structure.  As a result of a question I put at the last meeting of the Dublin Corporation, I was told that, so far, £3,400 has been spent on O'Connell Bridge and that it was proposed to spend another £3,500.</P>

      <P>If you had the fortune or misfortune to come back into office you would more than likely have followed the same lines.  However, I am satisfied that to spend £7,000 on O'Connell Bridge would be a mistake and it would not be possible to have the thing put right.  I propose at the next council meeting to put forward a motion to that effect, that the bridge be restored to its pre-Tóstal state.  I think Gandon's beautiful work was destroyed by that concrete slab on O'Connell Bridge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the Town Planning Committee of the corporation before which that proposal came. We were told we were allocating £10,000 for the decoration of the city for An Tóstal, and that included something for O'Connell Bridge.  I feel guilty that I did not see the plans of it; I had to take a bus across the city to look down past the hoarding to see what was in it and I discovered it was some sort of fountain or whatever you like to call it.  It is only fair that the Dublin <Col N="2175" /> Corporation should admit that a mistake has been made and that the £3,400 should be written off.  If more money is spent you are not going to deceive anyone.  I hope our motion succeeds at the next corporation meeting and that the bridge will be restored to its pre-Tóstal state.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is the rightful home of the Lane pictures, that is, in Charlemont House and I would like the Government to continue to press for the return of those pictures to Dublin.  A lot has been said elsewhere and a very good case was made and justice demands that those pictures be restored here.  I am not suggesting that I am a great art lover but I like good pictures when I see them and I have visited many galleries in various parts of the world. I would impress on the Government to keep up the fight to have these Lane pictures restored to the rightful place, that is in Charlemont House, Parnell Square, in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Time and again I have mentioned in this House the question of malicious damages and I would ask the Taoiseach if he would realise that this is causing us a great concern in Dublin. I am tired raising this matter and I would impress on the Taoiseach that the Dublin Corporation staff are finding it extremely difficult to cope with the claims that are coming in day after day every year now for the past five or ten years and the amounts being paid out are continuing to increase considerably.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kyne has given notice to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the private notice question which he addressed to the Minister for Agriculture to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day, by way of private notice question, I asked the Minister for Agriculture: Whether he is aware that a certain Dublin butter wholesaler who has been supplying retailers of butter at a price sufficient to permit them to sell butter at 4/1 per lb. has been refused sufficient butter to meet the requirements of his customers by the Butter Marketing Committee, notwithstanding the fact that he is prepared to pay ready cash for all supplies received by him; and, if so, whether he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reply of the Minister was that he was investigating the matter and was awaiting a reply from the Butter <Col N="2177" /> Marketing Committee.  I expressed my dissatisfaction with that because of the fact, which I hope to prove in the time allowed to me, that I knew the Minister was aware of this for some time, and that he had, or should have, been in touch with the Butter Marketing Committee before to-day, and that even if it only came to his notice to-day he could by means of the telephone, have ascertained the facts and got their views so as to be in a position to answer.</P>
    <P>I have a further question to ask the Minister which I hope he will answer when replying.  It is, if he has knowledge as to whether the Butter Marketing Committee received any representations from any trade association regarding the supply of butter to the Dublin wholesaler who has been selling creamery butter at a price less than the usual wholesale price, and if he will inquire into it if he has knowledge of it.</P>
    <P>I believe that is the kernel of my whole case.  I asked the Minister a furthere question to-day&mdash;I asked him on the usual presumption that a person is innocent until he is found guilty&mdash;if he would, as an interim measure, assure me that supplies of butter would be guaranteed to this wholesaler until it was proved that he was an unfit person to receive them, and he replied that he could not give me any such assurance. I think the public interest demands that this successful attempt to prevent a legitimate butter trader from passing on to the consuming public butter at such a price that it can be retailed at 1d. per lb. less than the normal price in the City of Dublin is of such importance that the position cannot be allowed to continue, and that this racket&mdash;I can call it nothing else&mdash;must be exposed and must be stopped.  In my opinion it is in the power of the Minister to stop that, and should the Minister not exercise that power I feel that he must be presupposed to be a party to this desire to prevent the ordinary, poor necessitous people of Dublin from securing butter at a price which is 1d. per lb. lower than the price of the butter normally supplied to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2178" /> Time and again we have heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce exhort our industrialists to increase their production and, by their efficient management, to reduce their costs so that they may be able to pass on to the consumers their products at a reduced price, thus helping the economy of the country, as well as bringing down the cost of living.  Here we have a clear case where that was done by an efficient, enterprising trader, but the Butter Marketing Committee, presumably on the suggestion of some other body and with the connivance of the Minister, have defeated that laudable object.  I should like to say that all the facts which I propose to give have been sent to the Fair Trade Commission. Proof is ready and will be given in public and everything that I am saying can be substantiated by the people concerned.  I think, because of the urgency of the case and of its importance, that the Dáil is the place where the public should know this.</P>
    <P>The facts are that Joseph Gallagher, trading as United Packers, 5 Graham Row, Dublin, is a butter wholesaler. He started business in January, 1952. It is necessary, under the conditions of securing supplies from the Butter Marketing Committee, that anyone trading in butter as a wholesaler in Dublin or district should obtain his supplies direct from the Butter Marketing Committee or from some person who has secured supplies from the committee.  He started, as is the normal course, on a cash basis for all transactions.  After 12 months of successful cash trading, the committee extended to him an order for credit facilities, that he could pay for his supplies within seven days of the order.  This continued up to the 22nd October of this year.  On that date, the secretary to the Butter Marketing Committee sent for him and informed him that if he wished to buy in excess of £4,000 worth on the seven day credit system, such as was given to all traders, he would have to pay in cash or by guaranteed cheque.  Mr. Gallagher demurred at this suggestion that he should be made an exception of, notwithstanding that he was prepared to carry on and pay cash or <Col N="2179" /> by guaranteed cheque for all his supplies.  Through his solicitors he queried that restriction on his credit. I have here a letter dated 23rd October, from the firm of Colley and Moylan, solicitors, addressed to the secretary of the Butter Marketing Committee querying as I have stated, why Mr. Gallagher's credit was restricted and protesting against it.  An acknowledgement was given to the solicitors stating that the matter would be placed before the committee at their next meeting.</P>
    <P>The only information that is available to Mr. Gallagher as to why his credit was restricted is that the firm of Gallagher, Sharkey and Company, Limited, carrying on business at 29 Wellington Quay had gone into voluntary liquidation and that all wholesalers in the area were being put on restricted credit because of this fact. Mr. Gallagher, because of the similarity in names, immediately pointed out that he had no connection with that firm, that, in fact not only had he no connection with it but that he was a creditor of it and that it owed him over £200 and he stood to lose, as well as other people, to whom the firm owed money.</P>
    <P>On investigation he learned that he was the only one of 20 wholesalers in the Dublin district to whom this restricted credit was made applicable. That was admitted to him at the Butter Marketing Committee.  His solicitors, as I have said, wrote on the 23rd October and received an acknowledgement on the 24th October that the matter would go before the committee at its next meeting.  Notwithstanding the fact that on the 12th November a meeting of that committee was held, Mr. Gallagher still received no reply.  During a call in the normal course of business to the committee on the 14th November, he was told that, instead of getting any redress in connection with his complaint, a further restriction, not only of credit but of supplies, was going to be made applicable to him.  He was restricted, he was informed, to 400 boxes of butter per week with cash on order, or cash handed in with order.  I will deal with the value of the boxes later.  A guaranteed <Col N="2180" /> cheque sent on the 25th November, 1953, for 200 boxes of butter was refused and returned to him.  The cost of 400 boxes of butter is £4,375.  Any order in excess of that under the first restriction meant that he would have to produce money in excess of that. He was satisfied to do that.  He was solvent and was prepared to pay cash on delivery or on application.  Notwithstanding that, his money for 200 boxes was returned.  Mark you, the previous week the purchase of this firm from the Butter Marketing Committee was £7,500 worth, or 700 boxes. That indicates the extensive business that this reputable merchant was carrying on.  With his butter supply stopped, he found that on 16th November, 1953, he had to let a van driver go and put him on the unemployment exchange.</P>
    <P>He saw the present Minister for Agriculture on 17th November.  He told him the facts as I have related them so far.  The Minister expressed the view that he saw no reason why Mr. Gallagher should not obtain supplies that he needed.  He undertook to examine the matter and after a short space of time the Minister indicated to Mr. Gallagher that he was not prepared to take any action in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Gallagher and Sharkey case is a matter separate and distinct from this.  It has no bearing on Mr. Joseph Gallagher of United Packers and his dealings with the Butter Marketing Committee.  And there was no reason why, even if all the other people were restricted in credit, that Mr. Gallagher should be restricted in credit.  But there is every reason to say there was something wrong when his butter supplies were cut off.  He has a staff of ten employed and he authorises me to say that he is paying the maximum rate prescribed by the Joint Labout Committee for that industry.  He challenges anyone to deny that.</P>
    <P>This gentleman found that because of his enterprise and intelligence he could, and did, have installed a machine that permitted him to cut butter and subdivide it into pounds and half-pounds and packet it untouched by hand at such a speed that it permitted him to sell the butter purchased at the normal price paid by <Col N="2181" /> all wholesalers to the Dublin Marketing Committee, at 8/- per cwt. less than was being charged by the other wholesalers.  He asked that that benefit should be passed on through the retailers to the consuming public.  I have a list of reputable retailers in Dublin with branches varying from nine to three throughout the city who took advantage of his offer to enter into business with them and who passed on that reduced price to the consumers.</P>
    <P>On 9th December, Mr. Gallagher sent this letter to the secretary of the Butter Marketing Committee:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Further to our telephone conversation of to-day's date, I would ask you to place before your committee the facts as outlined at the earliest possible opportunity as this matter is of extreme urgency to me.</P>
    <P>As stated, my present position is:</P>
    <P>(a)  I am not in a position to supply my customers with their current requirements of butter due to the restrictions imposed on my purchases by your committee.</P>
    <P>(b)  Should there be any question of my disposing of butter to any source other than the normal retail trade in Dublin&mdash;I am prepared to open my books for inspection by a responsible person from the Butter Marketing Committee to prove conclusively, that all butter purchased by me in any one week is sold by me in that week to legitimate retail traders in Dublin.</P>
    <P>(c)  As I have been compelled to refuse butter to many of my customers this present week&mdash;it is seriously damaging my business, and should these restrictions continue it will do my business irreparable damage as I am losing the confidence of the retail trade &mdash;therefore I appeal to you to consider my case urgently.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Gallagher has received no reply. It seems a strange position but the background to what happened is this: Mr. Gallagher is not a member of the Butter Wholesalers' Association of Dublin.  He refused to become a member of it.  He did make application <Col N="2182" /> for membership but when the conditions and when the threats&mdash;as I would suggest they were&mdash;were held over him he said he would carry on as he was. Mr. Gallagher is prepared to state that he has been informed that the Wholesalers' Association resenting the fact that he sold butter or made it possible for butter to be sold at reduced prices by his efficient management, sent a protest to the Butter Marketing Committee. Whatever the effect, this it what happened.  First, his credit was restricted.  He overcame that because he was able to pay.  Secondly, he was put on a restricted quantity, and thirdly, he was refused butter even with the money or the cash.  I suggest that the Minister knows that.  I suggest that the Minister in refusing to take action is encouraging the people who wish by means of restrictive trade practices to prevent ordinary working people of Dublin securing the advantages of butter at a reduced price.</P>
    <P>It is desirable, I think, in the time I have available to substantiate my claims by giving this list of retailers in Dublin&mdash;legitimate retailers&mdash;who were customers of Mr. Gallagher and all were selling at 1d. below the maximum price of 4/2 per lb.; Payantake (9 branches); Donlon Brothers, Moore street and Killester; T. Maher, Thomas Street; E. Walsh, Stoneybatter; Leo's, 101 Malahide Road; Mead's The All Cash Stores, Ballybough, and 9 Old County Road, Crumlin; P. Nolan, West Stores, East Wall Road; P. Crean, Townsend Street; T. Walsh, Pearse Street and Crumlin Cross; Pidgeons Ltd. (6 branches), and Flynn's, Sundrive Road, and McQuaid's Ltd. (5 branches).</P>
    <P>I suggest that these reputable and legitimate dealers were carrying on a perfectly legitimate trade and carrying out the request of the Minister for Industry and Commerce; that the Minister for Agriculture knew all this; that he attempted to postpone discussion on this by saying he was making inquiries; he had not sufficient knowledge and he could not do anything.</P>
    <P>I now demand, in the name of the public of this city and the public of this country, that people who engage <Col N="2183" /> in legitimate business be entitled to carry out their business: that no ring be permitted to compel them to keep the cost of living high; that the ordinary people who get an opportunity of benefiting by efficient management will be protected, and that the people who give them that opportunity will be applauded.  Finally, the people who attempt to prevent them will be dealt with by this Government as surely as they will be dealt with by the people when they have an opportunity of expressing their disapproval.</P>

      <P>As I told the Deputy to-day when I was answering his question, I had heard of this matter.  I stated that the Butter Marketing Committee were giving me a full report.  Subsequent to the Deputy's intimating that he would raise this matter on the Adjournment, I sent for the members of the Butter Marketing Committee.  I have been informed by that committee that the reason why they refused to give this wholesaler extra butter was because, as is generally known in Dublin and elsewhere, we have a certain quantity of imported butter on hands and that butter will be coming on the market within the next two months.</P>
      <P>Now, in order to ensure that there will not be any confusion when that butter comes on the market and that there will not be Irish butter on the market at the same time, certain steps must be taken because we all know the difficulties that would arise if Irish butter and imported butter were simultaneously on sale.  The people would insist on Irish butter and leave the imported butter on the hands of the retailers.  In order to avoid that certain steps must be taken and the Butter Marketing Committee are always suspicious of retailers and wholesalers looking for increased quantities of butter shortly before imported butter comes on the market.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has given us the figures to-night and, according to those figures, this wholesaler got £4,000 worth of butter weekly; in one week that figure was increased, or sought to be increased, from £4,000 to £7,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>He received that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2184" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That was an abnormal increase.  In ordinary circumstances would not anyone be suspicious if an order expanded to such an extent in one week?  And the Butter Marketing Committee was suspicious as to what would happen to this additional butter if they issued it to this wholesaler. Consequently they proceeded to investigate the reason for the sudden expansion.  I stated to-day that I was to receive a full report of that investigation. The investigation has not been completed but when this wholesaler made representations and stated that his business had so expanded that he required more butter to supply his legitimate customers he was given an extra 100 boxes as recently as yesterday.  Until such time as a full investigation of all these abnormal demands on the Butter Marketing Committee has taken place they will be very careful as to whom they will issue additional supplies of butter since the imported butter will possibly be on the market inside the next two months.  We do not know exactly when it will come on the market; it depends to a large extent on when our own butter supplies become exhausted, but everyone will understand the difficulty there would be if simultaneously one merchant was selling New Zealand butter and another merchant Irish butter.  The possibility is that the grocer selling New Zealand butter would not sell as much as one lb. of it and the other man would get all his trade.  It is in order to avoid that situation that the Butter Marketing Committee has of necessity to take certain precautions and investigate every case.</P>
      <P>In relation to the selling of the butter at 4/1 per lb. instead of 4/2, there is nothing to prevent anyone selling at 4/1 if he wishes to do so. He can sell at 4/- if he likes.  The 4/2 is the maximum price fixed.  If any retailer or wholesaler wishes to sell at a lower price than that there is nothing to prevent him doing so.  If merchants think their margins are too high there is nothing to prevent them cutting the price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

      <P>On the Deputy's own admission to-night this gentleman in whom he is interested has received 400 boxes of butter per week.  That is ten tons of butter, and apparently there is no restriction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As late as yesterday he got an additional 100 boxes so the Deputy's information must be out-of-date. That is the information I received from the members of the Butter Marketing Committee this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister meet me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not meet the Deputy any place.  I am giving the Deputy his answer now and I place as much reliance on the Butter Marketing Committee as the Deputy places in Mr. Gallagher.  I am quite prepared to accept the committee's information.  I have as good a right to accept that as the Deputy has to accept Mr. Gallagher's.  As I was saying, there is nothing to prevent people selling butter at 1d. per lb. less than the maximum price if they wish to do so.  Are these people who are selling butter at less than the maximum price paying trade union wages?  Are they meeting all their commitments because the margins fixed for the wholesalers and retailers have been fixed as a result of their representations to the Prices Advisory Body and it was on the recommendation of that body, after examining all the figures placed before them, that the margins were arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If these people had not had a good case for these margins I am sure the Prices Advisory Body would not have given them an increased price.  All these things were taken into consideration <Col N="2186" /> when the margin was fixed.  If wholesalers or retailers wish to associate, the price can be reduced.  The margins on butter are such that they enable apparently the individual whom the Deputy has mentioned to reduce his price by 1d. per lb.  His margin is such that if he buys from the Butter Marketing Committee he gets a margin of 18/-.  That margin has been fixed as a result of representations made to the Prices Advisory Body.  It was not arbitrarily fixed by the Government or anyone else.  Apparently the case made was a justifiable case for the margin arrived at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then butter could be reduced in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that if these people associate they can reduce the price.  There is nothing to prevent all the wholesalers and retailers cutting the price to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>If the ring is broken it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as a ring.  The margin is there if they wish to work it.  It is quite possible that they could reduce the price.  Very often firms are prepared to sell an article at a low price in order to sell other commodities.  It is good business at times to do that because more custom will be attracted and the reduced price for one commodity will help to sell tea, sugar and so forth. All the factors must be taken into consideration. We do not know what the factors are in the present case but we do know that the margins fixed were those recommended by the Prices Advisory Body after due deliberation and after careful investigation of all the facts and figures placed before them.  There is nothing to prevent any retailer or wholesaler selling butter at less than 4/2 because there is no minimum price fixed.  What is fixed is the maximum price.</P>
