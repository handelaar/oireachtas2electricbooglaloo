As I then intimated, the registers relating to housing grants are kept in county order and do not readily disclose separate figures for a particular part of a county.  The figures for the rural portion of the entire County Cork show that instalments of 407 grants allocated for new houses and 767 grants allocated for reconstruction remain unpaid, but applications for payment have been made to my Department in only a small proportion of these cases.  The special compilation of the detailed information requested by the Deputy in respect of West Cork would impose an unjustifiable demand on the time of the staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm 11 Orders made by the Government under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act. Deputies will have learned from the explanatory memorandum what these Orders were about.  Two of them imposed new protective duties on stainless steel couplings and cotton tapes and bindings.  Eight of them extended the scope of existing duties in certain respects and one related to television sets and reduced the duty in operation on television sets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to give a brief account as to why the Orders were made. The manufacture of stainless steel couplings was begun by a well-known Dublin firm and although that firm has an established reputation it was felt that they would not be able to make headway against existing trade connections without the aid of a protective duty having regard to the fact that these goods were ordinarily supplied by very well-known firms in Great Britain.  The business cannot be very extensive as the value of the market for these goods is estimated at about £16,000 per year.  In the case of television sets there was a duty of 75 per cent. (full) and a 50 per cent. preferential with certain minimum duties. The practice had developed under which licences for duty free import were given to firms engaged in the sale of <Col N="558" /> radio sets and to other traders wishing to import television sets for experimental purposes and not for resale. That practice was an undesirable one. It left open the possibility of charges of discrimination and preferential treatment and it was considered preferable to reduce the duty to 37½ per cent. (full) and 25 per cent. (preference) without a provision for importation free of duty under licence. There is no protective purpose in that duty.  It operates solely for revenue purposes.</P>
    <P>The next Order related to plastic hair slides and combs.  It excluded from the existing duty combs made from metal, glass, wood, stone or mother-of-pearl.  Combs made of these materials were admitted free of duty as they were not made here.  They have now been excluded from the scope of the duty.  The Order also brought within the scope of the duty plastic hair slides.  The effect of the change is not likely to be considerable. Tarpaulins were subject to duty heretofore when impregnated with tar or pitch.  Recently tarpaulins impregnated with other chemicals have been imported and the scope of the duty has been extended to cover tarpaulins which are impregnated with any chemical including tar and pitch. There was no duty previously on cotton tapes, bindings and webbings.  Irish manufacturers claim to be able to supply the full market needs for these goods but they are at a slight handicap in competition with outside firms because of the smaller quantities of them normally made in one run in Irish factories.  Protection, on that account, was deemed to be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Order relating to artificial silk piece goods extended the scope of the existing customs duty on these goods by reducing the minimum price specified in the original Order from 1/6 to 1/3 per square yard and by reducing the width limit so specified from 60 inches to 53 inches.  The manufacture of artificial piece goods has, of course, developed very considerably here and the extension of the scope of the duty, by reducing these limits, was considered desirable to increase the protection to these firms.  There are eight <Col N="559" /> of them at present engaged in the manufacture of these goods.</P>
    <P>The next Order relates to babies' napkins, knickers, pants and certain sanitary clothing.  The position in that regard was that the cloth from which these goods are made is subject to duty here, and previously these goods were held to be subject to duty also, but a recent decision of the Revenue Commissioners that they were sanitary ware, instead of articles of clothing, excluded them from the duty so we have remedied that position by bringing them back again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>So that they are now dutiable.  I think that is a bad thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are manufactured here in adequate supplies and the cloth from which they are made is also manufactured here.  With the development of the cotton spinning industry in this country, it now becomes possible to extend the scope of protective duties to include doubled cotton yarns.  In July of last year, restrictions were placed on the imports of single cotton yarns, but as the process of doubling yarns has developed it is considered desirable to assist it by the imposition of a protective duty. The Irish manufacturers are not yet making a full range of doubled yarns and, consequently, duty free licences will be issued for those grades that they are not producing until the full range of yarns is being manufactured here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next Order relates to iron and steel bars and sections.  That duty extended previously only to bars and sections of certain sizes, and the effect of the new Order was to extend the sizes of the bars and sections subject to duty.  The position with regard to the steel mills at Haulbowline is that, with the passing of the peak demand for their products, it is desirable to endeavour to extend their range of production in order to preserve employment there.  The mills have recently began to produce these bars and sections of slightly larger and slightly smaller sizes than they had <Col N="560" /> produced previously and which heretofore were not subject to duty.</P>
    <P>The extension of the duty on unprinted paper was the one which gave, perhaps, more concern and difficulty than any of the other duties to which these Orders, now to be confirmed, relate.  When the original protective duty on paper was imposed in 1939, this business of manufacturing printing and writing papers was only commencing in this country, and it was limited in its scope.  Since then, various changes have taken place in the industry which have made it necessary to reconsider the whole scope of the duty, and this new Order brings within the duty certain classes of papers which were previously excluded from it.  In the first place, the weight of the paper to which the duty relates was reduced from 12 lb. to 9 lb. per ream, and then specialised papers, like limitation art paper, printing paper containing mechanical pulp, featherweight esparto printing paper, tinted printing paper, writing paper, cream wove bank paper, twinwire cartridge duplex paper, pasting paper, tinted bank paper and manifold bank paper, were all brought within the scope of the duty.</P>
    <P>The position had arisen that, because of technical developments in the industry abroad, many of these classes of paper which have previously been excluded from the duty were being imported and used in substitution for the papers made here, whereas developments are taking place here to enable the mills to undertake the manufacture and making of these additional classes of papers.  The position developed last year that a rather serious falling off in employment in the industry occurred.  One large mill was, in fact, closed down for an extended period. It was in that situation that I undertook the reconsideration of the whole scope of the duty in consultation both with the paper manufacturers and with the representatives of the printing trade and other trades for whom this paper is a raw material.</P>
    <P>It is still necessary to keep the situation under review, and arrangements have, in fact, been made for the employment of industrial consultants <Col N="561" /> to see what can be done to extend the scope of manufacture and improve the manufacturing processes employed here.  In the meantime, arrangements are being made with the printers' associations to ensure that no special difficulties will develop for them during this interim period.  I am hoping that, as a result of discussions between the representatives of the paper manufacturers and the printing interests, any difficulty still existing will, in the course of time, be ironed out.  The manufacture of paper is an industry which we, naturally, would like to develop in this country because of its considerable future possibilities, and now that it is being given the fillip of this widened duty there is no reason why it should not go ahead, subject to the utilisation of the most modern techniques which we hope to secure by reason of the technical assistance project which is being initiated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That has always been in operation.  The final Order relates to root crop knives.  We had a duty upon edge tools, scythes, sickles, slashers, bill-hooks and hay knives before the war.  It was suspended during the war and representations were made for its restoration.  Its restoration was decided upon and at the same time the scope of the duty was extended to include root crop knives.  That is why the matter has to come before the Dáil. Reimposition of duty has not brought back the scope of activity here to the <Col N="562" /> pre-war dimensions but it is getting back there.  There is, of course, no reason why it should not continue particularly as my information is that the prices at which these tools are made and offered for sale here are lower than the prices of comparable imported tools.</P>
      <P>I have given that brief outline of the effect of all these Orders.  If there is any further information Deputies want I shall be glad to give it.  Most of these Orders are comparatively small in their effect.  The only two that might be regarded as of major importance are those relating to cotton ply yarns and to printing materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any opposition to this measure. The Minister mentioned in his introductory remarks two new duties in respect of stainless steel couplings and cotton goods.  Could the Minister say what additional employment is being provided as a result of the amendment of protection in connection with these goods?  The Minister also mentioned that it had been decided to reduce the duty in respect of television sets rather than grant duty free licences.  Do I understand from that that it is possible now for an individual, as distinct from assemblers or wireless manufacturers, to import television sets or are they obliged to operate through the wireless assemblers?  Can the Minister say if television sets are manufactured here?</P>
      <P>The only other two matters I wish to mention are these.  Complaints were prevalent that in respect of artificial silk piece goods, the manufacturers were not able to supply the requirements.  I understand that developments were contemplated which would supply the market requirements here and that extensions to the manufacturing capacity of a number of concerns were in the course of construction or development. Can the Minister say if these complaints have ceased and if he is satisfied that the industry is now capable of meeting the demand?  I do not know whether he has any particulars which would show to what extent increased employment has been provided as a result of the extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> Similarly in the case of the duty on paper he referred to the fact that because of paper imports one of the mills was obliged to close and a number of hands had been let go.  He mentioned that although this duty has been imposed he is not yet certain to what extent they have been able to meet competition. I wonder has he any information concerning the restoration of their positions to those who were formerly employed?  In connection with the duty on root crop knives, can the Minister say how prices compare with prices of knives imported and, again, if additional employment has been provided?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of the last item to which Deputy Cosgrave referred, that is, root crop knives&mdash;and I suppose I may include in it the Order in connection with edge tools generally&mdash;I wonder if, as in the case of the newspaper business, the Minister had consultation with those concerned.  I think there is only one firm really in this business.  I am sure he had some sort of initial consultation, but was there any final consultation or was there any sort of agreement on the part of the manufacturer that such a duty was adequate for the protection of this line of business?</P>
      <P>With regard to the edge tool industry as carried on in Wexford town &mdash;I think it is the only place in Ireland where edge tools are manufactured on any great scale&mdash;I would urge upon the Minister to keep his eye on this particular industry.  Part of it has been revived and the edge tool business has been extended there.  If there is any protection the Minister could give to provide employment and generally to expand this business further I would urge that he keep this particular Order in mind.  If there is a case for amendment, after representations by the employers, he ought to give it sympathetic consideration.  The firm engaged in this business has met hard times in the last number of years and that is one branch of the industry which should, as I have said before, provide increased employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister <Col N="564" /> has he any information as to the prospects of quick supplying from Cobh in respect of iron and steel bars, that is, rounds and rods, squares and angles of increased dimensions.  The experience of the foundry in Wexford in respect of these particular items of iron and steel is that in some cases, not generally, supply has been slow and they have been forced on occasions to seek permission, sometimes with success and sometimes without success, from the Department of Industry and Commerce or from the Department of Finance to look for these particular items elsewhere.  I am sure they would have no objection in the wide world to continuing, as they have been doing in respect of the smaller sizes, to obtain them from Cobh but on the understanding that they would be readily and quickly available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the various points raised.  So far as the stainless steel couplings are concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that I have some difficulty in discussing the employment position because only a single firm is concerned and Deputy Cosgrave is at present in a position to get all the reliable information concerning it.  It is a business which was only recently started and which, I am sure, can be developed on a greater scale than that which it appears to have reached at present.</P>
      <P>So far as television sets are concerned, it was, of course, always open to anybody to import a television set on payment of duty.  The duty-free facility was given only to traders and people importing them for experimental purposes and not for resale.  It will still be open to anybody to import a television set subject to the payment of the reduced duty and no special permit or authority will be required. I understand that there is one firm experimenting at the present time with the manufacture of television sets but it will perhaps not be able to make headway until certain decisions are made here as to the future of television, if it ever comes to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are different characteristics in the television broadcasting systems of different countries and a decision will <Col N="565" /> need to be taken fairly soon as to what form we will adopt here, if ever, before more progress in the manufacturing end can be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is a decision likely to be reached?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I know, has it under very active consideration at the moment.  He has been naturally reluctant to take that decision in advance of the time when he could foresee the establishment of a television broadcasting station, but the importance of taking it early has been impressed upon him and he realises it fully.</P>
      <P>So far as art silk goods are concerned, the manufacturers state that they are able to produce the entire home market requirements of the classes of art silk goods which are now subject to import duty.  There has been a rather noteworthy increase in employment in the firms concerned in the production of these goods in recent months, but whether that was due to general trade conditions or the operation of this Order it would be difficult to say.</P>
      <P>With regard to paper, the large firm which had closed down last autumn has, of course, reopened, and is now actively engaged in production again. Arrangements that are being made for technical investigation of the industry will, I hope, not merely improve existing production methods to the extent that they require improvement, but also open up new possibilities for the industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as these edge tools are concerned, my information is that the price at which the Wexford-made tools <Col N="566" /> are available is lower than the import price, irrespective of duty.  The present import duty is 25 per cent. (flat).  That was the duty before the war, which was brought back into operation again. In these circumstances, it should be adequate because it is required only to divert orders to Wexford where, in our information, better value is obtainable, anyhow.  I should think that once the position has been restored that the business flows naturally to Wexford then it should develop substantially.</P>

The purpose of the duty is to increase the volume of business of the home concerns and thereby permit of their lowering their prices.

    <P>With regard to deliveries from Irish Steel, I do not think there is any problem there at the moment.  It is true that Irish Steel has been endeavouring to work on the basis of producing against orders so that the stock they had to carry would be kept at a minimum.  A stock of steel bars represents a substantial investment of <Col N="567" /> money and, of course, Irish Steel Limited has no capital.  They are working upon a bank overdraft.  I hope to have before the end of the year proposals for the reorganisation of the capital structure of Irish Steel, a reorganisation which would be desirable in any event but which would be necessary in future, particularly if they are to work upon the basis of supplying orders from stock and investing money in stocks.  At the present time, however, there is substantial stock there and I am sure deliveries can be made without delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion on which this Estimate was before the House I made a plea for the conacre tillage farmers of County Dublin.  I pointed out that the position was unique in County Dublin in that there is a large number of conacre tillage farmers who have been making a good living out of this form of farming. They have no land of their own.  Their sons carried on the same type of farming. They never succeeded in getting sufficient money to buy land.  A few of them managed to buy a few acres. The conacre was very dear.  They had to buy machinery and, taking one year with another, some of them eked out an existence and just paid their way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> I refer to this matter because a number of estates have been acquired and possibly estates will be acquired in the next few years and some large farms that have been let on the conacre system may be taken over by the Land Commission.  I want these people to be seriously considered in that matter.  I am not interfering.  I know the Minister has a serious problem to deal with in the matter of land division. There are so many uneconomic holdings in the country that it is very difficult for the Minister or the Land Commission to do the things we all desire they should do.  Nevertheless, I am dealing with the problem here that families who have been conacre tillage farmers in County Dublin for years upon years may possibly due to the present policy of the Land Commission in relieving uneconomic holdings be crushed out completely and may lose their livelihoods.  These people work very hard, some of them 14, 15 and 16 hours a day, at their holdings to eke out an existence and rear their families at this type of work.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest that in my constituency where the farmers have not to be told to till their lands, as they are good tillage farmers, the Land Commission should sympathetically consider them in any schemes which they may have in hands, because the conacre tillage farmers of County Dublin are worthy of sympathetic consideration. If the Department of Lands and the Land Commission have to make decisions I would like that they would not make any decisions that would be contrary to the livelihoods of the people whom I have the honour of representing at the present time.  I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should convey my remarks to the officers and inspectors of the Land Commission in dealing with my constituency when there is land to be divided in the area.</P>
    <P>Strange as it may seem we have a large number of uneconomic holdings in County Dublin.  We have small uneconomic holdings of people eking out an existence on four or five acres. We have some with seven-acre holdings and up to ten acres, so we <Col N="569" /> have the problem of uneconomic holdings in County Dublin.  Some of these people work very hard at market gardening, cultivating tomatoes and other things, trying to eke out an existence.  I would point out to the Land Commission, taking the county as a whole, that we have a considerable number of uneconomic holdings in County Dublin and that the amount of land to be divided in the county is very small and will not often be able to relieve some of these people as well as to encourage the tillage farmers I have referred to.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister very sincerely, as is his due and that of his Department for increasing the size of holdings, because I hold that it is no use to hold two men in mid-air.  It is a good deal better to increase the size of holdings and give a man a chance of making a living as he may be responsible for giving a living possibly to two or three other people as well. If he is a market gardener or an intensive tillage farmer he may possibly employ two other families as well as himself.  The type of very small-holding, the 21 statute acre holding, was a wash-out.  It meant that a man was in mid-air, neither a farmer nor a labourer, on the holding.  I am delighted that the Minister has changed that policy.</P>
    <P>We have another problem in County Dublin due, of course, to the implementation of the 1950 Act&mdash;the price of land, and the fact that the people going to get it in future, especially within a radius of the City of Dublin, are going to find it very expensive.  I am not saying that it is wrong to pay the market price because I believe that an individual, in selling land, is entitled to his price, but if anybody has to suffer as a result of this it should be the State.  I would say that there is a vicious circle in this matter.  I have experience of the Land Commission taking over land in my constituency and of people bidding against the Land Commission.  Often it goes so far that where they know well that the Land Commission is interested in a holding of land they will come along.  I do not want to imply anything by my <Col N="570" /> remarks to the House but there is definitely a danger of people who have land to sell and getting the price from the Land Commission and in that way making the land very dear.  I am unofficially informed that where certain land in North County Dublin was going to be acquired by the Land Commission other individuals were responsible for putting up the price considerably, with the result that the Land Commission will have to recoup their losses and it is making it rather dear to the people who will be allotted this land.  Nevertheless, we welcome land division for our people who have uneconomic holdings and conacre farmers in the county.  I do not want my remarks to be interpreted as showing that we in County Dublin object to it where there are people anxious to get the land and make the best possible use of it.  We are only anxious to see that it goes to people who will definitely till the lands to the benefit of themselves and of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>There is only one other remark I want to make on this Estimate.  I would ask the Land Commission in future that when they are making roads to new holdings if they could improve by some method their road-making and in doing so if they could see that that road would be handed over to the county council so that it would be kept in proper repair.  I know there are a good number of complexities in this problem which has for a long time been an aggravated problem in County Dublin and I do not want to refer to it again.  I know that the Minister has no legal machinery at his disposal to carry out my wishes in regard to this matter, but nevertheless I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that he should get his Department to see if there was any way to deal with this very urgent and aggravated matter.  I would be deeply grateful if he would consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This vote for the Land Commission has ever been a sort of contentious vote, and notwithstanding the fact that tributes are paid to the efficiency and impartiality of the Land Commission inspectors and <Col N="571" /> officials, which I bear testimony to, there is always a feeling that in the acquisition and division of lands, influences, political and otherwise, are at work and remain at work.  Now I do not know how far that may be correct or not, but it is important that the Land Commission and the inspectors would maintain the highest integrity in the task of subdividing holdings.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that as far as I know no person has got land who is not entitled to it, and that in every case where they have got it with the inspectors recommending them or putting them forward they believed that they were going to make good use of the land.  I regret to say that there are still a very large number of cases in which the allottees did not make good.  Some time ago we passed in this House a Bill for the purpose of enabling the Land Commission to reacquire holdings of that type where the allottee did not make good use of it.  It has not, indeed, been operated very much. It was for a while but then it seemed to lapse into the limbo of lost legislation. I think that the Land Commission would be well advised to at least consider the operation of that Act again because it would incite or inspire the people who have got that land to make better use of it than they are making. In particular, where any person got land on undertaking to get married&mdash; I know some of them did promise to get married if allotted a holding&mdash;and where he has failed to do so, that land should be resumed.  The big principle of the Land Commission in the allocation of land is to establish a home and establish a family.  There is no point in allocating land to people who are not going to make use of it in that direction.  It is a waste of time and energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a bit disturbed at the notices of intention to inspect that have been served in several constituencies and in particular in the two Counties of Longford and Westmeath.  A large number of notices have been served and inspection has taken place.  It is very disturbing to people who are working their farms well to get such a notice. <Col N="572" /> I know cases in which it is true that, as a result of the economic war&mdash;this is not controversial now&mdash;they were in low condition, they had not the finance to buy machinery or fertilisers for their holdings.  In a great number of cases they owed money to the bank, as well as owing land annuities to the Land Commission and rates, perhaps, to the local authority.  In some cases they owed money they had got from the Agricultural Credit Corporation prior to the economic war.  As times have improved, they have been able to improve their working and they are now making good use of the land and are carrying out tillage operations on a very extensive scale.  I suggest that where that now obtains, where a man and his family are now working a fairly substantial farm, unless there is very grave need and necessity for the land, notice of intention to inspect should not be sent out.  If it is sent out, the decision should be made within the shortest possible time and if the land is to be acquired, acquisition should take place speedily.  It is not fair to leave a thing hanging like the sword of Damocles over the head of the tenant or occupier.  There should be a speed up in such acquisitions.</P>
    <P>I know cases in which agitation was started and the Land Commission were slow to say whether they intended to acquire the land or not.  I know there was a difficulty about the fair price to which Deputy Burke referred.  There was the danger that the value or price of the farm could be increased.  At the same time, land all over the country has a fairly well-known market value and there is no use in anyone puffing or blowing up the price of a farm.  It is easy to ascertain the normal price for land in a district and that should be available easily to the Land Commission.  It is true, of course, that the price of land has increased. There is no use in saying that the Land Commission could or should get the land cheaply, as that would mean to some extent robbing the owner.  The owner should get a fair price and only a fair price.</P>
    <P>The point I want to make is that when the agitation starts the Land Commission delays too long in making <Col N="573" /> up its mind as to whether it should or should not proceed.  The result is that the landowner is left in suspense and in a great number of cases damage is done to the holding.  He cannot get people to work on it and cannot make use of it while this agitation is going on.  When the Land Commission does decide to inspect, a long period elapses before acquisition takes place.  The land cannot be set or let or worked during that period.  Everybody knows it is going to be acquired and people insist on getting nearly a squatter's title to it, to get in in some way.  The whole argument I am making is to get speedy acquisition where the Land Commission sets about acquiring a holding, so that there will be only the minimum of delay.  I know that the tenant is entitled to appeal against the acquisition and to appeal against the price, but these two things are not so important as the first decision, that is, either to acquire or not to acquire.</P>
    <P>There are holdings in County Long-ford that have been in agitation for a long time.  I do not want to raise individual cases, but I may be permitted to mention the More O'Ferrall estate which has been in agitation for over two years.  The Forestry Department was to take some of it and the Land Commission was to acquire the rest of it.  There the question hangs.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot do so unless you make me Minister for Lands and let me inquire into it; then I will find out who is responsible. I do not know who is responsible now. The owners complain bitterly of the time it has taken the Land Commission <Col N="574" /> to decide something about the matter.  I could mention several cases, but I mention that because it is a big one and is a case where there are executors.  The executors are agreeable; but if the Land Commission does not take it the executors want to sell it.  They are in suspense for over two years and can do neither one thing nor the other.</P>
      <P>On the question of notice of intention to inspect, it is very unfair to inspect a holding simply because a local Fianna Fáil club or Fine Gael club should wish to get somebody else, and the club secretary writes in to the Minister or someone else to have a certain place acquired.  They can get up an agitation very easily that makes the unfortunate landowner a sort of outlaw, even if the holding is as small as 50 acres, saying that he is &ldquo;a menace&rdquo; and &ldquo;an enemy to the country.&rdquo; That should not be.  If the Land Commission wish to operate the section by purchasing by auction, they can do so.  I do not agree with Deputy Burke that anyone will bid up a farm against the Land Commission.  The farm might be knocked down to that person, who would then be in a difficulty, being left with a farm he did not want.</P>
      <P>On the question of subdivision, I still subscribe to the view that where there are small uneconomic holdings the Land Commission can often do much better work by giving a smallholder five or ten acres than by giving him 20 or 30 acres.  Where he is doing fairly well on a small holding of, say, ten acres, ten acres more are often of more benefit and value to that congested holder than 20 acres because, believe it or not, the 20 acres are just beyond his capacity to carry.  Ten acres would do him very well because they give him the grass for a cow or two extra and some young stock, as well as land for meadowing and tillage. But when a large parcel is given to him it just breaks his back because the valuation is too high and so on.  I urge the Land Commission when they acquire a holding in a congested area for the relief of congestion to make as large a number of parcels of land as possible for the smallholders round about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="575" /> The question of migration will always be a problem.  The Minister is well aware of the difficulties he is meeting and the allottees are meeting in certain counties, particularly Meath and Westmeath.  There is a demand by the local people for holdings when an estate is being divided.  But people whose ancestors were sent to &ldquo;Hell or to Connaught&rdquo; are entitled to consideration and it is only fair when land is being divided that they should get a portion of it.  There is the feeling, however, that the local people who are native to the soil should get a preference.</P>
    <P>I know it is not easy for the Government, when there is a policy of migration from the western and south-western seaboards, to carry that out in any extensive form if they divide some of the land amongst the local people.  But I would suggest to the Minister that he should urge the Land Commission to try and hold the balance fairly.  It would be held fairly when a large estate has been taken over if 50 per cent. of the estate were allotted to migrants and the other 50 per cent. to local people.  In that way you would get a better feeling of friendship and co-operation between the people in the area and those coming into it.  There is no use bringing people into a district if they are regarded by a certain number of the residents as intruders or as people whom the Government of the day have favoured by bringing them to that district. I think it would be wise for the Land Commission and the Minister to consider that a certain proportion, and 50 per cent. is not an unreasonable proportion, should be offered to migrants and 50 per cent. to the landless and uneconomic holders in the district.  In that way you will get more friendly relations between he people on the estate than you are getting at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>How many acres per tenant would you give them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>An economic holding&mdash;35 or 40 acres.  There is a standard set up for migrants of not less than 35 acres, with a new house <Col N="576" /> and outhouses and certain amenities. It is a great benefit to these people to get it and I think they do not appreciate as much as they should the value of what the State is giving them.  It gives them a good farm of land, a new house and outhouses in exchange for a barren holding on the western seaboard. It is a very big thing and they do not appreciate it as much as they should.  In addition they get certain other facilities, such as the purchase of animals for them and, in certain cases, an allocation of so much per week until they get settled down.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, people who think they have just as good a claim and who reside near them cannot get anything at all.  They feel, perhaps wrongly, that these people who are coming in are supporters of the Government. They may not be supporters of the Government at all.  I am not arguing that there is a political affiliation there, but the people who have a grievance against them say that there is.  No matter what anyone may say to the contrary, when a person gets a farm of land it is the Government of the day who get the credit for that and not the Land Commission.  People do not believe that the Land Commission exercise an independent discretion in the allocation of land apart from the Government.  The Government are blamed whether they give it or whether they do not.  That will be true of every Government no matter what Government is in office.  I urge the Minister and the Land Commission, therefore, to take that view in the future in connection with the division of estates.  Where a farm is being well tilled and there is a fairly large family and the farmer at some future date intends to divide it in the interests of the family, the Land Commission should not take the farm from him.  On the other hand, where people are not making proper use of land the Land Commission should acquire it, giving reasonable compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other difficulties also arise in the acquisition of estates.  There is the question of the herd and other employees on the estate.  While the Land Commission in some cases do allocate a holding to the herd who is being displaced, <Col N="577" /> in other cases they do not. They offer him compensation for loss of employment.  There was one case of an Old I.R.A. man brought to my notice who had been a herd for over 25 years on an estate which has been acquired.  He was offered £150 compensation instead of a holding.  If he is a person who would appear to make good use of a holding, I think he should get it, especially as he rendered service in the 1920-21 period.  Again, other employees sometimes get a holding and sometimes they do not.  It is very hard to understand the reason why one employee gets a holding and another does not, when their circumstances appear to be similar as regards family, work, etc.  Of course it would be difficult for anybody to criticise that, and I do not intend to do so.  I would appeal to the Minister, however, to see that the same consideration will be given to everyone and that there will be some uniformity in the division of land.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything we can say about the fair price for the land.  There was an Act passed a couple of years ago binding the Land Commission to give that.  As I say the fair price can easily be established. There is no district but there is land for sale in, and the fair price can be established easily enough, and if there is puffing by anybody to put up the price of it, they can be very easily dealt with by leaving it to them at that price.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission does not let anybody know what it is doing&mdash;and it is quite correct in that&mdash;when it is bidding for a holding.  They have authorised people to do the buying for them and if they keep their minds to themselves and if they discharge&mdash; which I am sure they do&mdash;the direction imposed on them by the Land Commission, there is no danger of anybody getting to know that the Land Commission is bidding for a place, and therefore no great risk.  Provided, as I say, that the people appointed by the Land Commission do not betray their trust and retain the secrecy of their instructions, they can be buying for anybody and if they use as much discretion in the bidding as they would <Col N="578" /> for themselves, then there is no danger of an excessive price being bid.</P>
    <P>On the question of roads and fences and everything like that for land on estates divided, I always feel that people when they get a farm want too much from the Land Commission altogether.  They should appreciate the fact that they have got a good farm and houses, and at least they should themselves put the additions and amenities to it that are required.  If there was less spoon-feeding, and if they knew they would not get any spoon-feeding afterwards, I think it would be all to the good.  They would then proceed to make use of the farm the State bestowed on them through the Land Commission.  It is a very difficult task.  No Government in this country will be ever able to satisfy all the people in the division of land and if they were able to keep a fair middle of the road system in trying to do it&mdash; they will get criticism, of course&mdash;but I think they will have done well.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Land Commission ending at as early a stage as possible the whole question of land acquisition and division so that we would have settled these matters in so far as it is possible to settle anything, for all time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a congested area along the south-western seaboard I, of course, would have to take a different view from that taken by Deputy MacEoin on this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because we hold that the very small holders along the south and south-west seaboard are there because their ancestors were driven back and they had to set up in these little holdings and try to eke out an existence during their lives.  But no matter under what difficulties they lived there in years gone by I think every opportunity should now be afforded them of getting an economic holding in the Midlands or wherever good lands are available.  In fact, it is because of the difficulties under which the smallholders live in those Gaeltacht areas that the young people <Col N="579" /> are flying from the land.  They are no longer economic by any means and whatever chances they had in years gone by when they had something else to do, like fishing or so forth, to help them to live, they have not that same opportunity now.  In fact, there are really in the southern portion of my constituency, very many small holdings absolutely derelict and scarcely any owner can be found for them at all. In very many of the others, we have only old maids and bachelors because nobody wishes to or could settle down in those small holdings.  When, therefore, one of these small farmers makes an application for a transfer of holding and wishes that his children, his boys, would have an opportunity of making a living on the land, I think the Land Commission should hasten the transfer and enable those people to get an economic farm where the young people would be saved from emigrating.  The small farm thus vacated should be given to some other neighbouring uneconomic holder and not divided up into small plots as has often been done because after all I think the long-term view would be that in those congested areas&mdash;the poorer areas&mdash;the more land a person can have, even bad land, the better he can live and even though eventually it will entirely reduce the population of the areas, still the problem of the uneconomic holder will be or should be solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do know that recently very many applications have been made by smallholders&mdash;and by some fairly large holders&mdash;in South Kerry for transfers of holdings to the Midlands, or, perhaps, to other parts of Munster, and I think the Land Commission inspectors, having examined these, should know cases where there are really good farmers working their poor land in these remote poor areas.  A certain amount of provision should be made for such people to get them transfers of holding.  If a good farmer does his best to live on a poor farm, he should certainly make good if he got the proper land.  Then, again, perhaps, before the turbary would be used up&mdash; a great deal will be necessary for the proposed generating stations&mdash;I think <Col N="580" /> the Land Commission should make provision that in all cases people requesting turbary plots should get them. Even when these plots were given in the sales of the estate, the acre that each holder got is now used up and there are very many applications from individuals and from numbers of people in districts for turbary rights, and the Land Commission should come to their rescue and ensure that at least they would have a plot of turbary that will do at least one generation, and in all cases, these turbary plots would be fully developed by being drained, and by having roads leading into, and through them.</P>
    <P>If the problem of congestion is ever to be solved, I think that when a farm is offered for sale, where the land is good and capable of subdivision or even in cases where it would not be subdivided, the Land Commission should step in and acquire it rather than let foreigners take it over.  I think the time has now arrived when we might expect the Land Commission to step up this work.  I understand that during the emergency period the Department was entirely depleted of its staff but now, after six or seven years, I think we should have sufficient staff to carry out and accelerate work that is so urgently required.</P>

      <P>It is now just over 15 years since I first entered this House. During all that period, I felt on many occassions that if we had made any reasonable progress, we should have finally settled the land question and dealt with all the land available for distribution.  Instead of having reached the goal of all our efforts to end the land question I am convinced that the reconquest of Ireland is taking place all around us at the moment.  I tabled a question here in 1951 with the object of ascertaining how many acres of land had been bought by non-nationals and I got a very vague reply &mdash;in other words, I did not get the reply at all that I expected to get.  I put down a similar question early this year and again I had difficulty in ascertaining how many acres had been resold to people living outside the country.  I did however get the information that for the last six months of <Col N="581" /> 1952, 6,900 acres had been sold to non-nationals. When I hear Deputy MacEoin, Deputy Palmer and other Deputies urging on the Minister the necessity of giving land to our own people, I ask myself are we sincere when we allow thousands of acres pass into the hands of non-nationals.  Is it not an extraordinary fact that during the past seven years, since the end of the last war, certain gentlemen from England running away to escape high taxation in their own country were able to find asylum in this country and buy up the best of the land here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Who, in the name of goodness, has any function in it except this Government and the last Government? I was present in the House some time ago when a Land Bill was going through and there was as much opposition to it as if we had the old landlord system still in existence. Personally, if I had my way, I would put an end to the Land Commission and put the Minister in complete charge, giving him all the necessary powers to do something effective in regard to the division of land.  The part of the country from which I come was quite a good locality for landlords some years ago but in the last 20 or 30 years most of them disappeared and their place was taken by the ordinary Pat Murphys of this country.  They farmed that land for a number of years but within the past six or seven years, more especially in the last two or three years, there has been a sudden change. We have men coming across from England who never spent an hour previously in this country purchasing these places.  Because they put six or seven horses on some parts of this land, they are entitled to call them stud farms and to avoid any necessity for carrying on tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we should face up to this problem in a realistic way.  I heard Deputy Burke speak about the conacre system and in regard to the necessity of the Land Commission letting land in their possession out on the conacre system.  Does anybody think that that is treating this matter seriously?  While <Col N="582" /> this land remains in the possession of the Land Commission, we have unfortunate people in the poorer parts of Kerry and other counties trying to eke out an existence amongst the rocks. Why should we allow people from outside countries, who never contributed anything of value to this country and who come here merely because they desire to escape taxation abroad, come in here and purchase farms while our own people are starving for want of land?  I think the time is ripe to put an end to the reconquest of the country that is taking place in that way. That is what has been taking place for a number of years.  Let us not be humbugging ourselves but rather admit that we have fallen down on the job when we allow that to take place.</P>
    <P>I have seen some of the tenants who were given parcels of land of about 25 acres and I am not at all satisfied that that method of distribution is the proper way to deal with the land question. Twenty-five acres, 30 acres, or even 35 acres are not sufficient to constitute an economic holding.  I have seen these people striving, and even their children working hard on the land, and yet they can never reach the status that we would wish them to have.  I have seen many of these small farms in my own part of the country and also in counties through which I pass travelling by train to Dublin.  A house is usually built on the farm for the tenant and only just a house and they are given certain facilities such as Deputy MacEoin has mentioned. These people, however, have no capital at their back and it is useless to expect them to work that land properly without some capital.  I know that in a number of cases where estates were divided in the last 15 or 20 years, there was quite a number of landless men, men who had been reared on the land and who had helped their fathers on the home holdings.  These men could have got the necessary finances from their parents to start work if they were given land but they did not get it.  I think it is wrong not to give land to men who are willing to work it and who are likely to make a success of it.</P>
    <P>I have had experience also of cases where land was given to people who had not sufficient capital to work it. <Col N="583" /> If these people went to the Agricultural Credit Corporation they were charged 5 per cent. for any money they could raise.  Now they have to pay up to 6 per cent. and put themselves into debt.  When a large estate is being divided is there anything wrong in building houses for people who are willing to work that land on a cooperative basis rather than expect each individual to buy a plough, buy machinery, buy a horse and all the farming implements to work a small farm which he may be given on this estate&mdash;a thing which he cannot do because he has not the necessary financial backing?  I suggest that we shall have to do something more realistic than we have done in the last 20 years to settle people on the land.  I do not see any hope of the Land Commission making a success of the job in the next 20 years under the system that has been operated up to the present. Whilst we have been operating that system, we see the reconquest of this country taking place by people who have plenty of money and can come along and acquire the land that we need for our own people.  I was told of one case of a man who bought a big place not so long ago.  I was informed that he drove down to Holy-head in his motor car taking with him in his luggage enough money to buy a good farm of land over here.  While that is taking place we have people here trying to eke out a living on six or seven acres of land.  I was recently looking up the number of holdings in this country and I think there are up to 60,000 holdings of less than five acres. I forget the actual area but it was under ten acres of land.  We cannot describe them as holdings in the true sense of the word.  While we are all conscious of that position, we were able to sell, in the last six months of last year, 6,900 acres to non-nationals. I suggest to the Minister that we should have less talk in this House and, instead, get down and do the job and give the land of this country to those Irish people who need it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, in order to satisfy Deputy Hickey, we should decide on a restricted sale of land. Take, for instance, a small farmer who may want to sell his farm because his health will not permit him to continue it.  It would hardly be justice to tell him that he could sell his land only to a certain restricted number of people because that would mean a restriction on the value of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One great difficulty in this connection is the fact that land at present is very valuable.  Generally, when war breaks out, land becomes valuable and when the war ends the value of land <Col N="585" /> declines.  That is a question to which Deputy Hickey might pay some attention. From whence does all that money flow?  The fact of the matter is that during times of war there is a big demand for land and therefore it becomes very valuable.  Perhaps the reason is that Governments have to feed all the people fairly well: when the war is over, they do not.</P>

      <P>There is a demand on the land.  Various people want more.  The Land Acts and the Land Commission laid down that only certain types of people would get it.  I heard Deputy MacEoin talk about a fifty-fifty basis, that is, 50 per cent. of the land to migrants and 50 per cent. to the natives of the district.  In County Meath we have the same trouble as County Westmeath, and perhaps a bit more.  I am not satisfied that in County Meath we are getting a fair crack of the whip as far as the division of land is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>There are portions of Meath, especially North Meath, where the land is so bad that, at a conference here, Deputy Blowick told me quite seriously that if they took the land from the people they could get nobody else to take it because nobody would live on it.  Therefore, there is not much use in our talking about the land of Connemara and of the rocks there.  We have every sympathy for the situation there but the fact of the matter is that we have people in County Meath suffering the same way.  Many of those small farmers in North Meath could not live were it not that they grow small patches of quicks and that, on small portions of land, they can produce early cabbage.  Thank God, Dundalk and Drogheda never reneged us and we have the markets there which we had years ago.  I think that those farmers in North Meath should get very serious consideration and that the Land Commission should have full reports on the position.  Actually, some <Col N="586" /> time ago, migrants were brought into that district.  I have not the slightest objection to bringing in migrants to South Meath where there are few people and very large ranches but it is a mistaken policy to bring migrants into districts such as those in the northern portion of County Meath where, for generations, numerous people have been watching for a bit of land to work.  I hope that the Minister will study that position and get certain information from the Land Commission which they have in their possession.</P>
      <P>Another problem in County Meath is that, unlike Westmeath&mdash;although, indeed, portions of Westmeath supply milk to Dublin, too&mdash;the bulk of the milk supplies are sent to Dublin with the result that labourers living in labourers' cottages in Meath cannot get milk there.  They see the milk lorries pass by their doors but they cannot get any milk for themselves. The reason is that the dairymen are very busy.  Very often their cans are full of milk and sealed and they cannot open them and sell milk.  If they do sell milk to one or two persons then, a few days afterwards, they have an inspector from the Milk Board down on top of them.  Under these conditions, they cannot and they do not want to supply milk to such people. Such a state of affairs should not exist in County Meath.</P>
      <P>Quite recently, a large farm in the parish of Moynalty, County Meath, was divided.  When I passed that way, two days afterwards, I saw three cows along the road and they were there all the time.  The land that was taken up by the Land Commission formerly fed these cows and, the moment it was divided, there was no place for the cows.  Along the Blackpool Road, at Batterstown, anybody can see a cow on the roadside, because it is there all the time.  I do not say that the same cow has been there all down the years but for the past nine or ten years there has been a cow on the roadside there. What are the people to do if the Gardaí prosecute them?  There are children there who need the milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we got our freedom a lot of the people lived on condensed milk <Col N="587" /> which they bought in the shop.  That was a very good thing but I think it would be a pity if we started the condensed milk stunt again when there is plenty of milk available.  One man in County Meath started to sell milk in bottles to different towns.  I mention that to show that there is a grievance there and a problem to be solved.  No doubt, he may have solved the problem to some extent but there are a great many labourers' cottages in County Meath.  For that reason I ask the Minister to have a fairly strong word with the Land Commission and the inspector there so that they will not neglect any agricultural worker who has a cow and who, by the division of land, has nowhere to keep it. Thank God, owing to the fairly prosperous times we are living in, and the small increase in the wages of agricultural workers, I notice that quite a number of them have been able to purchase cows.  I think it is a pity, for the sake of the health of the children and of themselves, that some facility is not given to these people.</P>

      <P>Let them have cow parks or accommodation plots.  It was the former Government which took some keen objection to these accommodation plots.  I watched them very carefully in County Meath and nobody could take any exception to them. Wherever the former Minister and the former Government found their objections, I do not know, but they admitted to me on one occasion that it was not in County Meath anyway.  These accommodation plots, in most cases, were worked and stocked.  There were a few cases in which the father and mother died and the son had no necessity to keep a cow and perhaps there were a few plots set in these circumstances, but you will always have that sort of thing.  You may take it that people who expect in land division 100 per cent. efficiency tomorrow morning are going to be disappointed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if all these people who got land in recent years bought it and paid for it themselves, you would possibly have the same amount of failures.  Most of the failures which took place were due to temporary circumstances&mdash;the loss of a cow or a horse or a serious illness will upset things for quite a long time&mdash; and I ask the Land Commission to judge these people from a more humane and a more practical point of view.  There is no use in getting a ruler and drawing straight lines&mdash;that will not work in relation to a farm of land.  There has to be a good deal of elasticity.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to look into that question and also the question of giving agricultural workers an opportunity of keeping cows, either through accommodation plots or through the ordinary cow parks.  The Minister may answer me by saying that in former years the experience with regard to these cow parks was very unfortunate, that they had got into debt and so on and that they had to take them from the board of health, but excuses could have been made at that time.  It was not the fault of the board of health and not the fault possibly of the people who kept cows at one time and then had to sell them when misfortune in some shape or other came upon them.  These cow parks were then set for dry cattle and horses and some of them got into debt. I do not think there are any in debt now, but we have a new and more sensible principle of administering them to-day.  We appoint people in charge of these plots and they decide who should get grass, how much should be paid for it and how the whole thing should be managed.  It is certainly working very satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the things which, from a humane point of view, we should look into very carefully, to ensure that any legitimate farm labourer with a wife and family will get an opportunity of feeding a cow and having fresh milk and a bit of butter.  With butter at its present price, it would be a great help to many agricultural workers whose wages are not extraordinarily high. Due to the changes which have taken <Col N="589" /> place generally, free milk is not now available in quite a number of places. I remember when free milk was available to all the workers and when nobody thought anything about a pint or a quart of milk&mdash;it had no value. To-day, due to war and other conditions, it has very great value and is a very precious commodity.</P>
    <P>I should like the Land Commission to see whether it is possible to provide people with facilities to keep a cow and, above all, to see to it that smallholders get a reasonable opportunity in County Meath.  I do not know any migrants in County Meath&mdash; and we have had them from many counties&mdash;who did as well as the migrants from North Meath.  Many of them are living on the high road from Dublin to Trim and it would edify most Deputies to have a look at their farms just before you reach Trim and to see how things are done.  Without building them up and without any great effort at all, they are pilot farms, and from the point of view of production these people should get a better chance than they have got in the past.</P>
    <P>With regard to the size of the farms, there is no doubt that very serious mistakes were made in this regard. Those in the colony at Rathcarne got 21 statute acres.  After taking a garden and a yard out of it, they have left about 18 acres which spells emigration. That is the flight from the land. It is obvious that nobody could live there, except the mother and father. They were increased somewhat afterwards and to-day they should be around 40 acres because anything less than 40 acres is utterably uneconomic, a waste of time and money and merely going to force a flight from the land. The Land Commission should be a little more generous in the areas of land they give, so that the people will have a chance of living and working on them.  We must remember that we are living in different times.  There are dances, football matches and so on for which the old man has to produce the &ldquo;dibs&rdquo; every Saturday night.  If he does not do so, the son will say: &ldquo;I am not going to stop here&mdash;I will hop it.&rdquo;  We must try to make things economic and not create the small uneconomic <Col N="590" /> holdings that were created in the past and about which we complain so much.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister and the Land Commission have a very difficult task and I know that, no matter how they split the difference, they will not be able to relieve all the uneconomic holdings&mdash;some 60,000 or 70,000 people will be left as they are.  For that reason, we are trying to develop industry which, of course, is not easy. If it were developed, it might ease the situation, but every one of us must face up to the fact that when the Land Commission's work is finished&mdash;and I wish it were finished&mdash;there will still be left 60,000 or 70,000 people with uneconomic holdings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know where the Land Commission is heading.  I should also like to know what is the object it has in view and when does it hope to come to the end of its task.  I was curious about the issue of some £5,000,000 worth of new bonds in a recent Bill.  It indicates that this matter is not going to be wound up in the foreseeable future.  I do not think the Land Commission was ever intended for that purpose and I wonder if, taking a long view, it is a good thing for the country that there should not be a definite plan upon the execution of which the Land Commission could close down.  I should like to say some more on that matter but perhaps it might sound revolutionary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear from Deputy O'Reilly that while there is all this talk about uneconomic holdings, he would give these people 40 acres. Twenty years ago, I threw up the sponge in this connection, because people seem to lose their senses when they come in here to deal with practical matters.  There is not sufficient land in this country to provide land for all the people who require it.  Until we find some scientific method by which we can reclaim a large portion of the Atlantic Ocean we will not have enough land to provide all our people with land.  Now I have always held the motto that anything one does one should do it well.  I have urged time and time again that 50 acres of land <Col N="591" /> should be the smallest unit allocated by the Land Commission in order to create an economic holding.  First we had holdings of 20 and 22 acres.  Then they crawled up to about 30 acres and, having reached that point, they thought they had done elaborately well.  The first thing to ensure in allocating an economic holding is that the holding is capable of carrying the overhead charges.  That is the first liability on any holding.  A man is not brought from some other part of the country with his wife and family and placed on a holding merely to be a pawn for the Land Commission and the county council in relation to the payment of land annuities and rates respectively.  It would be far better for that man to remain as he is.  Taking the general run of valuations throughout the country, the valuation works out at roughly £2 per acre.  Rates are showing an upward tendency.  How then can a man with 30 or 35 acres of land meet the overhead charges and at the same time achieve a standard of living for himself, his wife and his family?  It cannot be done, and that is all about it.</P>
    <P>I am disgusted at the vandalism of the Land Commission in dividing up plots.  I do not think there is any country in the world&mdash;this may appear to be an extravagant statement, but it is nevertheless true&mdash;in which so much land is wasted as there is here. One of the greatest criminals in that respect is the Land Commission.  They begin by giving a man 20 or 22 acres. They build an enormous fence around that holding&mdash;a fence that would have served as a moat around an old castle &mdash;about two feet wide at the base with a gripe on either side at least two yards wide.  Calculating a fence 400 or 500 yards long and at least six feet wide one can estimate how much land is taken off that 20 acre holding, a holding which is already uneconomic anyway.  Surely the proper method of fencing would be the putting down of reinforced concrete uprights and the running of wire fencing around the holding.  That is what would be done in any other country.  Our present type of fencing would not be allowed <Col N="592" /> in Belgium where land is both scarce and dear.  It is a waste of good land, land that should be producing food of some kind for either man or beast.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is worth while repeating a former appeal I made to the Minister and to his Department. Once policy is laid down and regulations made, one might as well try to turn back the Atlantic Ocean with a pitchfork as get regulations changed.  Already the community has to pay heavily for placing people on the land.  It is not right that such a relatively enormous quantity of good land should be wasted in useless fences.  Very often because the land is so dry the present type of fencing crumbles away and it might as well not have been put there at all in the first instance.  The obvious thing to do is to save every inch of land for the benefit of the people who are being placed on it.  I am sure if I am here 20 years hence&mdash;Providence may ordain otherwise&mdash;no change will have been made in this.</P>
    <P>On another aspect I would like an explanation from the Minister in relation to a particular matter.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The payments in respect of interest and sinking fund on land bonds are recurring charges and, as the land settlement programme proceeds, additional charges are created which result in sub-heads H (1) and H (3); the estimated increase this year in sub-head H (3) for halving of annuities is £8,900.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like some clarification of that since I do not quite understand it. Am I to take it that the land annuity is fixed on the basic of the purchase price and that it is then halved in the same way as it would have been had the annuity been payable at the time of the passing of the 1933 Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is based on the security value of the holding.  The Land Commissioners fix the annuity based on what they think it can reasonably carry.  The Deputy can take it there is a large loss on resale in all these cases and that tends to increase. With the increased price of land and <Col N="593" /> increased costs generally the loss on resale tends also to increase.</P>

      <P>In relation to the financial aspect of it, the Minister says that there is a sum of £152,000 arrears of land annuities.  In his next sentence he say he considers that highly satisfactory. Frankly, I cannot agree with him.  This is gradually creeping up. Will we reach the day when the general taxpayer will be called upon again to write off these annuities and get credit for them?  What is the explanation? A sum of £152,000 has to be paid by the labouring farmers for those people who have not paid these land annuities.  With the price of cattle and sheep at what it is, I do not see why any farmer should not be able to provide half the annuities that are due on these holdings.  I would like a statement from the Minister when he is concluding, as to how he can point to a satisfactory condition in regard to the collection.  I think it is far from satisfactory.  I do not think there should be any arrears in regard to any farm in Ireland to-day having regard to the price which obtains for cattle and sheep.</P>

Are we going to allow this to creep up again until it <Col N="594" /> reaches such a sum that the general taxpayer will again be called upon to meet the bill?  I am not at all satisfied even with the 1 per cent. because it is a percentage which represents £152,000.</P>

      <P>We will have reached a splendid state of affairs if everybody takes up that course.  If one's neighbours are to be asked to pay one's annuities ultimately the economy of the whole agricultural community will be smashed.  We should not get our neighbour to carry such a burden.  One's neighbour should not be asked to do the donkey.</P>
      <P>Complaints were made in regard to the Land Commission's treatment of the land they acquire.  I wish to associate myself with that complaint. In the first place, I want to suggest to the Minister that the moment an inspection is made of an agricultural holding public notice should be given. I have known cases where substantial farms were inspected by the Land Commission and no notice of a public nature given.  The moment it was inspected it was put up for sale.  The purchasers bought the land at its market value without knowing that the Land Commission was going to acquire it.  I think that is a grave injustice. The reply to that may be that it should have been seen to on the acquisition of title but, whilst solicitors are supposed to take the utmost care, there is nobody but makes a slip.  It is a very serious matter and I earnestly submit to the Minister that there should be nothing hidden about that kind of thing.  It is a public act by a Government Department and there should be no secrecy about it.  The moment it is decided to acquire land public notice should be given at once. I earnestly recommend that procedure to the Minister.  There has been complaint about another matter and I earnestly repeat it.  It concerns the Land Commission acquiring lands and leaving them lie for as long as ten and 12 years in conacre.  That is criminal.</P>

      <P>It is nothing short of criminal to let land for that number of years having regard to the fact that the final intention is to have the land divided and given to poor congests. They are brought there under false pretences because the land is completely barren.  The land is in conacre and no farmyard manure and no proper fertilisers put on it or sulphate of ammonia applied to it in order to extract out of the land the last ounce of fertility.  After ten years the Land Commission divides this up among poor congests who think they are made forever. They are put on this barren land.  Anybody who knows anything about land knows that it will take five to ten years of intensive application of manure and fertiliser to bring the land to the state that it should be in on the day they took it.  I do not know what is the explanation for that but it should not be done.</P>

      <P>They are not.  Any land taken in my constituency is agricultural land which the congests have never seen before.  But whether they saw it or not the poor creatures are so glad to get something that they will grab at anything.  The last thing I have got to say&mdash;I suppose this, too, will fall on barren ground&mdash;concerns an <Col N="597" /> appeal made by Deputy O'Reilly.  I wish to join in that appeal.  I do not know what the position is in Meath. The type of land that I have been talking about and which has been taken over by the Land Commission in my constituency is let in conacre to a class of people who themselves are sons of agricultural labourers working on farms all their lives.  Now the Land Commission comes along and acquires any land available and they are taking people from the congested areas.  They are taking away the pool of land which is available for those landless men upon which to earn a livelihood for themselves, their wives and their families.</P>
      <P>I want to submit to the Minister, even at this late hour, that provision should first be made for these men. I do so because if all the land that can be acquired is taken up and divided amongst allottees, how are the men for whom I speak going to make a livelihood for themselves?  Obviously, there will be nothing for them but emigration. The position is that we are taking people who have homes of some kind and a piece of land of some kind and putting them on land elsewhere, but while doing that we are displacing a larger number of people who have nothing before them but emigration.  I think that is tragic.</P>

      <P>I do make an appeal to the Minister on behalf of those men for whom I have been speaking. Apparently, the Land Commission <Col N="598" /> and the Minister think that they have not the statutory power to do what I ask.  I am not going to give a legal opinion on that, but, assuming that the power is not there, why not take the means of getting it?  There was a lot of new power taken in a Land Bill that was run through this House quite recently.  It was really a whole network of amendments to existing Acts. Several amendments were made in that Bill to the existing law.  Why not do the same in the case that I speak of by way of amendment?  This matter is one of social importance to the community. It is a matter of vital importance in my constituency so far as large classes of people are concerned. Are they going to be left destitute and have nothing facing them in the future but emigration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to draw the Minister's attention to a very important matter that concerns people in the County Carlow at the moment.  I refer to the fact that a number of farmers there have received notice of intention from the Land Commission to inspect their holdings with a view to taking them over.  In a good number of these cases the farms are being properly worked.  You have families living on them&mdash;a man and his wife and children.  It is an extraordinary thing if the Land Commission can come along and issue these notices.  They have a very upsetting effect on old people.  They are causing a lot of worry and people feel they have no security.  It seems to me that the system the Land Commission have of finding out whether land is being worked properly or not is very bad and very unfair.  It would seem to me to be this: that if a few people can get together and have the idea that a particular farm should be divided immediately, the Land Commission takes notice of that, and a notice of inspection is issued no matter what the circumstances are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that this is something that should be put right. It is causing an awful lot of worry and inconvenience, especially to old people. They get upset when they get these notices and think that they are going to be put out the next day.  I think that is very unfair.  The policy of the Land Commission as regards people who are entitled to get land, when there is a division of land, should be made known all over the country. Most of these agitations for land are started by people living in cottages, people who, as I understand it, will never get land.  That type of person is being misled at the present time.  If there is a local agitation about some farm they are told by certain people that they are in line for it and are sure to get it, but when it comes to dividing up the farm they find that they have no chance at all.  I think the Minister should make a statement on what the position is as regards land division and on the people who are entitled to get land.  The opinion is held by some people anyway that it is the uneconomic holders in a district who have first claim when a farm close to them is acquired and comes to be allotted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>But that is not generally known.  Therefore, I say it would be a good thing if the Minister made a statement on that.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="600" /> stated recently at a meeting in my constituency that cottiers had the first claim.  It is very misleading to people all over the country if a Minister of State makes a statement like that.  Surely, people are entitled to believe it, cottiers and others looking for land.  Some of them are very progressive people and expect that they should get the land when a statement such as I have referred to is made.  I would ask the Minister to make a clear statement as far as that is concerned, that is, on what the policy of the Land Commission is with regard to land. Definitely, some of those applicants for land are being misled at the present time.  These inspections are causing worry to people.  The Land Commission should have some other way of finding out how farms are being worked.  I believe that before a farm is taken over there should first of all be a preliminary investigation.  It is the sending in of an inspector that upsets old people especially.</P>

      <P>As regards the size of the holdings which are allotted by the Land Commission I believe that a mistake was made by making these holdings too small.  I think that if a person is to be given an economic holding so that he can make reasonably good use of it, he will require to get at least 40 statute acres.  He will require that if he is to make a living out of the land.  If a man is not given enough land to enable him to make a living from it, then it would be better for him if he never got the land. People should be given enough land to enable them to make a living out of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the transfer of people from the Gaeltacht and congested districts to the Midlands. I have on occasion asked the Minister what was the definite policy of the Land Commission in regard to the transfer of those people?  Some time ago, I had a question down asking the Minister if it was the policy of the Land Commission to concentrate upon vested tenants, and I was informed <Col N="601" /> that that was not so.  I would like again to refer to that matter because, as far as I am aware, the policy of the Land Commission is, where possible, to accept the unvested tenant in preference to the man who is vested, even though the applicant would be very desirable and very suitable otherwise as far as the Land Commission is concerned.  In the present year, I understand, approximately 80 people were transferred and ten of that number came from County Kerry.  That is a very small percentage for County Kerry.  Most of the Deputies are speaking about the transfer of people from the West.  There is nothing at all about the great numbers in the congested districts of the South and South-West. There is a number of people who applied for transfer in the past four or five years in County Kerry.  There is a waiting list and, as far as I understand, nothing has been done or can be done.  Although we all admit that the problem in the West is more urgent than in any other area in the country, there is always a danger that our people will be overlooked and left on the waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of money being spent in my constituency, by comparison with Mayo and other districts, is not very great.  I could give the names of a number of estates in connection with which moneys under the purchase agreements were withheld from the landlord for the purpose of building houses and for other constructional work.  Even though that was put through 20 or 30 years ago, nothing has been done in regard to these estates.  There is the Blennerhassett estate, the O'Donoghue estate and a number of others.  I can give information to the Minister's Department so that something could be done about this matter.  I remember travelling in one of these areas about 13 years ago with an inspector of the Land Commission. I was informed that a certain sum of money was withheld from the landlord for the purpose of erecting houses for the tenants and other improvement works.  I was told recently that that money which was withheld by the Land Commission has never <Col N="602" /> been expended.  That is only one of many cases I know of.</P>
    <P>We are always informed, and rightly so, that we have no land to divide in County Kerry to any extent in comparison with what is in the Midlands. As against that I suggest to the Minister that money should be allocated for the carrying out of the rearrangement schemes and other improvement works I mentioned.  The work that the Minister's staff are doing in our county is appreciated.  They have done good work within the scope of their allocation; very little is allocated to our county for that type of work but we appreciate that the Land Commission staff are doing their best for us.</P>
    <P>If at all possible, I would like the Minister to increase the number of applicants for transfer and make it possible for them to avail of the scheme.  I am aware of a few cases&mdash; I did mention it to the Minister's Department&mdash;where men were recommended for transfer by his own officials down in Kerry, but this question of the unvested and the vested tenant played a very important part in the whole matter.  They were not accepted, at least that was the explanation that was given.  Whether a tenant is vested or unvested, when he is a suitable applicant and when he is a man who will make good and be a credit to the country, that man should be given a chance by being accepted by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I understand it is easier for the Land Commission to accept tenants who are vested because there is an obligation on the Land Commission to deal with their case at some time or other.  I expect they take the line that it is just as well to transfer them where possible and fulfil their obligation in that way.  I know of cases in Ballinskelligs and many other areas where there are ideal types of people to avail of that scheme and they should be considered.  While I do not wish to say anything detrimental to the West, to the people from Mayo and Galway, I feel there is too much concentration altogether on that western area to the disadvantage of some of our people.  When the Minister is <Col N="603" /> replying, I hope the position in regard to the vested and unvested tenants will be clarified once and for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Finan in his opening statement referred to the Land Commission holding Congested District Board's estates for a long time.  He did not give the name of the estate. As I have just said in reply to Deputy McMenamin, there may be remnants of estates, mountain or bog, comparatively, if not absolutely, worthless land, in the hands of the Land Commission. According to our statistics, we have many thousands of acres of such land. The point is that, whatever the complaint against the old Congested Districts Board may have been for holding land for a period of time, they had the excuse or justification that in fact the same people were taking the land for conacre as would eventually be allotted the land.  In the case of these Congested Districts Board's estates it is, almost universally, the same people who are using the land for temporary purposes who will benefit by it in the long run.  They know that.  That has been the position.  In regard to the derelict holdings that have been referred to in the debate, and acquisition of which would be necessary and very desirable for what we call rearrangement or improvement or enlargement of small holdings in these congested districts, it may happen in some isolated cases that have not been brought to my notice that in fact lands have been in the possession of the Land Commission for some years.  I doubt very much if it runs to any considerable period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Normally the hold-up is in connection with building.  When the Land Commission take over land their inspectors have in mind that houses have to be built or reconstructed and in the case of new houses particularly, which have to be set to contract, if they do not succeed in completing their arrangements before the spring period it means that the taking up of the holding by the allottee has to be postponed until the following November. For example, if the contractor has met with exceptional difficulties, or if there is a question about water or some such <Col N="604" /> thing, it may happen that, instead of the normal year which ought to be more than sufficient and which ought to be a maximum period between the time the Land Commission take possession and the time of allotment, the period may be somewhat increased and it may go over the year in very exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in the present year has been in satisfying the potential migrants.  In some cases after they had seen the land, in other cases after they had actually expressed their willingness to accept the holdings offered to them in other counties, they withdrew. The two reasons generally given were that the holdings offered were not large enough or domestic reasons, that the older members of the family or perhaps the wife of the congest refused to come.  Were it not for that, we would have been able to complete the allotment of the 143 or 144 holdings which were given out during the present year.  Next year we expect to have about 150 migrants leaving the congested areas for the Midlands.</P>
    <P>I notice that the migrants from Kerry are amongst the most difficult to satisfy.  That applies not only now. When I was in this Department ten years ago Kerry people who had been offered exchanges refused at the end of it all to come.  Considering that the problem of rearrangement and the number of unvested holdings is not nearly as serious in Kerry as in Mayo and Galway, I cannot agree with the implication in Deputy Flynn's statement that we are not giving Kerry fair play.  We are giving Kerry more than fair play, in my opinion.  We have just got additional sanction for a large turbary scheme.  It will cost us another £17,000.  The total expenditure on that single scheme on the Kenmare Estate will be about £65,000 over recent years.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, we have in contemplation an expenditure of at least £15,000&mdash;and it will probably cost more&mdash;for the embankments at Callinafercy. The Land Commission do not agree that in fact they have any responsibility for some of these embankments, whether at Callinafercy or elsewhere, but due to the fact that the <Col N="605" /> Board of Works have not set up their arterial drainage organisation, the presumption and the intention being that when that national drainage organisation was set up the care and responsibility for the repair of these embankments should pass to it, we have been asked by the Government in certain cases to undertake this work.  It is work that is superimposed upon the Land Commission over and above their ordinary work, which can be described briefly as the completion of the vesting of their holdings in the tenants and, secondly, during whatever period of time it is necessary to give the Land Commission, to endeavour to complete the work, to try to see that the largest possible amount is done to alleviate the bad position of the rural slums, the really badly affected congested areas where this rundale system of intermixed plots still obtains on many thousands of holdings in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We would like that as much as possible should be done to relieve that situation.  It is in Mayo and Galway that it is particularly serious.  It is also serious in parts of Donegal.  The Donegal people, perhaps, have turned their backs on the idea of agriculture and regard their little holdings in Donegal as merely resting places where they settle down for certain periods of the year and go off for industrial or other employment during the rest of the year.  They have shown a marked reluctance and, in fact, have refused to come to the Midlands and even to migrate from West Donegal into East Donegal.  They are most unlike the Kerry people, who apparently are so fond of their beautiful county that no attraction we can offer to them seems to be sufficient to make them come up here.  We know that the Kerry people themselves are very persuasive and perhaps the Land Commission inspectors though some of them hail from that part of the country are wanting in the eloquence that Kerry people rejoice in.  One large migrant from West Kerry refused at the last minute to carry out his transfer of his holding in County Dublin owing to the opposition of his wife and family.  I have <Col N="606" /> an idea that he was rather keen on coming.</P>
    <P>Another one under an approved group migration scheme, from another part of Kerry previewed and refused a holding in County Kildare, but he is still anxious for an exchange although he refused a holding of 34½ statute acres.  Another one previewed and refused another holding of 33 statute acres because it was not large enough for him but he still wants to exchange. Another one from Bantry saw two holdings of 33 and 34 acres and refused them, but in this case, at any rate, he did not seem to be keen on coming in any event.  Another one from Clare who was very anxious to come was held back by his aged father.  Another one from West Cork refused a 33-acre holding in County Kildare on the grounds of insufficient size.  He would like a larger area not necessarily of such good quality.  Three group migrants from another part of Kerry refused even to come to see holdings offered to them in County Kildare.  Two of them had seen holdings already in 1952 and were understood to be keen to migrate.  It is thought that their refusal to migrate is due to some family difficulty.  Another large group migrant from Kerry refused to look at a large holding offered him in County Kildare as he no longer wished to migrate.</P>
    <P>All this means that not alone is a considerable amount of the inspectors' time lost and considerable cost accruing to the Land Commission by reason of these people's failure to make up their minds definitely whether they want to come or not, but when they delay their final decision even when they have given consent to the Land Commission inspector that they intend to come, it means that he is placed in a very difficult position.  As I have just indicated, towards the end of the season he has to turn around and look for another migrant to take the holding instead.  If the migrant is a man who is giving up a comparatively large holding and getting a comparatively large holding it is difficult because the Land Commission tries to give fair compensation by way of return.  My own opinion is that the compensation <Col N="607" /> is generally generous and that the man who has the courage and initiative to come is not going to lose.  Unfortunately, some of them do not seem to have these qualities.  They do not seem to see the enormous advantage of being within 20 or 30 miles perhaps of the City of Dublin with all the market facilities and all the rest of it that that may mean to them.  It may be that their overheads go up very considerably.  I have no doubt whatever but that they do.  The overheads may be twice, three times or even more than three times as high as they were, but there are advantages in getting a holding of 33 acres of first-class land and getting the other concessions and other facilities including a first-class dwellinghouse and outoffices, roads constructed and so on, and all that, in the most fertile part of the country and within striking distance of the largest and most profitable market, certainly ought to appeal to the Kerry migrant.</P>
    <P>As far as I know there is no distinction between vested and unvested tenants.  If the Land Commission inspectors in the particular schemes that they have in mind have told Deputies that unvested tenants must secure preference and priority, that is on account of the nature of the scheme. In my opening statement I pointed out that the utilisation of the migrants' surrendered land for the enlargement and rearrangement of adjacent small holdings which, in turn, generally required improvement of buildings etc., cannot be speedily completed.  I said that land acquisition as to proceed under statutory provisions with due allowance for objections and appeals.  I went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The circumstances of uneconomic holders and others affected have to be carefully investigated.  Buildings take time to erect.  In fact, all stages of the work require competent and tactful handling from beginning to end.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And then I went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Inevitably, in the lay-out of any congested townland there are &lsquo;key&rsquo; holdings, the acquisition of which by the Land Commission would greatly <Col N="608" /> facilitate the rearrangement and give general satisfaction, but these holdings can only be secured by migration as a general rule.  Consequently, before migrants are selected from an area, it is necessary to establish which are the &lsquo;key&rsquo; holdings and this entails careful inquiry as well as the framing of tentative proposals to discover how resettlement can best be effected.  If the tenant of a &lsquo;key&rsquo; holding is willing to migrate, well and good, but if he is unwilling, alternative selections may have to be made, involving the recasting of proposals, and unfortunately, this often leads to disappointments, misunderstandings, and unmerited criticism of the officials entrusted with this difficult work.</P>
    <P>In some congested townlands if the &lsquo;key&rsquo; holdings become available, conditions can be remedied simply by providing enlargements, without the need for rearrangements at all. Where this is possible, so much the better.  The primary consideration in the selection of a migrant must, therefore, be the use which can be made of his surrendered lands, but it will be obvious that the personal circumstances of the migrant and his family will also be of considerable importance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With regard to the expenditure, I think Kerry is doing fairly well.  It would be an extraordinary thing if it were not, it is so well looked after in this House and in the offices of the Land Commission.  During the past year, we spent £40,000 and more on improvement expenditure.  In the preceding year, we spent £23,000.  In the year before that, less than £18,000. The total expenditure for the whole country was £560,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin seemed to object to the size of the holdings.  Like some of the migrants he referred to the little patches of 22 acres.  Unfortunately, as I have said, we have not been able to get the Donegal people to come to the Midlands or we have not succeeded in persuading them even to go from West to East Donegal.  I am not sure that it is not for want of appreciation of what they were getting. <Col N="609" /> The position is that in the West of Ireland it was always recognised that the standard holding would be about £10 valuation, and if the Congested Districts Board or the Land Commission succeeding them were able at any time to bring the tenants up to the £10 valuation generally on an average they would consider that they had accomplished something practically miraculous.</P>
    <P>If you look at the figures for these western counties, you will see that is the position.  Not alone there but in the Midlands, even in Deputy MacEoin's constituency, where land has been given out by way of enlargement to smallholders, my recollection is that in a portion of County Longford they are still around about the £10 valuation and a very large number, the clear majority of the holdings in this country are in that category.  People on these holdings have succeeded in bringing up families, in rearing them and giving them a reasonable education and, what is to their credit, they have very often succeeded in giving them higher education and fitting them for a professional career.  In the Civil Service and the teaching profession, not to speak of the Church, we have any number of examples of the large numbers that come from that particular class of small farmers.</P>
    <P>The point then is, if we know that £10 is more than we can achieve on the average and that the smallholder of £10 is regarded as comparatively well off in large areas west of the Shannon, are we justified in raising the size of the migrant's holding?  If people are being migrated from these areas to the East, up to 40 acres, let us say, are we justified when we know that only a limited number of some hundreds at the most can be brought in a particular year?  If we bring 150, as we did last year and as we expect to do during the coming year, we shall be doing very well indeed, in my opinion.  Are we justified then in giving these 150 exceptionally special treatment over and above what they are getting already?  We know that, as far as Mayo and I should think Galway also, are concerned there are probably more than enough anxious to come and exchange their holdings.  The only <Col N="610" /> point holding them up is that we must be satisfied that our inspectors believe that the removal of these particular individuals will help, that their cases are, in fact, the cases in which the greatest relief can be given to their neighbours.  If the particular persons who have made applications for exchanges can satisfy the inspectors on that score, they can be included in the quota of 150.  I cannot see why we should go further than give 33 acres of the best land in this country, with the dwellinghouse and outoffices and all the rest of it, when we know that we can do that only in a limited number of cases.</P>
    <P>This is to an extent a social service. I dare say that if we gave some of the migrants far more than the 33 acres we would still have complaints that they were not getting enough.  I would like to point out to Deputies who are not familiar with the position that they will find in the last Annual Report of the Land Commission a report by our inspector, Mr. Gleeson, which has been incorporated in the report dealing with the success which has met these migrants in Meath.  It is quite clear that their stock and their wealth have increased enormously and that they have been able to take more land.  I know that some of them who have come from the very poorest fishing villages in this country have not alone been able to establish themselves soundly and firmly, but they have been able to go out and buy holdings for members of their families.  Therefore, it is absolutely ridiculous, and it shows either complete ignorance of the situation or sheer pretence, to say that we are not doing well for these people. They are the choice persons, they are the ones who have been selected and for whom all this has been done.</P>
    <P>As I said in reply to Deputy McMenamin, we are losing large sums of money.  In the first place, when the Land Commissioners fix the annuity they fix it having regard to what they think the land can pay; and under the 1953 Act they are compelled in law to revise that annuity.  Therefore, on the annuity that would be considered fair and reasonable and proper in normal circumstances, remember that we are getting only half the amount. <Col N="611" /> In the Estimate this year, Deputies will see that &ldquo;Payments under Section 27 (2) of the Land Act, 1933, sub-head H 3&rdquo; in the present year amount to £667,400.  The expenditure on the improvement of estates during the current year is £615,000.  A very large proportion of that goes in the preparation of these holdings.  About £1,500 is spent on improvement works on each of these holdings.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of the halved annuity, the Land Commissioners do not attempt to recover the full cost.  I have a return here of lands acquired over recent years.  The acquisition price for an amount of land acquired, a recent figure, might be £95,000 total, but the resale price would be only £73,000, leaving a loss of 22½ per cent.  A more recent figure, for a smaller area, shows the acquisition price almost £14,000 and the resale price only £7,000, so we recovered only half the cost; we lost nearly 49 per cent.  You may say we recovered only half the cost of the land.  You have to add on to that the cost of the buildings and improvements of various kinds.</P>
    <P>My attitude to this matter is that I want, in the first place, to see that we get value for this money.  I realise that land settlement is a very costly business and that if we are going to settle people upon the land we must be satisfied not alone that they will give a return and will work the land properly and be an example to their neighbours, but also that in transferring them from their own areas to take up new holdings we are giving the maximum amount of benefit.  We have to combine the two things, giving the maximum benefit in the areas from which they are being taken and trying to see that the persons we have brought will give the best possible return to the community and to the country.</P>
    <P>The reasons why these losses on resale have increased in recent years are, roughly, two.  Under the Land Act, 1950, market value is now paid for land instead, as previously, a price fair to the Land Commission and fair to the owner.  As a result, purchase prices have increased to a greater extent than the resale values, which are fixed with <Col N="612" /> due regard to the full term of the repayment period annuity and the possibility of bad as well as good years for the farming community.  Secondly, the relief of congestion tends to depend more and more on migration and tenants can be migrated to holdings of good quality only.  This entails the acquisition of a bigger proportion of land of high market value, the resale of which on a percentage basis alone involves increased losses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke and, I am sure, other Deputies, are interested in this problem of conacre tenants looking for land.  I have a great deal of sympathy with these conacre tenants.  As far as the policy of land resettlement is concerned, there has been no change. Fundamentally, it has been the same for many years past.  There may have been some variations, such as those in regard to price, but fundamentally the policy is the same and, in so far as the categories of persons and the order of priority in respect of each are concerned, they are just the same now as they have been for years past.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, sets out categorically the persons or bodies to whom the Land Commission may allot land:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Advances may be made to the following persons or bodies for the purchase by them from the Land Commission of parcels of land:</P>
    <P>(a)  A person being the tenant or proprietor of a holding which, in the opinion of the Land Commission, is not an economic holding.</P>
    <P>(b)  A person who has entered into an agreement with the Land Commission for the exchange of his holding.</P>
    <P>(c)  A person who within 25 years before the passing of the Irish Land Act, 1903, was the tenant of a holding to which the Land Purchase Act applied, and who was evicted from that holding in consequence of proceedings taken by or on behalf of his landlord, or in case such person is dead, the person nominated by the Land Commission as his personal representative.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> (d)  A person being a labourer who by reason of the sale of any lands under the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts has been deprived of his employment on the said lands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And finally:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any other person or body to whom in the opinion of the Land Commission an advance ought to be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 2 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Land Commission in deciding as to the suitability of applicants under this section shall be satisfied as to their competence to work the land, and their intention to do so and not sell, let, or assign it ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a person had lost his employment on the land taken over he could be considered and generally got a holding if he had been in reasonably permanent employment.  That was changed under the 1950 Act.  The procedure now is compensation by payment in cash.  It is a matter entirely reserved to the Land Commission and, with the scarcity of land and the high cost of carrying out this policy, I am reluctantly forced to agree.  The law is there&mdash;it has been amended to deal with the situation&mdash;that whatever land is acquired should be kept mainly for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the conacre question generally, it is the practice of the Land Commission to provide as a first consideration enlargements for adjoining uneconomic holdings and the satisfaction of locals before any migrants are introduced into an area, because the Land Commission know as well as anybody else that local opposition has to be mitigated and if possible eliminated.  Therefore, it has been their policy over a long period of time to do their utmost to satisfy the locals so that an area may be created in which it will be possible to introduce migrants from outside without an overwhelming feeling that locals are being neglected and have been <Col N="614" /> more or less pushed aside.  But that has not been the position.  If I were to quote the figures for County Meath or even for County Kildare I think I could show the House that for many years past the situation has been that a great deal has been done and a great amount achieved so far as local deserving cases were concerned.</P>
    <P>Now land is becoming more costly and we are concentrating very largely on the problem of relieving congestion. This House itself recognised that when it decreed that former employees ought to be satisfied with compensation in cash.  Even in respect of that category which had always received special treatment, the Oireachtas has decided that they are no longer in the same category or cannot be compared with smallholders in the vicinity, who are the people we are primarily concerned with.  Even if the position were as Deputy Hickey feels, that land is being purchased by foreigners to the extent of nearly 7,000 acres in a half year&mdash; and I am not at all underestimating the possibility that this can be a very serious problem indeed&mdash;and even if it were to be maintained at that rate, it would take a great many years, some hundreds of years, let us hope, before the final conquest of the country would be achieved.</P>

      <P>What I want to direct the Deputy's attention to is that we have an Aliens Act which was passed in 1935, the third section of which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Real and personal property of every description in Saorstát Éireann (as it was then) or subject to the law of Saorstát Éireann may be taken, acquired, held and disposed of by an alien in the like manner and to the like extent as such property may be taken, acquired, held, or disposed of by a citizen of Saorstat Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So that foreigners have exactly the same facilities in regard to the ownership of property as our own nationals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I need hardly remind the Deputy that if we amend this law, or if we considered, which I do not, that this problem is so serious that we have to take drastic measures to deal with it, there would very well be retaliation in other countries.  I am not at all saying that it is not a matter which should not be carefully watched and carefully considered if the situation should become grave.  But I have no proof, at any rate, from whatever inquiries I have made that it is as serious as perhaps Deputy Hickey believes.  In addition, the traffic is not all in one direction.  There is a great deal of traffic, and, unfortunately, traffic in people, as we have heard emphasised recently, out of the country as well as foreigners coming in.</P>
      <P>There is this stamp duty.  That does not appertain to my Estimate.  I am going to depart from the subject by pointing to the fact that there is the provision I have just read in the legislation which would, I think, have to be amended unless Deputy Hickey can persuade the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach, that either the former or the latter of these two, should take action to deal with what he regards as a serious situation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Finan asked me about the well-boring plants and I would like to inform the House there are two well-boring plants, the second of which was acquired in September last.  Both machines are engaged full time on a planned itinerary, which aims at taking them to the urgent jobs in all counties with the least possible delay.  Certain works have been done already in the West, in Galway, and progress planned for the future includes some further wells in Galway and Roscommon.  The two machines between them have completed 25 wells since September last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to the More O'Ferrall estate and the position in that regard is that the estate issued for preliminary report on the 8th December, 1951, and it issued for suitability and price report on the 6th of May, 1952.  The provisional list was <Col N="616" /> published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on 27th January, 1953.  I think we may assume that an offer of price would have been made before this for the More O'Ferrall estate were it not for the hold-up pending the passing of the Land Act, 1953, and the adjustment of the position regarding land bonds.</P>
    <P>I quite agree with Deputy MacEoin that, as far as possible when the Land Commission inspects land, if they propose to take further action and to go ahead with proceedings for the acquisition of it they ought to make known their intentions as soon as possible to the owner.  I think it is certainly a disability or a hardship to the owners, and I would not attempt to justify it for one moment, that they should be kept in a position that they do not know what the intentions of the Department of Lands may be in regard to them.  If my attention is called at any time to any case of that nature I shall certainly try to have the matter speeded up and a decision come to with the least possible delay.  Deputies have the usual channels also of communicating with the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general remarks of Deputy MacEoin, so long as land is producing sufficient food and is giving reasonable employment, I think there is very little likelihood that the Land Commission will undertake proceedings for the acquisition of such land.  It may be that in very congested areas in the West of Ireland, the Land Commission have to go after what may appear to be unnecessary small holdings, but that is because of the very bad congestion problem which exists there.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, I think I may assure Deputy Hughes that I have no personal responsibility for, nor would I countenance, persons making use of my position, for example, to try and get land agitations going.  I may say that, with reference to what I have just mentioned, that the general policy over many years has been not to interfere with lands which are giving a proper return to the country and fair employment, and also subject to the fact that if there are smallholders in the area&mdash;a number of them&mdash;and if they can point to the fact that land <Col N="617" /> which will benefit them and perhaps which they have been taking in lettings if it is obviously not being utilised and the owner may be not even living on it, in that case I think it is fair enough, under the policy which has been carried out by the State for so many years, that the Land Commission could have representations made to them to take action in these cases.</P>
    <P>As far as the political side of it is concerned I think I may say in reply to Deputy MacEoin that while we are quite safe in assuming that we will be blamed by those who do not get land, whoever the Minister for Lands may be, we are not so very likely to be thanked or to have any marks of gratitude or appreciation from those who do get it, and I think anybody who would believe otherwise does not show proper appreciation of the situation. I would say with reference to the particular case which Deputy MacEoin raised about an ex-employee who, he claims, had been unfairly treated in regard to compensation, that I am informed by the Land Commission that herds unfortunately have not had a good record as a class over the years where they were given holdings. I always&mdash;even before the 1950 Act was passed&mdash;I must say, I always had a note of interrogation in my mind as to whether there was the same justification for giving them holdings, while I would have been in favour of the Land Commission having discretion. which still exists of course, of giving them holdings if necessary.  If they showed themselves deserving and clearly were of a type to make a success of what they got, while I think there should be that discretion, I certainly would not be inclined to agree that every herd should have received a holding.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly referred to the question of vestings in North Meath.  I have not been able to trace the survey to which he referred more than once, as having taken place.  The information at my disposal makes me believe that so far as smallholders in Meath are concerned they have been largely accounted for in the schemes that have been carried into effect in that county <Col N="618" /> over the past 15 years or more&mdash;nearly 20 years now.  I do not agree that they have not got fair consideration. I cannot agree that if there are one or even two smallholders in an area that that means it is a congested area.  That is not congestion as I understand it. What I understand by congestion is where you have, say, five or six small-holdings and where there is obviously a clear case if suitable land is available for taking it over for their benefit.</P>
    <P>When land was more plentiful, we had a larger pool to draw upon and when costs of land division and resettlement were not as great 15 or 20 years ago, it was possible to give land out in accommodation plots and in cow parks.  The accommodation plots were dropped because it was considered that they were neither one thing nor the other.  The person who had five or six acres was no longer a cottier; neither was he a farmer, and the limit of 23 or 24 acres at that time&mdash;now 33 acres&mdash;of good land, whatever the complaints may be in regard to it, should be a basis.  It should provide a man, I should say, with ample and sufficient to bring up his family and later on to extend and improve himself as I am sure has been the case.</P>
    <P>The experience with regard to cow parks also has not been satisfactory. The primary purpose of the Land Commission in regard to land acquisition and allotment is the enlargement of small holdings adjacent to the land taken over&mdash;within a mile of it&mdash;and if the Land Commission in the future are to concentrate on that task, I do not think that it will be possible for them to deal with cow parks or to provide for agricultural workers in the way Deputy O'Reilly seems to suggest.</P>
    <P>There is not enough land to go round, even if we were to go all out on accommodation plots and if we were to divide the whole of it in looking after local requirements in the manner he suggests.  Cow parks have to be administered by trustees.  Trustees die, they change, or they neglect the duties imposed on them.  The general experience of the Land Commission, I think I may say quite frankly, in their dealings with trustees, is not encouraging apart from the G.A.A., which is a continuing body and which takes over <Col N="619" /> responsibility for playing fields.  In the case of trustees who take over a cow park in a rural area, a few individuals are picked out and perhaps they have no personal interest at all in the matter.  It is a very difficult problem, therefore, to deal with but if in any particular case it is clear that a large number of people, working people, are being deprived of facilities or of certain advantages they have in regard to the keeping of cows, I think I can assure the House that the Land Commissioners will examine their case carefully and sympathetically.</P>

    <P>In introducing the 1952-53 Forestry Estimate to the House I departed to some extent from the normal practice of detailed commentary on the individual provisions in the Estimate in order to give Deputies a more clearly defined general picture of the work which the Forestry Division would be doing during the year and which the Estimate as a whole was planned to cover.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Estimate I would like to go into some of the individual figures in greater detail before commenting directly upon the forest work which it is proposed to undertake during the year and for which provision is made in sub-heads C (2) and C (3) (1).</P>
    <P>The net Estimate at £1,220,800 shows an increase of £295,100 over the original Estimate for 1952-53.  Even after allowance is made for the Supplementary Estimate for £70,000 introduced late last year there is an increase of £225,100.  The gross Estimate excluding Appropriations-in-Aid, to which I shall refer separately later, shows an increase of £222,600.</P>
    <P>There are increases in individual expenditure sub-heads of £10,222 on sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances; £1,500 on sub-head B&mdash;Travelling Expenses; £56,000 on sub-head C (1)&mdash;Acquisition of Land; £123,100 on sub-head C (2)&mdash;Forest Development and Maintenance; £32,410 on sub-head C (3)&mdash;Timber Conversion, and £168 on sub-head E (1)&mdash;Forestry Education.  The only decrease is £800 on sub-head G&mdash;Incidental Expenses.</P>
    <P>Of the increase of £10,222 on sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances, £3,000 is by way of provision for an increase in forester staff to meet expanding work requirements. Almost the entire remainder is due to the incidence of normal adjustments of salaries.  The increase of £168 on sub-head E (1)&mdash;Forestry Education&mdash; is in the main due to the same cause.</P>
    <P>Before passing from the Staff and Forestry Education heads I should refer to the progress made with plans for improving the facilities for the education of forestry trainees.  Work on the adaptation of Shelton Abbey as <Col N="621" /> a new forestry school has commenced. The initial contract for the removal of defective portions of the building has been almost completed and there is every reason to expect that the main contract will be placed and put through in time to enable the building to be utilised from the commencement of the 1954-55 training year in October 1954. That will enable the Department to restore the arrangement under which trainees spend two of the three years of the training course at the forestry school.</P>
    <P>One year of the training course will continue to be devoted entirely to practical work.  It has been decided to utilise Kinnitty Castle as a headquarters for this practical training year. The castle is situated in the middle of the Slievebloom Forest massif within easy reach of Kinnitty, Clonaslee, Mountrath and Ossory Forests which jointly total 15,773 acres.  Seven thousand one hundred and twenty four acres are already planted and 2,456 acres are available for planting.  This forest group includes plantations of all ages including some up to 40 years of age in Mountrath which is our seventh oldest forest.  There is assurance of the steady planting of additional lands in the area for many years including lands where new techniques of mechanical preparation of ground will be applied and there is a nursery attached to Kinnitty Forest itself.  The castle is in good condition structurally; its size and layout are generally remarkably apt for the accommodation of one year's trainees, i.e., 20 men with domestic staff etc., and it is estimated that the building can be made suitable for its new use at a cost apart from furnishing of £2,700.  Authority for the necessary work has already been given and the aim is to have the castle available for occupation by the end of this year.  The new arrangement will permit of much more effective practical training.</P>
    <P>The increase of £1,500 on sub-head B &mdash;Travelling Expenses&mdash;calls for little comment.  It allows for expansion of field staff and work as well as adjustments in rates of travelling expenses.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head C (1) the Grant-in-Aid for acquisition of land, £100,000 <Col N="622" /> was provided in the original Vote last year and £7,000 in the Supplementary Vote apart from a balance of £23,268 carried forward from the previous year.  That made a total of slightly over £130,000 available for last year. At the 31st March, 1953, £9,393 remained unspent and was carried forward into this year.  The additional £163,000 now sought will make a total of over £172,000 available for the year.</P>
    <P>Expenditure has grown steadily over the past few years, the net figures being:&mdash;1949-50, £32,268; 1950-51, £50,341; 1951-52, £126,903 inclusive of abnormal expenditure on the Shelton and Kinnitty estates; 1952-53, £120,875.</P>
    <P>While variations in annual expenditure are to an extent attributable to the incidence of expenditure on buildings and woodland included in areas acquired, the figures I have quoted reflect a sustained improvement in the rate of acquisition of land, the plantable area acquired in the years mentioned being, respectively, 6,725 acres, 10,490 acres, 15,659 acres and 16,785 acres.  The total area acquired in 1952-53 was 19,419 acres including only 2,634 acres or 13½ per cent. of unplantable land; this was the second lowest percentage of unplantable land in 12 years.</P>
    <P>Acquisitions during the year resulted in the establishment of new forests at Mullaghareirk, County Cork; Killorglin, County Kerry; Gweebara, Raphoe and Kilcar, County Donegal; Lough Talt, County Sligo; Scotstown, County Monaghan, and Silvermines, County Tipperary.  A further new forest was established at Rosscarbery, County Cork, by the division of Bandon forest.</P>
    <P>At the 1st April, 1953, title was being, or had been, established to 23,260 acres which the Department had agreed to buy, compared with 17,231 acres at the commencement of 1952-53. Negotiations were in hands for the purchase of a further 31,577 acres, compared with 27,196 acres in 1952-53. These figures exclude areas likely to be transferred from the Land Commission amounting at the 1st April, 1953, to 2,255 acres, apart from 3,099 acres awaiting inspection.  In the three months ended 30th June, 1953, possession <Col N="623" /> was taken of 4,000 acres, while at that date 1,650 acres were ready for possession to be taken.  There is clear basis, therefore, for anticipating that the rise in the rate of acquisition will continue this year.  Expenditure is likely to be higher than in any previous year, but the sum of over £172,000 contemplated by the Estimate should be more than adequate to meet foreseeable expenditure.  Any remainder will assist towards restoration of the standing balance on the Grand-in-Aid Suspense Account, which has diminished in recent years.</P>
    <P>Accurate figures for the plantable reserve at the commencement of 1953-54 are not yet available but it is estimated that, after deduction of the area planted in 1952-53, slightly over 38,000 acres remained available, as compared with 31,700 acres a year previously. This improvement in the reserve figure is pleasing but we cannot yet view the reserve with complacency or relax in any way our efforts to improve it.  The House is familiar with the principle that, for proper conduct of forestry, land should be available for planting before seed is sown in the nurseries so that plants of the proper species for that land may be raised.</P>
    <P>This principle is usually referred to as the need for a three-year reserve on the basis that most forest trees are suitable for planting in their third year after sowing.  As there is some common confusion as to the real meaning of the term &ldquo;three-year reserve&rdquo;, it may be no harm to state the position in rather more detail.  Ignoring hardwoods, for which only a small proportion of our available land is suitable, we should know when sowing seed in, say, the spring of 1954 the precise lands on which we hope to plant out the resulting plants in due course.  The pinus contorta and a small proportion of the other pines, aggregating perhaps 30 per cent. of the total sowing, would be suitable for planting out in 1955-56, most other species in 1956-57, i.e., the third year after sowing, and the Norway spruce and a proportion of the sitka spruce, about 20 per cent. of the total sowing, in 1957-58.  In other words, if we were conducting our nursery work properly <Col N="624" /> we should know when sowing in the spring of 1954 or better still, in the autumn of 1953, when ordering seed what land we would be planting with Norway spruce and some of the land we would be planting with sitka spruce as far as 1957-58 or about 20 per cent. of the probable total planting in that year.  We should know all but 30 per cent., i.e., excluding contorta and some other pine ground, of the land we would be planting in 1956-57 and all the land we would be planting up to and including 1955-56.  If the annual planting rate remained at no more than 12,500 acres we would thus need in the autumn to have in reserve and allocated to particular planting years nearly 49,000 acres.  To allow for inevitable vagaries in the rate of development of nursery stocks and to permit of proper staggering of the planting of new areas attached to busy forests or large blocks in new forest districts an even greater reserve would be needed.  I have gone into this question of the reserve in greater detail than has previously been attempted in the House to impress upon Deputies that our reserve is still utterly inadequate to enable proper planning and co-ordination of the work to be attempted and that even greater progress with land acquisition must still be a primary objective.</P>
    <P>The increase of £123,100 in sub-head C (2)&mdash;Forest Development and Maintenance&mdash;is made up of increases of £6,150 for State forest nurseries; £80,750 for the capital expenditure head; and £76,400 for maintenance, offset in part by a reduction of £40,200 under the head of constructional expenditure.</P>
    <P>The increase of £6,150 for State forest nurseries is attributable to the provision for labour which is up by £10,000, the net additional amount required for nurseries being limited by a reduction in the aggregate provision under other less significant items chargeable to the head.  The reduction in the aggregate of provisions other than labour flows in the main from disappearance of an abnormal provision in 1952-53 for purchase of reserve stocks of tools, non-recurrence of a freight charge on an exchange of plants with the British Forestry Commission and a <Col N="625" /> reduction in seed purchases, due to increased home collections.  The addition of £10,000 to the provision for labour is required to meet wage increases, there being no change in the quantum of work contemplated.</P>
    <P>The nurseries will continue to operate on the basis I described in last year's Estimate debate, that is, on a production programme designed to enable the rate of planting to be increased to or towards 15,000 acres annually as soon as other circumstances permit of that advance.  There has been a reduction in the extent of seed sowing this year, due to allowance for surpluses from last year's sowing, but the nurseries are still geared to a planting target of 15,000 acres.</P>
    <P>The increase of £80,750 under the head of capital expenditure comprises increases of £50,000 in the provision for labour, £6,500 for materials, £16,200 for running expenses and repair of machinery, £4,000 for cartage and freight, £4,000 for the purchase and construction of buildings, and a nominal £50 for miscellaneous expenditure.</P>
    <P>Wage increases would have involved an addition to the labour provision of £12,000 without change in the volume of work.  The further addition of £38,000 is in respect of a much expanded road construction programme, the preparation and drainage of ground which is the other main aspect of work covered by the head being on the same scale as in 1952-53. I should explain at this stage that the acreage of land mechanically treated for preparation for afforestation amounted to 5,300 acres as against 7,000 acres manually prepared.  As I have said, this year's programme will be somewhat similar.</P>
    <P>The additional £6,500 for materials is required to cover more extensive purchase of new equipment than in 1952-53, the most notable item being additional light tractors for haulage work, additional rotovators for nursery work and some small rock drills and mechanical saws.</P>
    <P>The increase in the provision for running expenses and repair of machinery allows for the use of the new equipment to be purchased, increased incidence of repair costs on machinery <Col N="626" /> already in use, including crawler type tractors which have already been in service for about two years, purchase of some spare parts, adaptation of equipment to meet particular types of work and road tax payments.</P>
    <P>The increased charge for cartage and freight is complementary to the increased allowance for labour on road construction.  The rise in cost would have been greater, were it not for economies to be secured from the use of additional tractors.  In respect of buildings, allowance is made for speeding up the provision of official residences for foresters.</P>
    <P>The provisions under the head of constructional expenditure on which there is a net reduction of £40,200 are, with the exception of the item for materials, framed on the same basis as last year.  There is an increase of £5,000 under the head of labour to allow for wage increases.  There is also an extra £1,000 allowed for under the item cartage and freight.  There is, however, a reduction of £46,200 in the provision for materials.  The principal expenditure covered by this item is the purchase of fencing wire.  Notwithstanding that a reserve of about three years' supply of fencing wire was already in stock, allowance was made in the 1952-53 Estimate for the purchase of the major portion of the year's requirements. Fencing wire does not deteriorate rapidly in store, but prolonged storage can cause damage and the storage facilities available are furthermore inadequate for the proper protection of the quantity now held.  It is therefore proposed to draw on reserve stocks to meet this year's requirements and to purchase only materials of which inadequate stocks are held.</P>
    <P>The increase of £76,400 under the head of maintenance is constituted by increases of £80,000 for labour and £1,300 for building repairs offset by reductions of £4,500 in the provision for materials and £400 in that for protection.</P>
    <P>About £27,000 of the additional sum for labour is related to wage increases, the balance of £53,000 being directly attributable to the increasing volume of work covered by the maintenance head.  The increased provision for building <Col N="627" /> repairs is made in the hope of overtaking arrears of such work during the year.  The reduction under the item materials reflects completion during 1952-53 of the purchase of extra stocks of various tools, etc.  The lower provision for protection is not significant; the 1952-53 figure includes a sum of £400 provided in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Sub-head C (3)&mdash;Timber Conversion &mdash;shows an increase of £32,410.  This is made up by increases of £29.100 under the head timber conversion in State forests and £3,310 under the head sawmilling.</P>
    <P>The increase under the head of timber conversion in State forests is distributed over the various items constituting the head.  There is an extra £25,000 for labour, of which some £8,000 is by way of provision for wage increases, the remaining £17,000 being related to an increase in the volume of work.  An increase of £2,600 in the provision for running expenses and repair of machinery is due to anticipated increased incidence of repair costs on older machines and the projected use for timber haulage and sawing of some of the new tractors, for the purchase of which provision was made under sub-head C (2).  An additional £500 for cartage and freight relates to the increased volume of work anticipated.  A sum of £1,000 for tools and other materials has also been inserted in the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The increase of £3,310 under the head of sawmilling is due to a slight variation in the amount required for labour and an addition of £3,000 to the provision for equipment.  The alteration in the labour figure allows for wage adjustments, the completion of reconstruction work on Cong sawmill, and the opening of the new mill there during the year.  The altered figure for equipment and running expenses also allows for commencement of work at the new Cong sawmill, as well as payment for some outstanding equipment, electrical installation, etc.  It is hoped to have <Col N="628" /> the new sawmill at Cong in operation in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Sub-head D&mdash;Grants and Advances for Afforestation Purposes&mdash;is being retained at the same level as in 1952-53.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned sub-head E (1)&mdash;Forestry Education.  Sub-heads E (2) and F are being retained at the same level as in 1952-53.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G shows a decrease of £800, but if the proposed provision of £1,500 is compared with the original Estimate provision for 1952-53 it will be seen that there is allowance for an increase over that figure of £320, including £250 on the advertising head. After the 1953-54 Estimate was framed, it became apparent that considerably increased provision was needed to meet expenditure in 1952-53, especially on advertising, and an extra £1,120 was provided in the Supplementary Estimate for that year.</P>
    <P>Higher advertising expenditure is, in part, due to an increase in advertisement charges, but in the main arises from more frequent and extensive warnings in regard to the danger of forest fires.  Deputies will have seen from statements issued by the Department in recent months that there has been an exceptional number of dangerous fires this year and that a number, in fact, gave rise to considerable damage.  As our plantations advance in age and value the destruction which fire can wreak is of increasing gravity, and the Department is energetically pursuing every available means of awakening public consciousness of the danger of fires.</P>
    <P>I promised to refer in more detail to the operations to be carried on during the year under sub-heads C (2) and C 3 (1).</P>
    <P>The forestry policy which it is intended to pursue remains based on the principles which I explained fully in introducing the 1952-53 Estimate and which I may summarise as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Firstly, to give priority of attention to the proper sylvicultural treatment of existing plantations even where such priority militates against <Col N="629" /> the rapid establishment of new plantations on bare land associated with older plantations;</P>
    <P>Secondly, to lay down new plantations at the maximum progressive annual rate within an immediate target of 15,000 acres annually sustainable without interference with essential care and development of existing plantations and without exhausting in one or two years the available plantable land in new forest areas; and</P>
    <P>Thirdly, to maintain nursery production at a level which will permit of expansion in the annual planting rate towards the 15,000 acre target as soon as other circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>Last year I informed the House that the maximum planting programme practicable was 12,500 acres and I quoted copious data to enable every Deputy to see for himself that any attempt on my part to secure a higher planting figure would have been contrary to the requirements of good forestry and to the ultimate objective of providing good quality commercial timber from our own resources. Despite the data some Deputies were obviously sceptical as to the volume of other work which I stated to be urgently necessary to secure the proper development of existing plantations. Any such doubts should have been finally set at rest by the information I gave to the House in connection with the Supplementary Estimate for 1952-53 &mdash;information which showed that a bigger labour force than was ever previously employed had to be taken on to cope properly with the amount of urgent work in hands.</P>
    <P>I am now able to give the House an approximate summary of the main works actually carried out during 1952-53 although the figures are necessarily at this stage liable to minor adjustment.</P>
    <P>Fresh planting totalled slightly over the target figure of 12,500 acres and was spread over 119 forests including eight new centres where no planting had previously taken place.</P>
    <P>In addition to this fresh planting <Col N="630" /> areas destroyed by fire etc., totalling about 630 acres were replanted during the year, an appreciable advance towards disposal of arrears of such work.  Gratifying progress was also made with the replacement of failures in young plantations, some 11,500 acres being dealt with.  The importance of progress on this side of the work lies in the fact that replacement of failures becomes impossible when the original plantation reaches a certain stage of development.</P>
    <P>Increased work also had to be undertaken in the cleaning of young plantations.</P>
    <P>Deputies might like some idea of the distribution of the new plantations over the country.  Detailed figures for each forest or even each county would not readily show the general picture but I have had figures prepared for four main regions: The South-East, comprising Dublin, Wicklow, Wexford, Carlow, and South-East Kilkenny; the South-West, including Clare, Limerick, Kerry, Cork, Waterford, Tipperary and South-West Kilkenny; the West and North-West, i.e. Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon and Galway; and the remainder of the country which for convenience I shall refer to as the Midlands, comprising Laois, Offaly, Kildare, Meath, Westmeath, Monaghan, Longford, Cavan, Louth and the northern portion of Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>The new planting was spread over these areas approximately as follows:</P>
    <P>South-East&mdash;2,250 acres,</P>
    <P>South-West&mdash;4,700 acres,</P>
    <P>West and North-West &mdash; 3,950 acres,</P>
    <P>Midlands&mdash;1,600 acres.</P>
    <P>These figures show the extent to which land availability considerations have switched the emphasis on new afforestation from the traditional southeastern area towards the western counties. At least half of the planting during 1952-53 was in the western half of the country although about two-thirds of our total existing plantations lie in the eastern half and one and a half times as many men are employed in the East as in the West.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> These comparative figures reflect also the extent to which priority must be given to the management of existing plantations in the older centres, a higher labour force in the eastern half of the country being required because of the greater incidence of thinning, weeding and pruning, road construction, etc.</P>
    <P>Thinning was the operation upon which I laid the greatest stress in the survey of our forest management requirements which I gave the House last year.  I laid stress upon it particularly because of the serious retardation of proper growth and development which results from neglect of the regular thinning of plantations.  Each year that passes brings additional plantations to the stage where thinning is needed.  Once the need arises the operation must be repeated at regular intervals until the crop reaches maturity and the area of our plantations requiring thinning has been increasing progressively and sharply in recent years in consequence of the acceleration of planting in the decade following 1930.  I emphasised last year my anxiety that the growing arrear of thinning should be given the priority it deserves and I was pleased to be able to tell the House in the Supplementary Estimate debate that up to or over 7,000 acres would be thinned during the year.  The final figure was about 7,500 acres all but 700 acres being thinned by direct labour.  The work is still in arrear and we cannot relax the efforts made last year to cope with it but last year's progress was nonetheless a substantial advance; the figures for the two previous years being 1950-51&mdash;4,059 acres and 1951-52&mdash;5,528 acres.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress was made also with the elimination of arrears of weeding and pruning of plantations approaching the thinning stage, over 12,500 acres being completed.  This operation is the first step towards thinning and marks the end of the long interval of sylvicultural inactivity between the cleaning of plantations during their first few years and the systematic removal of less promising stems by regular periodic thinning.  The operation consists of the removal of <Col N="632" /> deformed and useless stems and the pruning of the lower branches of the remaining trees to produce cleaner timber.  It is sometimes accompanied by a light thinning of the remaining trees.  The same criticism applies to neglect or undue deferment of weeding and pruning as to neglect of thinning itself and I am glad to be able to report to the House that good progress was made with this work simultaneously with the improvement in thinning progress.</P>
    <P>I mentioned also last year the need for a more intensive programme of road construction to enable thinnings to be extracted.  That work also was accelerated during the year, a total of about 50 miles of new roads being laid down.</P>
    <P>Besides these particular operations readily capable of statistical summary, the usual round of routine management and maintenance work had to be handled in the forests and there was the normal annual increase in the volume of maintenance work due to expansion of the total area of properties and the total planted area.</P>
    <P>The year's work as a whole may be summarised by saying that it followed closely and with a good measure of success the objective of putting the management and development of our existing forests on a proper basis by devoting to them the increased attention which they now demand while pursuing a policy of fresh planting on the maximum scale of which our resources of land, etc. and the requirements of good management would permit. The year's work made a more effective contribution to the ultimate national good than if higher planting figures had been achieved by neglect of our existing plantations and disregard of principles of proper forestry. In the process greater employment was given than in any previous year.</P>
    <P>Turning now to 1953-54 it is intended to continue vigorously the same policy as that followed last year.  Weeding and pruning may not have to be on quite the same scale as in 1952-53, but it is estimated that between 9,500 and 11,000 acres will have to be dealt with.  Thinning, on the other hand, must be maintained at the same rate as in 1952-53 and, if possible, expanded <Col N="633" /> still further.  The sharp increase to 7,500 acres in the area thinned last year made, as I have said, a notable contribution towards elimination of arrears of this work but the area to be handled annually will continue to grow with the steady development of additional plantations to the stage where periodic thinning is required. Long-term speculation as to exactly when thinning will become necessary in particular plantations is dangerous in so far as growth conditions cannot be forecast accurately, but such estimation as is possible indicates that the area of our plantations requiring thinning will increase steadily towards 20,000 acres a year over the next ten to 15 years.  No interference with this work can be contemplated.  In the present year the Department's aim is to treat about 8,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Road construction must also continue to enjoy a measure of priority in the light of the increasing area to be thinned in future years.  It is expected that about 70 miles of new roads will be constructed in the year, an increase of almost 50 per cent. over last year's expanded rate.</P>
    <P>In the younger plantations, a further increase in cleaning is to be anticipated, an area of some 50,000 acres being due for attention, but there will be some reduction in the area of plantations in which replacement of failures will be effected, the probable total being slightly under 10,000 acres.  Complete replacement of areas destroyed by fire, totalling about 750 acres, is also on the year's programme.</P>
    <P>Fresh planting will again have to be limited to 12,500 acres because of the inadequacy of the available reserve of plantable land, its uneven distribution between forest centres and the other factors which I mentioned last year as militating against greater planting targets at many individual forest centres, principally the prior demands of thinnings, etc., at long-established forest centres and the undesirability of planting available ground in new areas at such a rate as to preclude the employment of a regular forest staff on a steady programme of work.</P>
    <P>The planting programme will be spread over the regions I mentioned earlier in somewhat similar proportions <Col N="634" /> to those which obtained in 1952-53, the approximate figures being: South-East, 2,100 acres; South-West, 4,800 acres; West and North-West, 3,800 acres; Midlands, 1,800 acres.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to be able to tell the House that the planting programme was being extended this year but there is as yet no room for extension without sacrificing good management. If satisfactory progress is made in the meantime with the acquisition of land I may be able to announce some increase in the planting rate in another 12 months.</P>
    <P>The data I have given in regard to the year's work explain the changes made in sub-head C (2) and C (3) (1) of the Estimate which I mentioned earlier as attributable to increases in the volume of forest work.  The increased road construction is covered by the enlarged provision under sub-head C (2) (2), additional thinning under sub-head C (3) (1), and weeding and pruning, cleaning and replacement of failures along with the general increase in maintenance work contribute to the rise in the provision needed under sub-head C (2) (4).  The Estimate as a whole allows for the employment of an average of approximately 4,000 forestry labourers during the year compared with an average of 3,550 during 1952-53. The present number employed is 3,700 compared with 3,400 in the corresponding week last year and there will be the usual increase in employment later in the year.</P>
    <P>To help Deputies to realise the amount of work which goes on in the forests and which absorbs all this manpower, I have had a summary prepared of the position at a typical long-established forest which I visited recently, Kilsheelan in County Waterford, which lies along the foothills between the Comeragh Mountains and the River Suir.  The forest provides steady employment for about 70 men.  Its total area is 4,718 acres including 350 acres of acquired woodland and 3,760 acres of State plantations.  The acquired woodland consists of middle-aged stands of European larch, Douglas fir and Scots pine which need continuous sylvicultural treatment.  Six hundred and thirty acres of State plantations have already reached the thinning <Col N="635" /> stage and 570 acres are at the weeding and pruning stage, making in all 1,500 acres already needing regular sylvicultural treatment.  Good shelter is provided on the northern slopes of the Comeraghs by the steep cliffs forming the summit and the plantations extend to the exceptional height of 2,000 feet.</P>
    <P>Planting has gone ahead steadily for many years but the area available for planting is now only about 300 acres of which over half is likely to be planted this year.  Apart from a considerable volume of work in a nursery attached to the forest, the programme for the six months ending 30th September next includes the preparation of ground for this season's planting; grass cleaning of 700 acres; cleaning of coppice shoots, furze, etc., over 750 acres; weeding and pruning of 272 acres; thinning of 60 acres; felling of 500 tons of mature timber; provision of 1,300 yards of new fencing; repairs to 2,000 yards of fencing; construction of 800 yards of new roads; repair of 880 yards of existing roads; erection of a bridge and repair of another, and other routine maintenance work such as the cleaning of firelines and rides and extermination of vermin.  There is a heavy local demand for forest produce of all kinds from light poles to commercial timber.  The thinning of the middle-aged acquired woodlands provides commercial timber, E.S.B. and telegraph poles, while thinning of State plantations provides fencing poles, stakes, pit props, etc.  There has also been a steady demand for firewood, but the supply is drying up. The total gross revenue from the forest during 1952-53 amounted to over £4,200.</P>
    <P>Mention of revenue brings me fittingly to the last sub-head to which I have to refer, sub-head H&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid. There is a net decrease in the allowance for Appropriations-in-Aid of £2,500 attributable to a reduction of £10,000 in the allowance for receipts from sales of timber in the forests offset in part by an increase of £7,500 in the allowance for sales of sawn timber in the departmental sawmills. Under the head, Sales of Timber, <Col N="636" /> receipts in respect of the sale of mature commercial timber, thinnings and firewood are credited.  The forest service is still too young to have any appreciable receipts from the sale of commercial timber from State-formed plantations and revenue of that nature derives mainly from woods and plantations taken over from private owners. So long as that situation continues, and certainly over the next ten or 15 years, there will be no question of a steady upward trend in receipts from the sales of commercial timber, and in the meantime revenue is liable to rise and fall somewhat erratically in relation to the vagaries of both supply and demand.  In 1952-53 there was some falling off in sales and it is possible that this trend may continue in the current year.</P>
    <P>Some of the produce of thinning is absorbed by local demand for fencing stakes and so forth, and departmental requirements of a similar nature. Much of the remainder is suitable either for pitwood or pulping.  Here again there was a reduction in sales during 1952-53 due to instability of the pitwood market and a falling off in demand for material suitable for pulping. The demand for pulpwood material was exceptionally high in the previous year because the Athy Wallboard Company were accumulating initial stocks of material.</P>
    <P>Total receipts from sales of timber during 1952-53 were of the order of £158,000 as compared with £172,000 in the previous year, and in view of the difficulties I have mentioned as affecting estimation of receipts under this head it was decided to frame the Estimate for 1953-54 on the basis of allowance for receipts falling as low as £140,000, whereas allowance had been made in the 1952-53 Estimate for receipts totalling £150,000.</P>
    <P>The increase of £7,500 in the allowance for receipts under the head of sales of sawn timber is related to the prospect of having the new sawmill at Cong in operation for part of the year. Receipts at present are almost entirely in respect of Dundrum sawmill as the old sawmill at Cong is unable to continue production at its full previous rate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> Finally, I would like to refer to the control of tree-felling on privately owned land under the Forestry Act 1946.  There has been little change in the number of felling notices received in 1952-53 as compared with the previous year.</P>
    <P>Last year, I pointed out that the replanting conditions attached to felling licences under the 1928 Act were due for fulfilment by the 31st March, 1952, and that in spite of repeated warnings many licensees had failed to fulfil their planting obligations.  I warned that it would be necessary to undertake proceedings in many of these cases.  I have since taken legal advice as to the form of prosecution and am having particulars prepared of all unfulfilled obligations with a view to the institution of proceedings in the near future.  Any person who wishes to avoid such proceedings would accordingly be well-advised to communicate at once with my Department stating the circumstances which have prevented him from fulfilling his obligation and submitting reasonable proposals regarding the fulfilment thereof at an early date.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that there has been some reduction in the number of illegal fellings reported last year as compared with the previous year.  The number of cases so reported amounted to 124 as compared with 169 in 1951-52 and is still far too high.  Proceedings were instituted in 77 cases and convictions obtained in 71 of these. Those convicted included eight timber merchants, who were found guilty of offences arising from the purchase of trees which the owner was not entitled to fell.  As I have previously pointed out, purchasers of timber can easily obtain evidence of authority to fell from the vendor or the nearest Garda station.  All timber merchants or other persons engaged in the purchase of timber should by now be fully familiar with the provisions of the Forestry Act, 1946.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has certainly given us a very extensive survey of the activities of the Forestry Department over the past year.  It is gratifying to know that headway is being made, even though it is not perhaps <Col N="638" /> as great as we would like or as the country would require.  The management and control of our forests is, of course, a very big undertaking and a very important business, if I may use that term, in relation to the economic life of the nation.  I should like to say that forestry has ever been the aim and ideal of every Government we have had here as it was of those who went before us.  All have felt that forestry is necessary from many points of view.  There should be no great difficulty in securing suitable land for even more extensive activities as regards plantation.  I agree with what the Minister said that the plantation of land is only the beginning, and that the pruning, the thinning and the cleaning of the young forests is even more important in a sense than the planting.</P>
      <P>Before I go into details, I should like to suggest to the Minister that, in my opinion, the time has arrived in which houses should be made available for those engaged on forestry work, if not on the forests at least in the forestry districts.  It is hard on men to have to travel long distances to and from their work, day after day.  I think that, under that system, their effectiveness is considerably reduced.  I should like to see, in every district where there is a reasonable amount of forest planted, suitable housing accommodation provided not only for the forester but for the workers likely to be permanently engaged on forestry work. Indeed, it would even be better if, as regards workers who are employed in a semi-temporary way, sleeping accommodation were provided for them near the forest so that they would be relieved of the fatigue of travelling long distances daily to their work.  I think if that were done it would evoke from the forester and the workers a greater interest in the care and wellbeing of the forests.  They would then realise that not only were they doing good work for themselves but also good work for the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has always been a certain amount of competition in the speeches made here on this Vote as to what is the proper amount of afforestation that should be done in any one year.  When <Col N="639" /> the Minister says he has decided on, approximately, 12,500 acres for next year, I suppose that is as much as we can expect him to do, although I fear his announcement will be a disappointment to many people.</P>
    <P>It was considered that 15,000 or 16,000 acres per annum should be a minimum.  However, if steady progress is made at the rate of even 12,000 acres per annum, it will be some headway, and I suppose we have to be satisfied with what we can get.</P>
    <P>In connection with the employment of workers on forests, I would like to stress that the Minister or the Department should not terminate at very short notice the services of people who are employed on that work, because money runs out or something else like that occurs.  The Minister need never be afraid to face this House with a Supplementary Estimate if he feels that he requires more money.  Forestry is one of the expenditures that this House would sanction with a very great will and he would have no difficulty in obtaining whatever money is required.  Every tree that is planted is a new asset to the State and it is certainly one of the best investments that a country or an individual can undertake.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has issued a warning to people who got felling permits and who have not fulfilled their obligations under the permits.  It is a matter which should be brought very forcibly to their notice for immediate attention.  When these people were getting permits to cut down timber, they were receiving good prices for it and it is only reasonable that they should comply with the requirements which the Forestry Department laid down.  They would not have got the permit if they said they were not prepared to undertake the replanting. As a great number of the people who got these felling licences never had the responsibility of planting that timber&mdash;they were really reaping the benefit from some previous generation &mdash;they should now reinvest that money.</P>
    <P>If persons who have been granted a felling permit want to have land replanted, there are nurserymen who will <Col N="640" /> take the contract for replanting from one acre to 50 acres at a very reasonable price.  If they make inquiries from good nurserymen for a tender to replant the forest they have cut down, they will find they can have it done far cheaper than they could do it themselves. The nurserymen know how to do it.  I have had some experience of it myself and I know what I am talking about.  The nurserymen will undertake the planting of young trees at so much per 1,000 and there is nobody can do it better than they can.  They prepare the ground; they bring the young plants, larch, spruce, or whatever they may be, fresh every day from the nursery and plant what they bring in the day.  These plants never stop growing and there is no failure.  It is easy, therefore, for those people who get felling licences to comply with the Forestry Department's requirements.  I would add my voice to that of the Minister in asking them to fulfil the obligations they undertook when the felling permits were granted.  That is one of the ways in which they can get it done reasonably, cheaply and efficiently. They have wiring, and so forth, to do themselves, of course, but they can do that very easily if the will is there.  I am glad to hear that the Minister has taken in hands the thinning and pruning of plantations and intends to do a good deal of it.  He should leave no plantation undone and he should see to it that all the pruning and cutting of the under-branches, and so on, is done every year where it is required.  Again I submit to him and to the House that he can easily obtain whatever money is required. The amount of the Vote should not stop him, because failure either to cut the lower branches or to thin or weed puts in jeopardy the benefits from the money he has already spent upon the acquisition of the land, and the planting of the young timber.  In that connection I would stress that the Minister, the Forestry Department and the Government need never be afraid to come to this House for whatever money is required.</P>
    <P>The extension of afforestation is admitted to be one of the greatest needs in this country.  There are many existing industries that could be <Col N="641" /> fostered and new ones established if we had sufficient timber, including young timber.  Therefore, one of the principal reasons why afforestation must commend itself to the House and to the country is that it provides rural employment.  It is one of the operations that cannot be done in the city; it is done upon the green fields of the Irish countryside.  Consequently, it is a step in the right direction towards retaining our rural population.  Every effort and every activity by the Department in that connection should be fostered and approved by every member of the House.</P>
    <P>On the question of land acquisition, although land is becoming dear again, I hold that that should not stop the Forestry Department from proceeding with the acquisition of land that is suitable for afforestation.  Of course, some Deputies like myself, who want land divided amongst uneconomic holders and others, do not like to see good land planted.  Unfortunately, the Forestry Department, in order to make sure that they would have some profit, must take some good land.  I do suggest, however, that they could do with land of a lesser quality than that which they are utilising.</P>
    <P>Having been told some 20 years ago that afforestation could not take place on certain lands, on certain heights and in certain areas, I will never forget having seen where an Indian prince established certain plantations in the West of Ireland, in a place where, we were told, no one would go.  To-day is it not something of which any of us could be proud?  If that could be done by an individual there is no reason in the world why the State could not do the same.  There are large tracts of land which, undoubtedly, at one time were covered with plantations and woodlands and which to-day are bare because of invasions and other occurrences when our timber was cut down and taken away.  Of course, the last destruction of our woodlands was in 1914-1918, during which time people got rich quick upon the destruction of many fine forests and woodlands.  The Department could, however, with profit extend their activities to this land which is easily obtained.</P>
    <P>I know that there are arguments that <Col N="642" /> land is used as sheep runs and that farmers have sheep rights, and so on. If the land is very valuable for sheep grazing, it is more costly to acquire but I think it is worth it.  Plantations will not only improve the scenic appearance of the country but will improve the temperature and give the employment that we so urgently require.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that there are people so careless about plantations as to light fires or carelessly throw cigarettes or matches and cause damage to this very valuable property.  There should be very prominent warning notices everywhere near forests.  Where people infringe the law in this matter it is one of the cases in which I would have no hesitation in visiting upon them the most rigorous punishment permissible under the law.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that in every forest I visited, good paths have been constructed but the clearing of the roads is not as good as it should be.  Rome was not built in a day and we cannot expect everything to be done in a minute.  If the Minister and the Forestry Division made a determined effort to proceed on a more rapid scale with afforestation they would get not only the support of Deputies but the thanks of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The satisfactory feature of this Estimate is that there is a proposal for an increased expenditure on afforestation of over £200,000.  That is welcome news to every section of the community.  It is welcome news to those who believe in the development of our country's resources and their utilisation to the fullest extent and to those who wish to see the maximum number of our people usefully employed.  We hear a great deal about unemployment, emigration and other social evils.  The only way to tackle them is by a constructive effort to increase the volume of useful employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that in the coming year there will be a further substantial increase in the number of men employed.  I think he gave the figure of 4,000 for the coming year as against 3,700 last year and last year <Col N="643" /> there was a substantial increase on the year before.  It appears that every year we are progressively stepping up the number of workers employed in afforestation.  That is satisfactory.  I hope the progress will continue.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's statement there is every indication that the volume of employment will progressively increase. As he stated, every additional year's planting of 12,000 or 15,000 acres adds considerably to the volume of employment in keeping the plantations in order.  The Minister gave a figure in connection with one estate where 4,000 acres meant employment for 70 workers.  That would be about one worker to every 57 acres, which is a fairly substantial amount of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that is very different.  In the case of planting as against cultivation, the volume of employment would be much greater. There will always be a very substantial number of men required for the purpose of maintaining plantations in proper order and we can look forward at a later stage to employment in harvesting and in the use of the timber for various industrial purposes.  All this is very desirable.  Everyone will join in the hope that it will be possible to step up the acreage planted annually.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has experience or knowledge of the conditions knows that it is not such an easy matter to acquire land.  The land has to be purchased. In some cases land which is at present utilised for grazing and other purposes has to be acquired and acquisition is a long and difficult process, particularly where there is a number of people involved.  Each individual owner must have his rights acquired.  That makes for considerable delay.</P>
      <P>The officers of the Minister's Department are doing all they can to acquire land as speedily as possible, as far as my knowledge goes.  I have experience of their perseverance, energy and activity in accquiring land wherever it is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the volume of information given by the Minister in <Col N="644" /> introducing the Estimate, it may seem a little ungenerous or perhaps discourteous to ask for further information but there is one simple figure which I should like to get from him and which would be of use in establishing public opinion in favour of afforestation.  It is the simple economics of afforestation.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a good thing if the Minister could tell the House and tell the country the approximate value of an acre of mature timber, the length of time that it takes to produce that acre of timber, and the cost of production including all the expenditure involved from the acquisition of the land to the date on which the timber can be felled.  Of course I recognise that there is an income from some of the plantations in the thinnings, but adding that to the value of the mature timber I would like to know what is the total value of an acre of timber and what approximately it costs to produce.  I realise that that would not be a very precise figure but it would give a rough estimate so that the community and the taxpayers could see what value they are getting for the expenditure involved.  The Department of Forestry is costing quite a considerable amount of money but people generally look upon it as an investment and we would like to be assured of the value of the investment.  Nobody, I think, really expects very big profit out of the transaction, because afforestation has a value apart altogether from its mere cash or commercial value.  It is certainly a social benefit to the nation to have so many men employed productively, and it is also a benefit, I suppose, to the nation by improving its scenic appearance.  I think it is also recognised that the plantation of our forests does benefit considerably the climatic conditions and agricultural conditions generally in the areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably knows that in South Wicklow, long before the Department got under way, we had such work done in a small way on the Coolattin estate, where the land on some of the small hills was planted and the remainder of the land was utilised for agricultural purposes.  Thus you have planting, afforestation and agriculture, which is very pleasing to <Col N="645" /> look upon and it is what everyone desires. The Forestry Department has sometimes been encroaching upon agricultural land.  I know that it is a difficult question, because if the Department acquired a certain area of land and there are pockets of agricultural land dovetailed in amongst the land that is only suitable for plantation it is difficult to separate the agricultural land from what is being planted, but at the same time I think that every effort should be made to do so.  It is better to keep land that is useful for agriculture separate from what is being planted and to confine timber solely to land that is unsuitable for other purposes. I know that that is a difficult thing to achieve in all cases, yet I think every effort should be made to do so.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note that there has been a substantial increase in mechanisation in afforestation.  In this, as in all other matters, mechanisation is not the enemy of the human labour. It rather tends to increase the output of the workers employed and to assist them in getting more value out of their work, so I think that wherever mechanisation can be employed everybody will agree that it is desirable.</P>
    <P>It is necessary and desirable that plans should be carefully laid for the utilisation to the fullest extent of the State forests and that industries for the purpose of utilising this timber should be established.  To get the full value from our afforestation programme it is necessary that the timber should be used in the most efficient way, and if the State is involved in a great deal of expenditure in producing the timber they ought not to sell it merely as raw material to some other industry but ought to develop it to the fullest extent and by utilising it in properly established industries as near as possible to the plantations get full value out of it.</P>
    <P>I know that efforts are being made now to provide housing accommodation for workers convenient to the areas being planted.  That is all to the good. I think it is right that the men should have their residences as convenient to their work as possible and that they should not have to travel unnecessarily <Col N="646" /> long distances.  It is right also that there should be in the rural areas that are being taken over for afforestation a rural population associated with and dependent upon the forests for their living, and in that way you would always have an assurance of employment for those workers and an assurance of an ample labour supply for the Forestry Department.</P>
    <P>Farmers have been complaining in the areas adjoining plantations of damage by rabbits and foxes and other vermin which accumulate in the plantations.  I know that the Department are endeavouring to deal with that, but it is a matter in regard to which very drastic action should be taken.  It would be altogether wrong to allow the forests established to become the sheltering grounds for vermin of every kind that would damage the farmers' crops in the adjoining areas, so that we would expect the Forestry Department to take ruthless action to exterminate all types of vermin which, while they might not injure the plantations to any great extent, could do very serious damage to the farmers' land adjoining the plantations.</P>
    <P>There is another evil which does arise in regard to plantations and it is one which might not have been foreseen.  I have had experience of it in Wicklow and I think other Deputies have experience of it also, and that is that after some years when the plantations become more mature the wire netting protecting them deteriorates and the fence to a great extent deteriorates, and while that does not cause any damage to the plantation it does result in loss to the farmers on lands adjoining inasmuch as their sheep, for example, can stray into the forests and get completely lost.  This is a problem which has arisen now in Wicklow and which I suppose arises also in other counties, having regard to the very large areas now under plantation.  If sheep stray into forests it is almost impossible to find them.  In that way there is considerable loss.  Not only for the sake of protecting their own property but for the sake of protecting adjoining farmers against loss, the Forestry Department should take adequate measures to ensure that the <Col N="647" /> fences on their plantations are kept in proper repair.</P>
    <P>While the Minister referred to the failure of private landowners to plant in accordance with felling agreements, he did not refer at all to the other aspect, State assistance to private owners to encourage them to plant.  It seems that the scheme of grants to private landowners for the planting of timber on their own lands appears to be ineffective or not to be availed of to any extent.  I have often thought that it would be a very good thing if farmers could be encouraged, even where they have not felled any timber on their own land, to put patches of waste land under timber.  There is, of course, a scheme under the county committees of agriculture under which this work is carried out on a small scale by the provision of assistance for shelter belts, but there would be somewhat larger areas on a number of farms which could also be planted.</P>
    <P>Farmers are a little slow to avail of grants for that purpose.  I have a feeling that the grants in themselves of £10 per acre do not offer sufficient inducement. I am not suggesting that the grants should be increased, but I think some scheme should be devised on a long-term credit basis, under which a farmer could plant one, two, three or four acres of waste land and the cost would be recovered when the timber comes to maturity.  Some scheme of that kind could be worked out.  As has been pointed out, the main expense in the planting of a comparatively small area is not so much the cost of the timber or the preparing and developing of the ground, as the cost of effectively fencing the portion of land.  That would be fairly considerable. That is one of the reasons why farmers are not too anxious to avail of these grants.  If there were adequate credit provided to cover this, it would be a better proposition.  Something should be done about it.  Quite a large area of land could be put under plantations in this way.  As everyone knows, particularly in hilly country, there are considerable patches of land on every farm&mdash;one, two or three acres &mdash;which are practically waste as far as agriculture is concerned and which <Col N="648" /> could be very usefully utilised for the growing of timber.</P>
    <P>The whole matter boils down to two questions.  First, there is the initial expense and then there is the very long period before a return can be secured. For that reason, some form of State credit would be more beneficial than anything else, to ensure that those small plantations would be carried out. Such a scheme would give considerable employment and would help to beautify the country.  I recommend it to the Government and I hope that something will be done in this respect.</P>
    <P>On the whole, this is a satisfactory kind of Estimate, inasmuch as we have at least one Department which is adding something to the value of the nation's assets.  It is not like many other Departments which apparently are only on the consuming side of our assets and resources.  It would be a great advantage, not only to the Forestry Department, but to the nation generally, in estimating the value of afforestation, if we could have, as I suggest, a precise statement of accounts in regard to plantation, if we could have the cost of production of each acre of timber and its value when the timber is produced.  That would enable the Dáil, in the first place, and the community generally, to appraise accurately the value of afforestation. If the community are satisfied that this is valuable work for the nation, the Minister and his Department will get useful help from local public opinion in the acquisition of land and in the protection of the plantations when established.</P>
    <P>It shows a great lack of public spirit when people are careless, as is well known, in regard to fires in plantation areas.  If there were a strong public opinion in every locality in the nation which looked upon the State forests as a very valuable asset, the public, generally, would be prepared to protect and defend them in every possible way and people would be very slow to run the risk of damaging those forests. The Minister pointed out that a considerable amount of expenditure was involved in the past year, as well as in the Estimate for the present year, in replanting areas which were destroyed by fire.  That is one kind of <Col N="649" /> waste that ought to be cut down to the minimum.  Accidents will happen in spite of every effort, but I think everybody in the community should be concerned to protect our forests from damage by fire, and that every precaution would be taken by the community if there was a live and wide-awake public opinion in regard to this matter. That is why I say there should be a little bit of publicity to bring home to our people the value of our State forests, their potentialities for the purpose of establishing industries in the future in the areas where they exist, and their value also as a source of employment to our people.  If that was clearly understood by everybody, particularly in forest areas, it would make for a strong local public opinion which would deter people from deliberately, or through carelessness, damaging those forests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would be safe in saying that the Estimate for forestry gives general satisfaction to all sides of the House.  The Forestry Department could be said to be a popular Department amongst all the people. The only thing we have any doubt about is whether they are going fast enough with the planting which every one of us would like to see them doing. There are difficulties about that and I suppose in the long run it would be better that they should do the job well when they acquire land and look after it afterwards in the matter of thinning, cleaning, etc.  The amount of employment given in districts where State forests are situated is a great social and economic advantage to the countryside.  In a very short time after a forestry section is set up an additional amount of employment is provided in the area, even in districts where the land gave little or no employment previously.  A big lot of unskilled labour is employed straight away or within a few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the best way of utilising a lot of our land which is of a poor, hilly nature and it probably gives a better return to the nation over a period of years than it would if it were utilised in any other way.  A lot of it at the moment carries a number of mountainy sheep which are kept mainly for the <Col N="650" /> growing of wool.  In some districts it probably could be better utilised for the growing of trees rather than the production of wool.  There are such tracts of land in all parts of the country and every encouragement should be given by the Forestry Department to the people who own that land to sell it for forestry purposes.  The people who live in the locality would be probably better off if the Forestry Department had the land in their hands in order to utilise it for the planting of trees.</P>
    <P>As to the matter of employment, we sometimes hear complaints of men being laid off at certain times of the year.  I often wonder whether sufficient money is being made available for certain foresters' sections.  We do know that particular foresters could utilise more money to advantage in their districts in the matter of thinning and cleaning.  But they are cut rather tight.  It is usual at this time of the year for a good number of men to be laid off because it is said that work is scarce.  My own opinion is that work is not scarce but that the forester has only a certain amount of money to carry him over the whole season.  It would be an advantage from the employment point of view if more money were made available and these foresters were allowed to do the thinning and cleaning to the extent that they believe is required on any particular plantation.  That would help very considerably in providing employment over the whole year for men who often only work occasionally in particular sections.</P>
    <P>I know that there is a certain objection by landholders to selling these hillsides to the Forestry Department and the Forestry Department, if they have not the goodwill of the owners, are slow about acquiring these lands. Generally speaking, however, the Forestry Department will get every help from this House in connection with the afforestation programme and I am sure that if the farmers are willing to hand over their lands to the Forestry Department the acreage planted each year will increase.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, and I think Deputy MacEoin, inquired what was the value to the nation of a mature plantation. <Col N="651" /> It is very hard to estimate that.  My own rough calculation would be, taking one acre with another, and assuming that after 70 years the trees would reach maturity, that a plantation would be worth from £1,000 to £2,000 per acre.  I doubt if it would cost more than £200 or £300 per acre to bring it to that stage.  I may be all wrong, but I have the idea that an acre of matured timber, taking one acre with another, would be worth from £1,000 to £2,000 and that the cost would not be more than £200 or £300.  If you take the long-term view of it and look at it over a lifetime or two lifetimes, it certainly would be definitely a good investment for the nation to have the largest possible area planted.</P>
    <P>With regard to planting by private persons, the Minister mentioned the amount of felling which was done in the recent emergency and that a number of woods which were felled have not yet been replanted.  That is fairly common throughout the country.  There is an aspect of that to which I should like to call the attention of the Minister.  It sometimes happens that when farms change hands an obligation to replant is transferred to the new owner.  Very often, however, a new owner may buy these lands without the knowledge that they carry that obligation.  I suggest that where land carries an obligation for replanting it should be noted on the folio.  There should not be any great difficulty about that and it would enable the new owner to know of the obligation to replant.  There should be no difficulty in getting something noted on the folio. The Department of Lands should be able to do that through the Land Registry without any great difficulty.</P>
    <P>I believe that more might be done by the Department with regard to the encouragement of planting by private persons.  It would help considerably the development of this country.  Very little in that direction is being done at the moment and there was a suggestion a couple of years ago that a forester should be added to the staff of the local committee of agriculture or the county council and that some two or three county councils have a forester <Col N="652" /> on their staff as they had a considerable area of timber in their hands. The whole energy of the Department of Forestry should not be devoted to State plantations and it should be portion of the official policy to help private persons and encourage them to do some planting.  I think some scheme could be worked out by providing that a forester be added to the local committee of agriculture to give advice and carry out a drive to get planting done in small areas by private persons and farmers owning the land planting a few acres.  In that way, if all the farmers were doing a little they could plant four times the amount each year that the Forestry Department plants, and that would be great acquisition for the country in a short term of years.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that he should consider the proposal put up to him a short time ago by Wexford County Council to have a trained forester attached to the staff of the local authority or the committee of agriculture so as to help and give advice to any person owning land who desired to have it planted.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister and his Department on the great progress being made in the acquisition and planting of land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>We can readily admit that the Minister made a very clear and full statement and dealt with all phases of afforestation.  That is only right because after all the Forestry Branch of the Department of Lands is by far the most important section.  I think, too, that so far as this side of the House and this Party is concerned that Deputy MacEoin made a full reply which covered all the matters in which we would be interested.  There is no need, therefore, to delay the House or the Minister very much longer or prevent the Minister from replying.  It is satisfactory to note in the Minister's statement that more money has been voted for the carrying out of afforestation and that also every provision is being made for the acquisition of more land, but evidently so far as planting is concerned the number of acres as laid down last year still remains the same at 12,500 acres.  The maximum <Col N="653" /> which his predecessor hoped to reach was twice that, but the Minister in his statement last year and this year endeavoured to show that that was impossible. I do not know how far that is correct but I expect the experts of the Department should know best. Still, of course, it is absolutely essential that every effort should be made to increase the number of acres planted from the figure of 12,500 year after year until at least we should reach a maximum of 15,000 or 16,000, or if possible 25,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is readily understood that during all the years of foreign occupation in this country, the country was denuded of its trees and whatever was left was cleared out entirely during the 1914-18 war.  In fact, this country has the reputation of having the lowest percentage of its acreage under forestry of any country in Europe, and it has been said, I think, by a forestry expert that a country denuded of its trees is a country leading to decay.  There must be something in it, because all the progressive countries of Europe&mdash;and I suppose of the world&mdash;have a very high percentage of their acreage under forestry.  England itself, I believe, has, or had, 18 per cent.; France something like 20 per cent. and Norway and Sweden 25 per cent.  It was a rather peculiar situation that about a half century ago now the English Government then in control sent over a forestry expert from Sweden to see what could be done about carrying out afforestation along the western seaboard of this country and, of course, his report was an adverse one which we could expect because, after all, an expert from Sweden, I suppose, would not be likely to give a good, satisfactory report on this country in competition with his own.  Perhaps the English Government itself did not wish it should be favourable.  I think it has been estimated that in this country something like 1,250,000&mdash;perhaps 1,500,000 or 2,000,000 acres&mdash;of plantable land exist and at the rate we are going it will take a very long number of years before we have it all planted. But, however, Rome was not built in a day, and by continuing as we are, and improving as far as possible, <Col N="654" /> planting all the plantable land&mdash;and then, of course, we shall have always the old forests being cut down according as the timber will mature and the land being replanted&mdash;so that in that way, not only will we eventually, perhaps, have the right percentage of our land under forestry, but we should also be able to give employment&mdash;permanent employment if possible&mdash;to thousands of our people.</P>
    <P>It is easy to understand that when the land is acquired for planting, that the fencing, draining, clearing out of scrub and so forth, the planting itself, the maintenance afterwards, the thinning out, and so on, are bound to give a great deal of employment&mdash;and very suitable employment, too&mdash;for our young men in rural areas.  I think it was Deputy MacEoin who said that it was very useful that that type of employment would be in rural areas, and would have nothing to do with the city.  As the trees mature you will have the cutting down, the haulage, the cutting of the timber in the timber yards and so on; and its distribution through the country, so that not only will we be making ourselves safe against any emergency by having our own timber in sufficient supplies, but we will also be giving permanent and suitable employment to many thousands of our people.  It is therefore one of the most important sections of the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to the effect on climate and, of course, planting our hillsides to a certain extent affects what I might call land erosion. Trees beautify the country and provide shelter.  Deputy Allen mentioned the rearing of sheep as against the production of timber.  I should not like to get into a discussion with a mountain farmer in connection with that matter. I am sure most mountain farmers would state that it is more profitable to produce sheep, wool and meat than to produce timber but it is a very debatable question.  After all, if we planted all our mountains that are plantable, it would change the economy of the country entirely.  I do not suppose that any mountain farmer would object to planting a certain proportion of his land.  An economic unit for a plantation <Col N="655" /> is supposed to be something like 300 acres but I think the Department should be prepared to accept a good deal less.  They would probably find that where one farmer was willing to offer 50 acres, another farmer in the same neighbourhood would offer another 50 or 100 acres and eventually by getting other farmers to offer some of their land and by merging all the land offered, it would be possible to have a plantation of 200 or 300 acres or perhaps up to 500 acres.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of pests in forests, I am sure the Department is quite aware of the destruction caused by rabbits, hares, squirrels and deer.  Of course, it is to prevent such destruction that certain areas are wired in but I do not suppose that the Department is always successful in ejecting the pests before they wire in any particular area.  In any event, I do not suppose that it would be possible to prevent deer from entering plantations or forests because they can jump to any height.  It is necessary, however, to make provision to curb these pests as far as possible especially in the case of young forests.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin referred also to provision of houses for forestry workers. Seeing that at present much of the work is part-time, it would not be easy to calculate the number of houses required but certainly, where men have to travel long distances to work, some provision should be made by which these men could have a hot mid-day meal.  In that connection it might be better if we were to follow in the footsteps of Bord na Móna year by year. Some provision should be made for the housing of employees or at least some steps should be taken to provide them with a hot mid-day meal.</P>
    <P>We had hopes at one time that an institute of forestry would be established at Muckross House in Killarney &mdash;that beautiful building which is idle and empty at present.  Anybody who has any knowledge of the woodland scenery of Killarney and of the area of land around the place suitable for planting, would readily agree that it would be an ideal situation for such an institute if the Department of Forestry should decide at any time to <Col N="656" /> set up such an institute.  Maybe it has set it up elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I would also suggest to the Minister, now that the Department has taken over that very important portion of land at Lickeen, Glencar, that next October or in the near future some effort should be made to get it ready for planting.  Many farmers in that area have offered land for further plantations.  It is a poor mountainous area and it is necessary to give employment to as many people as possible in the district.  On the question of forestry generally, we are all in agreement as to the necessity for extending afforestation and we are only too anxious to help the Minister and the Department in every way possible.  In conclusion I should like to say that in connection with any representations we have made to the officials of the Department in regard to offers of land. the acquisition of land or other matters we have always been received with the greatest courtesy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the advantage of hearing the Minister's opening statement but there are a few points I should like to mention in connection with this very important Estimate.  My approach to this matter is somewhat different from that of Deputy Palmer in that I deplore the fact, as I have done previously, that forestry is just a mere section of the Department of Lands.  I consider that there is no justification for that and, no matter what Minister or Government may be in power, I feel that we are undoubtedly unfortunately failing in our duty in regard to forestry.  Deputy Palmer mentioned the fact that a lot of timber was felled in this country during the 1914-18 War.  It might be interesting to ascertain what acreage in this country was under timber prior to 1914 or what acreage was under timber at the very start of this century as compared with the acreage under timber at the present time.  I think we should be prepared to approach this Estimate from the national point of view irrespective of Party politics as it deals with a question for which whether we like it or not, we have all a certain responsibility.  I am not satisfied that we should approach this <Col N="657" /> problem purely from the point of view of the minimum acreage that should be utilised for the growing of timber. It seems to me that we have come to the stage of considering everything merely from the return that may be made available in hard cash to the State, that we consider nothing other than the material benefits that may accrue over a number of years from the planting of timber.  If that were so always I presume that the acreage under timber at the start of the century would have been vastly different from what it was.</P>
      <P>I do not think that we should be prepared to seek the views of experts from other countries regarding the minimum acreage that we should utilise for forestry.  Why should we go to other countries to seek such advice when such experts, able as they may be in their own business, are bound to approach this question from a different point of view from that which we hold, and when they fail to realise that we have not the same quantity of land available in this country as in countries in which they gained their experience? Take, for instance, the United States. We have too small an acreage under timber if we compare it against other countries.  It is perfectly true that the percentage of land under timber in this country is relatively small and is undoubtedly a disgrace to us when we consider the percentage under timber even in an industrialised country like Britain.  What excuses are we prepared to make?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Allen mentioned one aspect of this very important question.  I refer to the problem of getting private individuals to realise the advantages of afforestation.  During the recent emergency, some people were permitted to cut down trees or fell timber on the understanding that they would replant the acreage concerned.  Unfortunately, that obligation has not been met in certain instances.  I am sure that every member of the House is aware that many of the owners concerned have no intention of replanting at any stage.  It is about time that such people were brought to heel and made face their responsibilities.  If they gained certain advantages by cutting <Col N="658" /> down the trees then surely they should be prepared to accept their responsibilities and replant the land.  Even at this late stage&mdash;because it is late&mdash;the Minister in charge of the Forestry Division should make it quite clear to the people concerned that they will not be allowed to evade their responsibilities and that the lands must be replanted immediately.</P>
    <P>I fear that, in many instances, where saplings were planted, it was done more or less as a joke.  I know of places where replanting was carried out and where the saplings are now four or five years old.  These saplings are of little or no value from the point of view of commercial timber&mdash;and they will be of no value&mdash;because they were planted next to the trunks of formed timber.  No chance was given to these young saplings in their first few years of growth.  Briars and weeds were allowed to grow around them. Surely we all realise that an orderly system of plantation is essential for the successful growth of saplings.  We are closing our eyes to the neglect of some of these owners who so far have evaded their responsibilities in this connection.  Much of that timber&mdash;or of what we hoped would be timber in a few years' time&mdash;will, I fear, be fit for nothing other than firewood.  I believe that, unfortunately, we have come to the stage where our concern with afforestation is purely from the point of view of commercial timber but, if that is so, then we must be prepared for a position in which in 30 or 40 years' time, a percentage of the trees which will then be coming into maturity will not be fit for any commercial purpose.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the people in the rural areas are not prepared, as individuals, to avail of the many opportunities afforded them for the planting of timber.  Deputy Allen mentioned the desirability of having a forester attached to each local authority area. As far as I am aware, that is so in County Donegal and certainly it is so in Cork.  Not alone have we a forester attached to the local authority but we also have a plantation and a nursery there.  However, much as is being done by the forester and the Cork County Council in the way of providing <Col N="659" /> the advantages that are there for landowners, unfortunately&mdash;whether it be through lack of publicity or because of that over-conservative attitude which it seems almost impossible to break down&mdash;the people are not availing of the opportunities that are being afforded in County Cork.</P>
    <P>Another problem in the same context is that vested interests are opposed to the setting-up of plantation nurseries and the appointment of new foresters attached to local authorities.  It may be that some of these people are afraid that, ultimately, it will lead to a position which they themselves may not be able to face.  The members of this House, irrespective of Party, must admit that forestry in this country, and the methods which have been applied for the past 30 or 40 years, are not showing satisfactory results.  It is all right to say that we have 12,000 acres: 12,000 acres each year will eventually give us some fair area under timber, but what is that amount compared with what we should have?</P>
    <P>During the last war this country was faced with a very serious problem due to lack of timber.  I have a small knowledge of the building industry and I have heard people saying that Irish timber was fit for nothing but the fire. Prior to the war, timber could be imported into this country at a cheap rate but, from 1940 onwards, we were in a vastly different position.  While we all hope that, in our lifetime, there will not be a recurrence of world war, yet, should such an unfortunate event occur, where would this country be as regards timber?  Timber is one of those important products that cannot be done without for building purposes as well as for many other purposes. Timber is a vital necessity for this country&mdash;and yet we are not facing our responsibilities in regard to replanting and afforestation.  Because of that, and because of the vital importance of timber in industry generally, I believe that it is unfair that a Minister for Lands should, at the same time, be in charge of forestry.  Of the two things &mdash;land and afforestation&mdash;I believe that, in the years to come, taking it as a whole, forestry will become a bigger problem than the question of lands. <Col N="660" /> We cannot divide land for ever, but we can keep planting trees for ever because, so often as timber is felled, so often will timber be replanted.</P>
    <P>One of the problem directly related to this important Estimate is that of the minimum acreage of timber.  I do not agree that land comprising as much as 40, 50 or 60 acres should be allowed to lie undeveloped and used for nothing, not even for sheep rearing.  It is no argument to say that because the acreage is small it should not be utilised.</P>
    <P>One of the problem in regard to afforestation in this country is the fact that the forestry section is located in Dublin City.  We have heard a great deal of talk about the decentralisation of industry and the decentralisation of certain Government Departments.  I consider that the forestry division should be moved to a rural area.  I do not for a moment suggest that the officials are not looking after the problem but I feel that the sooner the section is located in a rural area the sooner they will find the problems which directly concern them.</P>
    <P>It may be said that, because of financial difficulty, the plantation of 50 or 60 acres would not pay.  Would it not be possible for a Minister in charge of this very important section to arrange some system whereby there would be much greater co-operation between the various committees of agriculture?  I fail to understand why it is that even in South Cork&mdash;my own direct concern&mdash;and in other parts of West Cork which I travel, there are to be seen 40, 50, and 60 acres of land with the roots of old trees cut some years ago, briars and bushes of every description showing.  Why is it, I ask myself, that these so-called small acreages were planted originally and why is it that the country's economy then was so different from what it is now?  I believe that the sense of economy at that time was much more in keeping with the policy of afforestation than is ours at present.</P>
    <P>I was interested in a particular area before the present Minister took office, an area which was under timber many years ago.  When I raised the matter with the Minister concerned, the reply <Col N="661" /> I got&mdash;a reply which he believed to be correct and accurate&mdash;was that the soil in that locality was not fit for growing trees, although, strangely enough, the whole area at one time was under timber.  We know that, in that long gone by period, there were not available the advantages of soil testing and the various types of timber for planting that are supposed to be available to us at present.  We have advantages which were unknown to the people in those days, but we are not utilising the advantages which are ours for the taking.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am approaching this Estimate totally devoid of any desire to criticise one Minister or another&mdash;there is very little difference in the Estimate presented each year&mdash; but the difficulty I see is that, first, we are apparently forgetting the very important effect on our climate which would undoubtedly flow from the utilisation of these small acreages and, secondly, the very important effect on another problem which is noticeable in many parts of rural Ireland from time to time, unemployment.  In many areas, workers have only two choices&mdash; employment with a farmer or employment with a local authority on the roads.  Yet, just inside these roadways in many of these areas, there as tracts of land which, if we are prepared to tackle the problem as we should tackle it, would provide opportunities to put these men working.</P>
    <P>Are we afraid to do so?  Are we satisfied with the statements of experts who tell us that we should go into hundreds of acres as a minimum?  Are we satisfied that that is the policy which will be of advantage to the country?  We have in this country, small as it is, people as well endowed with brains as are to be found in any country, and if we had less dependence on experts from other countries and more dependence on our own initiative and ability to get over problems which confront us, we would be doing a better day's work for the country than we are doing.  The land in many of these areas is undoubtedly waste land.  It will not be utilised under the land rehabilitation scheme and it is not being used at present even for sheep raising. It is, in its own way, a wilderness, and <Col N="662" /> apparently we are satisfied, no matter what Government or Minister is in power, to let these pockets of land become worse year after year.  Even from the point of view of valuation, the improved value of these holdings, if they were under timber rather than covered with the stumps of old trees, furze and briars, would be of advantage to the country.</P>
    <P>There is not much use in going into detail on this Estimate.  I believe that every member who has spoken is interested in the subject, as I believe the Minister and his officials, as well as the former Minister, are also, but we are up against a stone wall because we are following an outmoded, outdated pattern in regard to afforestation, and the sooner we are prepared to admit our own failures, the more quickly will we get on to the road of preparing a policy which will show in the years to come the advantages of a bold Irish viewpoint.  If we face that problem, if we do not leave to others coming after us the work we should be doing ourselves, we will be doing a good day's work for the country, and, as Deputy MacEoin mentioned, for the people of the rural areas.  When we speak of unemployment we realise that in cities and large towns the problem is undoubtedly an industrial one, but in rural areas, where very often men have no opportunity other than that presented by farm work or road work, there is an alternative.  Are we going to take advantage of it?</P>
    <P>I went into more detail last year, but there is no good in doing so now in relation to policy, when it seems that that policy is not so geared as to bring within its ambit even criticisms of a constructive nature designed to help that policy.  That is why I believe that people in rural Ireland are not satisfied that this Minister and Government, any more than the Governments of the past 30 years, are prepared to tackle this big problem.  Let us realise that the time has gone when we can blame a foreign Government for all our ills.  We have had 30 years to remedy some of these ills and yet the percentage of land going under timber year after year is nothing compared with what it should be.  While I appreciate what the Minister is endeavouring to do under this <Col N="663" /> Estimate the fact is that forestry is looked upon as a sort of foster child of the Department of Lands and, secondly, we appear to be wedded to a policy in relation to afforestation detrimental to the interests of the people here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Desmond I believe that dealing with afforestation in a detailed manner here is simply a waste of time.  Over the past 30 years Deputies have put forward before the various Governments the reasons why we should embark on a vast afforestation programme. In spite of the advice given to different Governments by both sides of this House we find to-day that very little advance has been made in an effort to tackle this problem over the last 30 years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond pointed out that there is no use talking now about the massacre of our trees under a British régime during the past century.  That excuse can no longer hold water since we have had 30 years in which to make some attempt towards developing a policy of our own in relation to afforestation.  If the various Governments had implemented a policy aimed at giving us 25,000 acres of planted land per year we would have to-day 1,750,000 acres of land under trees.  That would be a worth-while achievement.</P>
      <P>I was not here when the Minister made his opening statement, but I am sure that, like his predecessor, and his predecessor before him, he gave the usual pat on the back to his Department and another pat on the back to himself because of the great work that is being done for this poor relation of the Department of Lands. Without wishing to be personal, instead of a pat on the back I would like to administer a good thump not alone to the present Minister but to his predecessors over the last 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is wrong that we cannot get a proper approach to this problem? Everyone is agreed that afforestation is a tremendous asset.  The Minister may be quite anxious to go ahead more rapidly.  I can see the Minister, like his predecessor, going into a Cabinet meeting, having purchased all the necessary land, obtained the wire <Col N="664" /> for fencing and the labour and putting up an estimate there to the Minister for Finance for the purpose of embarking on a programme of afforestation. I think we all know the answer: the Minister would be thrown out on his ear.</P>
    <P>We must remember that an afforestation programme has no great attraction in itself for a political Party or a Government.  There is no kudos to be gained from embarking on a large-scale afforestation programme for the return from such a programme will not come for at least 20 to 25 years and no political Party will plan its programme on a basis of 25 years ahead. We can see that outlook to-day in every Department of State.  Look at Bord na Móna.  That body is closing down in the country production section because it has failed to make a profit in the last four or five years.  It is closing down despite the fact that first-class employment was provided through its activities.</P>
    <P>What can we expect then in relation to afforestation where there will be no commercial return for at least 15 years?  That is one of the real reasons why a large-scale afforestation programme has never been embarked on. The fruits of such a programme will not be reaped for many years.  Such a programme takes great courage and perseverance, backed by finance, on the part of any administration.  I know that I am wasting my time talking to this administration just as I wasted my time talking to the last administration.  It has been suggested that there is difficulty in obtaining land and the moment the Forestry Branch comes up against difficulty in obtaining land they sit back and utilise that as an excuse for doing nothing. There are others who blame the small farmer with a bit of mountain grazing because he is not more co-operative in offering his land to the Forestry Branch at £4 or £5 per acre.  That bit of land to the small farmer, be he in West Cork or in the West of Ireland, is more precious than is the 300 or 500 acre ranch to the farmer in Meath. Possibly the small farmer in the West of Ireland has squeezed out an existence and reared seven or eight children on that miserable holding.  It <Col N="665" /> is all he has but it represents his wealth and he is entitled to first-class compensation, not on the basis of what the land is worth commercially but on the basis of what it represents to him as a livelihood.  We must appreciate the terrible wrench it is to the small farmer to part with even an acre or half an acre of his miserable holding.</P>
    <P>I do not approve of this idea of getting cheap land for afforestation.  I do not approve of offering only the bare minimum to the small farmer in the West of Ireland, telling him that he will have a good return later on. The point is that when that man parts with his bit of land for afforestation he gives up all his rights and the land becomes the property of the Forestry Branch.  The only thing that may happen after that is that the small farmer may get six months' work in the year for the planting or the drainage of that land.  He may be lucky enough to get work for his sons for a few years on maintenance.</P>
    <P>We will have to change our tactics with regard to the acquisition of land. I do not think that the excuse that it is so difficult to obtain land should be accepted much longer in this House by Deputies.  Deputy Desmond mentioned that the Forestry Section was only a junior section in the whole Department of Lands.  He is right.  Everywhere we have the Land Commission functioning there is a dead hand over everything. When they are allowed to put their paws on forestry, the dead hand will be there too.  If you are to go ahead with forestry there should be a separate Minister and Department set up completely free from the tentacles of the Land Commission.  They should be free to pursue their own policy in connection with acquisition, if necessary. There should be no need for reference back to another headquarters to see whether they can go ahead or not.</P>
    <P>In the immediate future, perhaps, the Minister might do something about this.  Wherever there are rural areas suitable for planting purposes, I think it would be possible to get local committees who would co-operate with the Forestry Branch in making land available. I have come across difficulties <Col N="666" /> myself in recent months where many local people with progressive ideas and views were anxious to have afforestation work but the trouble about it was that they knew very little about afforestation themselves.  Consequently, when it came to explaining to various landowners the benefits that would accrue in the locality if they were willing to give land to the Forestry Department, those progressive-minded individuals were at a loss to explain the advantages and so forth.  I should like if the Minister would in the near future have some attractive pamphlet printed setting forth the advantages of afforestation throughout the country. These pamphlets or any type of literature that his Department would advise him on would be given to local committees and would be of immense advantage in making the people more conscious of the value of afforestation.</P>
    <P>I know that up to the present this type of literature is not available because I myself tried on a number of occasions to get literature from the Department.  I could not get any printed directly by the Department. Pamphlets were given to me that were issued by Trees Associated and so forth but I could get nothing which was made available directly by the Department that would attract people towards the afforestation programme.  That is one of the points that I want the Minister to look up.</P>
    <P>The other point concerns the West of Ireland generally.  From the figures issued recently for planting work over the last number of years it is quite evident that the areas in the West of Ireland are not getting their fair share. Add up the acreage in each county and the number of forestry centres established in the West and it will be seen that the West is being neglected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that we have been listening to these statements for years without any improvement being effected, you could hardly expect me to come in and listen to a repetition of what went on in the years before.  I will come in here when I feel like it. It is no pleasure to listen to the Minister at any time.  The West of Ireland has been neglected and I challenge the Minister to contradict me on that.  I refer to the five counties of Connaught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the holdings in Connaught are very small and that the land is poor.  There are tremendous areas of cut away bog and big mountainy areas all of which are ideally suitable for afforestation.  Other Deputies have mentioned the new face that could be put on the countryside through afforestation.  Again, I think the whole thing comes back to a question of money.  A man said to me recently that money and men could do anything.  As far as afforestation is concerned we have the men and we have the land.  What we want is the money and there could be a first-class programme undertaken.  Deputy Desmond mentioned a point that should be of interest.  He said that afforestation would provide employment in the rural areas but there is another aspect. Every member of the Labour Party or of a trade union has responsibility with regard to the furthering of the afforestation programme.  One of the duties of any trade union is to see that industrial work is made available for those living <Col N="668" /> in towns and elsewhere.  If we had embarked 30 years ago on an afforestation programme, the industrial sidelines would be there to-day.  I am only just touching on this matter but there is no limit to the number of commodites that are made to-day out of timber.</P>
    <P>We import articles that are made from timber elsewhere and the manufacture of these commodities gives first-class employment in the countries from which we import these goods.  All these goods could be made here. Factories produce innumerable articles that are made from timber.  Consequently, I do not think there is any greater means at the disposal of the Government for solving the unemployment problem and providing wealth for the country than a big afforestation programme.  Neither the present setup nor any other Government that may replace them will be able to do anything about the matter until steps are taken on a financial line.  One of the difficulties facing any Government here that is keen on developing and expanding our resources is the cost of money. When it is as high as it is to-day and when a Government have to wait 20 or 25 years before getting a return from it, naturally enough they are going to shy away from embarking on such a programme.  Our duty is to try, by expressing our views in this House, and persuade different Governments that it is their duty to go ahead with these programmes.</P>
    <P>I often wonder why, in the last 30 years, this question has not been brought more forcibly home to the Governments we have had.  Again, I think it all goes back to the question of public opinion, and that one of the things that is clearly absent both in our towns and throughout the country is a lack of appreciation of the value of forestry.  I think that if the general public fully realised the benefits that would accrue, both in the rural areas and in the towns, as a result of a big afforestation programme, they would force their various Parties, whatever their political views might be, to adopt an attractive afforestation programme. If one of the major political Parties was forced by the public to adopt a big afforestation programme, it would mean that, in a short time, <Col N="669" /> the other Opposition Parties would have to come up to scratch, because, as far as the political Parties are concerned on matters like this it would then become a question of competition between them as to which could offer the most attractive programme.</P>
    <P>That, I believe, is what we have to get into the public mind, a feeling as to the value of afforestation.  If we can do that, then I think there is a hope for those who have spoken in this House on this question of afforestation for many years past that some day they will see their dream realised in so far as that, at least, 20 per cent. of our land which is suitable for afforestation will be clothed in timber.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to learn that the Minister's statement was an extensive and useful survey of afforestation: that, even if it was not encouraging, at least it was useful in so far as it was detailed.  I regret to see from the Estimate that this year it is not proposed to carry on a vigorous programme of afforestation.  Instead, it seems to be one of marking time.  The reason why I am making a comment on that aspect of the Minister's statement is that when the inter-Party Government were in office, increased the afforestation programme and made a better attempt to carry out a bigger programme during their years, we had considerable criticism from the members on the Fianna Fáil Benches because our programme was not a larger and more expansive one.  We find in the Minister's statement to-day that his programme is one of more or less marking time on the programme of recent years.</P>
      <P>I note that there are only 119 forests in the country at the moment, in spite of the fact that we have such a large acreage of barren land which is particularly suitable for forestry.  When we examine the long-term value of afforestation, we must take into consideration the fact that the cost of production, that is in relation to the value of the materials produced from timber, is relatively low.  Therefore, afforestation is a good long-term investment, and no Government should be afraid to invest money in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to hear Deputy McQuillan speak of the difficulties <Col N="670" /> which confront some people with a small acreage of land when it is proposed to take land from them in order to establish forests.  I have very much sympathy with the view expressed by him.  In that connection, I should like to mention some cases that have come to my knowledge where, when a small acreage of land on a mountainside suitable for forestry was offered to the Forestry Department, it was declined by it on the grounds that the parcels offered were considered to be too small.  I consider that every acre of land which is offered for forestry, and that can be obtained at a reasonable price, should be accepted and planted. Obviously, when it is offered by the owners it is not, in many cases, considered to be arable land and, therefore, should be considered suitable for afforestation.</P>
    <P>We learned from our geography books the value of forestry to a country.  We know how our climate would be improved if we had a relatively large number of forests.  Unfortunately, our land, both good and bad land, is completely bare, with the exception of a few areas.  One can look across a whole countryside and not see a tree.  That fact is remarkable, particularly in areas which would be most suitable for forestry, such as the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I feel myself that we must adopt a new attitude towards the question of forestry.  I say that because if we continue with such a programme as we had outlined here to-day, or such a one as has been reported on here for the last year or two, we are not going to solve the question of providing a proper scheme of afforestation for the country.  We can appreciate the real value of forests when we realise that millions of pounds are spent by this country on the thousands of tons of newsprint which we have to import from other countries.  There has been a remarkable increase in the cost of this newsprint in recent years.  Many reasons are advanced as an explanation for that.  One relates to currency, but, whatever the reason, the cost of paper in the form of the newsprint that we require, and of the other classes of paper that it is necessary for us to import, has advanced considerably.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> We are in a position to produce our full requirements of paper pulp from our forests if we go properly about it. If we do that, we will then be in a position to save the millions of pounds which we are spending at the moment on the thousands of tons of paper that we have to import.  The proprietors of our daily papers find it necessary to look to foreign countries to get the newsprint they require.  When we consider the amount of paper of all kinds that is used here we can see that it would be a very good investment for us to expand our forests as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P>In 1948 we embarked on a vigorous building programme.  Something like 30,000 houses or more, perhaps, have been completed since then.  We were in a situation in which we had not sufficient timber and we had to import a very great part of the timber for the building of our own houses.  We also, of course, had to import cement because we were not producing our full requirements at home, but we have reached a stage when we are in a position to produce our full requirements of timber and with such a large portion of land which is not suitable for cultivation we could, in fact, produce more timber than we require and manufacture here various materials from wood pulp in these factories.</P>
    <P>Other countries are producing more timber and wood pulp than they require.  We are taking advantage of that situation and importing some of that surplus from them in the form of newsprint and in the form of timber for building and timber in connection with our other programmes, such as electrification and telephone poles for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is an unfortunate fact that it is necessary for us in our nation building efforts to go outside this country in order to obtain those basic materials.  We could also have here cardboard making and box making.  Owing to the absence of wood pulp the only kind of cardboard making and box making open to us is in connection with that compressed material made from wheaten and oaten straw.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> Being a member of Dublin County Council I was surprised when I found that it was necessary for them to purchase trees in order to plant them along the various roads.  I feel that the Forestry Department ought to provide the trees free or at least as near as possible to the cost of production for these local authorities who need to plant them.  Dublin County Council planted at least 10,000 trees during last spring, and they intend next year to plant a similar number.  In that way Dublin County Council, at least, is contributing in some measure to the growing of trees on waste spaces.  It is very desirable that, when these waste spaces cannot be used in any other way, they should be used for the growing of ornamental trees or trees that are useful.  This type of capital investment would be a very valuable part of our economy.  I know it is a long-term programme, but when we have to wait a long time for the fruits of our labours in relation to forestry we ought to make sure that there will be an abundance of fruits when the time comes.  We may have to wait 30 or 40 years for the results of our work to materialise, but when there is only a small or a relatively small acreage being planted each year, in 40 or 50 years' time it will not be a case of replanting the trees we will be cutting down but we will still be planting the unproductive and barren land that is available at the present time for the growing of timber.  We should take advantage of it now so that in 40 years' time instead of having extra land on which to grow this timber we will be able to grow trees to replace those which we will be cutting down.</P>
    <P>The extension of forestry will bring to this country very great advantages, and it is unfortunate that we have to wait for so long for them.  If this Government does not act on the detailed survey which we had to-day, it will be the basis for a future Government to act on in pursuing a very vigorous programme of afforestation, realising that this is one thing which we should not approach slowly because if we do we will not be taking time by the forelock which we would be doing if we proceeded now with an extensive programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> I am not going to comment on the details; I merely want to comment in a general way on this subject because I consider that until we make up our minds to depart from the programme which can only be described as uniform progress, we are only acknowledging the value of forestry and not doing anything about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that since the Minister assumed office some two years ago, he has not retarded the progress brought about by his predecessor, Deputy Blowick.  Whatever may be said about the Party I represent, namely, Clann na Talmhan, I may say that on our entry into this House in 1943 we focused the attention of the members on the need for a Forestry Department.  Admittedly although we focused the attention of the House on this question, the progress was nil with the exception of that which we brought about in the years 1949 and 1950 arising out of the change of Government and the taking over of the Department of Lands by Deputy Blowick.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of my maiden speech in the House in 1943, I referred to the need for a Forestry Department.  I was abruptly interrupted on that occasion by the Taoiseach who reminded me that there was a Department; he was later contradicted by Deputy Dillon who told him that there was a section within the Department of Lands which dealt with the fostering and care of forestry.  That is the position to-day and forestry is the Cinderella of the Department of Lands.  As Deputy McQuillan has said it is treated as a foster child and it is not getting the attention it would get if there was a separate Department.  In advocating the establishment of a Department I realise that it would mean extra cost.  Therefore, while I would like to see it I would be pleased for the time being if a parliamentary secretary were appointed who would deal with that particular section of the Department and who would give his whole time to the care and development of forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of his contribution this evening, Deputy McQuillan was corrected by the Minister, who said that the West of Ireland was not <Col N="674" /> neglected as regards forestry development. I think the Minister said that more than half the forestry units were situated in the West of Ireland.  The Minister will appreciate that when Deputy McQuillan or any other Deputy coming from the West of Ireland speaks about it, he is referring to the five counties of Connaught.  Looking up the report as furnished, I note that there are only 21 units within the five counties of Connaught.</P>

      <P>The West of Ireland is neglected.  There is considerable scope there for activity, development and acquisition.  The Minister would agree with me that if there is anything capable of giving employment in the West of Ireland it is afforestation. Until we adopt a more progressive outlook in relation to the development of that industry, we will not make very much headway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard the Minister for Agriculture and other speakers telling us that the tourist industry would take second place to agriculture.  The importance of agriculture is not questioned. We know that it is the industry. I suggest that forestry, if properly developed and cared for, should come next to it in importance.  No interest was taken in it over the years <Col N="675" /> until we came into the House and in speech after speech tried to bring home to the then Minister the importance of the acquisition and preparation of land and the planting of waste land.  The Minister was bred, born and reared in County Mayo.  He is not that long out of it to have forgotten that there are large tracts of land that could be developed.  Coming from Westport, he knows all about Louisburgh, Mulranny and Belmullet.  He knows them better than I do because I am as near to Dublin as I am to that part of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I entitled to suggest that we should acquire more land for forestry under this heading?  I think I am in order in bringing home to the Minister <Col N="676" /> the importance of developing forestry. I feel I am in order in bringing home to the Minister that there are in Mayo acres of land that could be acquired and in reminding the Minister that he is not that long out of the county to have forgotten that that is so.  I think I am relevant in advocating the acquisition of that land.  I am prepared to resume my seat but I am convinced, judging by the Department of Lands and the Minister and his predecessors over the past 30 years, that they have no interest at all in the development of forestry.  That is why I am trying to impress upon him to-night the importance of forestry.</P>
      <P>In Mayo particularly there are acres of land.  The Minister is aware, as a result of his travels, that from Ballaghadereen to Charlestown there are acres of land which the tenants are prepared to give.  You do not have to bring them into the acquisition court.  There are 300 acres that they are prepared to hand over.  I mentioned that last year.  It will be found in the records of the House.  I wonder did the officials do anything about it? Nothing has been done to see if it could be acquired, developed or planted with a view to providing employment and creating prosperity for the future generation.</P>
      <P>Am I to take Deputy Kennedy's remarks as indicating the policy of the Party opposite?  When on this side of the House, during the administration of the inter-Party Government, he tried to convey that it is only the best arable land that can be and ought to be used for forestry.  If that is the view of the Government and that Party, we can well understand that the West of Ireland will be neglected because the farmers in the West, having only a very small proportion of arable land, are not prepared to part with it.  They are prepared to part with a large tract of mountainy land and land that is not fit for grazing or cultivation.  That land can be acquired by a little effort on the part of the Minister's officials or acquisition inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in the case of the building up of a mercantile marine and shipping accommodation, the war, apart from <Col N="677" /> anything that was said by us on this side of the House, helped to bring home to the Government of the day the necessity for having in this country the raw material represented by forests.  Prior to the war we did not hear anything about the building up of a merchant fleet.  It was only when we realised that we would be helpless that efforts were made.  Gradually, shipping accommodation has been provided and a mercantile marine has been built up.  During the war years timber was scarce and hard to procure. If at the very beginning of the establishment of this State forestry had been developed the trees would have reached maturity and would have been ready for felling during the war.  The timber could have been sent to the saw mills and prepared for all sorts of building purposes.  Timber can be used for a variety of purposes apart from building and furniture making. With the development of science, a number of factories could be established to use the raw material of that industry.  As Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Desmond said, we cannot blame the British Government or any other Government.  We have here a State that is 30 years old.  We find that there are only a few thousand acres yet planted and there is not one of these, I may say, that we have fully utilised.  It is only for the past ten or 15 years that any effort was made and it is only within the last few years that a little &ldquo;jizz&rdquo; was put into the development of that particular industry.</P>
    <P>When we get up and speak like this we may develop a certain amount of heat, but we are entitled to develop a certain amount of heat, and we are entitled to try to bring home to the Minister that he cannot just carry on in a carefree manner, &ldquo;come day, go day, God send Sunday&rdquo;.  We expect that hard work and energy and effort will be put into it and that thousands, not hundreds, of acres will be developed year in and year out.  I am sure that if the speed which was initiated and started by the inter-Party Government and by Deputy Blowick as head of the Department of <Col N="678" /> Lands is continued and increased, in years to come we will have a substantial acreage under forestry.</P>
    <P>I think the report sets out here that there is something like 1,120,000 acres of land in the country which would be suitable for afforestation if acquired. I am prepared to agree that it is not easy perhaps to acquire certain lands. You may have certain problems, certain difficulties with the owner, but there is land that can be acquired very simply and easily if the importance of it is brought home to the owner, and the benefit which would accrue if he would only hand it over.  Although it sets out in this the amount of 1,120,000 acres I am convinced that there is much more, that there is up to 3,000,000 acres suitable for afforestation in this country; but even accepting what the report says here, 1,120,000 acres, if we had even all that planted it would be well, but we are far from it, and at the rate we are going on there will not be many of us alive by the time they have planted 1,120,000 acres.  We will be very old men at the rate they are moving.  So with that view in mind, and recognising that fact, we feel that the Minister ought to get a move on because we hold him responsible for directing his officers and directing the policy and seeing that the job is done and taking an interest in it, moving around and getting his inspectors to have it brought home to the people by more lectures.  I think it would be well that the wireless would be used. We have a talk on agriculture fairly often on the wireless and we should have a talk on forestry once in a while, I do not say as often as on agriculture but once in a while.</P>
    <P>Many sections of the community will remember the losses we sustained during the war when we had not the essential raw material and thousands of men had to leave employment who were craftsmen of the best type, and many of them had to go out of the country, and we had not the ships to bring in timber from Norway or Sweden or any of those countries where timber was available.  We learned in the war the necessity of ships and the necessity for forestry. We would never have learned it but <Col N="679" /> for the position we were put into by the war conditions.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to detain the House longer.  I did not know that this Estimate was on and I did not come in here prepared for it.  I have come up from the country after a trip of 140 miles and I thought I could not let it pass without making these points, which I hope may have some good effect.  I hope by the end of the year we will be able to see something more than has been done during the past year.</P>

      <P>It seems that most of the Deputies from the West of Ireland have a bee in their bonnet as far as forestry is concerned.  I think they are right, because there is hardly a part of Ireland where it could be expanded so rapidly and readily.  But as far as my constituency is concerned, I am satisfied that the Forestry Department have hardly entered into my county at all.  I do not know why it is, and certainly I could be very critical, but I am not going to be too critical, because I see that the Land Commission have a policy on a very big scale in the area of dividing land up and putting people on it and we cannot have trees and people on the land at the one time.  First things first.  I am satisfied that there are a fair number of areas in County Meath that could be planted and so be of enormous benefit both from the point of view of employment and scenic beauty and also from the point of view of climate.  I do not see why the Land Commission have not entered long ago on this cutaway bogland, and I could be critical of the Forestry Department for the manner in which they allowed the vast enormous estates in the Midlands to be cut away over the last 40 years&mdash;in fact from 1912 to, I think, 1953&mdash;and letting them be cut away wholesale.  I do not see that the Land Commission or the Forestry Department have enforced the rules saying that these people should plant three trees for every one they cut.  Why should they not do it?  Many of these vast estates were among the most beautiful landscapes you could see but vast quantities were cut away and a jungle was allowed to grow up so that now <Col N="680" /> there is nothing but briar and scrub-wood, and no effort was made by the Department to see this scrub-wood cleared away and replaced by good forests.  I will be critical in that case because I believe that if a man takes on obligations he should fulfil them. I am certainly satisfied that in such areas of the country the people may slide over the replanting.  Some of the officials of the Forestry Department came down to inspect it, and saw it perhaps once or twice, then went away and never saw it again.  If they came down ten years later they would find some little trees there or perhaps even a wilderness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be some care taken by the Forestry Department, especially where man got enormous sums of money in the sale of timber from the lands in my county&mdash;got huge fortunes out of the timber over the course of a few years and got away with that swag. I think there was an obligation on them to replant as the nation demanded, and it is in that sense that I am more or less critical of the Department that they did not keep their eye on the business as they should have to see that we were not being denuded of the timber the nation needs.  All over the Midlands it is more or less like a vast prairie, and we know that in the early stages some 100 years ago these lands were planted maybe by foreigners and became almost a semi-heaven planted by these rich gentry.  We had in our lifetime some of the most beautiful scenery to be seen, this country in these vast domains.  These are things that do not continue for ever, and I am glad to see these vast domains are slowly but surely being broken up and people coming back and being planted where years ago their ancestors were driven to hell or to Connaught.  I am satisfied that there are many of them there still and after all the huge sums they got from the sale of timber of different types on these vast estates it is only right that we should see that they fulfil their obligations, especially when we realise that some small farmers who were perhaps cutting a few trees were very carefully watched by the Forestry Department to see that they fulfilled their obligations.  The <Col N="681" /> Department were down right on top of them, but I do not see that they were doing anything in the case of these vast landholders to ensure that they would fulfil their obligations.  I do not see why they should be so severe with the unfortunate small farmer with a few scraggly trees of that type along the road, and when they see to it that he replants there should be care with the big estates.</P>
    <P>I am certainly satisfied also that the Land Commission are to blame.  I do not live very far away from lands which were taken over by the Land Commission 20 years ago and they cut all the valuable timber or allowed it to be cut and allowed those large areas of land to be left there as a wilderness.  There are now more or less stretches of prairie land, with whin bushes of all types, briars, furze and all that dirt in the country allowed to grow, and the fences were not looked after.  If they only gave these cutaway lands to some small farmers all this waste could be cleared away and turned into plantation land or into forestry again.  They were allowed to remain in that way.  Perhaps at some future date the Land Commission will have to take over and replant them, but over the last 15 or 20 years they were allowed to grow as wild as they are.  It will cost thousands of pounds to get this land cut away again and into shape for replanting.  It is a national waste and a loss of money, and there should be an investigation into it.  I do not believe the people will stand for it.</P>

      <P>I will mention them to the Minister himself.  I can give them to him in writing.  I am not blaming the Forestry Department but the Land Commission for not handing over the lands some ten or 20 years ago to the Department of Forestry to cut away and replant them.</P>

      <P>I will give it to the <Col N="682" /> Minister.  There is Coole, Garradice, Kilcock, County Meath, where there is anything from 50 to 100 acres which is a disgrace to the nation and to the Land Commission, which should have been cut away and replanted long ago. If only the Land Commission would do no more than sell it to the local authorities and cottage tenants who are crying out for firewood, if they would let people cut it away and take it for firewood, it would do an enormous amount of good.  Unfortunately, the wretch who would cut a bough off a tree finds himself in court, as the Land Commission is following him helter-skelter.  These are things I see with my own two eyes and I am not afraid to mention names. I hope that from now on immediate action will be taken, that these belts of forestry land which have been left there as a jungle by the Land Commission will be taken over and replanted with the utmost speed, in the interests of the nation and in the interests of good economy.</P>
      <P>The Forestry Department, as far as I know it, has done and is doing good work.  I do not expect the Department to replant the country overnight. There is only a certain amount of money at its disposal and as we as a nation have not got what one would call real control of our money, we cannot direct it as we would like.  If we could, we would certainly make more progress.  During the by-election in Wicklow I travelled through most of that county and was happy to see the work done by the Forestry Department, of which the nation can be proud.  I saw the care and attention given and the amount of labour and work put into these lovely forestry belts of which the country can be proud.  I hope the Department will be able to get more money to speed up its work.  There is no use in being critical because they are not replanting the whole country overnight.  They are doing good work with the money at their disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The private individual could do far more.  In the areas from where I come, the Midlands, there are too many old banks, ditches and dykes which should be cleared away under the land reclamation scheme, the Dillon scheme. Each farmer should put up a small <Col N="683" /> forestry belt, or two or three of them, whether his farm is economic or uneconomic. That would tend to give the Department a good shove on also. There could be an enormous amount of private enterprise in the replanting of the country.  There is hardly a farmer's holding which could not have a lovely forestry belt without taking away one acre of arable land.  Every one of us has anything from one to four acres of land which is of very little use.  Every one of us badly needs forestry belts for stock and for farm buildings.  If this question were taken up properly by the nation, perhaps, as some said, by broadcasts, or by the local agricultural committees, we should be able to make a change in the face of the country in a very short time.  There is not a farmer but could without a bit of trouble, without a shilling from any Department, put down 500 trees, either larch or fir, at little expense.  I have done it myself, not because I was a wealthy man but because I believe in making my places happy looking and nice and as attractive as I can.  What the like of me can do every other farmer in the Midlands should be able to do.  If there were more private enterprise in the replanting drive, we would get somewhere The Department can do a fair amount, but the private individual can do an enormous amount.</P>
    <P>Then there are those old trees along the country roads, some up to 100 and 150 years of age, an ugly type, old elm and ash.  They should be taken out, as well as the high hedges, so that the people could see across the countryside where every mile or half mile there would be new shelter belts springing up around the happy homes of contented farmers, men working with a will.  These things are important, and we must get going on them. All I see at present is everyone trying to get something from the Land Commission or the Department of Agriculture for nothing.  Everyone says there must be a grant.  If there is any farmer who could not spend £5 now and again in buying a few trees, fruit trees or forestry trees, and planting them himself for his needs with his own money, he is not worth a damn. There is too much of this turning to <Col N="684" /> the State for everything.  That is what is piling up taxation and what has the State with such a heavy debt loaded on us.  Lots of work could be done in planting land, and it would mean more work for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>There are too many men getting away with it at present.  I know men who got from £5,000 to £8,000 off their property for timber over the last 30 years, but if you walk through many of those big estates you see no shelter belts springing up.  They are not there.  How did these people get away with it?  Every one of them should be marched into court, the same as the poor devil who cut six or 12 trees. Where did they put those belts?  They were asked to plant three trees for every one cut down.  Where did they plant them?  As far as I can see, they were not planted.  Many who did make a little attempt made only a poor attempt.  I ask the Department to see that where regulations are made they are applied to everyone.</P>
    <P>Good national work has been done by the Department and if it is kept up over the next 20 years we will be making good ground in the replanting and we will be making up for the enormous amount of timber cut during the two world wars.  The West of Ireland is a problem and those who come from the West can be and should be critical.  It is from the West that we have the drain of our able manhood.  Forestry development is one way of giving good employment, starting new industries in country areas and assisting in the decentralisation of industry.  If a fair amount of timber were planted in the next 30 or 40 years, there would be a vast amount of different types of industry all over the country and we would be in a happy position, keeping our people at home in the country areas.  However, there are other days to come yet and more money to be spent.  I believe the Forestry Department is learning lessons day after day. It is hard work, concentrated work and work that you cannot rush into.  The clearance of old demesnes and scrub land is difficult and costly work, and slow work; the bringing up of young trees there into a forestry belt is slow tedious work.  I passed through some <Col N="685" /> State forests and have seen where the work is well done and where the planting has been well carried out and the thinning properly done.  They are well fenced and vermin which cause so much destruction are kept under control. The money has been well spent and we are getting a fairly good return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Deputy Giles that the matter of replanting is not being lost sight of by any means. The matter is not quite simple because we have to go through the records of all the persons upon whom there are replanting obligations.  I warned them in my opening statement that we would have to take proceedings against them unless they took steps to fulfil their obligation.  If they have difficulties in doing so and they get in touch with the officers of the Department, we will try to meet them.  I agree that private holders of land can do a great deal.  If they take advantage of the schemes under the Department of Agriculture, from the point of view of shelter as well as from the point of view that at some time in the next 20 or 30 years the fuel situation will probably be quite different from what it is now, it will be a benefit to farmers to have timber for the various purposes for which they require it on their land.  All these reasons would indicate the benefit to farmers who take advantage of the existing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that we can expect the forestry branch to do the work which is there in looking after these 160 forests that we have, the thinning and extraction and so on, and to carry out an extensive propaganda campaign in favour of forestry.  To the extent that this annual debate brings the matter before the public, a certain amount is achieved.  But the real difficulty is that landowners are interested in agriculture more than in forestry.  It is only land that is absolutely useless for agricultural purposes that we are likely to get and that is all we are entitled to ask for.  We must depend on other agencies as well as forestry for whatever we get in the way of publicity to get a better public opinion in regard to afforestation.  But it is not true to say that it is merely <Col N="686" /> the Cinderella of the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>I am sure that if it were allied to Agriculture, it would be said that forestry was in danger of strangulation or decease at the hands of that Department where, obviously, there is a certain antagonism with regard to the use of land.  The Land Commission fulfil a useful purpose with regard to forestry in that out of the large amount of land that they acquire they are able to give a substantial amount, which they do not require for land settlement purposes, to forestry.  They save the forestry branch a lot of trouble because they have the technicians and the machinery for acquiring large areas of land.  When we acquire land primarily for forestry we have to carry out long and laborious negotiations with small farmers.  According to Deputy McQuillan, these men have their hearts so much in the land that nothing less than paying a sovereign for every square foot of land would get it.</P>
    <P>Deputies must know very well that we cannot afford to compete with other users of land.  We have to make up our minds that we can only get what is left over from agriculture and other activities and we are prepared to pay a good price for that.  If we can get a mountainy holding, if we can get land that is suitable for nursery purposes or for a better class of timber we are prepared to pay a reasonable price, but we are not able, and I do not think anybody in the House would expect us, to compete with those who can use land for agricultural purposes. We simply have to forget it.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Cafferky that we are neglecting the West of Ireland. We have a large number of centres there.  But, for the first 20 or 30 years of forestry operations, there were very few centres in the West.  I have heard it said several times in the House that very little has been done in the last 30 years.  People talk as if all the timber in this country had been felled in the first world war.  Probably most of the timber was felled 150 or 200 years ago when Irish oak was put into British ships, Westminster Hall and so on.  The country has been denuded of <Col N="687" /> timber, not for 30 years, but for hundreds of years.</P>
    <P>In the last 30 years a great deal has been accomplished in other directions. Perhaps more could and should have been done in regard to forestry, but I am glad to say that most Deputies recognise that you cannot do everything at one time.  If we are concentrating on agricultural development, electricity, and other things at the present moment and devoting our best energies to them, we perhaps cannot get quite the progress we would like with regard to forestry.  Considering that this is a 40-years programme at the very least&mdash;nobody expects the timber to be matured in less than 40 years &mdash;I think we are doing very well.</P>
    <P>We are doing what we can to give employment.  In 1951-52, I calculate that we spent about £666,000 on giving employment.  Last year we spent £733,000 on labour, and during the coming year we will spend over £900,000.  Over three-quarters of the Vote goes in the provision of employment. We have £1,200,000 altogether. That may increase; I presume it will increase, and I hope it will.  But, when you consider the other demands and that there are nearly £40,000,000 required during the present year for capital development, I do not think <Col N="688" /> that our £1,250,000 for afforestation is bad.  I hope that the figure will improve.</P>
    <P>Our chief trouble is, as in the Land Commission, that the areas which are offered to us are getting smaller, and it takes a much larger number of transactions as the years go by to bring in the same amount of land.  It is only very rarely, perhaps once in a year, that we would get 500 acres together. Deputies seem completely to forget the realities of the situation.  They ask, why can we not take these small holding of 50 or 60 acres?  Simply because it does not pay us to fence them in. They must be within a reasonable distance, within a few miles of an existing centre and, even so, except we get a rectangular block of land of some hundreds of acres, Deputies will recognise that it would not pay us to plant these places.</P>
