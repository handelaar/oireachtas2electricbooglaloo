      <P>When we adjourned last night, I had been addressing myself to what I regarded as certain legitimate criticism of the medical profession and, in particular, of their professional organisation.  That criticism was not based on any sense of antipathy to the doctors or failure to realise their services and rights as a profession. It seemed to me essential that in this debate we should try to come back to what should be the main objective of all Parties in this House and of the medical profession, the health and the physical welfare of the citizens as a whole.  It seemed to me that we should not allow ourselves to be side-tracked by assumptions made in advance that any particular scheme was to be condemned because it would seem to indicate a tendency towards progress in any particular political or social group.  I dealt with what I regarded to be intemperate and exaggerated comments made in the official document by the Irish Medical <Col N="308" /> Association in which they committed themselves to a statement which was quite clearly without foundation and on that basis condemned the scheme put forward.</P>
      <P>I am particularly anxious to be fair to the doctors and I can conceive that since 1947 they have met with difficulties in carrying on reasonable discussions with the Department of Health.  I personally believe that those discussions are not made easier by the fact that we have had doctors as Ministers for Health.  Frankly, I think that a layman is more competent to represent the community in discussions with professions in respect of matters that are largely based on professional techniques, standing and experience of various professional groups in the community.  That is only mentioned as an aside but I am concerned that in this situation and particularly in the heat of conflict, debate and interviews the doctors should be fair to themselves and should not permit a situation developing in such a way as to put them in an impossible position. Quite clearly, they are taking up an impossible attitude when they take the view that an Act passed by the Dáil will be rendered nugatory because they will not co-operate.  A much more powerful organisation than the Irish Medical Association took the same view in the United Kingdom some time ago and they found that they had to accept the verdict of the people because within their own ranks there was not unanimity, and there is not unanimity within the ranks of the Irish Medical Association in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very many doctors, young and old, experienced and highly experienced, who will place their responsibilities to the people before any official viewpoint of a professional association. Not only will they co-operate because an Act has been passed by the Dáil but because they will find within the confines of that Act, limited though the Act may be, opportunities for services to the community greater than will be available to them at present.  It is important to remember that we have many very eminent doctors&mdash;some of <Col N="309" /> them have played a leading rôle in the public controversy carried on&mdash;who have given outstanding services to the people of this country.  They have given that service under conditions where not only would they themselves not care whether it was private or public medicine but where they were not aware of their own personal position or of the income accruing to them from those services.  Their only concern was to give their best knowledge and experience to the people who were sick and required their services.  That is the reason why the medical profession will themselves realise that whatever may be in the statement at the moment in regard to lack of co-operation, time and the very force of public opinion will finally compel and induce them to take a more reasonable and sensible attitude.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on the question of State medicine I was not putting forward a point of view either for myself or the Labour Party that we conceive that the only good health scheme that can be offered to the people is a State scheme or a scheme of social medicine.  We have got no preconceived idea like that.  We want to see the best possible health scheme provided for our people within the limits of the resources of this community. We have got enough sense to understand that.  I, personally, feel that the best health scheme can in fact only be made available on a community basis because of the very developments of medical science itself, drugs, equipment and the requirements which the doctors themselves need in order to give of the best of their services.  It is as wrong for the doctors to say that they will not have a particular health scheme because it is an advance towards State medicine as it would be for the Labour Party to say that they would not have a scheme because it was not State medicine.  The test is, what is best for the people and not what the Labour Party or the doctors like.  I think a great many doctors will agree, on examining the present state of medicine in this and other countries, that if we are to give the best of that science to our people in large measure it will have to be on the basis of the resources of the State, resources <Col N="310" /> which can only be made available through the State.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in this House to the British scheme.  The one thing that is outstanding about that scheme is that all impartial observers from other countries who have gone to England in recent years, regardless of what may be their political or social outlook, have agreed on one thing, and that is that if the British Labour Government had never done anything else they did, in this British health scheme, erect a monument to their credit which has withstood all the criticism that has been directed against it. I suggest it is a bit invidious for us to question the cost of it.  The British people are not questioning the cost, and think that they are getting good value for their money.  If we were able, within our resources, to provide the same services for our people, and to make possible for sick people in this country the approach that is available in England then we might be in a better position to support our criticism in regard to so-called pagan England, and might be able to live a little closer to our own standards of Christian morality and ethics.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are individuals receiving treatment under that scheme who, in no conceivable set of circumstances, could have got that treatment from a private scheme of medicine&mdash;treatment, drugs and a human approach that are not merely capable of saving the lives of individuals but of giving them a standard of treatment that even the most wealthy people could not afford to secure under a system of private medicine.  It is noteworthy that that standard is applied not merely to British citizens but is given generously, and without stint, even to citizens of our own country who are temporarily resident there.  It seems to me that any scheme of health, whether it be a State scheme or a private scheme, which can transcend the boundaries of countries and the problem of nationalities, treating all men as human beings, has got something very fine in it.  It is something which merits the attention of the doctors in this country.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Bill at an <Col N="311" /> earlier stage, I said that from many points of view it was a poor effort. The Labour Party has indicated its attitude to it.  I would like to point out again, in reference to the doctors, the misconceptions that are being broadcast.  Only a week or two ago, a very eminent member of the medical profession, frankly, one who has had some association with the Labour Party, in the course of a statement said he deplored the fact that a sensible Party like the Labour Party were not only undermining a great profession but were destroying the middle classes.  Did anyone ever hear such fantastic nonsense spoken as that? Does not everyone realise that the Labour movement, in its broadest concepts, has done more to try and protect and sustain the middle classes against the impact of economic developments than any other section of the community?  If there is any hope for the middle classes and the professional classes, it is not going to be found in either of the two big political Parties in this House but rather in the Labour Party and in what the Labour Party stands for.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party, in its criticism of the medical profession and of the Irish Medical Association, is not making, and has not made, an unfair or an unfriendly criticism of them.  It has invited an understanding by the medical profession of this very simple fact, that if the present Bill before the House is not satisfactory it is, at any rate, as Deputy Dr. Browne has said, at least an opening of the door, and in time if that door is to be pushed open much wider, then it will be pushed by the elements in this country represented by the Labour Party.  Therefore, if the medical profession desires to see our people afforded health services which only the medical profession, in fact, can give, with the assistance of the community, then I suggest they should find ways and means of association with the elements in the community represented by the Labour Party, because the Labour Party is only too anxious to co-operate with any section that is prepared to put the well-being of the masses of the people <Col N="312" /> before any vested interest.  That offer was made before and is now made again.  It is for that reason that I have been concerned to try and make clear what I think should be the attitude of the medical profession.  It is, in fact, their responsibility, because it is the profession which they chose to enter.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on one final point, and that is the reference that I have already made to a remark that was uttered here by Deputy Dr. Browne. While expressing his satisfaction with the Bill he did indicate that it had its limitations.  He regarded it as the application of certain principles on which the Labour Party and himself are in agreement.  He expressed the hope of seeing this particular door pushed open a little wider, but Deputy Dr. Browne should also realise with the rest of his professional colleagues, that if we are going to have an advance in the provision of proper health services for our people it is going to come from the efforts of that section of our community which, in its broadest outlook, in respect of social and economic problems, is best represented by the Labour Party.  He has the problem facing him that health is not merely a question of medicine.  It is, as Deputy Morrissey quite rightly said, a question in the first instance of the economic condition of our people, and neither the Labour Party nor Deputy Dr. Browne, or indeed anybody else, can cover up mistakes in regard to basic economic issues by a correct attitude in regard to the less important question of health, social security and matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say that the basis on which rests the health of our people to-day has not the same secure foundation that it had 12 months ago.  It is correct to say that the masses of our people to-day have got greater problems to meet in regard to their ordinary daily commitments than they had 12 months ago.  I recall that, on the occasion of some of our Budget debates here last year, the point was made by us that the pursuance of that Budget policy was not only going to have social and economic repercussions in regard to trade, industry and employment <Col N="313" /> but would be felt directly at the table of working class families: that it would show itself in the form of smaller quantities of food on that table and food of poorer quality, in less clothes and cheaper clothes, and in all the concomitants that can show themselves in the lives of working-class families when their economic conditions become stringent.</P>
    <P>That has happened.  It is borne out by Deputy Dr. Browne's own statements in this House.  On the occasion when we were debating these matters he indicated that he felt the trade union movement would make good that defect.  The trade union movement is a very powerful movement but it cannot do the impossible.  It has not been able to do the impossible in the last 12 months.  The cost of living for the masses of the people has gone up by some 20 to 25 per cent.  The best that the trade unions have been able to do is to secure an increase in wages of about 10 per cent.  There has been a loss of 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is the responsibility, not merely of the Fianna Fáil Government, but of those who support them and who support their economic policies, including Deputy Dr. Browne.  We cannot pass the responsibility on to the trade unions.  It is our responsibility in this House.  The responsibility is all the greater in respect of such Deputies as Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy McQuillan, Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll and I think I can include Deputy Cowan, although he has gone so far over to Fianna Fáil that it is very difficult to distinguish them at all.  In regard to the three other Deputies, for whom I have a great deal of respect and a great deal of admiration and whom I have not criticised in public hitherto and do not propose to do so now, I want to point out that when we are dealing with health we are dealing with something that has essentially an economic basis and that it is not right to support economic policies in which you do not believe&mdash;because that is the position of these Deputies; they do not believe in the economic policies of the present Government; they cannot justify them and they feel uneasy in having to commit themselves <Col N="314" /> to support them in this House &mdash;and then feel that the ordinary people outside will overlook that very serious political error because they happen to have a correct position on a health scheme.</P>
    <P>So far as this Bill is concerned, the Labour Party has put down certain amendments.  Some of these amendments have already been ruled out of order.  Others remain on the Order Paper.  We propose to press these amendments as far as we can in this House.  We hope we will secure sufficient support, if the Minister is not prepared to accept them, to carry them by the votes in this House. Frankly, I hope that if we do it, the Government will regard that as a vote of confidence and take the necessary action.</P>
    <P>I do point out and I do warn the Deputies who may be prepared to support the Labour Party members on the Health Bill that they will be doing more than supporting these amendments because, if the amendments are carried against the will of the Government or against their votes, they will be taking what I regard as the first and most necessary step to founding a sound basis for dealing with the health of the people because until we correct present economic policies we are only playing with health problems.</P>
    <P>I personally invite these Deputies who have found themselves in many difficult positions in this House up to the moment, seriously to consider, not merely their obligation to support any steps that may be taken in this House to remedy the obvious defects in this Health Bill, but also to consider the greater obligation, that in supporting those amendments they will also be rejecting the economic policy which is creating greater health problems in this country than existed up to some 12 or 15 months ago.  That will be the biggest contribution they could make to the health of the people.</P>
    <P>I hope they will find it possible and I hope that on this occasion&mdash;because it has not happened on other occasions in this House where we have had other matters of grave concern to the ordinary working-class people&mdash;these Deputies will find it possible to go into <Col N="315" /> the Division Lobby with the Labour Party.  I hope on this occasion, despite the official viewpoint expressed by the Fine Gael Party, that they will find it possible and that, by concerted action, those sections of this House who realise that economics and health cannot be divorced will take such steps as will make the necessary changes, without waiting on the results of the by-election in Wicklow, and that we will be able to bring to an end this present situation which has been so detrimental to the health of the people generally, which has placed 90,000 of our own citizens in a position where, quite clearly, not only their economic welfare but even their health is in jeopardy, and that we will realise, if we are going to deal with health and, in the same way, if we are going to deal with other problems of social security, we must start at the bottom.  If we are not prepared to do that, we do not shoulder our responsibilities and we cannot hope to transfer them to others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended speaking on this Bill but, lest it might be thought that I am torn between two loyalties, I have made up my mind to say a few words.</P>
      <P>Had I been present on Second Reading possibly I might have found myself in the position of being torn between two loyalties, despite the fact that as far as we dispensary doctors are concerned we have Hobson's choice in this matter.  It is mandatory on us to work this Bill.  Some Deputies have said in the House that they knew of dispensary doctors who were prepared to work it.  The fact is that we have to work it whether we like it or not.</P>
      <P>Had I an opportunity of being present on Second Reading, possibly I would have been critical of a number of aspects of this measure but, in view of the fact that the Minister has conceded a number of points in dispute, I feel I must support this measure as I consider it at least a <i>via media</i> between the two extremes of thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was inevitable, in view of the many changes and reorganisation in other countries in connection with medical services, that we would eventually come up against the problem. <Col N="316" /> Although the scheme at present working in England and the Six Counties, of which I have fairly intimate knowledge, has its defects and is not altogether to the liking of people, nevertheless, I think the time has come when a reorganisation of the health services in the country is inevitable. I think this measure would provide the services that we all would desire for the people.</P>
    <P>Although I was absent from the House at the time I was rather encouraged by the unanimous passing of the Second Reading of this Bill.  I began to say to myself that there must be something more in the Bill than I and my professional colleagues thought.  Deputy Costello had been Minister for Health for a short period and during that time had consultations with the Irish Medical Association and knew their viewpoint.  I felt that if the measure had been in any way distasteful to the views expressed by the Irish Medical Association to Deputy Costello he and his Party would have resisted the Bill to the utmost.  Now I find that the Fine Gael Party have turned in their tracks in this matter, when the Bill was unanimously passed on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>Now, as I say, they have turned in their tracks and instead of conveying the impression to the people that this is going to be a beneficial <Col N="317" /> measure they have created confusion in the minds of the people as to the merits or demerits of the Bill.  Not alone the public but we doctors are becoming confused in the matter.  Apparently Fine Gael have decided they cannot oppose the Bill on its merits and have seized on that flimsy financial aspect of it with which to frighten the ratepayers out of their wits and at the same time, of course, try to achieve a spot of face saving.  Political expedience has been referred to in connection with this Bill, but surely no one can accuse Fianna Fáil of seizing on the Bill as a political expedient?  After all, we all must agree that this Bill is the natural offspring of the 1947 Act.  It would be interesting to visualise, were Fine Gael in power again, what sort of measure they would bring in.  We have never had any indication as to that in the debate.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand all the talk concerning this measure, which to all intents and purposes is law, having been unanimously approved by the House.  Everyone knows that, irrespective of whether our social services are good or bad, the cost must come out of our own pocket and we cannot expect a measure of this kind to work without entailing some expense on the community.  Although it was encouraging to note the belated and obviously prearranged anxiety or interest of the Fine Gael Party in the financial burdens of the community, I personally cannot recall any such outbreak of anxiety neurosis on their part when they were on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde quite rightly drew attention to the enormous increase in the cost of the British scheme over and above the original Estimate.  That in itself should not be a deterrent to us to go ahead with the implementation of this Bill.  Rather should we be thankful that they have had the experience first and that we are able to take a lesson from their experience.  There is no doubt about it&mdash;and I admit it&mdash; that the original estimates of the cost of a measure of this kind are never very near the mark once it gets under way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason, I say that, particularly where local authorities are concerned&mdash;and they will have a lot to do in the implementing of this measure&mdash;unusual precautions should be taken to ensure that no unnecessary expense will be entailed in connection with it.  We must also remember in this regard, when comparing the actual cost of the British scheme and the potential cost of ours, that they are two entirely different schemes.  The British scheme from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; was bound to run away with money, as fantastic demands were made on the public purse, by doctors, dentists, chemists, wig makers and others.  However, we will be able to benefit from the British sufferings.</P>
      <P>As I said, the Health Act will probably be in force and though the profession generally resent State intrusion into medicine, even to the extent visualised in this Bill, nevertheless, I think everybody will be relieved that it will mean an end to the unpleasant triangular &ldquo;cold war&rdquo; which has gone on for too long as between the Irish Medical Association, the Minister and the Church.  In this connection, by the way, the pronouncements of lay theologians both inside and outside the House have not helped in any way to smooth things over.  It is, of course, regrettable that a measure of this kind&mdash;which was destined to have far reaching beneficial effects on the health of the community and destined to revolutionise medical practice in this country&mdash;when it was being introduced and when it came to be introduced, was not conceived under happier circumstances.</P>

      <P>This is not the time to apportion the responsibility in this matter, but I also say that the present is not the time for sniping at the Irish Medical Association or the doctors. Rather should it be our objective at this juncture to pour oil on troubled waters and aim at a more flexible approach to the solution of the differences or the outstanding matters in dispute.  We doctors&mdash;at least the vast majority of us&mdash;are not an unreasonable <Col N="319" /> body.  I assert and maintain that our objections to the Bill were solely on matters of principle.  After all, if they were not on matters of principle and if, as some Deputies have enunciated, they had a monetary aspect, we could have waited until we would see what the monetary benefits were and then registered our opposition to it.</P>

      <P>While I deplore the unwarranted insinuations of some Deputies in regard to doctors, and in particular specialists, I take this opportunity to thank the many Deputies on both sides of the House for their generous tribute to the profession generally.  Specialists have obviously been the target, but let me say something in their favour.  I may be regarded as the devil's advocate in this regard, but I have had 30 years' experience in medicine&mdash;20 years in general practice in dispensary work.</P>
      <P>On no occasion during that 20 years have I ever had a complaint from a patient whom I sent to a specialist concerning the fee charged.  Not alone that, but I have had tributes paid to them for their generosity towards a number of patients in regard to fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that the life of a specialist in his particular work is not a long one.  Another thing we must remember is that before he becomes recognised as a specialist he has reached a mature age.  He has to climb a very difficult ladder to reach that position. He goes along for a few years and eventually he finds himself ousted by one of his juniors.  Concerning this question of fees, I must say I never had a complaint about them.  I have very often noticed, however, that some <Col N="320" /> people will spend their last halfpenny on a law case to keep themselves out of jail for a short time, and then will grouse at paying a reasonable fee to a doctor for keeping them alive.  They never seem to count the cost when it comes to law.</P>

      <P>I often thought I took up the wrong profession, and I am sure of it now.  Deputy MacBride referred to one of the difficulties, namely, the absence or lack of complete physical requirements to implement this measure.  There is probably something in that, but I do not think there will be all this rush for free treatment we are inclined to visualise here. We have a fair amount of accommodation available and I think it will be adequate.  I am speaking of the country hospitals and other establishments for surgical, medical or maternity work.  I do not think there will be any great increase in the admissions.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to people who cannot afford to pay medical fees. I do not agree with that at all.  I find that some of my dispensary patients are going into nursing homes in my town to have a baby, a thing, of course, which is ideal from their point of view and also ideal from my point of view.  While the accommodation and the facilities in those private nursing homes in those provincial towns are not first class, nevertheless, they perform very useful work.  I would hate to think that the implementation of this Bill would militate against the continued use of these nursing homes by these dispensary patients or people in the lower income group.  I have spoken to the Minister on this subject, and I hope he will refer to it in his reply.  I think he is agreeable that they should not be injured in any way, that the grants will be made available to them just as they will be made available to patients who go to the county hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a big number of dispensaries in a bad way.  I have a new clinic in one of my dispensaries, and I always have to wear an extra overcoat <Col N="321" /> when I go there to do my dispensary work.  That is a new clinic, mark you.  Some of them are very cold structures.  At times I have to walk on my heels, just as the patients have to walk on their heels, through the water which, through condensation, flows down the walls on to the floor.  Matters of that kind require to be seen to.  As a result of my complaint I have had space heaters installed, and it has effected a certain improvement.  Hitherto it was a menace for me to go in to do my work because all the labels on the bottles had slipped down to the floor owing to the condensation on the bottles. Progress is being made, however, in this regard, and by the time the full impact and effect of this Bill will be felt quite a lot of accommodation and new dispensaries will have been provided. In a number of cases, country dispensaries could be abolished.  With transport as it is now, I find my patients coming into my Clones dispensary rather than waiting to see me in their own dispensary.  There could be a certain amount of economy effected in that regard.  We must creep before we walk, however, and I do not think there is any need to worry as far as these requirements are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride also said&mdash;he did not say it with any note of regret&mdash; that the bulk of the money to be devoted to this measure will probably find itself in the pockets of the doctors. It is obvious that Deputy MacBride has not to depend for his living on the crumbs which fall from the table of the Department.  I suppose something extra will come our way.  In my district, for instance, there are about 130 births per year.  Of those I suppose about 40 could be regarded as in the lower income group which normally would be attended free.  Under this scheme the doctor will get £5, say, for attending such a case.  That is a matter of £200.  That will not be the perquisite of the dispensary doctor because the people will have a choice of doctor.  There are four doctors in my town and probably it will be distributed amongst them.  I will not refer to dispensary doctors because it is <Col N="322" /> altogether too personal a matter.  For years we have endeavoured to have the position of dispensary medical officers improved.  Possibly some Deputies do not think that is necessary.  Let me give the House some idea of the basic salary of a dispensary medical officer in 1946.  I am quoting from memory an advertisement that appeared in the <i>Irish Times</i> in August of that year under the heading of &ldquo;Local Appointments Commission: Wanted for Dún Laoghaire Borough Council a solicitor, part-time, salary £600 per year.&rdquo;  A staff officer for some county council at a salary of £450 or £500 per year was the next appointment and the third appointment was for a dispensary medical officer for Lifford dispensary at a salary of £250 per year rising by £5 per year to £300 per year.  That will give the House some idea of the position.  I admit we have had a 20 per cent. or a 40 per cent. increase, but those increases have been based on the already despicable and inadequate salary scales in operation.  I hope the Minister will see his way under this measure to put an end to that unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <P>As a dispensary medical officer I have the honour of being medical officer to a fever hospital containing 18 beds.  For 16 years my salary for the work I did in that fever hospital was 18/9 per week or £50 a year.  The maid in the hospital was getting £75 a year and her keep.  It has been suggested that I must have had very few cases.  Possibly it will surprise Deputies to know that my average was next highest to the county hospital average.  Under this Bill we hope that position will be rectified.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided that specialists in the teaching hospitals and so on, will, in future, receive remuneration for their work.  That is an important advance and it should go a long way towards eliminating the opposition to this measure by that particular group.  Deputy Larkin referred to the low salaries offered to young house surgeons just qualified.  He instanced the general rate of £50 per year in the county hospitals and other establishments under the control of local authorities.  That, of course, is <Col N="323" /> disgraceful and one would not offer it to a messenger boy nowadays.  That is the salary given to these young men after their unfortunate people have spent probably a couple of thousand pounds getting them educated.</P>

I have no doubt he will continue to explore every avenue in order to get the wholehearted support of the doctors for this measure which must, in particular, effect a major improvement in regard to mother and child services and ultimately in the health of the community as a whole.  That will eventually more than justify the Minister's present courageous and intelligent attitude.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to see the people in general get every facility in so far as health services are concerned.  As a member of a local authority and coming from a county with a very low average valuation I am satisfied, however, that there is no immediate demand for these services or for the cost of them which will inevitably be passed on to the ordinary ratepayers.  On the other hand, there is an urgent demand for hospital accommodation and, while this Bill will provide portion of the cost, it is the ratepayers who will have to foot the greater part of the bill.  Having paid the bill they will not in general get anything like a 50 per cent. return for the money demanded from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hospital accommodation is lacking in my county.  If the scheme now proposed is put into operation under which free hospital treatment will be available to those people with an income of up to £600 per year or with a valuation of £50 there will be an immediate big demand for such treatment.  The possibility is that the poorer sections of the community, generally those most in need of treatment, may be deprived of treatment or delayed from getting treatment <Col N="324" /> because the hospital accommodation will not be available for them.</P>
    <P>I think it is shocking that the nurses engaged in these hospitals should be compelled to live out because of lack of proper nurses' homes.  Those on day duty must go outside to sleep while those on night duty must leave the hospital in the morning and they very often have to walk a quarter of a mile or more in very inclement weather. That is a serious lack so far as accommodation and hospital buildings are concerned.</P>
    <P>The T.B. scheme, plus the allowances made available to dependents, was an admirable step forward and praise is due to those who were responsible for initiating that scheme and extending it to the point where everything possible is being done to help these people towards recovery. The allowances for dependents play an important part in relieving those who are ill of the worry of providing for those for whom it is their responsibility to make provision.  Those allowances have given new hope and new courage to people generally.  Because that security is there patients now come forward willingly for examination. Before those allowances were given patients very often hesitated to approach a doctor because they were fearful of being told from what disease they were suffering.</P>
    <P>These facilities achieved a lot.  Even so there is still a waiting list because the accommodation is not available. The beds are not there.  However, though there is a waiting list it is not as great as it was at one stage but it is far in excess of what it should be from the point of view of the immediate need for extra hospital and bed accommodation.</P>
    <P>Creagh Sanatorium is in my county. Portion of the new hospital there was erected about 20 years ago at a site about 50 or 60 yards, or perhaps a bit further, from the site of the original hospital.  I am informed that there are about 40 patients in the hospital. All the cooking has to be done about 40 or 50 or 60 yards from the hospital on the other side of the avenue and then all the food has to be brought down the avenue to the patients in the <Col N="325" /> hospital.  On several occasions we, as a local authority, asked for a grant to enable us to provide an extra building consisting of a cookhouse and a diningroom which could also be used as a recreation room by those patients who are able to walk about and are not confined to bed.  That extra building is essential and yet it has not been provided.  We have also on many occasions drawn attention to the need for suitable accommodation for nurses in different hospitals.  To my mind these matters are more urgent than this Bill, which will have such a heavy impact on the ratepayers.  The danger is that perhaps the section of the community most in need will not get the benefit when they need it most.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the present position in my county&mdash;and I know it is the same in other counties&mdash;as regards a person who requires medical and hospital and even further treatment and who cannot afford to pay for it.  Such a person can go, in the first instance, for examination to the dispensary doctor.  If the dispensary doctor decides that the patient requires hospital treatment he is sent to hospital, examined, X-rayed if necessary, and given suitable treatment.  If he is a case for treatment in the county hospital he will be sent there and if it is considered that he requires further treatment he is sent to Dublin for it.</P>

      <P>If the dispensary doctor decides that the patient requires hospital <Col N="326" /> treatment the patient, if he is a local, is taken into the county hospital. If it is considered that he requires further treatment then, through the local authority, he is sent to Dublin for that further treatment.  If that patient cannot afford to pay his expenses home he is taken back to his county and, if necessary, he is left at the door of his house after he has received full treatment in respect of his ailment.  He is not asked to pay the cost when all is completed.  I admit that he may get a bill when leaving the county hospital but, on the other hand, he may not.  I have seen bills from a local authority in respect of treatment for serious illness. The patients were attended by the dispensary doctor, got accommodation in the county hospital, were sent to Dublin for further treatment, were returned to the county hospital and later to their own home.  The bills were but a small percentage of what it would cost an ordinary individual to go through the same routine and to get the same beneficial results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that every Deputy who is or has been a member of a local authority has had experience of patients who were sent, through the local authority, for hospital treatment. If, at the end of the treatment, the patient receives a bill for £10, £15 or £20 and points out that his family circumstances are such that he is unable to pay the bill&mdash;and if the circumstances are genuine&mdash;he has not to pay a penny.  He may be a married man with four children and in receipt of 15/- or 18/- a week unemployment assistance or he may be a very poor man with a wife and young family. Then again, there are other ex-patients who, having got a bill for £20, £15 or £10, genuinely cannot afford to pay it but can pay £3, £4 or £5.  Such persons are asked to pay only that £3, £4 or £5 as the case may be.  The fact of the matter is that all that machinery is at present available for the benefit of the poor man and, in addition, the red ticket system is as good as gone.  I am a member of the local authority and I have in my possession those two books with the two types of tickets.  In my 20 years' connection with the local authority I <Col N="327" /> have no recollection of being asked for those tickets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clear up that point as far as the medical profession is concerned.  I know that any tribute that can be paid to that profession is deserved by them.  If anybody needs hospital accommodation and goes to the local dispensary doctor or even to the private doctor he is not asked has he the money nor is he going to be told the charges before he receives the necessary treatment from the doctor. The doctors are very lenient in that respect and we cannot praise too highly the medical profession for the way in which they do their work for the poorer sections of the community.</P>
      <P>It is a well-known fact that, no matter how far the distance or how late the hour, when a doctor is needed and a message is sent to him, either by phone or otherwise, he rushes off to that patient.  There is no question of what the cost will be.  There are cases in which they visit very poor persons and perhaps they have to leave their own dispensary in the middle of the night and travel up to ten miles in bad weather.  Unless the patients volunteer to pay the doctor they never get the bill and are never asked for payment. Having all this experience myself living in a county with an average valuation of under £7, I am quite safe in saying, and I know it is the feeling of this House and of the people of this House and of the people of this country, that it would be impossible to pay adequate tribute to the medical profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the question of the £600 means test, I believe it will create an immediate demand by a section that could perhaps afford to meet a big proportion of the hospital treatment that may be necessary.  That will have the effect of depriving the poorer sections of the people of the available <Col N="328" /> accommodation as far as beds are concerned. A man in recepit of £11 10s. a week, though he be a married man with a wife and four or five of a family, should be able to afford to pay a big proportion of the cost of hospital treatment that he may need from time to time.  In relation to the population of the country as a whole, it is only a small percentage who need hospital treatment.  With £11 10s. a week a person should have sufficient to meet the full cost of hospital treatment and accommodation needed.  As far as the local authority is concerned, if there is a case of a man with £10 a week with perhaps a sickly wife or a weak family, and through force of circumstances there is an immediate need for hospital treatment which is going to be costly, there is, I believe, machinery in every county that will give that man assistance by way of paying at least portion of the hospital cost.</P>
    <P>I do not approve of the provision for a contribution of £1 a year.  If it was a bigger sum, say, £4 or £5 a year, perhaps I would be more sympathetic about it, but I do not like to hear of an annual contribution of £1.</P>

      <P>As I said at the outset, there is no demand for this Bill or for this Money Resolution.  As a member of a local authority with 20 years' experience I accept full responsibility for voting against this measure.  As a result of the implementation and operation of this Bill, I can see the cost reaching a stage inside, perhaps, five years, when it will react heavily upon the ratepayers of the county.  In order to continue it in operation, the local authority will have to tax the ratepayers. People will avail in increasing numbers of the provision in relation to the means test of £600 a year and in relation to the £50 valuation.  There will, perhaps, be a small charge of 1/- on the rates this year, maybe 2/- next year, and it will grow and grow.  There will be an increased demand on the local authority as far as buildings and bed accommodation are concerned.  In three to five years from now, it will <Col N="329" /> be hard to realise what additional cost will be borne by the ratepayers of the county.</P>
      <P>My county was one of the very small number, I suppose, that were able to hold the rate demand at the same level as last year.  There is no use denying the fact that if we did succeed in holding the rates at the same figure which was in operation last year, notwithstanding the increased cost of food for institutions due to the withdrawal of the subsidies, that was achieved only by curtailing expenditure in other directions.  We recognised from the demands on the people and from the mandate which we received from them, that we had reached the limit so far as increased rates were concerned and although we would have liked to reduce the rates this year, all we succeeded in doing was to hold them at the figure in operation the previous year.  I repeat that we were lucky in being able to do that and ours was one of the very few counties in the country in which it was possible to do it.</P>
      <P>It is impossible, as I have already said, to forecast where the cost of the scheme contemplated by this State will end.  It may start at 1/- in the £, rise to 2/- and perhaps go up as far as 3/- or 5/-.  Having provided in every county reasonable accommodation from the point of view of hospitals and sufficient beds to meet immediate needs, I think we should not incur any further risks of increasing the costs to the ratepayers.  Many needy applicants for hospital treatment may be kept on the waiting list due to the introduction of this means test in the case of the man with £600 per year income or the farmer with a valuation of over £50.</P>

      <P>The viewpoint of the Labour Party on this Bill has been very clearly expressed by Deputy Norton and subsequently by Deputy Larkin.  I think very little remains for me except to reiterate practically the statements made by these Deputies. We take the view that health services generally require to be brought up-to-date and I think the general consensus of opinion amongst the public is that our health services require to <Col N="330" /> be modernised in keeping with the development of modern drugs, medical science and surgery.  I think that is generally conceded because we find amongst all sections of the community common agreement that we should do something to improve and bring up to date our health services.  We have common agreement on that issue but it is when we come to the question of the methods to be adopted for that purpose that we are involved in a kind of head-on collision.  It is rather unfortunate that in a matter of such importance friction should have developed as to the best means and methods of improving our health services.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House is held by the Fianna Fáil Government to be the best method by which improvement can be effected in health services.  The Fine Gael Party, on the other hand, take the view that it is such a bad measure, so fundamentally unsound, that it is incapable of being amended, and for that reason they urge it should be scrapped and not proceeded with at all. The Labour Party, while not being enamoured of the Bill, feel that any vehicle which is capable of carrying into effect some measure of improvement in our health services should not be relegated to the scrap heap, that attempt should be made to improve it and to amend it, so far as it can be amended, to make it a useful instrument for the advancement of the people's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a short summary of the situation so far as this House is concerned but there is another big element in the community which is a very necessary factor in any health scheme, and that is the medical profession.  We find them at variance with the present Government and the preceding Government in regard to the methods to be adopted in promoting this scheme.  It is very sad to think that one of the vital factors in the administration of any health scheme is not pulling its weight when it comes to the question of improving health services for our people.  That they agree as to the need for an improvement in our health services is <Col N="331" /> clearly shown by the steps taken by the members of the medical profession themselves in an effort to bring health services up to date.  They have gone the distance of promoting a scheme of their own and of submitting it for the consideration of the Minister and of the previous Minister.</P>
    <P>It has not been acceptable to either Government and, while I agree with many of the things which Deputy Larkin has said, I am not prepared to agree with him in apportioning the major share of the blame to the medical profession for the contretemps that has occurred between them and the Government.  I think both sides are to blame and while no useful purpose can be served in attempting to apportion the blame between them, I think it can be said that the members of the medical profession have not at any time departed from the honourable stand they have adopted in the negotiations up to date.  Perhaps they were a little extreme in their attitude but more extremes were shown in the reception given them by the previous Minister and the present Minister.  I think that is what has led to the unfortunate clash that has taken place.</P>
    <P>I do believe that by the application of a little more of that probity, tact and common sense characteristic of the profession a <i>via media</i> could have been reached between the views of the profession and of the Government.  I am not saying that the proposals of the members of the medical profession on the one hand or those of the Government on the other hand were the best that could have been put forward but I believe that by sitting down with the members of the medical profession in a friendly round table conference, the officers of the Department would have been able to produce a scheme to the satisfaction of all parties which would have been best suited to the needs of the people.  I regret that that course has not been adopted and I would hope that even yet it would be possible to have some reconciliation because when two big bodies such as the Government and the medical profession clash, the punch ball in between is the health of <Col N="332" /> the people.  I think we should view with the greatest concern the continuance of a clash between the Medical Association and the Legislature in a matter which is concerned so intimately with the health of the people.  For that reason there is no use at this stage in entering into recriminations as to who did this or who did that.</P>
    <P>I repeat that the approaches of the Medical Association have not been treated in the way they should be treated.  Their scheme was based on an example taken from some other countries and while I can see some imperfections in it, I am of opinion that eventually when this Bill has been passed and put into operation, it will be found that it will not be a final solution of the health problems of the country.  I believe that eventually we will have to get a Bill on an insurance basis.  We had introduced in this country many years ago a national health insurance scheme and everything requisite was in that scheme, except health&mdash;a national health insurance scheme minus health&mdash;and all through the years since Lloyd George introduced his scheme, we have had a nominal national health insurance scheme with health out of it.  The only doctor provided under the scheme was a referee doctor who came into conflict with all his medical colleagues who gave certificates to sick people and who decided that they were all wrong and that the benefit being paid must be cut off.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy, I have had cases of demands being sent by the national health people for refunds of money incorrectly drawn and I remember one case of a sufferer from cardiac trouble getting a demand for the return of £100 or £110 when he had not got 100/- or 100d.  That was first-class treatment for a cardiac condition by the National Health Insurance Society.  I feel fairly confident that at some time in the near or distant future we will have a national health insurance system on an insurance basis, on a basis on which health will be insured as other matters in our daily lives are insured.  That probably was the cause of the trouble. The doctors seem to have some kind of an insurance of their own, copied, <Col N="333" /> I think, from Australia, and while I could see, as I say, very serious objections to many points in their proposal, I still think the basis is there on which could be built a suitable type of insurance scheme for this country. If that were not acceptable to the Government, I see no reason why the clash between two different viewpoints, as between the Government and the doctors, could not have been settled in a reasonable way, so that we would not have the Government, on one hand, and the doctors, on the other, fighting, irrespective of the result for the people who are waiting for an improvement in health services.</P>
    <P>It was with regret that I heard Deputy Browne speaking, because he seems to think that there is no need for improvement in our health services at all.  Anybody who gives reasonable consideration to it, however, will realise that that is an erroneous viewpoint. He may argue that this proposal is going to cost too much from the ratepayers' point of view, but that is different from saying that we have reached the very acme of perfection in our health services.  He would be a very bold man in public life who would say that.  We do know&mdash;we have the advice of our medical friends and others&mdash;that we need to bring ourselves up to date and for that reason any measure brought before the House to that end is entitled to very serious consideration and to constructive criticism and amendment.</P>
    <P>We of the Labour Party, as has been said by Deputy Norton and Deputy Larkin, have decided to support this Money Resolution and the Bill.  We are not in love with the Bill and we have sought to amend it.  The Minister himself has tabled several amendments. Some of our amendments, amendments which, we believe, would make the Bill more acceptable, more workable and remove some of the anomalies that exist in it, will not be allowed to be moved because of the rules of the House; but we appeal to the Minister, and we promise our support and co-operation on the Bill if he will do so, to examine these amendments with a view to improving the Bill.  They are not going to be <Col N="334" /> very costly&mdash;some of them may cost nothing at all&mdash;but they will remove anomalies which should not be in the Bill.  We suggest that, in conjunction with his own amendments, the Minister should examine them impartially. They have been tabled in an honest and constructive effort to make the Bill more workable.</P>
    <P>It is our bounden duty, as a Party representing working-class people, to try to improve the Bill for the benefit of these people.  The Bill deals with the nation as a whole and it is the job of Dáil Éireann to attend to the toning up of the health of the nation, but in drafting the Bill the draftsman made omissions and slips.  We have tried in our amendments to draw attention to a few of these but, as I say, unfortunately, the majority of our amendments will not be allowed to be moved.  The Minister should examine the point with regard to the provision by which a man may be asked to pay a couple of guineas a week, when sick, out of the 24/- a week, or the 50/- a week, if he is married, which he receives.</P>
    <P>He should also examine the point as to a baby ceasing to receive treatment at the age of six weeks&mdash;having reached maturity at the age of six weeks.  I should like to ask if that makes sense.  Why not allow the benefits to continue up to the age of six years?  It would not involve a very fabulous outlay for the State and the child can then be linked up with the school medical service.  There is nothing very unreasonable about that.  It is a rather helpful suggestion which, on consideration, must appeal to the Minister. There is, then, the other point about the school-children.  We give a service to the primary schools.  What is wrong with the secondary and vocational schools, the circumstances being equal and similar?  The children in these schools are all children of the nation and the title or class of the school should not debar them from enjoying the benefits of the Bill.  These are a few of the points I want to make, in conjunction with my colleagues.</P>
    <P>While I agree with much of what Deputy Larkin said, I am not prepared to go as far as he has gone, in passing, if you like, a vote of condemnation <Col N="335" /> on the action of the doctors in this crisis.  They are the leaders of the medical profession.  I am a trade unionist and I recognise that the organisation called the Irish Medical Association represents the medical profession.  The few doctors who are not in it are, I feel, unworthy of their profession, because they should be in it.  If the association have been rather strong in their recent tactics and letters, that attitude has been forced upon them by the wrong treatment given them by both Deputy Dr. Browne and the Minister in their capacities as Ministers for Health.  I feel that there is much to be said for what has been suggested here, that if we had laymen as Ministers there might be a better reception and better results between the Medical Association and the Department.  Even at this late hour, I hope that a proper reconciliation will be brought about as between the Irish Medical Association and the Minister, because it is very difficult to see this Health Bill operating successfully for the benefit of the people with the doctors in revolt.  I believe that will not happen and I hope that, before the Bill leaves the House, it will have been so amended and improved as to make it a useful instrument for the improvement and advancement of the health services up to the time when a better Bill comes along.</P>
    <P>This will not be the last Bill and this Bill will not bring perfection.  It will be a measure to carry on for a period, on a basis of trial and error and seeing where its defects lie, leading then to a better Bill.  That better Bill, which will be satisfactory from the ratepayers' point of view as well as the point of view of the country as a whole, should be based on the idea of an insurance scheme, with contributions towards national health services by the people who are capable of contributing, those who are not able to do so being provided for by the nation as at present.</P>

      <P>I have studied a lot of the schemes in operation in European countries. What is wrong with these schemes is that all their social services cater for the workers in the towns and leave the farming community go by the board.  I am sure the House is aware of the fact that the majority of the farmers have a far lower standard of living than the average worker and that the road worker who earns a meagre wage on the road is far better off than many farmers with a small valuation.  It is now suggested that we should have an insurance scheme.  How in this overwhelmingly rural community are you going to collect that insurance? Are you going to add another 2,000 or 3,000 to the overburdened Civil Service we have and put them out with books and bags to collect insurance weekly from these small farmers?  I want an answer to that from the Fine Gael benchers who are the mouthpiece of the Irish Medical Association and who make the war for the Irish Medical Association.</P>

      <P>We want an answer to that question.  Are you going to put 2,000 or 3,000 civil servants out to collect and add to the burdens of the State?  Would it not be far more practical to collect a few pence in the rates, 2/- in the rates if necessary, in order to give the service instead of carrying on the codology of the Irish Medical Association who are only concerned with their one guinea, two guineas and other fees?  Scratch a Russian and you will get a Tartar; <Col N="337" /> scratch the Opposition in connection with this whole business and the only thing is that the people in rural Ireland will be cut to the boots with fees of one guinea and two guineas.</P>
      <P>That is what is at the bottom of it. Medicine has reached a stage in this country which it has reached in no other European country.  Men, women and children are practically on the point of death before they call in a doctor.  They will not call in a doctor because they will be faced with bills. All this sob stuff about the humanitarian practices of the doctors is all eyewash.</P>

      <P>That is occurring in every townland in the country.  Deputy Browne talked about the red ticket not being used in County Mayo.  It is used in Westmeath.  In Mayo they have to bring the ass-load of turf or bag of potatoes.  The doctor does not demand it, but the eggs, chicken and turf are brought as a <i>quid pro quo.</i>  They do not use the red ticket but that other practice is understood.  Is it not time to end all that nonsense and come to the relief of the 150,000 persons, many of whom are heads of families who are living on a small valuation?  Even if these people turned their holdings into the most intensive horticultural holdings and had them up to date they would not have the living of a labouring man.  I do not want to see these people disappear in my own county, where there are a considerable number of them.  Every thatched house that falls down, every holding that is grabbed by a grazier and every holding in Donegal or Mayo that disappears is a loss to this country.  Medical fees are an unbearable burden on those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne says that he is on a public board.  I know he is and so am I.  He said that when a neighbour of his got a bill for an X-ray&mdash;he did not use the word X-ray&mdash;and had been so many days in the county hospital and so many days in an extern institution, the neighbour would come to him and he would negotiate to get the bill reduced. I appreciate that Deputy Browne does that, and many other Deputies in this House do that, but why should they have to do it?  Why should that cumbersome machine exist?  Why should these negotiations between the county manager and patients be made an <Col N="339" /> everyday occurrence?  Here is a Health Bill that ends that.  Why not support it?  Why not give these men their rights and a family card for medical attendance?</P>
    <P>If a man goes to Ballina and becomes an artisan he will get his free treatment, but the unfortunate father or mother, brother and sister left at home in Cork, Westmeath or Mayo will not get any free treatment at all.  The lad in the town has three times the pay. Is it not time for us to keep our people in the country in frugal comfort?</P>
    <P>I approach this problem from a practical point of view.  Let us not send round insurance people with bags in their hands and books in their pockets to collect 1/- or 2/- a week.  I worked at insurance when I came out of jail and I was glad to get the job.  I know how hard it is to collect these fees.  I know the insurance companies get rich when the policies lapse.  You collect 1/- this week and 1/- the following week, but then there is no money in the house.  The lull period comes, the calves will not be sold and the policy lapses.  That is all very well for the insurance company, but when the civil servant comes round with his book, how are you going to fare?  You will then have open rebellion.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Keyes when he suggests an insurance medical Bill.  That would be all right in a city like Dublin or Limerick but the hard core and basis of our country is the small farmer.  Here we have a Bill that is coming to his relief.  Let us hurry up and implement it.  Let us give him the relief to which he is justly entitled from every point of view.</P>

      <P>At this stage, it is noteworthy that a fine debate has developed on this Financial Resolution. Early on, the debate was availed of by certain members to make slanderous attacks on the medical profession.  I am very glad that Deputy Maguire made such a valuable contribution this morning.  I do not agree that he was fair to this Party, but I think that in his misrepresentation of the views held on this side of the House he is possibly influenced by the fact that he lives in an air of misrepresentation.  I endorse 75 per cent. of what he said, and I think it is a great pity that Deputy McGrath was not here to hear him.  If he were, then perhaps he might withdraw the scandalous allegations which he made against the medical fraternity in Cork City.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to hear a responsible member of the Government repeat those allegations.  We do not mind Deputy Dr. Browne, but when we heard the Parliamentary Secretary, who has just spoken, say that the people in parts of this country bring turf, eggs and chickens to the medical officer in payment for his services, what are we to think?  We have to recognise that this Bill does nothing for those people to enable them to pay for the medical attention which they receive in their own homes.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell me under what section of the Bill the people in rural Ireland now get any relief to meet the cost of the attention which they get in their own homes from a medical officer? Is there any provision in it which will reduce the charge which he states the medical officer unfairly makes on those unfortunate people?  The Parliamentary Secretary has nothing to say on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary <Col N="341" /> Secretary has read the Bill, then I am afraid he has misinterpreted its provisions.  My understanding of the Bill is that farmers with valuations under £50 and people with incomes under £600 a year or, as Deputy Costello pointed out, a person with £12,000 in the bank, will qualify for treatment once they go into an institution. In that case, they will be entitled to this free treatment.  I use the word &ldquo;free&rdquo; with a certain amount of reservation.  Let us see what we are getting free.  The Parliamentary Secretary spoke about farmers with valuations under £50.  We have very few of them in my constituency and very very few people indeed with incomes of £600 a year. We have in the country a great number of farmers with valuations of £50 and over.  I think they are very well able to pay any fees they may be charged by doctors or in hospitals if they happen to have operations.  I am thinking of very small farmers with valuations of £10 or £15.  They will be loath to pay the taxes which are to be collected in order to reduce charges on people very much better off than themselves, such as the person with £12,000 lying in the bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment what accommodation have we to give all this institutional treatment to patients?  Deputy McQuillan said yesterday that over the past four years a revolution in medicine had been effected in relation to T.B.  I am in full agreement with him on that but in many instances that position was achieved by taking over for the treatment of T.B. cases general hospitals which had been erected by the local authorities for the treatment of patients suffering from ordinary ailments.  When Deputy Dr. Browne was Minister for Health he met with very grave opposition from the Cork County Council, much of it politically inspired, when he came to take over Mallow Hospital.  The people who objected were very glad afterwards to have that hospital there for the treatment of those suffering from thoracic ailments.  I should like to pay a tribute to the work that is being done in that hospital.  The ratepayers of Cork County, who did so much to erect it, <Col N="342" /> are also proud of the work that is being done there.  We must not, however, overlook the fact that the general community has been deprived of a number of beds for the treatment of ordinary diseases in that hospital.  If they require treatment they must now go to other hospitals.</P>
    <P>I contend that, as regard hospital treatment, the agricultural community is being placed on a different footing from that of any other section of the community.  The reason is that the farmer is very slow to go into hospital, and one of the great difficulties that a doctor has is to try and keep him there. The reason is because he is constantly thinking while in hospital of his responsibilities. He has to think of his family and of the people he employs.  The farm has to be looked after in his absence&mdash;his cattle, crops and poultry. All these aspects of agricultural life need constant attention and supervision, so that even if a farmer has to have an operation, he wants to get home as quickly as possible after the operation.  It will relieve his mind of anxiety if he can get home quickly because all the time he is in hospital he is thinking of what is happening at home.  These are the people who will have to pay in taxes an unknown sum under this Bill.  They will have to pay in rates and in taxes, notwithstanding the fact that the Taoiseach said some time ago that the country has now reached the limit of its taxable capacity.</P>
    <P>The point that strikes me about this Bill is that, while so much is being said about institutional treatment, when people are invited to go into hospital for treatment the beds will not be available for them.  I disagree in a slight way with Deputy Dr. Maguire who said that there will not be a rush for institutional treatment.  I think that, when people are called upon to pay for these services, they will try to avail of the facilities which they are paying for.  The result of that will be that, when people in the lower income groups require institutional treatment, they will find that the beds will not be there for them.  That is my belief.  Deputy Dr. Maguire also said that we must creep before we can <Col N="343" /> walk.  I think that in this Bill we are trying to race before we can creep.  I believe that, if we had a proper dispensary service for the country, we could do much better for the people than by what is envisaged in this Bill. There is no demand in the country for the provisions contained in this measure, but there is a great amount of concern as to the impact which the Bill is going to have on the people who are to be called upon to pay for the maintenance of all these State institutions.</P>
    <P>Under no circumstances can the provisions made for the British people be compared with what may be envisaged for our people.  Reference has been made to the great progress that has been made in England.  That may be, but we hear stories of grave abuses under their scheme.  People who go to Britain from this country for a few weeks can get dentures and operational treatment.  Many go over and avail of that opportunity.  It is also a fact that the specialists of Cork City are catering for British people who have been waiting too long in the queue and who have reached the point that they are prepared to come to this country and to sit in the waiting-rooms of our Cork doctors for attention.  Is that a tribute to the frightfully expensive scheme that is being operated in Britain?</P>
    <P>I am a new member of this House.  I am a newer member of the committee of a voluntary hospital.  Deputy McCann made a brilliant defence of the wonderful work the voluntary hospitals are doing in this country.  The people are loath to go before the mandarin who presides over our local authorities, the county manager, and submit to him that their means are such that they should be placed in a class entitled to all these benefits.</P>
    <P>In the last few weeks I had the experience of a T.B. patient whose child went into a voluntary hospital and died there after a long illness. The child was given every facility. Despite the declamations of the Parliamentary Secretary, I want to say that that child was given attention there by <Col N="344" /> the doctors, the nursing staff and the administrative staff which could not be improved on.  A big bill was presented to the father, but when the voluntary hospital were made aware of the circumstances and the home conditions they reduced the bill by 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>Have we not a medical fraternity who are applying their own means tests?  It is untrue for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that every dispensary doctor who goes out ten, or even three or four miles, demands a fee of £2 2s. or a load of turf or chickens.  That is an accusation which is too ridiculous to demand attention from anyone in the House.</P>
    <P>I have put down a question to the Minister for Health which I hope will be replied to in detail.  Information was denied another Deputy on two occasions because of the work involved for the servants of the Minister.  I want it, not in relation to the country as a whole, but in relation to my own county, and when I get it I think I will be in a position to prove that farmers under £50 valuation, and under £15 and £10 valuation, were paying in the past much less for institutional treatment than the Parliamentary Secretary would lead us to believe, and that when the rates come to be assessed for this Bill, if it becomes an Act, they will pay far more than they have been paying in the past by way of fees.</P>
    <P>Those with lower valuations and lower incomes resent very much the fact that if this Bill becomes law they will be called upon to pay for so-called free treatment to people who are very well able to pay when it comes to a matter of paying a surgeon or a doctor for their wonderful services.  It is for that reason that I, for one, intend to vote against this Financial Resolution.</P>

      <P>I am glad that this Resolution is being dealt with in a calm atmosphere to-day because I was absolutely disgusted by the scenes that took place at the commencement of this debate.  It is not a thing that we could be proud of, nothing but hatred and tirades of bitterness towards political opponents.</P>
      <P>Tributes were paid to doctors and to the Minister but there are two men to whom no tribute was paid and who have done more for the health of this country than this House has done, the late Mr. Dick Duggan and Mr. Joseph McGrath.  They have done more to ease suffering in this country than anyone else but there is no tribute paid to them here.  The hospitals that they have erected all over the country for the sick, the poor and the suffering are monuments to them but there is not a word said on their behalf.  If we would face our task as they faced theirs there would be little need for talk on such a Bill as this.</P>
      <P>A Health Bill should be discussed in a calm atmosphere.  It is something that concerns all of us but this is a Bill that is being forced on the public, on the Hierarchy, on the medical profession, on the local authorities.  It is an unwanted child.  It is being forced on a nation that never looked for it. The House should not allow it to see the light of day.  It is like a child that refuses to be born.  There has been talk of such a Bill from 1946 to 1952 but it never came to light.  I hope it will be a still-born child.</P>
      <P>We as Irish Christian people ought to have Christian ideas and should not follow the ideas of a pagan State.  The British State is being lauded for what it is doing.  It is doing damn all.  The British people can never be a headline for us.  We never followed them and we never will follow them.  There is no such thing as British family life.  The family in England is like the pigeon's clutch.  It is easy for the medical profession in England to look after these. We have a Christian way of life and Irish ideals.  We are a free and individualistic people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a small farmer who wants to be free and I will be free and I will pay for anything I want <Col N="346" /> for myself and my children or die in the attempt.  I want no State medicine or State aid.  I want to pay for everything.</P>
    <P>I want this State to be in a position that it will be able to pay its way. There is no way of keeping an Irish, Christian, social State but by taking the hard and the honest road.  Let the people fend for themselves.  Let the State do its duty.  Its duty is to see that work, wages and decent homes are available for our people.  If our people had good wages they would be able to fend for themselves and pay their way, and that is something to be proud of.</P>
    <P>Where are we heading for to-day? The Socialist State; and, to-morrow, the Communist State.  We are preparing the way.  There are three or four inside this House and from their characters over the last three or four years I see they are &ldquo;fellow travellers,&rdquo; and I see they were trained in the old school all Moscovites are trained in. We have a very active Communist cell in Trinity College.  Everyone knows that.</P>

Most of the ideas on this still-born Bill came from the Communist cell, from the Trinity outlook.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in a good Health Bill, and I believe in good health services, but I put first things first and I believe in <Col N="347" /> asking people to pay if they are able to pay and not forcing on them something they never looked for and never wanted.  Why the rush on this Bill? Are we not an organised community? Have we not our parishes, our doctors in every district, our county hospitals and maternity homes?  Have we not the foundation there on which we can build?  Why not build on that foundation? Before you start building, at least, lay the foundation.  We are trying to build an edifice from the top, which will crash on the whole lot of us.</P>
    <P>We are told that we can have a &ldquo;free-for-all&rdquo; and that the people will pay for nothing.  Who, indeed, is going to pay?  Who paid for everything from the beginning of time? Does not everyone know that we all do, that the tramp on the road pays if he buys an ounce of tobacco or drinks a pint of beer?  We all pay for it.  There is no such thing as anything free and there never will be.  We are not a backward people.  We are not something like the Mau Maus.  We are an intelligent people who have survived in spite of terrible persecution. We are a Christian people, thanks to our outlook and our perseverance in Christianity.  This Bill has the stamp of the bully and nothing more.  It is being forced down the necks of the Hierarchy, of the doctors, of the local authorities and of this House, and it was never asked for.</P>
    <P>We heard the tirades against the doctors.  What is wrong with our doctors? Our medical profession is one of the most worthy in Europe.  Our doctors are the sons and daughters of our small country farmers.  They were reared well, they were reared honest. They were reared on honest money and they came to the profession by honourable means.  They are to-day throughout the country attending to the sick and the ailing and doing a noble work in a good Christian way. If we gave them the facilities they are calling out for, they would be able to carry out their professional work in a better way and then we would have something we could be proud of.  We are not doing that.  All over the <Col N="348" /> country there are shacks which we call medical stations and they are nothing more than a disgrace to the whole lot of us.  The doctors have not the slightest chance of carrying on the medical profession there as they should.  Why not improve on these things before we start to build from the top?</P>
    <P>Now, there is one thing certain, that we have crushing taxation and on top of that we are now going to force 2/- in the £ at least on every ratepayer. Who could stand for that, to give the Minister a blank cheque for something we know nothing about?  I say it is time that we called a halt to this highfalutin nonsense.  I am proud to-day, more proud than I ever was, of the Fine Gael Party, that it has adopted a manly and masterly stand on the side of justice, honour and decency and did not follow the carrot that is being held out, the carrot that is being laid for the next general election.  We know that when that general election comes we will stand on our platforms and we will speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth and we will ask no vote from any man who is not prepared and willing to give it.  He can give his vote to whom he likes.</P>
    <P>We formed this State, we laid the foundations of it in the teeth of opposition, almost the same opposition as we have to-day.  We can stand against the storm and stand in defence of the right of the people for justice, honesty and fair play.  Let the people pay and live in peace, let them pay in their own way and in their own time.  We stand for the family way of life, the Christian way of life.  We want none of your State medicine.  We were born honest, we were reared honest and we want to die honest.  We of the farming community do not care two hoots about you or your Bills.  Our fathers before us were reared in bad times, in hard times, in persecuted times, and they never looked to the State or to Britain or anybody else to rear their children. They reared themselves and we are the product of that generation and we want nothing from anybody but to carry on as our fathers before us.  All we want is the right to live and let <Col N="349" /> live, to live our own lives in our own way and die when God calls us, and be proud to die&mdash;to die the death of men who have lived honest lives.</P>
    <P>The farmers are the pawns in this thing, too, and the farmers have been the pawns over the generations.  There is this thing of £1&mdash;pay £1 and you will get this.  We have that kind of penny peepshow.  We want none of your £1, £5 or £10 schemes.  All we want is to be able to pay our own way and keep schemes like this out of our way.  We believe that every man is responsible for his own family and that he has a parental duty to look after the rights and needs of his family.  It is the State's duty to see that he is in a position to be able to look after his family.  I am satisfied that when any worthy man marries a girl and brings up a family, he should make an honest attempt, a huge attempt, to do everything he can in defence of that family.</P>
    <P>This House is trying to interfere with family life, trying to give our people the easy way out.  None of us wants the easy way out; we want the hard road, the straight road&mdash;that is, to pay our way, to pay for our own needs from our own pockets and not to have to pay from the State coffers, it being torn from us by taxation in all forms, after going through the hands of ten or 20 or 30 or, maybe, 10,000 civil servants. It is a costly way that undoubtedly it will go through before we will have paid for it.  We have to pay for it all, all the time.  All I want to see is our hospitals in the ordinary course of events given every facility we can give them for the doctors, given the modern amenities and the new drugs that are such a great help, and to see that they are brought within the reach of the people.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who belong to a county council and I know what I am talking about.  I belong to a noble and worthy county council where we do our work honestly and forget political differences.  We work as a team for all the people.  I am glad to say that our county hospitals do everything possible for the people and they are not mulcting the people as we are told.  Men like myself are often approached by a man, perhaps one who <Col N="350" /> has gone through a tortuous illness and who finds the bill fairly stiff, who asks us to get it cut down.  I am glad to say that on almost all occasions, when we approach the county manager or those responsible, we are met with a ready response and can always get that bill cut down, or if it cannot be cut down, the time can be extended and it can be paid in instalments.  It is the very same here in Dublin with the higher medical profession.  The highest and most eminent surgeon or specialist does that also.</P>
    <P>We heard Deputy Morrissey saying he would not be alive to-day if it were not for one of them.  Fifteen years ago I had a major operation from which I never expected to recover.  I went to an eminent specialist and was on the operating table for many hours between life and death, but I pulled through because of the skill of the specialist.  When I came to leave the hospital I expected to receive a very big bill from the specialist which would be beyond my means to pay and have to pay hospital fees which would stagger me.  I am glad to say, however, that I was met in a very reasonable way.  I was asked what I was able to pay and if I would be able to pay in one sum and was told I could pay as I liked.  They took me at my face value and told me to pay when I was able and I did pay it to the last penny.  I could have been charged hundreds of pounds for that operation, but I found that there were Christian gentlemen working in that hospital.  It is the same to-day all over the country.</P>
    <P>We have heard these furious tirades against the doctors and the specialists, many of whom are the sons and daughters of country people.  They are being trampled on by the cheap type of politician who is not fit to wipe the boots of those people who earn their living by hard work and who were educated with the earnings of their parents.  It cost many politicians nothing to come in here.  All they wanted was a long tongue.  They come in here and throw dirt at these people as if they were at the crossroads.</P>

      <P>These are the foulmouthed politicians who are making little of our doctors and specialists all over the country and it is time that it should be stopped.  Pain and suffering are the heritage of human beings since the fall of Adam and we will have them until the end of time.  If they were borne with Christian resignation it would be of immense benefit to the nation.  But Fianna Fáil wants the easy way out, the nice way out for all.  It is a good thing that our hospitals are not filled with the Fianna Fáil Party or we would hear them groaning and squealing.  Through the generations our Irish mothers have never groaned or whined.  They bore the pains of childbirth in silence.</P>
      <P>I want to see a sound and honest approach to the health problem of this country.  Let us put first things first. Let us see where our duty lies and where the parents' duty lies.  Do not try to trample on the rights of the parents or let the parents get out of their responsibilities.  They have their responsibilities and we should let them carry them out to the last farthing.  I believe that the State should look after the treatment of the major diseases, the ones which are more or less beyond the reach of the people, such as T.B. and cancer.  The State should do everything possible to cope with these diseases.  It has done fine work in that way and will do fine work and, in the course of time, if we do not get a cure for them, we shall be able to cut down the number of cancer and T.B. cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No effort is being made here to treat these health matters on vocational lines.  If that were done, there would be no need for State interference in the matter of medical treatment. We should have vocational groups, each with its own medical scheme.  We have only to go down to Guinness' brewery to see how such a scheme is carried on.  They are not looking to this House or anyone else for aid.  They have their own medical service there for their employees and their dependents who are as safe and secure as people in any part of the world.  Ought we not to take a headline from that?  We have State-aided <Col N="352" /> industries all over the country living behind high tariff walls.  Why not ask them to do what Messrs.  Guinness are doing and make them look after the health of their employees?  Let them take over the responsibility.  The State paid enough money to put them on their feet.  Let them now get their own insurance schemes working to cater for their own people instead of putting a crushing load on the unfortunate harassed taxpayers and ratepayers.</P>
    <P>Only a few months ago we were told by the Taoiseach and other Ministers that this country was in a very bad financial condition and that we could hardly pull through; that the country was almost down and out.  Now we are forcing through this scheme on the top of all the other taxation and we are not told what it will cost.  We know, however, that it will put at least 2/- in the £ on the rates of the farming community who are expected to take that lying down.  I say that we certainly will not, that we will fight to the death against this imposition by the political impostors who are the cause of all the trouble here.  They have piled up and crushed the people by taxation and now they want to put more on them. They say that Fine Gael will not give the people a Health Bill.  The Fine Gael Party can answer for themselves. They will go on platforms as they did before and they will appear on platforms when the Fianna Fáil Party are gone and forgotten.</P>
    <P>The teachers' organisation could establish their own insurance scheme. Why not let them?  Why not take up the one thing that is worth taking up in this country, the Muintir na Tíre organisation, and lay the foundation of Christian ideas here?  If the people were organised in vocational groups we would have a State of which we could be proud.  But you do not want it because it would interfere with your narrow, mean politics.  That is the way of truth and light and you do not want to follow it.  If it were followed, crushing taxation would not be necessary and our people would work for themselves and provide for themselves. They would not want to be State paupers.</P>
    <P>I come from a county where we have <Col N="353" /> a maternity home which has only eight beds.  There is a large number of people waiting to get in there, but there is not the slightest hope of their getting one of these eight beds.  Yet we are told we must put this Bill through.  Why not give the people the beds which they are looking for and instead of a maternity home with eight beds give us one with 50 beds? We will pay for it and let all classes of people use it, whether they are labourers' or farmers' wives.  If you put the beds there we will pay for them, but you will not do that.  For 20 years we have been fighting for a proper maternity service in County Meath but we have been spurned.  We wanted our share of the Hospitals' Sweepstake funds and we never got it. Other districts have got it and have been provided with proper institutions. Before you start with these health services give us 50 beds in a maternity home in Meath and we will pay for them.  We want none of your &ldquo;free-for-all.&rdquo;  What is the use of putting this Bill through when there are only eight maternity beds provided in that home in the County Meath? You will have the mink coat ladies replacing the plaid shawl women who will be far down in the queue.</P>
    <P>I stand for the aged, the infirm and sick being looked after by the State as far as our means allow.  We should be proud of our middle classes and of the small farming community who do not want anything for nothing.  We want none of your sops, your doles or your subsidies. We want to be allowed to live our own lives in our own way and to pay our own way.  We will pay for our hospitals.  We will pay our taxes.  We do not want anything free.  We want none of your slave States and we will never accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there can be no doubt in the mind of any Deputy of the importance of the subject we are discussing on this Money Resolution, namely the health of our people.  There is complete agreement that the health of our people does require both attention and action by this Parliament. But it is there that agreement ends, and it is clear that there is now a very <Col N="354" /> serious divergence of view as between both sides of the House as to the manner in which we should deal with the problem of the health of our people.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out in this debate and on the Second Reading of the Bill that the subject of health has been bedevilled with political considerations for the last decade.  In the last ten years we have had no less than three Health Bills, advertised by their respective sponsors as the final legislative measures to cure the health problems of the nation.  In addition to three Health Bills we have had four White Papers.  A ribbon of paper has been wound around the problem of sickness and disease here, and at the end of it all we find the country as far away as ever from a solution of the perennial problems affecting health and kindred matters.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason that we in the Fine Gael Party have endeavoured to suggest to the Government that they would serve the country better if they scrapped this Health Bill tore it up and did instead some constructive work in their Departments.  About eight years ago, in 1945, those interested in the care, treatment and cure of sickness and disease pointed out to the Department of Health certain urgent matters requiring to be done.  They pointed out the necessity for improving the dispensary facilities, improving the institutional treatment available, providing more beds in our maternity hospitals and many other steps essential for the care of the sick and the combating of disease.  That was done immediately prior to the introduction of the first Health Bill in 1945.  At that time there were available here to meet the average birth rate of over 65,000 per year just over 900 maternity beds.  To-day, almost ten years later, when three Health Bills have been proposed, four White Papers have been drafted, circulated and torn up, and two Governments have come and gone, and a third is about to go, we still find only a few more than 900 maternity beds throughout the country to deal with an average birth rate of 65,500 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> The dispensaries in most parts of rural Ireland consist of a room let at a few shillings a week in a local house. There is no provision for proper medical examination.  There is scarcely any light and practically no decent sanitary accommodation.  It is for that reason that we in the Fine Gael Party ask what has the Department of Health been doing over the last decade? Legislation is not required to provide extra accommodation in the maternity wing of the Meath hospital to which Deputy Giles has referred.  It is not required to provide extra maternity accommodation in the different local authority hospitals throughout the country.  At the moment that accommodation totals 604 beds.  No legislation is required for providing more beds.</P>
    <P>Why, then, is not this essential work being done?  We know only too well on this side of the House the element of political expediency inherent in the discussion of any matter so important as the health of our people.  Unfortunately, over the last ten years each politician in charge of the Department of Health, except during one very brief period, has been too concerned with the window-dressing and the shop front advertising of a health policy through the medium of the goods actually contained in the shop.</P>
    <P>It is only now that people are beginning to recognise the obvious fact that one cannot make people healthy by legislation.  It is only now that people are beginning to realise that the introduction and the enactment of legislative proposals providing for free, or almost free, maternity treatment does not actually provide that treatment. It is only now that people realise that the passage of a Bill here entitling a person in a certain income group to free institutional treatment does not, in fact, provide that treatment. It is only now that people are seeing through the fraud and the fog that has been deliberately created with regard to this matter in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the time of this House and the time of the officials in the Department of Health should be wasted in the discussion of this <Col N="356" /> empty formula.  The Minister for Health in the last 18 months or two years would have served the country far better if, instead of going around the country like a travelling circus talking about the coming Health Bill and matters of that kind, he directed his energy towards the provision of the raw material of any health service. It is becoming apparent that, in regard to the actual provision of facilities for a health service, the Department have nothing to report. It is gratifying that, as a result of successive promptings in this House and outside it, the problem of the great scourge of T.B. is in sight of solution.  The strange thing is that the construction and direction of sanatoria which were planned many years ago are proceeding according to a Civil Service file and directive while other diseases are now far more serious and while other matters of illness and health now require far more attention.  Nevertheless, we are still, apparently, in our building programme endeavouring to deal with a situation that should more appropriately have been dealt with ten years ago.</P>
    <P>I think we are building sanatoria now&mdash;sanatoria to be completed in two or three years' time&mdash;that will not be occupied, thank God, by a single patient.  That is because, under successive Ministers for Health, there is no cohesion, liaison or collaboration between the Department itself and the professional men who have to work any health service in the country.  I think that all this is both tragic and nationally harmful.  If it were possible for us in this House to erase the political chapter with regard to health of the past ten years, to forget what has gone, to forget what was said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to forget what was done, it would be a good thing.  Surely, if this matter of health were now being discussed for the first time, it would be common case between both sides of the House and the collaboration, helpful advice and assistance of the medical profession would be a <i>sine qua non</i> to any national health scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> Maybe that is not possible now under the present Administration: I do not know.  Even at this eleventh hour, I think the national requirements demand that some effort should be made to obtain the co-operation of the medical profession and to act upon the advice which they give.  Otherwise, what we are doing in this House in this session does not count for anything in the solution of the problem which we all desire to see resolved.  We are only creating trouble, dissension, discontent, and strife for the years to come. We are only ensuring a continuance of poor services for those who need better services at the moment.</P>
    <P>It is clear to anybody who endeavours to examine the Health Bill&mdash;for which we are asked to vote money&mdash; that it is a typical example of a Government's putting the cart before the horse.  The Government know&mdash;the Department has been advised and the medical profession have repeated it time and time again&mdash;that existing facilities, not merely in relation to maternity but also in relation to institutional treatment in hospitals generally, are far from adequate.  If a serious or sudden illness takes place in this city&mdash;an illness which requires surgical or medical treatment in a hospital&mdash;undoubtedly there is considerable difficulty in securing a bed for a patient.  The supply of beds even for medical and surgical cases is well below the margin of safety.  An effort is made by voluntary hospitals to provide beds for all those necessitous people who cannot, owing to lack of money, purchase accommodation elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to our voluntary hospitals that in the present difficult circumstances they have preserved the traditions which they built up.  They provided and continue to provide beds for those who cannot afford nursing home treatment or accommodation elsewhere.  While the number of beds at present available for the poorer patients is by no means adequate, nevertheless it is certainly reasonable in the particular shortages that exist.</P>
    <P>With regard to the new class that is defined by our legislation as the &ldquo;middle income group&rdquo; I often wonder what exactly that term is <Col N="358" /> intended to convey.  For the ordinary person&mdash;the young man who is married and has a family, the white collar worker, and so forth&mdash;a serious illness is a sentence of death or a sentence of bankruptcy, and that particular person is not contained within any limit of £600 a year; we are codding ourselves if we think that he is.  There are men to-day in the Civil Service, in the professions, in business, with incomes of £600 to £1,000 with large families or comparatively large families, who find it practically impossible to pay their way.  For those people illness of any serious nature, illness of the wife, of the husband, or even of one of the children, is either a sentence of death or of insolvency.  I mention that because even those who support this Bill should not cod themselves into thinking that any serious effort is being made to deal with the really deserving cases in this country.</P>
    <P>With the limited supply of beds in voluntary and local authority hospitals, a supply which at the moment is pretty well preserved for the poorer patient, all we are doing is adding to the queue many hundreds of others who are compelled to provide accommodation for themselves elsewhere.  I do not object to that.  Obviously it is only just and reasonable, provided you do not do harm, but if you only have two beds available for 5 patients and if by your legislation you double the number five and make it ten with still two beds available, you are doing nothing but harm.  You are creating hope which cannot be justified.  You are causing a belief amongst people faced with illness or who fear illness that when this Bill becomes law everything is perfect: pick up a telephone, ring up a hospital, be provided with a bed, go in and get treatment, all free, no difficulty.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is not so.  The only thing we are doing in relation to free treatment of this kind is to sow the seeds of confusion, doubt and considerable discontent in coming months.  It is for that reason I have said this is a case of putting the cart before the horse. A great deal could be said for it&mdash; there certainly would not be opposition from this side of the House&mdash;if the <Col N="359" /> Minister or whatever Government might be in power, had available in this country the hospital accommodation for the operation of a service of this kind.  Then the legislative provision would be of a secondary nature; it would be automatic and would have complete approval.  By our legislation we are creating at the moment a hope in the breasts of the people that has no chance of fulfilment over the next ten years or so.  We are legislating for a state of affairs which, with luck, with a good Government, with a good Minister and an active Department, may be realised by the year 1963.  We are now giving the right to free service for certain classes of people in this country, a right which can never be realised in the next ten years.  I do not think that what I say in that connection is open to any contradiction.</P>
    <P>One may then wonder why we should be acting in that manner.  We know that the present Government is doing this not out of any interest in or feeling for the sick and afflicted but merely for the purpose of satisfying the parliamentary requirements of those who maintain the Government in power.  That is regrettable.  This Health Bill, introduced, I think, in 1952, is an example of the Government tail wagging the body.  It is introduced here to give a political platform to four or five Deputies who badly need some political platform.  It does not bear on its face marks of any consideration or of any care or examination. Like all those ill-considered acts of political expediency it has stored up a mass of trouble for those who sponsor it.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to make political capital out of the discussion of any human ailments or human ills.  I do not suppose that on any other subject there can be so much hypocrisy and insincerity and so many crocodile tears.  It is very easy for a Deputy here&mdash;and we have had some of them&mdash; to speak apparently from his heart in regard to the poor and afflicted outside in order to make for himself some little niche in the political life, but when all that kind of talk is finished and done with what will count in the <Col N="360" /> long run are the actions of those who actually are serious about these problems.</P>
    <P>I do not know why professional men like Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Dr. Ryan and other professional Deputies of that kind should endeavour to make political capital by attacking the profession that some of them represent.  Possibly it will secure for them a few miserable, unthinking votes that may satisfy their desires, but very serious harm will undoubtedly be done.  Is there any reasonable Deputy who believes that the doctors in this country, even a large percentage or the majority of them, are dishonest money-grabbers interested only in securing money out of the illness and necessity of those whom they treat, as has been suggested?  Is that the belief shared by reasonable Deputies in this House?  If that is so it is a very serious indictment of our people, of every one of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were so I certainly would be very sorry to call myself an Irishman because the medical profession is a cross-section of our people and they have consistently in the last ten years been subjected by cheap politicians to these sneering attacks we have heard in this House, attacks by those who know what they are saying is completely untrue.  I know, and every Deputy in this House knows, that the Irish doctor through the centuries has held and still holds an honoured name in medical history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Right through the years when the British system of local government in this country was being destroyed by our national movement the necessary service in the interests of the Republican Government in this country was given by the Irish dispensary doctors. There are men supporting the Minister, Deputies in his Party, people who stood on platforms with him, Irish medical men, who have had behind them a lifetime of service to this country.  These are the people who are being upbraided and sneered at by Deputies, such as Deputy Dr. Browne, who come in here with cheap prattle in <Col N="361" /> order to get cheap votes.  It is regrettable that that should be the case but it becomes more astonishing when we find Deputy Cowan&mdash;who is sitting outside the bar of the House at the moment, who would be the first to fight for his own profession, the legal profession, and whose views on the coming Courts of Justice Bill I shall be anxious to hear&mdash;joining with Deputy Dr. Browne in this foul slander on his own profession here.  However, what they have to say pales into insignificance when we consider the effect of their fulminations on Deputies like Deputy McGrath.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath is a great Deputy for repeating things he hears.  Deputy McGrath, in his contribution to this debate, no doubt spoke in accordance with what he feels to be the lead set for him by the person in charge of the medical services of this country&mdash; Deputy Dr. Browne.  Deputy McGrath said that if the doctors do not do what they are told under this Health Bill, the Attorney-General should be consulted to ascertain whether the doctors were to be prosecuted.  The doctors were, apparently, to be brought up in a court of law because they did not do what the Government said they were to do.  Was there ever a clearer suggestion by a prominent Government Deputy for the initiation of a police State in this country?  The doctors were to be forced by the policeman's baton into operating a system about which they had doubts and against which they had an objection.</P>
    <P>That is the solution always available to the bully.  If by argument you cannot convince your opponent, then hit him on the head.  That is what Deputy McGrath thinks should be done to the members of the medical profession in this country.  The Attorney-General should be seen, the bailiffs should be sent out, the Civic Guards with a process should be brought into operation, and before the courts of this country the humble dispensary doctor should be hauled for the crime of believing in the democracy that we all prate about here.  I think it was a reprehensible suggestion in the way it was put, and I trust that it does not represent the view of the Minister or <Col N="362" /> of any other member of the Government.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters to which I should like to refer.  Generally speaking there is a great deal of &ldquo;codology&rdquo; in this Bill.  The Bill, or the major part of it at any rate, provides for things that already exist. The financing of the Bill is a matter of concern to many people in the country.  I cannot speak with the experience of many other Deputies but, as a younger Deputy, speaking from my own experience, I think it is correct to say that there never has been from representatives of the ratepayers any objection good, bad or indifferent, to the provision of hospitals, the provision of health services and matters of that kind which really bring benefits to the people.  In fact, our local authorities through the years have been only too anxious to provide money for the provision of necessary services of that kind.  When the rates bill became unduly high, when efforts were made to trim, cut and wean, the one matter in regard to which no economy or no pruning was made was hospitalisation and health services generally.  I think that is a very noble and very fine record.</P>
    <P>Possibly, because of that, the Minister presuming on the unbounded generosity of the members of local authorities and ratepayers generally, comes along with a proposal to finance these &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; health services in a &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; manner by providing that for every shilling spent out of central funds a shilling will have to be provided out of the rates.  That is a great example of being very generous at the expense of someone else.  When the members of different county councils&mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and other political Parties&mdash;asked the Minister if he would tell them how much this was going to cost them, the Minister was unable to say.  He told the representatives of the midland counties, the western counties, the northern counties and southern counties that he did not know.  If the Minister does not know what the cost of the scheme will be, then he has no business proposing it and he certainly has no business providing that at least half the cost will be borne out of the rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> This extraordinary ministerial ignorance with regard to the cost of a scheme of this kind again prompts one to suggest that this scheme is not a serious one.  It is a proposal to maintain a parliamentary majority for a Government that is on its way out.</P>

      <P>With regard to the imposition on the rates, it is, of course, slightly Gilbertian to find this House, almost 50 per cent. of which is composed of reasonable, adult, responsible Deputies, being asked to buy a pig in a poke in the way they are asked to vote this money.  We are told: &ldquo;Pass this Bill.  I do not know what it is going to cost, but, whatever it costs, you will have to pay.&rdquo;  Is that the manner in which reasonable, adult, responsible Deputies are expected to legislate?  It is notable that some Deputies see nothing wrong with that, <Col N="364" /> but that is the particular objection to the scheme which is felt in a very real manner in many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>We know from the experience of people elsewhere that the cost of a scheme of this kind may be immense. Deputy Dr. Browne, whose views on this subject are, of course, imported&mdash; his very insult to the Fine Gael Party was that we were to be dragged kicking and screaming into the 20th century, a description which also had to be imported&mdash;as a person who holds imported foreign ideas on State paternalism, no doubt will be able to advise the Minister that, when the national health scheme was introduced by the Socialist Government in Britain some years ago, it was stated that the cost would be £178,000,000.  That was, of course, an estimate, but the Labour Minister of Health, Mr. Bevan, did endeavour, at the reasonable request of the British Parliament, to estimate the total cost of the scheme.  The scheme went into operation, and, at the end of 12 months, it was found that the cost totalled £460,000,000, almost four times the estimate given by the Minister of Health.  The reason, of course, was in large measure human nature itself.  If there is anything free going and if Johnny around the corner gets it, I do not see any reason why I should not get it, and the operation of State medicine in Britain undoubtedly has been marked by considerable abuses.  The provision of a valuable service has been cheapened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if we are to expect the same result in this country, but at least we should get from the Minister some idea of the cost.  The Minister has said at some place that it will mean 1/6 on the rates.  Is he prepared to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage providing that the call on the rates shall not exceed 1/6 in the £?  That is a reasonable provision which a Minister who makes such a statement and who believes in what he says should be prepared to make.  If the Minister on Committee Stage provides that the call on the rates shall not exceed 1/6, he will have gone a great deal of the way towards proving his sincerity.  I do not know whether he would consider that suggestion, but when a Minister cannot or will not <Col N="365" /> state the total cost, but, in order to ease objections by local councils, says that the call on the rates should not exceed 1/6, some very real lack of consideration exists.</P>
    <P>This Bill is just part of the paper history in regard to the solution of health problems in this country.  I do not believe the Bill will ever go into operation, and I have no doubt that, in a short space of time, the responsibility will fall on Deputies on this side of providing a workable scheme and a solution of our health problems.  The position of the Fine Gael Party has been made quite clear by the Leader of the Opposition.  We realise that, in the solution of problems of health, a lot more than political propaganda is required.  A workable scheme, brought about in the spirit of goodwill and of charity, is necessary.  We think that a scheme of that kind is possible of attainment, even by the present Administration, and even at this eleventh hour, and that such a scheme will do more service to the sick and afflicted of this country than is done by the scheme contained in this Bill and previous schemes of the kind.  In any event, we have no doubt that the Government do not intend to operate this Bill.  Even if it were passed into law to-morrow, there it will remain as a fearful weapon of destruction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We are asked to pass it in order to provide some glimmer of a political future for the flotsam and jetsam of Irish politics, and the unfortunate thing is that the football being kicked around the place in this political game is the section of our people who are sick and afflicted. These are the people who have to suffer, who are suffering, and who will suffer, because politicians demand a health scheme introduced for political purposes.  Those who started this game 18 months or two years ago started something the end of which they cannot foresee.</P>

      <P>The country at the moment is marking time for a change of Government.

      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Davern was in the House earlier when Deputy McGrath referred to prosecuting doctors, but I suggest that no Fianna Fáil Deputy should refer to a Flogging Bill in regard to a matter of this kind.  We had one gentleman who ran away from a Bill in which the Fianna Fáil Government some years ago were prepared to enforce health under the shadow of the policeman's baton.  I do not think it comes well from any member of the Fianna Fáil Party to refer to a Flogging Bill with regard to health.</P>
      <P>In any event, I have endeavoured to state objections to this Bill.  I think the Bill will not go into operation. Whether it goes into operation or not, no matter what sort of health legislation we put on our Statute Book, no matter who the Government may be, the fact remains that urgent work remains to be done in the solution of health problems here.  The position is as bad now as it was painted in 1945. The Irish Medical Association, a decade ago, impressed upon the Department the urgency for immediate work with regard to dispensaries, hospitals and institutions of different kinds.  The position is as bad now as it was then.  No matter what legislation we pass or are asked to pass, the important thing always will be the number of hospitals, beds, nurses, midwives and doctors we have available for the treatment and the solution of the health problems of the country.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to understand the attitude of the Fine Gael Party to this Bill.  Everybody, of <Col N="367" /> course, had hoped that they would try for once in their lives to divorce politics from the health of the people. I, perhaps, more than many Deputies in this House can speak with experience of our medical services.  Unfortunately, I have had the necessity to avail of the services on many an occasion for the past 30 odd years.  I must pay a tribute to our doctors and surgeons. If Deputy O'Higgins attempts for one moment to insinuate that there are people on this side of the House who would like to see doctors summoned before judges or juries, no sane, sensible doctor in this country will accept that statement at all.  That is not going to happen, but the Government or the Dáil must of necessity decide in certain matters in what direction the treatment of certain people will go.  In particular, they will have to ensure&mdash;as this Bill ensures&mdash; that no person will die for the want of medical attention because of the lack of money.  That, in itself, should commend this Bill to every decent, honest Deputy.</P>
      <P>Knowing the Fine Gael Party as I do, I never in my most pessimistic moments believed that such conservatism still obtained within their ranks. Their answer to this Bill is just what Queen Victoria said many years ago: &ldquo;Let them die.&rdquo;  She gave £5 towards the relief of famine distress and £50 to a certain hunt.  That is just the same as Deputy McGilligan who said, in effect, some years ago: &ldquo;Let them die.  It is not the duty of the Government to provide work for the unemployed.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Perhaps, at a later stage, we will have more to say about it.  It was prudent for the Fine Gael Party to be a friend of the workers when they were courting the Labour Party for votes, but they have come out in their true colours again.  It took them a long time to make up their minds.  It reminds me of the bandy-legged drover who could not get his calves together.  It is the same with Fine Gael.  They are not able to decide whether to incur the fury of certain elements in the House.  Perhaps, it might not have been good politics for them to think, as a responsible Party should think, in terms of what is best for the people.  Always it is what is best for Fine Gael that the Fine Gael Party will think about. After many weeks of deliberation they have come out in their true colours, but they let the Second Stage of this Bill go unchallenged.  They agreed to it.</P>
