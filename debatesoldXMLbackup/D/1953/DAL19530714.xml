    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state, in view of the serious state of unemployment in the City of Dublin, if the Government proposes to take any action either by issuing increased grants to the Dublin Corporation or otherwise to relieve the present critical situation.</P>

      <P>The Government have been, and are, giving unremitting attention to the position regarding unemployment in Dublin, as well as elsewhere. Everything possible is being done to expedite the commencement of further building and other constructional works the capital for which is found entirely or to a large extent by the State.  The total estimated cost of such works (excluding housing) at present in progress in the Dublin area is over £17,000,000.  Of this amount, almost one-half represents work which remains to be carried out, and this will be pressed forward as rapidly as possible.  As I mentioned in my speech of the 30th June, proposing a vote of confidence in the Government, there is, in addition, a programme of work estimated to cost about £1,750,000 which will be undertaken shortly in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my reply to a question on the 21st of May last, I gave some particulars of the immediate programme of Dublin Corporation housing, to the cost of <Col N="1006" /> which the State makes large contributions. The number employed on the corporation's housing schemes is now greater by 36 per cent. than it was three months ago, and the corporation anticipates a further increase within the next few months.</P>
    <P>This year, the decline from the peak figures of January in the numbers on the live register at the Dublin Employment Exchanges is greater by about 900 than the corresponding decline in either of the two preceding years.  The progressive downward tendency in the number on the register at those exchanges, to which I referred in reply to a question on the 9th June, has continued without interruption.</P>
    <P>With regard to urban employment schemes with which the Special Employment Schemes Office is concerned, arrangements are being made to have the programme for the year ending the 31st March next put into operation as soon as possible&mdash;in advance of the usual time&mdash;in Dublin and in some of the other principal centres of population, it being understood that, should this necessitate the provision of additional schemes for the coming winter and spring period, a Supplementary Estimate will be taken to provide additional funds.</P>

    <P>* The content of the figures in 1953 differs from that of those in the earlier years due to the legislative changes effected by the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  While it is not possible to give a precise measure of the effect of the legislative changes in increasing the live register an investigation made in May, 1953, indicated that the increase at that date was in the region of 10,000.</P>

      <P>The increase of three points in the interim cost-of-living index figure at mid-May, 1953, compared with mid-February, 1953, is accounted for by an increase of 3.45 points in the food group offset by decreases of 0.25 of a point in the fuel and light group and of 0.05 of a point in the clothing group.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state if he has received representations from hoteliers, local Tóstal committees and others as to the period of the year at which An Tóstal should be held; and, if so, whether he has considered such representations and is in a position to make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no direct representations on the subject. I understand, however, that representations have been made to An Bord Fáilte by some local Tóstal councils and other interested parties concerning the decision to hold An Tóstal at Easter 1954 and urging that it should be held at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main objects of An Tóstal is to stimulate increased tourist traffic particularly from the United <Col N="1011" /> States during the period when, as a rule, demand for hotel accommodation is relatively slack.  When the idea of An Tóstal was first mooted it was suggested to me by American experts on tourist development that to ensure its success the event should be centred around St. Patrick's Day on the grounds that Irish-Americans would wish to visit Ireland for a festival held at that time.  As, however, St. Patrick's Day falls in Lent, I told An Bord Fáilte that if they felt that it would be better that An Tóstal should commence at Easter I would concur in their decision.  The board eventually decided that An Tóstal, 1953, should commence on Easter Sunday.</P>
    <P>In February of this year An Bord Fáilte informed me that they were anxious that a date for An Tóstal, 1954, should be fixed immediately in order that advance preparations might be put in hand.  The board stated that a number of organisations had already approached them in the matter and they suggested to me that An Tóstal, 1954, should commence on Easter Sunday, 18th April, 1954, and continue for the ensuing three weeks. I approved the board's suggestion.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for holding An Tóstal at Easter time 1954 have already been put in hands.  The question as to the date for An Tóstal in the years after 1954 can be fully considered in the light of the experience in 1954.  I shall of course be guided by An Bord Fáilte in the matter, but it is my personal view that, while there are obvious advantages to be gained by commencing An Tóstal on a day which has universal significance, this factor will diminish in importance as An Tóstal becomes more widely known and firmly established.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a widespread feeling that by having it so early in the year it has not been possible to stretch the holiday period in the way it was hoped to stretch it?  I think the original intention was that the summer holiday period should be stretched by one month or so.  Would not the Minister consider that by holding it so early in <Col N="1012" /> the year we merely come in on the Easter holiday period instead of stretching the summer holiday period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Easter, 1954, will be two weeks later than it was this year. A number of factors were taken into account.  I have mentioned that of having the festival associated with a holiday that is well known throughout the world.  There is also the prospect that at that period reduced shipping fares and other similar advantages may be secured that may not be possible later.  My own view is that, while there were advantages to be gained by linking An Tóstal with a day which has universal significance, this factor will become less important as the festival becomes more widely known.</P>

      <P>The recent general revision of the pay of non-industrial classes in the Civil Service applies equally to established and temporary employees.  This revision provided for increases as follows in the percentage additions given in 1951.  On the portion of remuneration, exclusive of such additions, at a rate of £200 a year or less, the percentage was raised from 15 to 27½, on the portion exceeding £200 but not exceeding £965 a year from 10 to 15 and on the remainder from 7½ to 10. Variations in the rates of pay applicable to industrial classes are determined by reference to conditions obtaining in outside employment and consequently do not follow a uniform pattern.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of the imports upon which a total of £10,234,000 customs duty was paid in the three months ended 30th June, 1953, the total quantity and value of the various articles or groups of articles imported upon which this duty was paid, and the amount of duty paid in respect of each class or group of such articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of £10,234,000 to which the Deputy refers does not represent customs receipts on imports in the quarter ended 30th June, 1953.  This amount represents <Col N="1017" /> the total of the payments into the Exchequer on account of customs revenue during the quarter ended 30th June, 1953, and includes the sum transferred in respect of the customs balance on hands on 31st March, 1953.</P>
      <P>The approximate net receipts of customs duty in the quarter amounted to £9,301,817.  This figure cannot, however, be taken as the receipt of customs duties in respect of goods imported in the quarter because by far the greater portion of customs revenue is derived from goods such as tobacco and spirits which are warehoused on importation, the duty being subsequently paid at the time they are delivered from warehouse for home use.  For this reason the Deputy will understand that information as to the quantity and value of dutiable goods imported into the country in any period does not afford an indication of the quantity or value of the goods on which customs duty was paid in that period.  The quantities (or values in the case of goods chargeable with <i>ad valorem</i> duty) on which duty was actually paid in the quarter ended 30th June, 1953, are not yet available.</P>
      <P>As the portion of my reply which indicates how the customs receipts of £9,301,817 are made up is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>The maximum allowance payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1952, to an unmarried person resident outside a county borough area who is undergoing domiciliary treatment for tuberculosis is ordinarily 29/- per week.  This rate of allowance was increased from 25/- to 29/- per week as recently as last October, and the increased scale of allowances then granted compares favourably with the ordinary social welfare benefits payable to sick and able-bodied persons. The amending regulations which provided for the increased scale of allowances also authorised the grant of an additional allowance towards rent if the recipient of an allowance, before he became ill, paid, or contributed substantially <Col N="1021" /> towards, the rent of the house in which he ordinarily resides.</P>

      <P>Tá a fhios agam gur ró-thrua le muintir na Dála a chlos go bhfuair an Teachta Proinsias Ó Fathaigh bás&mdash;go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
      <P>Tharraing gluaiseacht na saoirse mórán sár-dhaoine chuici.  Duine den dream a b'uaisle dhíobh ba ea Proinsias Ó Fathaigh.  Ina mhac léinn dó bhí sé cairdiúil muinteartha leis an bPiarsach, le Tomás Ó Cléirigh agus le Tomás Mac Donnchadha.  Bhí sé ina chomhalta d'Oglaigh na hEireann ó bunaíodh iad agus ina Oifigeach orthu le linn Seachtain na Cásca, 1916.  De bharr a ndearna sé sa tSeachtain ghlórmhar sin gearradh pian-tseirbhís air.  Ligeadh amach ina dhiaidh sin é ach gabhadh arís é sa bhliain 1918 agus bhí sé ina phríosúnach nuair a toghadh é ina Theachta dá chontae dhúchais, Gaillimh Theas, in Olltoghchán na bliana 1918.  Bhí sé faoi ghlas ag Gallaibh nuair a tháinig an Chéad Dáil le chéle.  Riamh ó shoin hatoghadh é ina Theachta don dáil-cheantar céanna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1932 ceapadh é ina Cheann Comhairle ar an Dáil agus bhí sé sa Chathaoir ar feadh naoi mbliana déag.  Nuair a bhí a Pháirtí <Col N="1033" /> féin ag imeacht as oifig sa bhliain 1948 ceapadh é d'aonghuth ina Chathaoirleach.  Sa bhliain 1951 nuair a tháinig an Dáil le chéile tar éis an Olltoghcháin dhiúltaigh sé, mar gheall ar easláinte, a ainm a ligean ar aghaidh le haghaidh na Cathaoir-leachta agus ba ansin a tháinig deireadh lena ré fada mar Cheann Comhairle.  Táa lán daoine anseo agus a fhios acu gur chomhlíon sé dualgais na hOifige sin go cothrom, cóir riamh agus i gcónaí.  Chuir a bhás deireadh le cúig bliana tríochad de sheirbhís dílis dá thír.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1949 bhí sé i gceannas ar an toscaireacht ón tír seo go dtí an tAontas Eadar-Pharlaiminteach ag Stockholm, agus an bhliain ina dhiaidh sin bhi sé ina chathaoirleach ar an gComhdháil Eadar-Pharlaiminteach i mBaile Atha Cliath.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on this particular amendment on the last day, I was summarising, in the main, the circumstances that should operate to compel the Minister to desist from certain, at least, questionable facets in relation to proposals for this consultative committee.  I do not intend to weary the House by extending the arguments but I would impress upon the Minister that he may be embarking by secrecy on a dangerous course.  The one particular facet of the public service that I think is best served by the searchlight of public criticism and, indeed, by the informed investigation sometimes pursued by the Press, is in relation to complaints that can be made in connection with food, services or attention given in health institutions.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be well advised to consider carefully whether it is of practical value to a consultative body to have the paid officials of the county, namely, the county medical officer and the county surgeon, as <i>de facto</i> members of any consultative body that may in fact be investigating some of the actions of these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion that has taken place on this amendment is very revealing over a fairly wide range of country.  From my particular point of view, however, it helps to throw into perspective the seriousness of the main point upon which additional light is thrown by the Minister's amendment.  Various questions have been introduced into the discussion here both by Deputy Allen on the one hand, and by the Minister on the other.  In order to avoid facing up to the questions that are being put by some of us here and the details that are required with regard to the Minister's approach to the administration of this Bill, all kinds of innuendoes and red herrings have been dragged across the trail.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen, supported by the Minister, sneered at people from these benches on the grounds that we were showing a great interest in the position of the county manager in relation to the administration of this Act while we had shut our eyes to the position of the county manager in relation to general health administration for the last 12 or 15 years, or whatever the length of time it was.  The fact is, however, that from the time of the disclosure of the Fianna Fáil attitude towards health services, from the time of the introduction of the 1945 Act, our whole approach and our whole concern has been radically changed.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows that their approach to health administration in the 1945 Bill was such that the Bill collapsed in their hands but only after substantial and lengthy discussion here.  The 1947 Act, in which they enshrined their principles and plan and their machine of administration, as the Minister is quite aware, was challenged on constitutional grounds as well as on other grounds.  From the time the Fianna Fáil approach to health plans and health administration was fully shown, from 1945 on, naturally we were concerned very much with the position that the county manager was to occupy in the administration of these services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For purposes of red herring manufacture, the Minister suggests that the amendment before us has not been <Col N="1036" /> read by Deputies.  Deputy MacBride read sub-section (1) and in sub-section (1) it is made plain and clear that the making of any service available to any individual is a matter that neither the elected body nor the advisory council that is contemplated in this amendment will have anything to do with.  One man will be responsible for deciding any question relating to the making of any service available to an individual, that is the county manager.</P>
    <P>We are not concerned with attacking here in this Bill the county manager, either as an individual or an institution.  We are concerned with being clear as to what powers this Bill could put into the hands of an individual as county manager.  Take this particular reservation&mdash;it would be a reservation in any case as far as the power of the county manager is concerned&mdash;no person under the County Management Act as it stands, apart altogether from anything that may be mentioned in this amendment, would have any power to interfere in any way with the manager's decision in the making of any service available to an individual under this Health Bill if it is passed in the way in which the Minister contemplates, except in so far as Section 29 of the County Management Act might be brought into play and a couple of meetings of the county council might be held to issue an order to the manager to provide a certain service for a particular individual. Even then we might have the Minister in the position of standing behind the manager in the matter and annulling the local authority's attitude.  However, as I see it, Section 29 is just a way of calling in elephants to do something that ought to be done by ordinary systematic administration.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware by this time that this Bill divides the people who are likely to be affected by it into three different sections, three different millions, the lower income group, the middle income group and the higher income group.  If we take only one of the problems that are being made the responsibility of the one individual, the county manager, in this case, he will have the personal responsibility of deciding in respect of people who are <Col N="1037" /> to some small extent at one side or the other of the line dividing the 1,000,000 lower income group from the 1,000,000 middle income group.  He is the person who will have sole authority to decide whether a person at one side or the other of that particular line will have a certain service, whether it is a service by way of payment or by way of medical attention or by way of institutional attention, given to him or not.</P>
    <P>The same applies to people who are on both sides of the other dividing line between the second 1,000,000 of the middle income group and the third 1,000,000 of the higher income group.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne declares:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... I have no great fear of final decisions being handed over to one man.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He declares that in relation to the whole of the administration and the entire provisions of this Bill.  He says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a fundamental argument on the whole question of the expansion of State services as between health and social services and so on. I do not see that we should be afraid of this at all.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is at column 921, Volume 140 of the Official Debates.</P>
    <P>It is quite satisfactory to have a clear definition of Deputy Dr. Browne's attitude in this matter but we want to be equally clear.  I have no desire in any way to misrepresent Deputy Dr. Browne's attitude in this matter.  I do not think that any interest that he or any other Deputy, including the Minister, may have will be served in any way by misrepresenting our attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne, at column 922, declares:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;People are nominated here to govern the country and the activities of this House are an expression of our opinion in relation to particular matters relevant to health and social welfare and so on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The activities of this House are an expression of our opinion.&rdquo;  Deputy Dr. Browne uses that in relation to his attitude in regard to one-man rule once the man is subjected to this Department and to his approach to the <Col N="1038" /> review or the supervision of voluntary hospitals, on the other hand.</P>
    <P>One of the most remarkable activities in this House as an expression of our opinion was the passing of the Public Charitable Hospitals (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1930.  That was an Act which expressed our opinion in relation to the value of the work and the value of the tradition enshrined in our voluntary hospitals. The body that came into being as a result of that Act, subsequently confirmed in the Public Hospitals Act, 1933, or superseded by that Act, that is the Hospitals' Trust Limited, is the most remarkable piece of voluntary and private enterprise work I think we can boast of.  At any rate, it is one of the most outstanding pieces of private enterprise we can boast of and the work done in collecting moneys to assist the public hospitals was done by a most remarkable piece of private enterprise.</P>

      <P>I am relating this to the amendment.  The amendment here is for the purpose of setting up a consultative or at least an advisory body to advise the county manager, and every possible attempt has been made here by the Minister and by others to obscure the function of the manager for which this advisory body is being set up, and to a very remarkable extent, and I am making use of the discussion on this amendment to bring out in the clearest possible way that the county manager, the one-man rule that Deputy Dr. Browne states in column 921 that he has no fear of a final decision being handed over to one man&mdash;that that is the fundamental part of the legislation that we are passing through here.  When we set up a special body here, a consultative health committee for the purpose of advising the county manager I feel it is an obligation here in the House that we should clear away the obscurities that have been gathering upon the machinery for the administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am clearing the obscurity that Deputy Allen speaks of here, the attempt to convey that in our discussion and our criticism of this particular aspect of the proposed administration of this Bill we are now for political reasons interested in particular classes.  We are interested in seeing that every section of the people, particularly the people in the lower income group, will have the administration of their health service in the hands of something other than a mere State official entirely in certain circumstances under the Minister's direction.</P>

We had to be interested in very serious aspects of health proposals and health administration from the time the 1945 Bill was first introduced here; the Minister himself who brought the 1947 Act through this Dáil knows more than anybody else what constitutional and other aspects of social policy were involved and were challengeable in relation to the 1947 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>And the function and the work of that council.  It has been stated here by the Minister that the local authority will have authority to set up a council, that the council will advise the manager and that the manager will have whatever powers he has.  Now surely when we set up a council to advise a particular person we are concerned with his power, and surely when we in this particular amendment make specific mention let us say that there are certain powers of the manager which would not be interfered with&mdash;surely we are entitled to discuss those powers which are mentioned in this amendment if we want to do so.  I want just more or less in a passing way to make a reference to the fact that this consultative council will not have any power to interfere with the manager in relation to the making of any service available to any individual, and in connection with that I point out the extraordinary problem that exists if the population of this country is taken and divided by two dividing lines between them with 1,000,000 at one side, 1,000,000 in the middle and 1,000,000 at the other and here by this amendment the consultative council is expressly forbidden to have anything to do with whether people immediately on one side of the line or immediately on the other are going to be treated in a particular kind of way.  I am pointing out that not for the purpose of arguing that their powers should be of a particular kind but for the purpose of showing the fantastic approach to administration that is fundamental to the whole Bill, because this Bill gives no idea in the world as to what kind of local authority ought to administer the Bill. A Health Bill ought to be administered by some kind of local authority, and the local authority that is provided for here is the one man who has been appointed as county manager and who has all the responsibilities and all <Col N="1042" /> the duties of a local authority other than those prescribed and defined by Section 15 of the County Management Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot go into that.  It is obvious that we can only go into the power given to the county manager and the local authority by this amendment.  We cannot go back and travel over all the powers the manager has and has not in respect of those other matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does no harm to set up this consultative committee, but when you propose the provision and administration of services so closely affecting in a personal way the health of the people and when you put these powers into the hands of one man, then&mdash;even though Deputy Dr. Browne may feel that because we have the statutory machinery here for appointing this man we can control him&mdash;the more people you have looking in over his shoulder the better it will be.  Indeed, a lot of supervision and of &ldquo;looking over the shoulder&rdquo; will be necessary if these powers are ever put into the hands of one man locally.</P>

      <P>I am often asked why I do my best to obstruct the return of Fine Gael to power.  Anyone listening to the Health Bill debate has an answer to that question as there has been the most transparent filibuster over the last fortnight.  Deputy Mulcahy pointed out that the county manager is an official who will carry out the will of this House through the local authority.  It is only right that my attitude to that should be clear. Deputy Mulcahy quoted from my remarks in the debate here on the last day, column 921.  My remarks were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... I have no great fear of final decisions being handed over to one man.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is quite a different thing to hand over our decisions in relation to legislation to any group, as was done by Deputy Mulcahy's colleague, Deputy Costello, as Minister for Health, when he handed over his powers to the Medical Association, which was not a democratically elected body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins suggested, in furtherance of the argument, that the official salaried officer had no right at this committee beyond being called in.  I deprecated the arguments put forward by Deputy Esmonde and by Deputy Mulcahy, I think, suggesting that these salaried officers could not consort with the nominated members of the committee. I did not see anything wrong in it.  If these salaried officers are not to appear on the consultative committee, I would ask Fine Gael members what would they do with the county manager.  He is a paid official of the local authority.  Do they suggest he should not be on the consultative committee either?  If that is so, who is to be on it and who is to convey the wishes of the consultative committee to the local authority or to the manager?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see any objection to the paid officials being members.  It does not make a ha'porth of difference whether a man is a paid official or not; the question is whether he is of any value on the consultative or advisory committee.  He should be prepared to <Col N="1044" /> take any criticism coming to him, he should answer to the best of his ability if he can and, if he cannot, he should accept whatever censure is imposed upon him.</P>
    <P>I would urge strongly on the nonprofessional and non-medical members of the Dáil that it is terribly important that professional secrecy should be maintained.  The doctor-patient relationship is important.  All the higher medical men in England agree&mdash; and I am completely at one with them &mdash;that anything that would jeopardise the doctor-patient relationship should be deprecated.  Some of the lay members might not appreciate that, but if they do a little thinking they will realise that it would be very wrong if any of a person's personal worries, or the details of medical histories, were at the disposal of anybody.  On the local authorities, 99 per cent. of the people are intelligent and sensitive in understanding but you might get a person who would not appreciate the significance of blurting out details in such a council and do irrevocable damage to our State health services. It is one of the pitfalls which must remain, one of the pitfalls pointed out by the Medical Association and greatly exaggerated in their suggestion that the State health service could add very grave dangers to the secrecy of the doctor-patient relationship.  I think they should be denied the satisfaction of anything like that happening.</P>
    <P>Normally, so long as there is the possibility of a local representative being able to air his grievances, that is terribly important.  I completely agree with Deputy Kyne that as long as a member is in a position to air his grievances at a local authority meeting, or to air the patient's grievances, with the patient's authority, one cannot see that anything is in danger by having these meetings held privately.  I look on these committees as advisory or consultative committees. That should be their primary or main function.  I do not see any grave reason why the meetings should not be held in private, with the local authority carrying on its own functions as it does at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister for Health, on this <Col N="1046" /> section, something that is very close to what Deputy Browne has just been discussing, that is, the question of the two extra medical doctors that it is proposed should be nominated to the consultative body.  I suggest that the Minister should put in a proviso, if this section is to be left as it is, that these two doctors be not dispensary doctors or officials of the local authority.  There would be on the consultative committee a medical officer of health and a county surgeon.  If you add to them two doctors nominated by the Medical Association or by some other authority, and leave it at that, you could quite possibly get two dispensary doctors as well.  You will then have on the consultative committee three subordinates of the medical officer of health in so far as they are immediately under his control and, to a certain extent, can be subject to disciplinary measures if they either irritate or aggravate him. I do not suggest that any dispensary doctor so appointed would allow that to interfere with him, but it would be an unpleasant thing and it would at least prevent him from having complete freedom of thought and expression of opinion.</P>
      <P>I understand that amongst the things which may be discussed is whether steps should or should not be taken in regard to the immunisation of people in the county.  If the medical officer of health expresses the opinion that it should be done it will be difficult for the dispensary doctors to say other than that they agree with him.  I suggest that the Minister should put in a provision that the two doctors should not be paid officials of the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present moment they are not.  I suggest that these two doctors should not be paid officials of the local authority in the sense of being dispensary doctors or holding any other official post, but should be private practitioners.  You will then have doctors who will not be under disciplinary control to the same extent as dispensary doctors and who will view things from the private patient's <Col N="1047" /> point of view.  Very often the private patient's point of view is not considered and the matter is looked at from the State point of view.  I think the suggestion has merits in as much as you will have a variety of opinions, if it is absolutely necessary that we should have four medical men on the committee.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in present circumstances in this House there is very littIe hope of defeating any amendment the Minister brings in, but I appeal to him to consider that suggestion and, if he feels there is wisdom in it, he could bring in a further amendment to alter the position and provide that the two doctors to be nominated should be in private practice.</P>

      <P>Are we to take it that this is only a Fianna Fáil ruse?

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one important factor that we may have missed so far.  I must confess I missed it up to now.  I suppose the reason it has been missed is because we have not yet dealt with Section 63.  Section 63 says: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act or any instrument thereunder shall operate to enable the Minister to direct the giving of any service or benefit to any individual person.&rdquo;  I may be wrong, but I read that in this way, that there is no appeal to the Minister following a decision which the county manager might come to, say, as regards the making of a service available to an individual.  That is a departure, especially as far as health matters are concerned, because at present if a county manager refuses the granting of an allowance to a tubercular person there is an appeal to the Minister.  But, if Section 63 is passed, it will mean that the county manager will have the final say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> I appreciate that there must be some one person within the local authority to make decisions and to take responsibility for them.  I suggest, however, that there ought to be an appeal to such a person as the Minister, or at least a person who has been elected to this House by the people of a particular constituency and who has responsibilities to these people and therefore responsibilities to the House.  I think we ought to follow the usual practice, especially in respect of the granting of a health service or an allowance under the health services, of an appeal to the Minister where there is disagreement with the decision of the county manager in respect of this particular amendment, which is in effect a new section.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the first sub-section that the consultative committee shall not have any say in the making of any service available to an individual.  I am not advocating that the consultative committee should take these decisions themselves.  But, inasmuch as they will be representative of the elected representatives of the functional areas and will have on them as representatives the county medical officer of health, the county surgeon, and two other medical practitioners, the Minister ought to make a further change and allow the county manager to discuss any difficult or borderline cases with them.  I think there will be a lot of dissatisfaction, to say the least of it, in many cases relating to health services on the part of individuals who will believe that they have got a raw deal from the county manager.  I think the county managers themselves would welcome the idea of an appeal to some other authority, if not to the Minister, then to the consultative committees proposed here, because in very many cases local committees such as these will be able to give additional information and probably a type of advice which will be of benefit to the county managers in individual cases.</P>
    <P>I supported Deputy Kyne's plea on the last occasion that the meetings of these committees should be held in public, with this reservation, that the committees themselves should decide whether or not certain meetings should <Col N="1049" /> be public or private.  Everybody is in agreement that we do not want to disturb the doctor-patient relationship. But there is another type of relationship which exists in this country&mdash; whether it is peculiar to this country or not I do not know&mdash;and that is the constituent-public representative relationship. I will not say it is the same type of relationship as that to which Deputy Dr. Browne referred, but it is a relationship which is very secret and very guarded.  Again, as Deputy Dr. Browne stated, the vast majority of our public representatives on the county councils and other public bodies are people who will not divulge a confidence and who get the confidence of the people whom they interview from time to time.  Possibly in some respects they can give public representatives much more information than they can give a doctor on family matters. For one example, I do not think that this section would be upset to any great extent if the Minister gave power to the manager, or, if you like, to the local council, to consult with the manager on such a thing as the making of any particular service available to an individual.  If the Minister or the House does not agree that this amendment should be further amended in that way I would suggest in respect of Section 63, that the Minister provide for an appeal to him in the event of dissatisfaction by an individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Dr. Browne was speaking just now&mdash;perhaps I misunderstood him&mdash;I took him to state that the county manager would be a member of this advisory or consultative body.  I do not think that is the intention of the Minister. Perhaps the Minister might clarify that later on.  He also stressed the point that it would be natural for the officials to be there as they would be administering the scheme.  I understand Deputy Dr. Browne's point of view.  It is consistent.  It is simply this: that the State should take complete control and maintain this control. That viewpoint is quite consistent. We object to State control only in so far as it is absolutely necessary and this consultative or advisory council as I said before seems <Col N="1050" /> to be a step in the right direction because it is a council set up of democratically-elected representatives, and public representatives of different opinions to consult or advise on matters appertaining to health, a local council and a most desirable thing. Our opposition to it is this.  We have made several objections and we are not alone in this.  These objections have been made by other speakers, by other Opposition Deputies as well as the Fine Gael Party.  Whether they make them or not Fine Gael intends to state its case and maintain its principles. and is surely entitled to do that.  First of all, we maintain that the county medical officer of health is <i>ipso facto</i> an official with delegated powers from the county manager.  This council is set up for the purpose of giving advice or considering actions taken by the county manager in his function as health authority.  Is it not the height of nonsense to suggest that the medical officer of health who in the majority of cases will be acting in the person of the county manager with powers delegated to him should be a member of this council?  Surely that nullifies the whole thing straight away?  I cannot see any argument against that one way or the other.  It is quite the usual thing on local authorities at meetings to have the permanent officials there acting in their capacities ready to give their views if they are required.  If the county medical officer of health should be present as an official it is quite possibly conceivable that some action he has taken may be under discussion or consultation.  It surely is going to be embarrassing to this advisory council if they are going to carry out their full functions, if they have to criticise one of their own members.  I think they are handicapped from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The other point we object to is Section 6 and it is very easy for the Minister to meet that point.  I know Deputy Dr. Browne cannot agree with this point and he is consistent with his principle in that he believes in complete State control.  Sub-section (6) of amendment 66 states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Every meeting of a consultative <Col N="1051" /> health committee shall be held in private.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has produced all sorts of arguments as to why consultative bodies' meetings should not be held in public.  I freely admit there are occasions when they should not be held in public and that sometimes it might be desirable that they take place in private but Section 6 says they &ldquo;shall be held in private.&rdquo;  In other words, this is a secretive committee and that is where it defeats its own ends.  It is put there for a purpose, a democratically-constituted body, for the purpose of defending the rights of citizens, or the local people concerned who are deriving benefits from these improved health services administered by one man who is the centre of the local authority, the one man who controls the whole thing. That is admitted now.  He is the county manager and this body is for the purpose of advising him and if they are going to meet in secret, does it not nullify their functions straight away?  The Minister is giving with one hand and taking away with the other. This consultative body is no good provided the proviso remains that they shall meet in private.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the publicity derived will be sufficient to nullify the effect of the solo control but it is no argument when you keep the clause that they shall meet in private.  The Minister could quite easily alter the case by saying they may meet in private.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne was worried that there might be possibly some interference with the doctor-patient relationship but when this advisory council meets I do not think they will discuss the particular ailments of people or particular treatments.  They may discuss the facts as to why a certain person should have been sent to a hospital and was not sent to that hospital but that does not reveal anything in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an individual case. They cannot even discuss that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Dr. <Col N="1052" /> Browne will explain how he feared the doctor-patient relations will be interfered with?  I think it is a great pity the Minister does not try to meet us on this.  It is no use purporting to offer something.  Obviously the consultative council is a new idea.  It comes in before Section 44.  The principle is good but the way the Minister is tying the hands of this council would nullify its functions altogether.  It would be very easy for him to meet us on this point.</P>
      <P>There is no need to stress the point made by Deputy Kyne in regard to dispensary doctors.  There is a certain amount to be said for it, provided there would be any other doctors than State or dispensary doctors if the intentions of Deputy Dr. Browne and those who support the Fianna Fáil Government are put into effect.  It seems to me we are going to have whole-time doctors and State officials, and as far as the private practitioner goes, you will not find him anywhere unless you go to a foreign country.  I think Deputy Kyne can forget that, although if we had private doctors I think they would be the best people to sit on this council.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister could very easily change that sub-section (6) from &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I do not say that we will agree with it then or that we would be any more in love with this state of affairs that exists in regard to health than we are now, but it would be a slight improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be worth while for me to waste time trying to argue with Deputy Dr. Esmonde because he apparently believes that they will not do good work unless the Press is present to hear them speaking.  I think people do good work when the Press is not there&mdash; even, in fact, better work.  Men of the type of Deputy Dr. Esmonde forget about the publicity part of it and settle down and do good work.  That is my point about not having the Press present.  I think Deputy Dr. Esmonde should try and forget about propagandist opportunities for these committees and try and settle down and do good work.  It is a most extraordinary <Col N="1053" /> thing that we spent two hours on the Second Reading and we are spending four days on a comparatively minor amendment.  It goes to prove the rumour that is around that Fine Gael are boasting that they will not let this Bill through.  We will see whether they will or not.  That is their boast at any rate.  Evidently they are making a good attempt, spending four hours on a minor amendment of this kind that I think would not matter whether it was put in or left out.  But they have spent four days discussing it and Deputy Mulcahy is trying to bring into it the county manager.  I know Deputy Mulcahy a long time but I can never make up my mind whether he is stupid or dishonest.  I think it is a combination of both.  It is difficult enough to deal with a dishonest person who is not stupid, because he is sometimes amusing but when you get a dishonest person who is stupid as well as dishonest it is very hard to put up with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not tried to obscure the position as Deputy Mulcahy alleges.  I have pointed out over and over again that the local authority will adopt the scheme, give a general direction as to the Way in which it will be administered and then the county manager has his functions in carrying out the administration of the scheme.  There is nothing obscure about that.  Maybe there is in Deputy Mulcahy's mind but to the ordinary Deputy there should be nothing obscure about it.  If the local authority adopts the scheme it will give general directions how it is to be administered and then the county manager takes over the administration of the scheme.  This committee then comes in to advise the county manager.  It would be ridiculous to suggest that you should have the committee to advise the county council.  You might as well suggest that you should have a committee to advise the Dáil.  Nobody would attempt to set up a committee to advise the county council.  It was simply because some people thought that the county manager in the secrecy of his own office might do certain things that should be open to review that this advisory committee was suggested and is being set up to <Col N="1054" /> advise the county manager.  I wonder am I being obscure to anybody when I put it that way?  Despite the fact that all this has been clearly explained before Deputy Mulcahy comes in here and starts the discussion all over again. He has been at this amendment now for four days&mdash;I suppose under orders of his Party that this Bill will not be allowed to pass.  He is doing his job well so far but we shall see who will win in the end.  It is very amusing to hear Deputy Mulcahy talk about the freedom of the individual.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see the only matter we have to decide here is whether the amendment should be inserted in the Bill or not.  That issue could be decided long before now.  If it is rejected well and good but if it goes in, all these refinements as to whether doctors or the county medical officers should be members of the committee or not, could be dealt with on the next stage by suitable amendment.  Apparently Deputy Dr. Esmonde has been forbidden to put down an amendment by a Party decision but some other Party could put in an amendment to deal with these matters.  All we have to decide at the moment is whether this amendment should go into the Bill or not.</P>
    <P>One point raised by Deputy Kyne or by Deputy Corish had reference to the question of individual benefits.  I am strongly of opinion that the county manager or somebody must decide who is to get benefit and who should not get it.  Again I say the county council should not be called upon to make that decision.  I do not think any person who applies for benefit would like to have his case discussed in all its details at the county council meeting. He would not like to have everything about the family circumstances made public at a county council meeting.  I think the individual concerned would prefer to have his case decided without publicity.  It is a matter that should be decided by an officer of some sort. As the law stands at present under the County Management Act and other Acts that decision rests with the county manager and he has been deciding cases of that type for the last 12 years. As Deputy Allen has already pointed <Col N="1055" /> out, when it was a question of deciding whether a member of the lower income group should get benefit or not, Fine Gael did not take any interest in that matter but now when it is a case of a person belonging to the middle income group Fine Gael has become very anxious about the whole thing, about the county manager's powers and so on.  I think the county manager is as well able to deal with cases arising from the middle income group as he dealt with cases from the lower income group in the past.</P>
    <P>It is provided that the members of the advisory committee cannot raise an individual case and I think rightly so because if they could raise such a case it would follow that they would have power to ask the county manager to produce the evidence or the facts about the case which caused him to decide it one way or the other.  That would be wrong I think because if an individual gives information about his means and perhaps even about his ailment, whatever it might be, the details of that information should not be passed round and discussed in such a way that every person present can hear them.  On the other hand I am quite sure that if any member asked the county manager why so-and-so was refused treatment, the county manager would at least give the advisory committee the general principles upon which he acted and say that in his opinion the person concerned according to these general principles was not entitled to benefit.  It would then be a matter for the advisory committee to make up their minds as to whether that was a fair decision or not.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Corish pointed out, that under Section 63 a person will not be entitled to appeal from the county manager's decision to the Minister. Persons affected by a decision of the county manager have such an appeal at the present time in connection with the infectious diseases maintenance allowance but I do not think it has done very much good.  A few cases come along occasionally but I do not think the Minister has ever given an order turning down the county manager.  I cannot speak for my predecessor <Col N="1056" /> but so far as I am concerned when such an appeal came before me, I wrote to the county manager stating that I got such a letter and asked him what were the facts of the case.  I think on one or two occasions I wrote back to the county manager and said that I thought it was a case into which he might look again.  That was as far as ever I had to go.  I suppose that any Minister who is there can go over the facts without any right of appeal to him and I think it is better that this right of appeal should be withdrawn. However, that is a question that can be discussed on Section 63; it does not arise on this amendment.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is very much use appealing to the House; I suppose it is not very much use appealing to Fine Gael.  They have made up their minds that they will not allow the Bill through as far as they are concerned. I suppose they have got to keep on talking as stupidly as they have been talking and keep away from the Bill as far as possible but I would appeal to members of the House, other than those of Fine Gael, to be a little more considerate.  As I have pointed out, we have now spent four days on this amendment which is an ameadment of a rather minor type.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I have to intervene again but the Minister did not deal with the question which I raised in regard to the county medical officer being retained as a member of the committee.  Another point upon which I should like some information is this.  If in the event of this consultative committee wishing to ventilate a grievance, can the Minister indicate what avenue they have for ventilating that grievance? So far as I can read the sub-section they have no right to ventilate a grievance. The meetings are held in secret and if they object to anything that the county manager as the health authority does, what redress have they got?  So far as I can see none whatever. The Minister has not clarified that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a pity that the Minister should have tried to decry his own amendment by describing <Col N="1057" /> it as one of minor importance. Frankly, I do not think it is because the principle embodied in it is one which the Labour Party tried to have embodied in an earlier amendment. We have no very great objection to the amendment as it stands, because we accept the position that the committee is intended to give advice in general matters to the county manager and that machinery will have to be provided for that purpose.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister is stressing too much the role of the consultative committee in advising the county manager on the purely technical aspect of giving effect to the policies decided by the council, and too little the role that can be played by the consultative committee in helping the council and the county manager to get a wider and more general acceptance of the services that will be made available to the citizens.  It is from that point of view that I would suggest that the Minister should permit the consultative committee to decide themselves when they should have private meetings.  It seems to me that the point made by Deputy Dr. Esmonde that they should have the power of utilising the Press as a means of defence against a county manager is not very effective.  If they have any difference with him, their recourse is to the county council and they can very readily invoke that power.  There may be occasions on which both the county manager and the committee want to discuss some new service.  To the extent that it is envisaged by the amendment, the committee can, in fact, be composed of a number of persons who are not members of a local health authority, who are not doctors but who are men and women interested in public health generally and prepared to devote their time to it.  To the extent that they would associate themselves with, say, a manager at a meeting of the committee, in discussing and supporting the introduction of a new service and examining in detail its value to the citizens and generally indicating the value of that service, it should be possible for them on such an occasion to invoke the assistance of the Press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1058" /> All the argument about bringing individual cases before the committee and having a person's intimate affairs discussed at the meeting, in front of the Press, and weakening the doctor-patient relationship, and so forth, is cod.  That does not happen at all. The Minister is putting up arguments and knocking them down again.  At least this amendment provides a connection between the full-time officer and the public-spirited people who, for a long time, have been interested in public welfare and public health and are prepared to associate themselves with a committee such as this and desire to assist the health authority and the full-time officers in making such a service not merely effective but accepted as well.  From the history of vaccination, we know that it takes a good deal of time, sometimes, to get the public to accept a service.  The fact that the Department of Health are carrying out a campaign of advertisement in relation to immunisation against diphtheria proves that advertisement has an effect on public opinion.  I know of no more effective way than of a committee like this, constituted not only of medical experts but also of those directly engaged in the administration of the service plus a number of men and women who carry weight generally in the county, meeting in public, with the Press present, to consider and deliberate, in consultation with the county manager, new services proposed to be provided, and explaining in detail the benefits of these services.  If they meet behind closed doors, the Press will eventually get the report on the service but it will not carry with it the support of the members of such a committee.  It will be a cold statement from the manager and, in many cases, it will be accepted with great reserve.  I think it would be better from the Minister's point of view if he permitted the committee to decide, in their own good sense, whether or not they will have the Press.</P>
    <P>My second point is in connection with the number of meetings to be held per year.  Why should a committee of responsible men and women be confined to six meetings a year unless they get permission from the <Col N="1059" /> health authority or the county manager to hold more than that number? Surely they are not children.  If they feel it is necessary to meet oftener than six times in the one year then I think it should be possible for them to do so.  The less restriction that is placed on this committee the better.  They should be put in the position of being invited not only to advise the manager on general matters but to give him that advice as sensible men and women, with a sense of their responsibility, and these restrictions both in regard to the number of meetings and the exclusion of the Press are not, I think, in character with the whole of the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite welcome to discuss my stupidity and my dishonesty if he thinks that it will help him in any way to make himself clear in this House.  I should like to assure the Minister that if he would appreciate our approach to this Bill he might save himself from wandering into these directions and he might get through his business, such as it is, a bit quicker.</P>
      <P>I am not concerned with delaying this Bill so much as I am concerned with bringing out with clarity what the Minister's proposals are.  I am not concerned with amending or improving in any way the Minister's proposals because the Minister's proposals are made on such an unsound basis that I do not think that any attempt to improve them or to rectify any minor details in them would be of any use at all.  They are based upon a flat-footed attitude by the Minister.  He is introducing proposals that are in flagrant disregard of the desire of the medical profession of the country to be consulted and to have their opinions taken and their experience understood.</P>

      <Col N="1060" /> At column 920 of the Official Report of the 9th inst., Deputy Dr. Browne is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Consultation is an accepted part of the control and management of industries, factories and institutions for the past 20 years, even in backward countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here we are introducing a health scheme in face of a statement published by the medical fraternity as recently as the 18th March last.  The following resolutions were passed unanimously at a meeting of the Irish Medical Association held in the Royal College of Surgeons in regard to their attitude to the Health Bill of 1952.</P>

      <P>It probably is.  I will not mind reading out the declaration but I will state the fact.  I want to tell the Minister again, so as to be clear in regard to our attitude and so as to help him to speed up his work, if he wants it speeded up, that we are concerned with bringing out the facts by such question and discussion as we can have in this House.  If the Minister would give the House the clearest possible information as to his proposals then there would not be so much time wasted.  However, when we have Deputy Allen, on the one hand, and the Minister, on the other hand, pretending that the local authority have powers in respect of health administration which they have not then, naturally, there is persistence on our part in putting questions and in pointing to facts which, in the interests of the Minister's proposal itself and particularly in the interests of the public, we must do.  Deputy Dr. Browne declares that because this House gives, through a statute, power to one man to carry out a certain scheme of administration, it makes it all right&mdash;that we have power to remove the man at any time and, therefore, it is not only pure and perfect democracy but a complete safeguard of anything that democracy would look for in connection with the freedom of the individual and the services he may require.  That is all <Col N="1061" /> nonsense and so much is it nonsense that Deputy Dr. Browne is driven to take up the attitude that not only does he stand four-square with the Minister on this Bill and on the 1947 Bill but he has to go back to 1922 to say that he stands with the Minister.</P>

This proposal is that the consultative council shall be set up with the restrictions imposed on it here for the sole purpose of advising a man who is the only man with any power to administer the Bill, subject only to the normal power of the local authority to strike the rate.</P>

      <Col N="1062" /> I could traverse some of the statements made by Deputy Allen to show how necessary it is to clear up the misunderstandings that Deputy Allen would like to create and go back to the position in which the Minister, who is handing over these powers to what he calls frum time to time the local authority, told the House a couple of days ago that he did not know what the reserved functions were, whether they applied to a county manager or county council.  These are the circumstances in which we are trying, not to improve a measure conceived in an absurd frame of mind and which cannot get into operation, but to get clear for the House the facts of the situation so that we may be clear in our discussions.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been talking about our stupidity and our dishonesty, but surely when the Minister puts a particular clause in a Bill, that clause has a purpose.  If the Minister has any function in relation to the measure, he has the function and the responsibility of putting before the House the circumstances in which he thinks it necessary to embody such a clause in the Bill, of stating what is the purpose of the section and what is it intended to deal with and giving us, if we require it, an idea of what procedure will be adopted to put the section into operation.</P>

      <P>Surely nothing could be clearer than the section.  If the local authority propose to make an agreement with any person or body for the provision of services, they will be subject to any requirements specified by the Minister.  There would, in the first instance, be general regulations laid down.  It is usual to stipulate that certain things must have the approval of <Col N="1064" /> the Minister.  Certain agreements made under the regulations shall be, I take it, subject to approval.  I do not know that this section requires any particular explanation.  In my experience, after four days' explanation Deputies opposite seem to be as wise now as they were in the beginning and I do not see why I should waste four more days explaining this section.</P>

Surely we are entitled to an answer to that?  I am not being difficult.  Will these things be done by regulation, by an ordinary letter written by the Minister or through the medium of the telephone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy has not had much experience of local authorities.  General regulations will cover a good deal, as they always do, but it may be that certain things will require the approval of the Minister. I could not at the moment state any particular type of agreement that would need such approval.  Local authorities making agreements with doctors in connection with maternity services would certainly be covered by the general regulations laid down and the same agreement would be entered into with every individual doctor. That will apply, too, so far as I can see to agreements with voluntary hospitals.  But there may be very special cases where the regulations will not cover specific instances; a local authority may need the specialist service of some particular doctor in a specific case in which the existing regulations would not cover the doctor in question and in that connection the Minister then will lay down certain regulations by letter or by circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Minister has not yet answered the question I asked.  This section provides that the local authority shall in certain circumstances comply with the requirements specified by the Minister. Now, are those requirements to be specified by way of regulation, by Way <Col N="1065" /> of letter, by way of telephone communication or what?  A regulation made by the Minister must be laid on the Table of the House and, because of that, the House will have some opportunity of expressing its views as to the desirability, or otherwise, of any regulation made by the Minister.  On the other hand, if this section enables the Minister to compel a local authority to adopt a certain course by letter or by telephone communication, the House is thereby deprived of the one safeguard there is in relation to the powers of the Minister to order local authorities to pursue a certain course.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can explain it any more than I have explained it already.  Generally speaking, regulations will cover most matters, but I cannot at the moment say that regulations will cover all cases that may arise.  Specific cases may arise which will not be covered by regulations and in such cases the local authority might be or could be directed by the Minister to observe certain conditions in making a certain agreement.</P>

      <P>This section then gives the Minister power to make a ministerial Order without reference to the Oireachtas.  Is that not the position? There will be certain regulations in certain districts.  The bulk of the regulations governing the administration of these envisaged health services will be universal, but in certain areas there will be differences in the regulations. I take it what the Minister has in mind is that&mdash;I may be wrong in this&mdash;he may consider a certain type of service should be given in a certain district or something carried out by the local authority which is not already included in regulations: this section then gives the Minister power by ministerial Order to compel the local authority to put something into effect forthwith without reference to the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister like to tell us something about Section 45?   This is a long section about the training of disabled persons.  Does the Minister intend to have these persons trained locally?  Is there any <Col N="1067" /> machinery already in existence to deal with these people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a new power being conferred on the local authority; indeed, it is a new obligation.  This section will be operated by regulation; and under regulations made by the Minister local authorities will be expected to provide facilities for the training of disabled persons for suitable employment in relation to their condition of health, ete.  They will also be expected to help in finding employment for these people when rehabilitated. That is the first part of this section.  I have not fully made up my mind yet but I got advice from various people and my idea is to have a central committee advising on this whole subject of rehabilitation.  The central committee would give advice and lay down a scheme for local authorities to follow.  The local authorities would also have a voluntary committee composed of certain people, perhaps some members of the council and some others who would be helpful in looking after this matter of rehabilitation and who would be especially helpful in finding employment for the rehabilitated people.  The medical officer of health would, of course, be responsible for the medical part of the treatment.</P>
      <P>There is also a sub-section which puts the onus on the local authorities to provide the necessary equipment and so on.  Then the Minister may make regulations with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance providing for the payment of maintenance allowances to the persons specified in sub-section (5) of the section.  In sub-section (5) the persons specified as being eligible for maintenance allowances are those over 16 years of age who are incapacitated to the extent of their not being able to earn a living for themselves and have no means. That is qualified to the extent to which the person's family should look after them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a new scheme&mdash;no new principle is involved&mdash;introduced for the first time to look after the disabled people in this country.  When I was bringing the Social Welfare Bill before the Dáil, I drew attention to this.  I said I <Col N="1068" /> thought we had now succeeded in covering all the different classes that needed help from the State to meet the ordinary hazards of life but that there was one class, this particular class of disabled people, who were not insured, who had no means and who were incapacitated from earning a living and who should be covered by some scheme.  It seemed more appropriate that they should be taken in under this Health Bill because the patients suffering&mdash;from infectious disease already have this scheme at their disposal.  This is an extension of the scheme, which refers to infectious disease, to other members of the population who are disabled and unable to make a living for themselves.  I am not able to go any further than that at the moment.  It requires a good deal of thought and so on.</P>
    <P>One thing I am very keen on is that the local authorities and the Minister should have the assistance of voluntary organisations in working this scheme out.  I think it will be necessary to have a central committee composed of various people Who would be interested in this subject and, perhaps, people who have knowledge of this subject to advise on the best scheme to be drawn up for the local authorities.  Again, I think that the local authority will in turn require a voluntary committee to advise them on the administration of the scheme and in placing people in employment.  As a matter of fact, when we come to that question, it may be necessary to have more than one voluntary committee in a county.  It may be necessary to have them in various places so that they can help in procuring employment for disabled people.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will realise that a person who is suffering from some physical defect may be quite as good a worker in some occupation or another as the person who is physically fit but the employer is always reluctant to take a person of that type into his employment.  It will require a lot of persuasion and a little appealing to his better senses and so on to get him to help in placing these people in employment when they are rehabilitated. I think that really covers the <Col N="1069" /> section as far as I have made any progress in getting it ready to put into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>This is probably one of the most useful and constructive provisions of this Bill and one which certainly deserves the support of the House.  I agree entirely with the views expressed by the Minister in regard to the necessity for some advisory body and also for enlisting the co-operation of voluntary organisations to make it effective.  I do not know, however, whether the Minister has really examined the section very carefully. Sub-section (5) seems to nullify a lot of the provisions of the section.  Sub-section (5) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The persons referred to in subsections (3) and (4) of this section are disabled persons over 16 years of age who are unable to provide for their own maintenance and whose relatives within the meaning of this sub-section are unable to provide maintenance for them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What does &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; signify in that sense?  Is it the old poor law definition or is it some new definition? I can quite well visualise a number of cases where a person's family might actually be able to feed and clothe a boy or girl who is deformed, badly injured or blind, but might not be able to afford the necessary treatment in regard to occupational therapy.  I do not know whether I have made myself clear to the Minister.  Maintenance is one thing.  A family might easily be able to pay for the actual food and clothing for a youngster of 17 or 18 years of age, but be unable to afford the course to have that youngster trained in an occupation that he could pursue later on, because most of the training in respect of persons who are physically defective is specialised and is fairly expensive.  I do not know whether the Minister intends this section to cover blind persons or not. As the section is framed, I think it would include blind persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It imposes an additional function on the local authority.  If that is so, I do not know whether it is wise to have an age limit of 16 years.  In the case of blind persons the main problem is to train them from an early age.  As the section stands, I think it precludes the local authority from making provisions for the training of a blind child of ten or 12 years.  It is really at that age that training is particularly important.</P>

      <P>The problem in connection with the blind is that the actual cost of teaching the Braille system to a blind child and teaching him the general use of his other senses is quite an expensive process which can only be carrisd out in a few places in the country.  I think it would be of tremendous benefit if this section could include blind children and place on the local authority the responsibility of defraying the cost of having that child trained.</P>
      <P>I take it, too&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister has considered this, or whether it may not be covered somewhere else in the Bill under an omnibus section&mdash;that, in many cases, a local authority will be enabled to provide the necessary training itself. Perhaps there should be power given for a local authority to provide, jointly with other local authorities, for the training visualised in the section.  For instance&mdash;I am sure the Minister had in mind the case of children affected by polio&mdash;it might be feasible for each local authority to have a training centre of its own.  You might have only two or three training centres altogether.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has considered if <Col N="1071" /> enough power is given in the Bill to enable local authorities to provide such centres, or whether it would be wise to include a further enabling sub-section to enable a local authority to arrange with other local authorities to provide such training.  I think the Minister should consider fairly carefully whether it is wise to include this age limit of 16, because the mere fact that it is included will mean that a local authority will have no power to provide training for a child under 16 though, in many cases, it would be highly desirable that such training should be provided for it.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy MacBride that the sentiments expressed in the section are excellent if they are ever capable of implementation. I am afraid that will not depend solely on the goodwill of the Minister which, I am sure, is there in full. Speaking from a certain amount of experience of dealing with rehabilitated persons, I am afraid I cannot see that this section will help to any great extent until we reach the position when our numbers of unemployed will be very much smaller than they are at present, that is the number of able-bodied persons who are able and willing to work and who cannot find work. As far as I can see, in attempting to rehabilitate persons you are going to be up against that problem of having so many able-bodied men, able and willing to work, who cannot find work. Consequently, there is bound to be great difficulty in trying to place a disabled person in any kind of employment against a healthy person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the section because it will give the Minister power to encourage local authorities to set about trying to rehabilitate disabled persons by this extra provision of extending the rehabilitation facilities, not only to the persons whose disablement is due to infectious diseases, but to those suffering from poliomyelitis, to the paralysed child and those suffering from general disability of whom we have so many throughout the country.  Their very serious distress is due to the fact that there is no such provision as this in any of our existing health legislation. While, however, we are faced with the <Col N="1072" /> fact that we have 50,000, 60,000 or 70,000 unemployed, healthy persons, I am afraid that the disabled person is going to have very little hope of competing against them, even though he is highly trained and skilled in some occupation or other.  The employer, with his eye on profits, is going to go for the healthy man who can give him a full day's work or a full week's work. I am afraid the majority of employers will do that, though, I agree, some of them are magnificent.  They are very good; but, generally speaking, the employer is going to take the man who can give the best output for the money he pays him.  These are hard facts.</P>
    <P>There is another point to be borne in mind in this connection.  It is this, that in this particular matter, the State itself&mdash;that is to say, ourselves in our representative capacity&mdash;is not above reproach in relation to the rehabilitation of disabled persons.  I am afraid that so far as State&mdash;local authority&mdash;institutions are concerned, they are too rigid and too inflexible in their consideration of these problems. Personally, I find that it is much easier&mdash;my opponents can take this for what it is worth&mdash;to get voluntary boards to consider the problem of disabled persons than it is to get the local authorities to do so.  I am speaking specifically on this from the point of view of those whose disablement is due to an infectious disease.  My point is that the local authorities are too rigid and too inflexible in their consideration of these problems.  There are many individual examples of that to which I could refer the Minister. In my opinion, the local authorities appear to be bound too much by considerations relating to the superannuation code&mdash;that is, on the question of giving permanent and full-time employment to disabled nurses, disabled gardeners, porters, telephone assistants and clerical assistants of the secretarial type.  We cannot afford, therefore to be too hard or too critical of private enterprise or of industrialists in relation to this problem if we leave ourselves open to what, in my view, is the legitimate charge of being particularly hard-hearted ourselves where State institutions are concerned. <Col N="1073" /> That certainly is true of any local authority institution of which I have any knowledge.</P>
    <P>There is one other consideration which, I think, is important.  It is referred to by Deputy Larkin and Deputy Kyne in their amendment.  I hope that the Minister covered it in his references to the Bill&mdash;that is, that the trade unions will be consulted, or will be part of the consultative body, as regards the type of training&mdash;and the type of person to be trained&mdash; which will be provided.  It is absolutely imperative that trade union representation should be included on any consultative body.  Speaking from my own experience, one of the difficulties which trade unions appeared to find themselves up against was that if they had many of their members idle, men who were quite capable and competent to do work, and in such a situation accepted the principle of a disabled person being employed on a particular type of work in some particular institution, it would mean putting an able-bodied man out of work.

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Estimate the last evening I had come to the point of dealing more specifically with some of the important matters in connection with the overall policy on agriculture.  I emphasised the importance of one particular crop, namely, the potato crop.  While we all appreciate the wisdom of wheat growing, there are parts of the country, <Col N="1074" /> particularly around West Cork and in other areas, where it might not be so suitable for the farmers to adopt a policy of wheat growing.  I would expect the farming community to realise the importance of wheat growing but not to the detriment of other essential crops.</P>
      <P>If we take the report submitted by the Minister in his opening statement, we will find that comparing the years 1939 and 1952, the total acreage under potatoes alone has gone down.  That also applies to other important items. Whatever may be said by the Minister and his Government about the inter-Party system of government, the figures as submitted here show clearly a reduction in the potato crop in the year 1952 as against any of the three years of the inter-Party Government. The point I am trying to make is that there is more than wheat growing involved in the general picture of agriculture. For instance, the figures submitted show a reduction in total corn crops for the year 1952.  In the case of root and green crops if we compare 1952 as against 1949 and 1950 the same applies.</P>
      <P>I could go on with many such comparisons, but I assure the Minister and the House that it is not my intention to praise one system and condemn another.  We have been listening to a very important member of the Government, none other than the Minister for External Affairs, who did nothing but try to draw a Deputy of the Labour Party into stating a preference for one policy as against another.  What we are interested in in the Labour Party as regards agriculture is not alone pursuing a progressive policy but being-prepared to say without fear of contradiction or without hesitation that agricultural policy is not solely for the benefit of the agricultural community or of the consumers.  It must be based on an honest approach and an endeavour to help all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again taking these figures submitted by the Minister, in the case of milch cows in 1950 as against 1952, a reduction is evident.  Even after two years of the operation of the Government's policy, agriculture has not shown the wonderful or complete change-over to a new era of prosperity about which <Col N="1075" /> we had been told by some members of the Government.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to deal with and in relation to which much has been spoken inside and outside this House for a long time past is the question of milk supplies and prices.  In this regard, we must be prepared to fix a price, not for a few months, but over a longer period.  That, to my mind, is the kernel of the situation in regard to milk supplies.  The producer must know where he stands.  We must also consider the problem of the consumer in the City of Dublin, in Cork City and in the various towns and villages.  It is quite evident from information in various parts of our constituency that owing to the price of milk many families with a large number of young children find it absolutely impossible to supply sufficient milk for those children.</P>
    <P>The members of the House have been speaking on a very important item up to a few minutes ago but the Government and all the members here must study agricultural problems in a more determined fashion.  It is not sufficient for any member or Party to take the side of the agricultural community in an endeavour to get their support.  We have a responsibility, a responsibility which, perhaps, the Minister for External Affairs when speaking on this Estimate, was trying deride.  However, until we are prepared to mend our system of agriculture, particularly in relation to milk supplies, we are failing in that duty.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's absence.  I mentioned that it is totally unfair that it is not made feasible for farmers to go in for any particular breeds of cows they wish to select.  There is victimisation at the present time as there has been over the past 20 or 30 years.  The farming community are at a disadvantage by this victimisation in regard to certain breeds as against others.  The people in the towns and cities are also victimised because they must pay the penny or 2d. in the gallon which may be given to farmers at any particular time.  As well as being a problem for the farmer it is a problem for the consumer.  That problem, in my opinion, <Col N="1076" /> can be eased greatly if we are prepared to extend facilities to farmers in relation to certain breeds, such as Friesians, or any of the other strains.</P>
    <P>Hanging on to the dual policy which at present operates, may be all right if we follow a beef policy, but the problem of the consumer also must be considered.  I believe that the price of milk is undoubtedly connected with the low yield which is so noticeable at present.</P>
    <P>Apart from the reference to the half-holiday, no mention was made in the Minister's opening statement to agricultural workers.  People bemoan the fact that they cannot get agricultural workers.  Very many of them, when they were able to get them, expected them to work for almost slave wages. They failed to realise their responsibility to these workers.  Certainly, that did not apply in all cases.  It strikes me very forcibly that it is the large Iand-owners in particular areas that I know who are guilty of abuses in dealing with workers.  If agricultural workers are not available in many areas it is because wages and conditions have not been anything like they should have been.</P>
    <P>Very often a particular Deputy, whose name I will not mention as he is not here at the moment, emphasises that agricultural workers should receive £6 a week.  It is quite simple to use such catch cries.  It is not a matter of what farm workers should get; it is what they are getting that is important.</P>
    <P>While the Agricultural Wages Board have done their work in their own limited way, in many ways it would be much more beneficial for the agricultural worker and the agricultural community, particularly those who are farseeing and wise enough to accept present-day policy as between labour and employers, to have a system on the lines of the Labour Court.  The Minister may refuse, as his predecessor did when we asked that the proceedings at the meetings of the Agricultural Wages Board be published.  I see no reason for that refusal.  I fail to understand why the right is denied to the Press to publish these meetings.  If some of <Col N="1077" /> the things that happen at these meetings were reported, it would certainly be more humane.  If important meetings between employers and workers can be reported I cannot see why meetings of the Agricultural Wages Board should not be published, particularly having regard to the fact that there is State money involved in calling meetings of the board.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the amount of work to be done, tribute should be paid to the inspectors of the Agricultural Wages Board.  There is not a sufficient number of inspectors employed.  If the benefits of the weekly half-holiday, annual holidays and proper wages are to be afforded to all agricultural workers, the whole system of the Agricultural Wages Board should be investigated and, if necessary, altered to suit present conditions.</P>
    <P>I would particularly draw the Minister's attention to the fact that when Irish-bred horses are successful in races in other countries, it seems to be a general policy of the people in England to claim that the horses had been bred in England.  Whether the horse wins in England or on the Continent or in America, we are put in the background. I would be anxious that through the Minister's Department such false information should be flatly contradicted every time it is published. Credit should be given to this country when it is entitled to credit.</P>
    <P>To sum up my remarks on the Estimate on the 24th June and this evening, I believe that the overall policy on agriculture should be embodied in a three-in-one policy.  The three things that must be considered are the producer, the consumer and exports.  If we are solely concerned with one particular branch, we are bound to fail.  If we restrict our efforts to helping the producers at the expense of the consumers we will not have efficient agriculture. We cannot completely line up with the consumers in the home market to the detriment of the producers.  One must be coupled with the other.  I dealt with exports on the last occasion.  I tried to stress the importance of adopting and improving a system amongst farmers of co-operative selling.  From the time the produce leaves the farm until it reaches the shop to be bought <Col N="1078" /> by the consumer there are too many side shows, as it were, on the road.  It could be that because of the operation of all these middlemen the price is not suitable to the farmer himself and the agricultural community as a whole. Then they complain when they hear of the price charged in retail shops, and also the consumer is bound to complain when he hears of the cost of production in some cases as against the price charged in the shops.  Here you have the two ends of the scale, but the difficulty is that between the two of them there are undoubtedly too many profiteers stepping in to the detriment of the producer and the consumer.</P>
    <P>If we are trying either to formulate or to support a policy on agriculture I believe it is important for us to be honest in our approach to it and to be sincere, either in our criticism or otherwise.  On the 2nd July, in column 488, an Independent Deputy in this House, in the course of his remarks, mentioned that the Labour Party apparently speaking on agriculture wanted the agriculturists to get artificially depressed prices for their produce.  According to the Official Report of 24th June, 1953, in column 1937, a Labour Deputy in this House&mdash; I happen to have been this Deputy&mdash; was speaking, and then this Independent Deputy found it suitable apparently to take completely out of their context words spoken on agriculture here.  His line quite evidently is: &ldquo;Of course, export all we can and let the home market look out for itself&rdquo;.  The speaker on that occasion has more reason to be connected perhaps with agriculture than I as a member of the Labour Party have, but he must know as I know that if we are to adopt a system of complete exports without protecting the home market, in some years to come if, please God, peace will continue, the result will be a danger of a fall in prices on the export market owing to competition from other countries; and are we going to leave our agricultural community here in such a position that, while they may reap good rewards for a couple of years, after that, owing to world-wide depressed prices, they must fall with all the other people who will fall <Col N="1079" /> simply because they are dealing in the export market?</P>
    <P>I will not repeat what I said on that occasion, but I believe that for the farmers co-operative efforts are essential in trying to do the utmost we can for all concerned.  The one way we can help to protect the home market is by being prepared in a co-operative system to give a fair and just price to the producer.  Although some members may not be in favour of it, if it is possible and suitable for us to export even under State services and gain thereby, I fail to see why we cannot, by subsidisation of the prices of butter and milk on the home market, help the home consumer and, in particular, to help the farmer.  There should be a situation whereby the farmers will have one market that will always be at their doorsteps, and that is the home market.</P>
    <P>I finish on that point, saying what the policy of the Labour Party is irrespective of how any particular Independent Deputy may wish to twist it&mdash;a fair, just and sensible price for the farming community, but at the same time protection for the consumers who undoubtedly are entitled to fair consideration in the home market as well as anyone else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told by statesmen in many parts of the country that there is a market for all the food I that the world can produce in the foreseeable future in view of the fact that the world population is rising and that agricultural production is not going up.  One rather peculiar feature has arisen as one reads in the Press over the last few weeks&mdash;that America finds itself in a position of having so much wheat on hands that they have to store it in their spare ships in the docks and other places, and this before they have even reached this year's harvest.  The Minister must be in a position to know the position in the world with regard to wheat markets, and able to make a definite, clear statement on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country a lot of farmers were forced to grow wheat in the emergency to the detriment of their land, and to a large extent they turned against it.  The situation has altered <Col N="1080" /> somewhat now by virtue of these concentrated fertilisers which have enabled us to get better yields over the last few years than we were getting heretofore.  I may say that in the war period we had no fertilisers and could not get a good yield.  In my eon-stituency, which is perhaps one of the premier if not the premier tillage constituency in the country, a lot of farmers are very anxious.  As the Minister knows, when you are arranging your farming system you do not arrange it for one or two years ahead, you like to arrange it spread over a long-term policy; and they would like to know what the position is in regard to wheat because of the rather disquieting fact that we see these enormous quantities of grain are in excess apparently to the requirements of the people of the United States. When the Minister is replying to the debate perhaps he will deal with that point.</P>
    <P>I think we will all agree that the necessary thing to do in this country is to increase agricultural production, but it is no use telling the farmers to increase agricultural production&mdash;you have got to make it possible for them to do so.  In my opinion the whole secret and source of the trouble behind the lack of production here is credit, to put it in a nutshell&mdash;proper placement of credit throughout the country here would enable us to increase our production.  The Land Commission, which, of course, I know the Minister is not responsible for, when it is apportioning land to farmers very often builds houses, gives them land and sets them up, but they have not got the credit to lay in the necessary ingredients such as seeds and stocks and manures and so forth to get into productive capacity immediately.  If a farmer wants to get credit the only avenue for credit in the State at the moment is the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I know that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are doing their best, but they are bound like every other corporation by rules and regulations and they are held to them perhaps by higher authorities, and they make no advances without security.  In other words you have a position that the farmers in this <Col N="1081" /> country who are looking for credit are those who have no money, and they have no chance of getting any credit out of the Agricultural Credit Corporation unless they already have money. We have this principle that the Agricultural Credit Corporation will not lend money to a farmer unless he pledges the security of his land, and even then it is very difficult for them to lend more than half the valuation of the farm.  You have a position of affairs obtaining in the country, and it is not improving very much as time goes on, with practically all the small farmers starved for want of credit, and there is really no policy to deal with that.</P>
    <P>In America and other countries as well they have a system of credit, short-term credits, what is known as chattel credit.  They give credit on the produce of the ground and on the stocks that the farmer buys in at a certain period which are going to reach their maturity and be ultimately disposed of.  That seems to me to be the solution which would be very helpful in this country in increasing our production.  The average small farmer has to go every year to the merchant for credit for his seeds, for his manures and for any of his requirements.</P>
    <P>In the majority of instances he is bound to go to the one merchant.  He owes that merchant a certain amount of money and he deals with him.  He buys his requirements in the spring and endeavours to pay when he harvests the crops in the autumn.  The merchant has to give a vast amount of credit.  The merchant has to borrow the money from the banks at a high rate of interest and he is virtually lending money to the small farmer on very limited security in the majority of instances.  It is not very difficult to see that, as a result, the cost and the percentage of charge for seeds and manure to people who are short of ready cash is considerable.  In some cases it has been stated to have been as high as 20 per cent.  Therefore, the argument would appear to be that if the Department of Agriculture&mdash;in the case of newly parcelled out farms, in conjunction with the Land Commission &mdash;could give short-term credits to <Col N="1082" /> enable people to have those farms stocked, seeded and manured so that they could go into production immediately, it would increase production. Those who have land already should be put into a position to go to somebody to get credit, without having to spend weeks pledging the farm.  If they are without any chance of getting credit unless they have money already, some short credit term should be instituted, if we are to increase agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The next avenue to the increase in agricultural production is the land reclamation scheme.  Many things have been said about that scheme&mdash;many hard things and many soft things.  It is a very fine scheme.  I would like to give the Minister the position in my constituency, as I have it from innumerable constituents&mdash;and they are not going to waste their time in telling me a pack of nonsense.  Anyone who applies in County Wexford under section B of the scheme goes on to the waiting list.  To my certain knowledge, that waiting list is growing week by week and month by month.  I took the trouble to investigate the matter and to check up on it with a good many people and from every angle.  As I know the scheme at present, it is divided into sections A and B.  Under A, the farmer does it himself; it is the old method of the spade and shovel, which may be slow and not a very good one.  Under B, the job is done for him by a contractor, under the grant scheme of the Department of Agriculture. A farmer wants to have his land reclaimed, fertilised or drained.  He applies to the Department and an official comes out and inspects the farm.  The official gives his estimate as to what it is going to cost per acre. That is the information I have at present; the Minister can refute it afterwards if I am wrong.  I am further informed&mdash;and I have this from officials themselves, from farmers and from the contractor&mdash;that the average cost of reclaiming land in County Wexford is £52 an acre.  I have been told it costs that much because there is a lot of wet marginal land there that requires draining, and by the time the drainage pipes and so on are put in there is no reasonable profit left to the contractor.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> If a man applies to have his land drained under section B, the Minister's official comes out and inspects the land.  The report is sent back to the Department&mdash;it has to be approved there&mdash;and the query is asked whether that land is to be drained or not.  I submit that when an estimate for £52 is sent in, it is turned down and the job is not done, and the particular farmer is put back to section A.  In my opinion, that is wrong.  The Minister may answer that argument by saying that the machinery was put up for sale.  We did not approve of the machinery being put up for sale, and we did not hesitate to say so.  The Minister may say the machinery has been sold and that that is proof that there are plenty of people ready to drain the land.  I would like to point out that when the machinery was sold &mdash;I have this from several sources as well&mdash;it was not stipulated that the machinery could be used solely for the purpose of draining land.  The people who got it were quite free to utilise it for other purposes.  It might be economic for them to buy the machinery and use it for purposes other than land drainage.  It might not be economic&mdash; and I maintain that in the County Wexford it would not be economic&mdash;to buy the machinery and drain the land, at the ceiling price allowed by the Department at present.</P>
    <P>On the question of butter, we have always had difficulty in selling butter in Wexford.  I do not think the difficulty is confined to Wexford.  Our problem this year is no easier than in any other year; in fact, it is more difficult at present for farmers to dispose of their high-grade butter at an economic price.  Creamery butter is selling at 4/2 a lb. but everyone knows that it is quite impossible for farmers to get anything like that for highest-grade butter in County Wexford.  It is not difficult to see the reason.  The market for butter from a rural constituency must always be found, in times of plentiful supply, outside its own area.  The Minister knows that regulations exist at present prohibiting the sale of Irish creamery butter in the Dublin and Bray areas.  That means that Irish creamery butter is <Col N="1084" /> competing with farmers' butter in other areas.  The answer may be that farmers are not making as good a butter as the creameries.  Remember this, the creameries are specialised butter makers, that is their job; why should a farmer have to compete in his own area with specialists?  The farmer has to do many other things besides make butter; he has plenty of stock to look after and plenty of other work to do.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister a further reason why it is difficult to sell farmers' butter.  He can check on this if he likes.  Any shopkeeper will tell the Minister that more margarine has been bought for human consumption in the last two years than there has been for a great many years in Ireland. That is the reason why farmers' butter is not marketable&mdash;because the Irish people, to the ultimate detriment of their health, are eating more margarine at 1/7 a lb., as they cannot afford to-buy butter.  I do not know that the Minister can really make a market for butter, but I think a statement on the-subject would be welcomed.  The removal of the Orders that apply to Dublin and Bray would make a considerable difference and would ease the situation.</P>
    <P>The peak period for butter is now passing.  As the Minister himself, being a country Deputy the same as I am, knows perfectly well, the peak butter period in rural Ireland is the end of April, May and June; and with the advance, of the gad and so forth the butter is not as plentiful as before. People cannot sell the butter and it is not economic for them.  As a result, there is less and less homemade butter. Some people argue that the time will come when we will have to import butter from across the world.  I am not inclined to agree, but there are two schools of thought on the subject.  The time may come when we may not be able to import from across the world. Does that mean that the Irish nation, an agricultural nation, will have to eat margarine as the poor are eating it at present because they cannot afford to buy butter?  The situation may obtain in which you will not have a manufacture of butter and all sections of the community, rich and poor, will be <Col N="1085" /> eating margarine, because there is no butter to be eaten.  Of course the Minister is not entirely responsible for that.  He is only responsible as a member of the Government for the fact that the poorer sections of the people have to eat margarine.</P>

      <P>As I said, we know how to till in Wexford and we grow barley.  We are facing considerable difficulties again down there owing to the policy of the Minister and the Government.  I do not think anybody will deny that the brewers and the maltsters have cut their contracts for barley by 50 per cent. and in some cases by more than that.  We have in Wexford this year perhaps the best and the most promising crops of barley we have had for a great many years. The Minister knows that with the cutting down of the contracts by the brewers and maltsters a lot of barley which heretofore was sold as malting barley and marketed at a remunerative price will come on the market as feeding barley.  Last year the Minister rather belatedly brought in a scheme. Unfortunately, many people in Wexford were &ldquo;stung&rdquo; and sold their barley before the scheme came in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather belatedly, last year the Minister introduced a scheme for the payment of 48/- a barrel for barley.  A lot of people in South Wexford had disposed of their barley before that, not knowing that the Minister was to introduce the scheme. At present, the fields in Wexford are full of barley.  We have possibly the best crops we have seen for a good <Col N="1086" /> many years.  Is the Minister going to introduce such a scheme again or will the farmers of Wexford be left to grow barley at an uneconomic price?  Now is the time for the Minister to say that. The harvest is approaching.  As a farmer, the Minister knows that every farmer has to make his arrangements. I have asked the Minister a parliamentary question about that and he has told me that he is not importing maize.  That does not get away from the fact that a large number of small farmers grow barley in excess of their own requirements.  In Wexford, not only do we grow barley for our own requirements&mdash;and we can claim that we feed just as much of it to live stock as people in any other county&mdash;but we supply barley to other parts of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil speakers never cease talking about the necessity for increased tillage.  Wexford is the best tillage county in Ireland.  It has a higher tillage ratio than any other county.  We are now in the month of July and in some places the barley is ripening, but we have had no indication whether we will have a fixed economic price for barley.  I have been asked about that and I said I would bring it up on this Estimate.  I ask the Minister, when replying, to make a statement with regard to the price of barley.  The matter does not affect County Wexford alone.  It affects a great many other parts of Ireland, but it will hit Wexford harder than anywhere else if the Minister does not do something about it.  Furthermore, I should like to point out that the price of 48/- fixed last year should be increased this year in order to make it economic for the farmers to produce barley.  As the Minister is aware, the cost of production has gone up considerably in the last 12 months.</P>

      <P>I will deal with oats in a few minutes.  I should like to deal now with the question of lambs.  There was a subsidy paid by the British Government for dressed lambs for a certain period, up to the end of June, anyway; perhaps it obtains at present. That subsidy worked out at 6d. per lb. <Col N="1087" /> I have a letter here from a farmer about that matter, one of many which I have had from farmers in South Wexford. There was a fair held in Wellington Bridge a month or six weeks ago.  The night before the fair buyers from Waterford scoured the countryside and bought lambs wholesale all over Wexford.  The farmers who were disposing of their lambs had no idea that this subsidy was being paid.</P>

      <P>The British Government paid a subsidy of 6d. per lb. on dressed lamb.  I think the Minister will agree that the average conditioned lamb would kill out at 40 lb. and 40 sixpences would total £1.  Therefore, a lamb should have been worth £1 more to somebody and the person who did not get the £1 was the farmer.  The Minister has often made a deal at a fair and he will appreciate that it is usual for a dealer to say to a farmer: &ldquo;What do you want for that lamb?&rdquo;<Col N="1088" /> When the farmer tells him, the dealer does not say: &ldquo;I am pleased to tell you that there is a subsidy of £1 and I will give you another £1.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking for the farmer who tells me that he did not get the £1.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us who got the £1.  That is the mystery.  Deputy Cunningham mentioned oats.  In regard to oats, it is a matter of providing accommodation for the farmers.  The oats crop is peculiar in that sometimes oats are in short supply here and sometimes there is an excess supply.  When oats are in short supply here, they are in short supply in Great Britain and Western Europe as well.  It is in excess supply here and it is in excess supply there. That is the difficulty which any Minister for Agriculture has to meet with regard to oats.  If he has to fix a price for it, it would probably help, but it is very difficult to fix a price definitely on oats because it is a rather fluctuating product and supplies vary a great deal.  But it seems to me that the solution would be something on the lines of what was done when Deputy <Col N="1089" /> Dillon was Minister for Agriculture. One year when there was an excess of oats, the Government bought in a certain amount of oats at a certain price. They bought in white oats, and that to a certain extent stabilised the price.  But a better solution would be if the farmers were put in a position to co-operate in different centres for the purpose of storing oats so that we would not have a situation arising that when we are short of oats we will have to import them.  But any system you run must, in my opinion, be run to some extent under central Government control, because until you have central Government control in some form, in which the Department of Agriculture is prepared to step in and buy some of the oats so as to stabilise the market, you are going to have the situation of small farmers being forced to put their oats on the market and there being no market.  It is natural&mdash;human nature being what it is&mdash;that the merchants will buy it for what they can get it for, and they get the profit and the farmers who do the work and employ the labour and have to struggle against the elements to produce the crop will not get the price.</P>
      <P>With regard to fixing prices, it is very difficult.  The price of oats which is largely used for feeding here apart from a small quantity for the distilleries, must always be dependent on the demand, and that is where the Government may come in to produce that demand by buying some of it, by taking a certain amount out of the pool, and it will stabilise itself.  Oats stabilises itself every year but it does so too late, and to the detriment of the farmers.  The farmers are the people who do all the work and do not get the profit.  Until such time as we give to the farmer all the profit and eliminate the middleman, you are not going to keep the people on the land and stop the flight from the country. We are dependent in the final analysis for everything on the land; we are dependent for the things we import on what our agricultural section can produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pretty well accepted now that the country is <Col N="1090" /> happy in the knowledge that we have in agriculture an extremely valuable constituent of our economy.  In view of the cattle prices that are now obtaining, it is indeed a matter for congratulation that in the period 1948-51 the cattle population in this country rose by 172,000 in number, and in value, to the amount of £10,284,000.  We claim that that can be traced, number one, to the closing down of cattle slaughtering which persisted up to the formation of the inter-Party Government. In 1947 we slaughtered an extraordinary number of young cattle in this country.  That slaughter was indiscriminate. One of these slaughterhouses was adjacent to my home and I know of what I speak.  There were no questions asked as to the breed of the calf or as to its condition, or anything else.  They all went the one road and were it not for the action of Deputy Dillon when he became Minister for Agriculture in closing down that concern and many others like it, we would not have had that increase in the cattle population&mdash;and that notwithstanding the fact that at the time their farms were cluttered up with uneconomic cattle for which there was no price.  In view of the many other developments in the years since, we now have a steady market for the disposal of these cattle that were uneconomic for milk and consequently were a load on the farmer and the disposal of them makes way for his opportunity to keep more economic cattle on his farm.</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy that the number of young cattle has risen by 2.9 per cent. during those three years.  Consequently, we can say&mdash;we are often charged with having left numerous headaches to this Government but I think they will appreciate that they had a very worthy asset there&mdash;even though the Minister for Finance in this Government was very slow to recognise the fact when he had to deal with the problem of external trade, that the cattle have provided us with a very large proportion of our exports in years gone by.  Indications are that in the foreseeable future very lucrative markets will be available for all we have to dispose of in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with the increase of <Col N="1091" /> the number of live stock in the country it is also a matter for congratulation to appreciate that there has been an increase in the output per acre in the way of crops which proves that in this country where mixed farming is the order of the day, when the farmer is doing well in one part of his concern that he can plough back into the land fertilisers and manures necessary to keep it in good heart.  In that respect, it is also on record that in the last year of the inter-Party Government the farmers purchased £5,000,000 worth of artificial manures.  Surely that fact must be recognised, in so far as it has meant that we have put back into the land much that was taken from it in the years when we had, to a certain extent, to ravish that land.</P>
    <P>Consequent on the development of the land project, it is surely a matter of pride that we on this side of the House can say that during these years considerable progress was made under that scheme.  It is a pity that when it was introduced it did not meet with a better reception.  There were extravagant, wild statements made as to the average cost of doing an acre under that scheme, but in figures furnished by the Department of Agriculture I note that in County Cork 32,369 acres were reclaimed for £216,830 in grants, which I make out to be an average of about £7 per acre.  If, to improve the land of this country, the average cost is like that we could not spend money in a better way.</P>
    <P>To-day, there are disconcerting facts relating to this project.  The first blow was that struck by the Minister for Agriculture.  It is the Minister's intention to dispose of the land project machinery.  That we claimed was a bad thing.  These machines should be left under the direct control of the Department because anywhere a private contractor takes on this work he naturally tends to look for the work in bigger farms where there are bigger fields and where the farmers are able to pay cash down the moment the job is done. Naturally where men spend money in purchasing this machinery they go to the bigger man for the work knowing they will be paid immediately.  I want to put on record here, and I think it <Col N="1092" /> should be a matter for concern, that some of the skilled men whom we brought back from abroad are now. working as navvies on the Lee scheme, in the hope that if ever a vacancy arises they will get a job as a lorry or a tractor driver.  I found that out when I visited the scheme and tried to secure employment for an ex-lorry driver who lost his job through trucks being put off the road.  The man in charge told me that there were men there working with picks and shovels who were competent to drive these big machines and yet who had to take up that work.  Many other such men had left the country again.  I think that is a tremendous loss to us.  It will be very hard to restore their confidence and get them back to work in this country.</P>
    <P>I know it is not permissible to refer in any detail in this debate to the closing down of work under the Local Authorities (Works) Acts, but I think I can justify short reference to it by claiming that the many people who have applied for schemes under the land project find they cannot carry out that work until many rivers and streams are cleared for them.  They have not got a sufficient outfall for the drainage thew contemplate.</P>
    <P>I think it is a great pity that work was not continued under the Act to the same extent as some years ago.  If it had been, man more acres might be added to the land reclaimed under the land project.  Some people claim that these schemes were in operation many years before Deputy Dillon introduced them, but there was never a scheme before, I think, under which fertilisers and ground limestone were spread on the land to such an extent in connection with land reclamation.  To-day when we look at the marginal land of this country we see that much of the land reclaimed in the days of our forefathers under slave conditions has reverted to its original state and is growing heather again, because these men had not the wherewithal or the scientific assistance that we have to-day. Consequently, it is a matter of importance that we should give the people living in these barren areas every opportunity of improving their holdings. <Col N="1093" /> It apparently is the opinion of this Government, as expressed by the Taoiseach, that we should direct activities under the land project to land which in the ordinary sense would be considered medium quality land.  I think the man on the hillsides, the man with the bad holding, deserves first consideration.  No doubt it is a more pleasant matter for the Department to deal with fairish land and make good land of it.  We must remember, how ever, that unless the people on very bad land are given assistance it becomes impossible for them and their families to eke out a livelihood on such land.</P>
    <P>In the course of the past year the farmers of this country have had to contend with serious difficulties in relation to production costs.  In that sphere, it is very hard to refer to these difficulties without referring to general Government policy.  Any Minister for Agriculture in this country must be prepared to take a strong hand in impressing on his colleagues in the Government that no matter what development is mooted in other Departments, it will not be carried out at the expense of agriculture.</P>
    <P>In the ultimate, when we speak of increased costs, they all work back to the initial producer in the country&mdash; the farmer.  The Minister for Local Government is assisting his colleague the Minister for Finance in procuring more revenue by increased taxation on transport.  I feel that agriculture has been seriously affected in the past 12 months by increased transport charges. In the last general election, the Taoiseach, speaking in County Clare, referred to hidden taxation and its bearing on the economy of the country. As reported in the <i>Sunday Press</i> of May 25th, 1951, speaking at Kilmihill, in County Clare, he said that the previous Government were raising revenue by hidden taxation and that they conveniently forgot that a tax on petrol was a tax on everything transported by lorry.  Most of our agricultural produce is transported by lorry and any increase in petrol or in vehicle duties of any kind reacts in reducing the margin of profit to the farmer.  In the dairying areas&mdash;and the constituency I represent is predominantly a dairying <Col N="1094" /> area&mdash;motor trucks are employed for the transport of milk to the creameries. The creameries, in turn, employ trucks to transport milk to the chocolate factories and to the central creameries, and their costs of production are seriously affected by these increased charges.  The farmer who, a few years ago, purchased, by stinting himself, perhaps, in other ways, a little truck to bring him back quicker to the work on his farm or to transport his produce to market, is now faced with increased costs.  At the same time he is affected by the increased prices he has to pay for every single article he has to buy in the shop.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, he has to meet difficulties referred to by Deputy Esmonde in regard to the credit restrictions experienced in this country in the last few years.  The shopkeeper in the town is depending on the local bank to afford him credit and he cannot give the farmer what he always gave the farmer in the past&mdash;credit until such time as the farmer fattened his stock or harvested his stock as he did in the past, because he himself cannot now obtain credit.  We think all this is detrimental to the increased production which we desire to see in this country.</P>
    <P>We often throw bouquets at industrialists when they expend large sums in improving their concerns and expanding their business, but it should be recognised by this.  House that for the last four or five years the farmers have made a wonderful contribution in the amount they have expended on the mechanisation of their farms, in the introduction of water supplies and in the linking up of their homes with the rural electrification system.  All these developments are to the good, but they have not been accomplished without considerable effort on the part of these small farmers&mdash;and many of them are very small farmers&mdash;who have made many sacrifices to avail themselves of the benefits of these various schemes. If we could facilitate the farmer, particularly the small farmer; by providing him with improved credit facilities I think we would be going a long way towards helping him. Earlier on, before this debate commenced, <Col N="1095" /> a Deputy, not of this Party, drew attention to the difficulties which he encountered when seeking a loan for a farmer from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  He told them what the money was needed for and that the result would be increased production on the farm.  He spoke of the difficulties which he found in obtaining credit for this farmer.  The Minister for Finance made the interjection, which I think was a disgrace: &ldquo;Could that farmer not stop smoking for a while?&rdquo; If that farmer and every other farmer stopped smoking, the Minister for Finance would not have much revenue in his coffers.  I think there is an obligation on any Minister for Finance to make credit available for farmers; definitely there is an obligation on the Minister for Agriculture to see that the Minister for Finance makes available to farmers the credit which they require to improve their holdings, to purchase stock or to do anything which would assist in bringing about the increased production which is so necessary if our economy is to improve.</P>
    <P>The Budget statement of this year indicates the Government's approach to agriculture.  Out of 66 pages the Minister for Finance could devote only 19 lines to agriculture.  In that respect Government policy was stated&mdash;that in their opinion taxation rests lightly on the land.  I claim now, speaking on this Estimate, that one of the greatest impediments to the progress of agriculture in this country is the taxation which agriculture has to bear at this moment.  Every co-operative creamery throughout the country has to meet increased costs in maintaining its transport services, in paying increased wages to their employees and they also have to bear their share of the increased taxation.  Every farmer throughout the country has had to find increased money to pay his agricultural labourers and also to give to his wife to enable her to buy commodities which are essential to the household. The farmer, however, has got no increase in order to enable him to meet that increased expenditure.  That is a recognised fact and we know what the <Col N="1096" /> result of public opinion was in regard to it when it was put to the test.  The Minister for Lands has asserted that East Cork is an urban area.  East Cork comprises two areas, one distinctly rural and the other distinctly urban, and the farmers in that area recently gave their opinion on present agricultural policy in a very emphatic manner.  It is their desire that the Government should mend its ways. They want to see the Government give the fillip to the land project which such a worthy scheme deserves and give the drive and initiative to the running of the Department of Agriculture which is so essential.</P>
    <P>We are often addressed by some of the older Deputies on the Government Benches and told that we should engage ourselves, in particular, in trying to secure some improvement in our own constituencies&mdash;that we should try to bring to those constituencies some concern which would give employment and improve the standard of living of the people there.  In that connection, I propose to address a few remarks to the Minister and to remonstrate with him for the manner in which my constituency was let down in the matter of securing an excellent concern for it. One of the greatest firms in Europe was prepared to come to this country and engage in the canning of meat here in conjunction with local effort. They were prepared to work in harmony with the co-operative creameries in extending production.  However, we met with nothing but obstruction in that regard.</P>

      <P>I am citing an instance.  We cannot bring into remote rural areas the types of industrial concerns that the Deputy can bring into Dublin City.  We are restricted in the type of industry in-as much as it must be based on agriculture. This industry would have to rely on the locality for its raw material and it was prepared to give very good employment and very good representation in relation to management, and so forth, to Irish nationals.  It was a distinct loss to the constituency which I have the honour to represent, and that is the reason why I have raised this matter on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer again, as other Deputies have, to the difficulties which farmers are meeting in relation to reduced barley contracts.  I consider that this is inimical to the whole of the agricultural industry.  About one-third of my constituency is affected by the reduction.  My worry is that these farmers who formerly secured lucrative incomes from the sale of barley under contract will now have to compete with other farmers in producing crops that may be difficult to market. <Col N="1099" /> It is regrettable that the Minister for Agriculture in this Government did not impress on the other members of the Cabinet, before they finally embarked on the policy to reduce the consumption of spirits, that such a policy would react unfavourably on the agricultural industry.  Unless there is a great change in regard to that aspect of the agricultural industry, then all I can say is that the industry is in for a very lean time indeed.</P>
    <P>I want to register a protest on behalf of small farmers, their wives and families, for the let-down which they got last Christmas in regard to turkey prices.  Undoubtedly, those people who go in for the rearing and fattening of turkeys deserve every penny they can get for the birds at Christmas time. Many of them depend on the moneys which they expect to receive at that time from the sale of the birds.  Last Christmas, the fall in the price of turkeys was very seriously felt by many small farmers' and cottiers' wives throughout my constituency.  I feel that this Government has failed in particular by allowing the costs of production to increase to the extent to which, they have increased, with the result that the farmer is now faced with a considerably reduced profit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The point which I wish to mention is a hardy annual: I refer to storage for grain in the harvest.  Is the Manister satisfied that there is sufficient storage in the event of a wet harvest?  With the advent of the combined harvester, much more storage and drying facilities are required than formerly.  A serious problem could arise in the matter of storage if we have not the fine weather this year which we had last year.  In the case of wheat and barley especially, farmers must get rid of these crops to the stores immediately, and that situation will be much more urgent in a wet harvest, unless the people who handle this grain have made provision for it.  The harvest comes in within three weeks and it is all dumped into the merchants and the millers in that period.  The big burk of the grain this year will come from combine harvesters and unless some arrangements have been made, <Col N="1100" /> even though they are emergency arrangements, to handle that grain within a short time, the problem may be serious.  I suggest that the Minister might appeal to some of the farmers who still harvest by the traditional method of the reaper and binder to hold over their corn, or a portion of it, for a few weeks or so.  That might relieve the situation.  Otherwise, the position could be serious, especially in a wet year.  I am sure the Minister has made a survey and that provision has been made for that eventuality, because otherwise a lot of grain could be lost within a week.  If the grain is unfit to remain in the sacks, it deteriorates very rapidly and serious damage may be done.  I feel sure that the Minister will be able to assure the House and the country that there is sufficient storage, no matter what weather we have, and that the millers and grain merchants will be capable of handling it and drying it immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had much discussion about land rehabilitation and about sections A and B of that scheme.  In that connection, would-be contractors or existing contractors plead, as a reason for their inability to take contracts in future, that the amount allowed will not is sufficient to reimburse them and give them a livelihbod in using these machines.  Although the Minister did refer to it, I think he should explain clearly to the House if there are any new conditions attaching to the operation of Section B and whether it is a fact that, in future, it will be his policy to encourage people to drain the better quality land which needs drainage rather than land which is scarcely worth draining.  There was a big lot of money spent on a certain amount of land over the past few years and it is doubtful if its expenditure was economic. If it were the policy of the Minister in the future to spend money, in the first instance, on the better-class land which needs drainage and which could be improved, the peopte would be satisfied.  It will not cost as much to drain such land as it would to drain the more boggy type of land. With regard to section A, the scheme under Which the farmer proposes to do the work himself, that is a scheme which will give general satisfaction. <Col N="1101" /> The majority of the farmers are small and medium-sized farmers and it will be found that if they carry a number of men over the winter, as many of them do, they will find time to carry out minor drainage under section A and improve their land in many ways. I think that will eventually be the most popular part of the scheme.  Side by side with that land, there will be land which will need heavier machinery for carrying out drainage operations.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a new scheme for the distribution of lime and we should like some more information with regard to when it will come into operation and if he is satisfied that the existing plants which are producing lime will give an output equal to the demand.  In the spring of last year, through no fault of the suppliers&mdash;a big number of farmers all wanted the ground limestone within the short few weeks of the sowing season&mdash;some farmers found they had to do without it.  All the encouragement possible, through Press and other propaganda, as the Department is doing at present, should he given to farmers to take the lime into stock at the slack time of the year and the agricultural instructors should advise them how to keep it from getting wet and having it in proper condition for sowing.  If the lime gets very wet, it becomes mucky and unsuitable for sowing in many types of spreaders, but if it can be kept dry it will not deteriorate in any way.</P>
    <P>We are glad to see that, far land rehabilitation, there has been an increase in the amount of money made available each year since the Minister took over, and in the amount of work being done.  There is an increase of £150,000 in relation to the subsidy on ground limestone and the transport of ground limestone in this year's Estimates as compared with last year which shows that the farmers are fully appreciative of the value of ground limestone.  In my own county of Wexford, we are unfortunate in not having any supply of lime at all.  No lime whatever is being quarried or prepared in the county and there is scarcely any supply available which a worth looking after.  I hope that under <Col N="1102" /> the new scheme, when the country is being zoned, it will not be forgotten that there are areas in County Wexford that are a long distance from any source of supply.  I am sure the Minister and his Department will keep that in mind.</P>
    <P>The amount of money provided this year for sub-head M (11)&mdash;Prevention of Contagious Abortion and other Diseases in Cattle&mdash;is the same as last year and we should like to hear from the Minister whether there has been much progress made and if the scheme has been fully availed of.  I have been told that in the early years, due to publicity, it was availed of much more extensively than last year.  I think the Minister should press forward with that scheme of inoculating cattle against contagious abortion because it is a scheme of immense advantage to the country.</P>
    <P>A token Vote of £10 is provided at sub-head M (5)&mdash;Loans for the Purchase of Cattle and Sheep, Agricultural Implements and Milking Machines.  We have no information as to the number of animals purchased under that sub-head.  I take it that it is the Agricultural Credit Corporation that finances it and that the Department merely provide a token Vote, There were complaints by people who felt they were fully qualified to get a loan under that scheme that it is just as difficult to get a loan now from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, even under that section, as it was in the past to get a loan directly from the corporation.  I suggest that the Minister should do something to get the Agricultural Credit Corporation&mdash;I am not sure whether they come under this Vote or not&mdash;to loosen up and to be more liberal in the matter of loans to farmers who need to purchase live stock and implements.  The implements part of the scheme seems to be working better than the stocking of the land with cattle and sheep and live stock generally.  That has been my experience throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We had Deputy D.J. O'Sullivan and Deputy Desmond suggesting by innuendo that because the farmers are at the moment getting a certain price <Col N="1103" /> for milk the Government is responsible for increasing the price of butter to the consumer.  It would be interesting to hear the official policy of both Fine Gael and Labour in relation to butter and milk.  They cannot have it both ways.  They either believe the farmer is getting a fair price for his milk or that he is getting too much.  I do not believe the farmer is getting too much; he is entitled to a fair price for his produce.  On the other hand, the farmer should, of course, do all in his power to feed his cows and to get the best possible yield from them.  The farmer has a duty to the community, to the consumer and to himself to increase milk supplies in so far as he can.  Having performed that duty, he is then entitled to a fair price for his produce.  The Opposition seems to be talking with its tongue in its cheek. When speaking in an urban constituency Opposition Deputies bewail the price of butter to the consumer and they are full of sympathy for the townspeople.</P>
    <P>The Opposition should lay down some clear policy.  If they think the farmer is getting too much for his milk, they should say so outright. They look for popularity in the towns and urban areas by telling the people that it is the Fianna Fáil Government that is responsible for the price of butter at the moment.  Milk is ? per gallon.  It takes 2? gallons of milk to make a pound of butter.  Knowing that, it is easy to understand why butter is 4/2 per lb.</P>

      <P>If any Deputy on the Opposition Benches has any formula whereby we can pay the farmers ? <Col N="1104" /> per gallon for milk and produce butter at less than 4/2 per lb., the House and the country would be glad to have it. I will have far more respect for Deputy Rooney in future than I have at the moment if he can give us such a formula.  Opposition policy seems to be in abeyance at the moment.  We are waiting for some pronouncements of policy in relation to the price of butter and milk.  Is the Opposition satisfied to give the farmers an economic price? Is it prepared to tell the consumers that there is no way out?</P>
      <P>The only way in which the price of butter could be reduced is by increased milk production.  The margin allowed to the creameries manufacturing butter and the margin allowed to the retailer is cut to the very bone.  We would all like to have cheap butter.  There seems to be no way of achieving that except through better management of dairy herds, if that is possible.  If farmers are already doing their best and breeding the best type of animal we can only continue to pay the present price for butter and no formula by either Fine Gael or Labour will solve the problem.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will endeavour to get a greater acreage of potatoes grown next year because that seems to me to be the solution to our poultry-feeding problem and increased pig production. The cost of ensiling is pretty high.  There is a scheme in operation in some counties whereby steamers are-made available to farmers for the purpose of ensiling potatoes.  Contractors should be encouraged in every parish. If the acreage under potatoes is increased there would be a considerable addition to the food pool and the farmers would have cheaper feeding stuffs for both poultry and pigs.  Ensilage should be encouraged because the old method of cooking from day to day is no longer possible or economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement made by the Minister-in relation to the increase in tillage is very satisfactory.  I think everybody is pleased that we are on the right road at last after four or five years of difficulty.  That much leeway has to be made up.  We have yet a long road to go before we have sufficient land under tillage in this country.  We have the lowest acreage of tillage in Western Europe per 100 acres or per 1,000 acres <Col N="1105" /> of arable land.  That is to our own disadvantage and it costs us almost £20,000,000 a year in regard to our agricultural products.  There is an open market in addition to the present market and there is no reason whatever why farmers could not increase their live stock&mdash;cattle, sheep and pigs &mdash;and at the same time double the acreage under tillage.  We must be 1,000,000 acres short of what we need to provide our full requirements both in regard to animal feeding stuffs and food for human consumption.</P>
    <P>If we get a favourable harvest this year we will possibly have almost enough wheat.  There is every appearance of there being a bumper crop provided that during the next month or six weeks we have reasonable weather.  If the weather is reasonable our wheat requirements for the coming year will be reasonably safe. In regard to the matter of animal feeding stuffs, we are still a long way behind.  Before the harvest comes in, I hope the Minister for Agriculture will indicate a fair price to the people growing feeding barley in the present year.  I hope that the farmers growing feeding barley will get a price for it which will have some relation to what the feeding stuffs will be sold for in the future.  That is all important. The price they can be given for the feeding barley will only be related to the price at which the finished product is sold.  Still, the farmer who grows feeding barley is entitled to a fair price on the basis of what the feeding stuffs will be sold for in the future.  The farmers will not be dissatisfied with the price unless they see the merchants and the millers afterwards making an undue profit on their exertions and efforts.  I hope the Minister will ensure that the farmers will get a fair price.  That is all important if we are to encourage an increase in feeding barley in the future.  We are on the right road towards getting that increase which is very much to be desired.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is not much money being provided for horse breeding at the present time.  I mentioned this matter last year.  I hope the Minister will keep his eye on it.  This <Col N="1106" /> country is noted for its horses and its horse breeding.  The horses we bred were of great advantage to the country.  There should be no easing off in that connection.  I am not satisfied that enough money is being provided for the purchase of sires.  The market is fairly good at the moment, and the Department of Agriculture should encourage the bringing in of suitable sires as they did in the past, and they ahould provide sufficient money for that purpose.  As a long-term policy that is something we cannot neglect. It is of great material advantage to the national economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to commend the Minister on the success of his efforts to step up production.  We trust that he will redouble his efforts in the coming year.  The farmers will respond as they have always responded if given the necessary encouragement and leadership.  They are getting that in fair measure at the present time.  The farmers are a hard-working section of the community.  They have always worked hard and are always prepared to work hard for small profits.  They need a steady policy.  They should know for years ahead the direction in which they are asked to travel.  There is nothing so bad as to have a policy of changing and shifting day after day. A steady policy with a steady directive is what will bring about the increased production we all desire both in regard to home consumption and export.  I believe we are getting that and I am sure we will continue to get it.</P>

      <P>We found a situation in 1947 where the supply of bacon and pigs was the lowest ever.  The housewife was lucky if she could get a pound of bacon with her groceries from under the counter at the end of the week. <Col N="1107" /> That was the situation we found in 1947.  In 1950 not only had we full requirements of pigs and sufficient bacon for our housewives but we also had a surplus for export.  Bacon was exported from this country for the first time since the war in 1950 under the leadership of Deputy James Dillon. That is one example of changing and chopping that Deputy Allen does not like.  When we came into Government in 1947 housewives were getting two ounces per week of Irish butter.  But, in 1950, under Deputy James Dillon as Minister for Agriculture, there was a surplus and we were in a position to export a surplus of Irish creamery butter for the first time in many years.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Sir.  I will take up Deputy Allen on another matter.  He blamed Fine Gael for criticising the price of butter because butter was 4/2 at the present time. Was there anybody more noisy than the Fianna Fáil Party when in 1951 the price of butter increased from 2/8 to 2/10 per lb?  An increase of 2d. per lb. in the price of butter provided the noise for the windbags at the General Election of 1951.  Now, instead of butter going up from 2/8 to 2/10 per lb., it has gone up from 2/10 to 4/2.  Then you have Deputy Allen criticising Fine Gael because they dared say a word concerning the increased cost of butter&mdash;and New Zealand butter at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1108" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a corresponding increase in the price of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of 2d.  The Minister, if he knows anything about his job, knows that the reason for the 2d. increase in the price of butter was that the price of milk was increased by 1d. I hope the Minister will concede me that much.  It went up 1d. but it has gone up since nearly a couple of shillings.  Enough said in that respect.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the work during the past year under the stewardship of the Minister for Agriculture.  We have seen a considerable measure of confusion in the sphere of agriculture amongst farmers, but it was nothing to equal the confusion that was caused in relation to barley prices and the sale of barley last year.  That, of course, arose from the fact that a reduction in the price of barley was negotiated by the Beet Growers' Association.  I had never before heard of a producers' organisation negotiating for a reduction in price, but in the case of barley the Beet Growers' Association negotiated for a reduction in the price of barley to 75/- per barrel, while at the same time the Minister threw overboard the prices that had existed for barley in the previous years.</P>
      <P>When we came into office in 1948, we found that the farmer was not permitted to sell his malting barley at more than 35/- a barrel to the distillers, who then had to go to the ends of the earth to import malting barley, the price of which, when landed here, was 89/- per barrel.  When Deputy Dillon became Minister he decided that the farmers who grew barley should be given the opportunity of negotiating their terms with the distillers.  The result was that the price of malting barley eventually went up to 84/- per barrel, as compared to the 89/- per barrel which the distillers were paying in 1947 for the malting barley they were then importing.</P>
      <P>This game of ducks and drakes with the farmers in relation to price is very confusing, and if that is the chopping and changing which Deputy Allen has referred to, then I agree with him that it has an upsetting effect on our agricultural economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> The farmers have told the present Government&mdash;I presume it is a Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;that they approve of the Dillon policy and, in many respects, the Minister is attempting, in his own way, to operate the Dillon policy in regard to agriculture.  In the recent by-elections, the farmers gave their verdict.  In East Cork that verdict was given at the by-election mainly by farmers and farm workers; while in Wicklow, the sheep farmers and the farm workers, with the remainder of the community, gave their verdict clearly against the present Government.  They gave a verdict that they were against the present Government, and that verdict must surely be in relation to agriculture because these are rural areas.  If the verdict was against the present Government, it must have been in favour of Deputy Dillon, the previous Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is another point.  Only two days before the by-election this Estimate for Agriculture and the Minister's statement were published throughout the country.  On the basis of the facts put before them, the people in the rural areas, particularly the farmers and farm workers, were in a position to pass judgment and give a verdict at the by-election which took place two days later, on the 18th June. One can say that the Minister got an answer then on this particular Estimate and on his policy in relation to agriculture.</P>

If the Minister doubts that he should make inquiries from Messrs.  Eggs-ports, Ltd., as to whether they are being exported at a greater price to Great Britain.

      <P>At any rate, the figures will be reflected in the statistics when they become available.  The statistics covering the last three months will not be available for a long time, but, when they are, the Minister will see that there has been a falling back in the poultry trade.  The position is not as bad as it was in 1947.  In that year, there was a scarcity of poultry and eggs.  Our present Minister for Local Government then went to Great Britain and got a grant of £1,250,000 in order that we might produce eggs and poultry for ourselves as well as for export to Great Britain.  The poultry industry was certainly in a bad state <Col N="1111" /> then when he had to get a grant from Great Britain of £1,250,000 in order to restore it.  That happened at that time.</P>
      <P>The Minister now tries to remind us that there is a considerable amount of land under tillage, and tells us that the live-stock population increases as the tillage acreage goes up.  If that is a fact, I would ask him to explain why, in 1947, when we had something like 700,000 acres under wheat, apart from a large acreage under roots and grain crops, we had, at the same time, the lowest number of cattle, sheep and pigs recorded during the previous 50 years &mdash;in spite of the high acreage at that time.  The acreage under tillage fell a couple of years after.  In fact, that was anticipated by the Fianna Fáil Party.  It did fall, but not when they were in control.  Although it did fall, we had a situation in which we had in 1950 the highest live-stock population that we have ever had in 50 years.</P>
      <P>I think it worth while to remind the Minister, and those who talk about the wheat acreage and the tillage campaign, that, in order to qualify for Marshall Aid, a programme was put up which showed that it was intended to reduce the acreage of land under wheat from 650,000 acres to 235,000 acres.  That is what was intended by Fianna Fáil themselves, to reduce, by one means or another, the acreage of land under wheat to 235,000 acres.  The inter-Party Government did away with compulsory tillage, but yet the acreage under wheat never reached the low figure of 235,000 acres which the Fianna Fáil Party had entered in their programme when they were sending it forward to the Americans to qualify for the economic aid which was being negotiated at that time.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides for the making available by local authorities of facilities for training disabled <Col N="1112" /> persons for employment suitable to their condition of health and the making of arrangements with employers for placing them in suitable employment.  I was referring to the difficulty of the trade unions in relation to this particular matter.  I had some slight experience during my period of office and can understand the trade unions' difficulties.  I am sure the trade union members and officials will be able to help us more in this regard.  I understand their difficulty would be the one to which I referred, that is, the high unemployment rate for able-bodied men who are skilled in certain work, but are unable to find employment.  The trade unions are in a dilemma in considering the opening up of these same opportunities of employment to a disabled person.</P>
      <P>For the duration of the time in which we have high unemployment figures, the implementation of this section will be a serious problem.  There is no doubt at all that the trade unions will play a very important part in making this legislation effective.  Naturally unless they are agreeable to facilitate the Minister or the local authorities in allowing different persons to be trained in these crafts and skills, the section cannot be effective.</P>
      <P>In Great Britain in recent years this idea has been implemented under the Disabled Persons Act and the Factories Act.  Industries were under obligation to take in a certain percentage of disabled persons.  Of course, that was operating under conditions of full employment or practically full employment, about 2 per cent. of the insured persons in Great Britain being unemployed compared with our very much higher rate of 12 per cent. to 13 per cent., which made it possible for them to insist on the industries taking in a certain number of disabled persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, one of our greatest difficulties is the fact that the State itself, the central authority, has not given a very encouraging lead in the past to local authorities.  There is no doubt that in many of the local authority health institutions, which institutions, I certainly hope, are going to increase and multiply as time goes on, it is terribly important that we get <Col N="1113" /> it established at this stage that the health authorities can absorb into their employment disabled persons for whom they can find suitable employment. A tremendous number of these disabled persons, particularly in the infectious diseases group, can be absorbed into the fever hospitals and the T.B. institutions as clerical or secretarial staff, in administrative or outdoor work, such as gardening, as telephonists, messengers, attendants, and many other forms of employment in the health institution organisation. These institutions can find employment for many of the people whom they discharge from time to time to the competitive labour market, who because of the fact that they cannot compete in the open labour market, who rapidly fall back into the original disability or illness; all the money that has been spent by the community in making them well is lost and the whole business has to be gone through again.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the lead in this matter should be given by the State itself, that State institutions of all kinds should be made to understand clearly that they have authority to absorb suitable discharges into their service and rehabilitate them in that way. Again, of course, it is a matter in which the trade unions will have to be consulted because we will come up against the question, say, in relation to domestic staff, whether the trade unions will allow persons to be absorbed from the institution rather than from the employment exchange; similarly, in regard to gardening, secretarial work, administration, and so on.  That is why it is absolutely imperative that an understanding be arrived at with the trade unions at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>The question of the payment of allowances while training will also arise; in the case of a person who is able to do, say, a two-hour day instead of an eight-hour day, whether the six hours which the disabled person cannot work should be made up in the form of an allowance under the Infectious Diseases Act or under this particular section; whether the person will be paid for the eight-hour day or merely paid for what they can do, the two <Col N="1114" /> hours out of a total of an eight-hour day.</P>
    <P>The Minister will obviously see the danger of paying for the two hours in so far as in a six-day week the person will get money for only 12 hours which would afford him a very low standard of living.  It is of primary importance to decide whether the full rate for the week's work will be paid even though the disabled person may not be able to achieve the same output as an able-bodied person.  Again, the trade unions may object to that principle.</P>
    <P>This whole question of employment of disabled persons is an exceedingly difficult one and I am glad the Minister is setting up some sort of consultative council because he will most certainly need it.  The general direction in which the efforts of the local authorities go, whether it is towards the establishment of city workshops, city settlements or the different methods adopted in other countries, is a matter which could be worked out by such a council in order to advise the Minister, something which would be particularly well suited to our own way of life.  It is a question about which most people have a fairly open mind and one which is not easy of solution.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister on the question of the voluntary organisation which is there at the moment.  Whatever voluntary organisations are there should be encouraged to take an interest in this Act in order to help the Minister and the local authorities to the maximum.  It is one of the ways in which the voluntary groups can do quite a lot of good work.  At the same time the health authorities themselves will have to take a considerable amount of responsibility for organisation.</P>
    <P>I hope, with Deputy MacBride, that the Minister will have the power&mdash;I feel sure he has the power&mdash;to allow various local authorities to co-operate with one another.  On the whole, it will be very difficult for a single county to organise the rehabilitation services on its own.  It would be much simpler if they could group into different regional areas and provide a central rehabilitation service.  I agree with the suggestion implicit in Deputy Corish's <Col N="1115" /> amendment that &ldquo;brother or sister&rdquo; might be deleted.  Unfortunately, the amendment was not moved, but it seems a bit hard that the brother and sister could be considered for the purposes of Section 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>While I understand that the general feeling is that the parent must be responsible for the child, that the family must be responsible for the child, it is a bit hard on the brother and sister being so considered.  It seems to be stretching things pretty far that, where there is a young person growing up, earning a living, probably, fairly hard, getting very little money, probably saving up to get married, he or she should be burdened with this responsibility.  However, it is only a small point.</P>
      <P>I welcome the section.  It is a section which must be considered by most of us who have practical knowledge of the problems which arise from day to day as legislating for the millennium. While there was unemployment it would be very difficult to fit the disabled person into employment.  I know that a number of small projects have been initiated, one in the West, in Tuam, Galway&mdash;I do not know how it is doing&mdash;and a couple in the City of Dublin, but, generally speaking, there is no real progress in dealing with the problem of rehabilitating the disabled person.  It is very unlikely that there will be any substantial progress, largely due to the fact that it is very difficult to persuade an employer, or to persuade a trade unionist to persaude an employer, to take in a disabled person when there is a perfectly fit man willing to take the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a person is training for any job by way of technical institution or vocational or technical school, or any kind of studies, craft or trade, the Minister should make it quite clear to the local authority that the allowance <Col N="1116" /> is payable all that time.  Where a man goes to a city from a country area to train for any form of rehabilitation in a trade or craft, or, I hope, diploma or university degree, I would like, again, that the allowance should be such as to allow him to live in reasonable comfort, bearing in mind that in many cases the person has suffered from a serious disease which would recur if he was not given a fair chance in relation to living conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>After the Second Reading of this Bill I remember pointing out to the Minister that a type of person whom we all come across in the country, for one reason or another, did not come within the scope of any of the provisions.  I take it that this section is intended to cover this type of person, for instance, persons suffering from disseminated sclerosis or persons who had poliomyelitis in their younger days and were consequently disabled or persons who are permanent or chronic invalids because the particular disease that causes the condition has not been diagnosed, and persons born with certain disabilities.  It appears that this section will cover them.</P>
      <P>I am not so much concerned with the type of people that Deputy Dr. Browne or other Deputies have been speaking about, that is, people who would be in a position to take up some employment. I am mainly concerned with people who are not able to take up any employment and whose unfortunate lot it is to go through life as permanent invalids, solely dependent on those with whom they reside.  In so far as this section covers that helpless category of our community, I take this opportunity of welcoming it.  These particular people deserve most sympathy and, of all the provisions of the Bill, this particular section is most welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have all come across these cases. Unfortunately, even local authorities were not in a position under the regulations to do anything for them.  I have personal knowledge of households in which there are two or three unfortunate people of this kind.  They are not bad enough to be sent to an institution or do not come within the categories catered for by some of the institutions, <Col N="1117" /> and they are not well enough to be able to do any work or to help their parents or the other members of the family.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the portion of this section which deals with the payment of allowances.  I have certain doubts because of the way the section is worded.  I understand that the amendment to delete &ldquo;brothers or sisters&rdquo; has been ruled out of order. I would not agree with the principle of that amendment but I would ask the Minister to look into this matter. It appears to me from the way the section is worded that a deserving applicant could be cut out because, for instance, he or she had a brother or sister in America with a big share of this world's goods or a brother or sister, possibly, married away from the family and doing for themselves. Because that particular brother or sister was in good circumstances, an unfortunate applicant could be cut out. It means that, if one of the relatives as defined in the sub-section is well-off, that can be taken into account against the applicant although in fact the particular brother or sister might have been living away from the home for 20 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify the matter.  I would suggest that the words &ldquo;with whom the applicant resides&rdquo; or &ldquo;a relative with whom the applicant resides or who stands in <i>loco parentis</i> to the applicant&rdquo; should be inserted.  The way the section reads to me I have certain doubts.  We all know what the Minister has in mind, but this particular section will be administered possibly by local officials or local authorities and so on, and I think now is the time to clarify it and to make it clear that whomsoever these disabled people reside with&mdash;it may be a brother or sister or their father or mother&mdash;that the means of other members of the family who may be in good circumstances but are not living at home must be excluded when these people's claims for assistance under this section will be investigated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we might say for our Party that we welcome this section; in fact, we look upon this section as being one of the steps towards <Col N="1118" /> a decent Health Bill that we had to give the Minister credit for introducing in this scheme.  It indicates that the Labour Party is prepared to support this health scheme put forward by the Minister because of the fact that it has such a clause or other clauses similar to it.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The old idea of putting a man in hospital and curing him and then taking him out and leaving him on the labour market of no productive use to himself or to the community was bound to have an adverse effect on his health. He felt that he was an unwanted person and gradually he just faded away and died of the disease which he had contracted because of the crushing fact that he felt he had no desire to live. This section will give him, we hope, that incentive to live, that feeling that he is a cured person even though of limited productive use, that he is of use in the world and we hope that he will be able to find a place in the life of the community and be of use to himself and to the community.  That, we hope, will be a factor in continuing him in the health to which he has been restored by the treatment he has got in our hospitals.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister, though, that as Deputy Dr. Browne has stated, it is essential to co-operate with the trade union movement in carrying out this section.  Unless that co-operation is got, I doubt if much can be done.  It can be looked on from many points of view.  Number one, a disabled person probably will be or can be somebody who prior to being disabled was a trade unionist himself or his people trade unionists, and he would desire that in dealings or arrangements that were being made he should be looked after by his trade union.  He has come to look upon his trade union as the thing that protects him in getting a fair deal, and if he feels that his trade union will continue that interest in him and protect him and look after his interests he will feel more safe and more satisfied to accept whatever arrangement is made on his behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, of course, if the trade union movement are party to the <Col N="1119" /> scheme, I do not want to suggest that there will be any employers who will seek to exploit disabled persons, but if there be such in this country the trade union organisation will see that a fair deal is got and that these disabled persons are not going to be used as a means of breaking a labour price or that in any way something done or arrangements made would not be unfair to them and to the rest of the trade unionists in general.  We all know that there is a good deal of resentment among trade unionists when people come in at a lower wage or for part-time work or when anything is done in any way to reduce the price value of the labour content of a job. It is only when trade unionists will be appealed to and asked to co-operate in a scheme that you will operate it without resentment.  I suggest that that is essential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne will remember when he was pressed to receive a deputation or group of us, I think on his request, in connection with the very same task of rehabilitation in the C.I.E. bus section, for people cured of T.B.  I think he will assure the House that he got co-operation from the groups representing the various unions there in so far as the people who turned up at that meeting were concerned that we would endeavour to use our influence to see that a rehabilitated person got an opportunity to establish himself back in life.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Minister would do a good day's work if he himself would introduce the amendment that we did not move due to a misunderstanding, and would undertake to attend to that himself.  I feel sure, in making that appeal to the Minister, that it will be agreed to.  I believe possibly it is an oversight that it was not included already and I would ask the Minister to do that.  Should the Minister indicate that he is not prepared to do it we will have an opportunity on the Report Stage to put in a further amendment, but I would prefer to see co-operation on this between the Minister and our Party rather than in putting down an amendment which obviously is going <Col N="1120" /> to be defeated if the Minister resists it.</P>
    <P>On the question of the brother and sister being responsible for the maintenance of disabled people in certain circumstances, I would appeal to the Minister to drop that portion because of the fact that a disabled person might very well have a wealthy brother or sister even if they were not in America and that brother will not take the responsibility for the disabled person and what will really happen is that the disabled person, due to no action of his own, will be deprived of a benefit which he would have got if that brother had not been alive.  It seems ridiculous that due to the fact that the brother or sister refuses to take responsibility they will be able to do injury to people at home by refusing to take responsibility for them and do a further injury by existing at all. I can understand the reason why the Minister has put it in, but there are many brothers and sisters who, if they are not married with dependents of their own, will be making arrangements for future dates and it is difficult to expect a brother or sister to take responsibility for their other brothers or sisters.  It is understandable where a parent or a wife or a husband or son or daughter from a moral and legal point of view have responsibility, but for a brother and sister I think it is stretching the thing a bit too far and I would appeal to the Minister to remove that clause.  It is quite true that no amendment can be put in on it because I take it that the Chair has ruled it would be an extra charge on the Exchequer.  That is so, but it is quite true that the Minister can, if he so wishes, amend that on the Report Stage and I would appeal to him to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see that this section is being welcomed from all sides of the House, or practically all sides of the House so far.  Personally, I think that this is about the best section in the whole Bill. I think that if it is fully implemented &mdash;and I am sure it will be some time before it is fully implemented&mdash;it is capable of making a magnificent contribution to public health in this country and to social welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> The whole section brings up a vast problem, practically as big as the whole question of health services itself.  It covers in its field very, very wide aspects which involve issues that the public in this country will not be aware of at all until they understand the full significance of the limitation.  Our experience on it has so far been only in regard to people who have been suffering from T.B., and here a small, cautious but very successful start has been made by a number of voluntary committees.  This is a problem which so far the State has hesitated to grapple with, and the Minister shows great courage in bringing forward legislation of as wide a scope as he proposes in this section here.  There are most tremendous difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to see the Minister suggest that he should have a committee to advise him, and I hope that committee will be representative of all the facets in the very complex problem which stands in the way of legislation of this nature.  I think a lot of the difficulties can be got over by education of the public and of the people involved as to what is really meant by rehabilitation.  There are, of course, natural fears of misunderstanding between employers and employees.  Employers might get partly fit men cheaper than fit men, but I think that that difficulty can be overcome when employers and employees and their representatives understand the position involved.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in the remarks of Deputy Kyne in that respect and he was obviously thinking along the same lines.  The State can play a very big part, as it is far and away the biggest employer in the country.  We cannot talk about the implementation of this until the employment position has been tackled, but in every large industry it should be possible to find a certain percentage of jobs which could be reserved for those who have not been able to make a complete recovery from some illness&mdash;T.B., nervous diseases, poliomyelitis, disablement following injury or accident at work, or sightless persons, or whatever the defect may be I have noticed in big concerns <Col N="1122" /> such as C.I.E., Bord na Móna and the bigger local authorities, that there are many jobs where disabled people could be employed.</P>
    <P>The public must appreciate how much it is to everybody's interest that rehabilitation should be attempted. The alternative to rehabilitation is to put a partially fit man on some small State payment and leave him like that for the rest of his life.  It means that mentally and physically he degenerates. I believe that many of the people at present listed as unemployed might fall into that category.  That is why we will have to examine the whole problem very carefully.</P>
    <P>The question of an allowance must be combined with rehabilitation in its various stages, no matter what the patient may have been suffering from. That is the big difference, where rehabilitation offers so much as against leaving the partially fit person on some sort of medical benefit, some sort of social welfare assistance.  You can have a system whereby as the man's earning capacity increases whatever allowances or subsistence he is getting from the State is gradually reduced and you have the man feeling that he is making a recovery himself and becoming part of society again.</P>
    <P>The State and voluntary effort&mdash; there is a tremendous opening for voluntary effort&mdash;will have to move cautiously and should move hand in hand.  I would like to pay tribute to the work of the voluntary committees that have already been started.  They have done a very fine job.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister does not actually use the words &ldquo;sheltered industry&rdquo; or &ldquo;village settlement&rdquo; or any of the other phrases which are used so extensively in literature on rehabilitation.  I take it that the section which he has here and the various descriptions which are given to the scope of the section cover those points.  I personally think this is one of the finest sections in the Bill.  I welcome it.  It is a tremendous undertaking and I hope that employer, employee and the general public will understand its significance and the magnificent contribution which it will make to the country and that it will <Col N="1123" /> be to everybody's benefit to work to implement a section like this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse everything that Deputy Kyne said in regard to the amendment&mdash; which I notice was not moved&mdash;which provides that the trade union organisations should be consulted.  I think it is essential to secure the co-operation of the trade unions in any effort which is made to find work for the disabled persons.</P>
      <P>May I appeal to the Minister?  The Minister has had bouquets thrown at him from all sides of the House in regard to this section.  I agree entirely with what Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll said&mdash;it is probably one of the finest provisions in the Bill.  It does suffer from some defects, which could be easily remedied.  Might I appeal to the Minister to do the big thing in this case by meeting us in regard to these difficulties?</P>
      <P>First of all, as I pointed out before, to limit the training of disabled persons to persons of over 16 years of age weakens considerably the benefit of the section.  Obviously, a disabled child, a child who may be disabled from birth or who becomes disabled in the course of childhood, is a much fitter subject for training than an adult and would be much more easily trained. I do not think that anybody could quarrel on any sociological grounds if the Minister made provision whereby local authorities made training facilities available for such children.  The additional cost cannot be very heavy and the number of people involved is not very large.  It would seem to be spoiling the ship for a ha'porth of tar, by precluding persons under 16 from coming under the provisions of the section.  Once an age limit of that kind is embodied in the Act, nothing can move a local authority to make training facilities available for persons below the age limit.  That is the first point on which I would appeal to the Minister to meet us.  I think that all the Minister would have to do to meet us on that point would be to delete the five words in the second line of the sub-section, &ldquo;over 16 years of age.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point, on which I would <Col N="1124" /> make a similar appeal to the Minister, is this use of a means test, which is dependent upon the ability of the person to provide for his own maintenance. As I pointed out earlier, a person may well be able to provide for his own maintenance, he may well be able to feed himself and to clothe himself; but he may be completely unable to provide for a course of training.  Inasmuch as the purpose of the section is to afford training facilities, the test should surely be not the capacity of the person to feed himself or to clothe himself but the capacity of the person to pay for the cost of the training required.  That training may be quite an expensive thing, particularly if it is a form of training or treatment that requires a person to attend a particular centre.  The centre may be in Dublin and the person may be in Donegal.  That person would have to bear the expense of coming to Dublin and staying in Dublin to receive the treatment and training required.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he should delete the words &ldquo;provide for their own maintenance&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;make adequate provision for such training&rdquo;.  In other words, the test should be the ability of the person involved to pay for the training required.  The sub-section would then read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The persons referred to in subsections (3) and (4) of this section are disabled persons who are unable to make adequate provision for such training.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The third matter is a matter already mentioned, in regard to putting an enabling sub-section in, to enable a local authority to arrange with another local authority, or even with some other institution, to provide the training. If the Minister could see his way to alter these two particular matters in sub-section (5), namely, the age limit and the means test which is based on the capacity of the person to provide for his own maintenance, it would make the section much more useful for the people who really need the help of such a section.</P>

      <P>As I read this section, there are two different problems in-section <Col N="1125" /> involved.  As to sub-section (1), if the Minister could get voluntary organisations to do that kind of work without reference to local authorities, he might get the work done more effectively. For a great many years there has been provision in the local government code which would enable local authorities to do certain things in respect of disabled persons.  But there was very little done by local authorities in that respect.  They had certain powers all the time but there was very little done. I take it that it will be young persons who will be concerned in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the training should be provided in voluntary institutions or by voluntary organisations. While I am all in favour of the provision being made here, I believe there are such voluntary organisations in existence that possibly might do the work more effectively if there was a grant-in-aid from the Minister or some other source.  They might more effectively provide the training and make arrangements for the placing of such persons in employment rather than giving local authorities another activity to carry out which they might not carry out as well as others.  As I said, there is a provision which enables local authorities to do a certain type of work somewhat similar to this but very little has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the second portion, the class of people who are specified, I take it that would mean chronic invalids incapable of being trained or rehabilitated or provided with any type of work and that they should be entitled to an allowance.  My reading of it is that the people who would come under this would be mainly people incapable of being trained, such as chronic invalids of any age.  That would be portion of the work which a local authority might do probably more effectively than a central or voluntary authority.  I disagree entirely with <Col N="1126" /> Deputy MacBride and Deputy Kyne that if there happens to be a semi-invalid in a family who are capable of providing for the maintenance of that semi-invalid they should be able to get out of their responsibilities.  That would be all wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>You will have cases of that kind, but you could not write them all into the law.  Hard cases make bad law.  I would not definitely write anything into the law which would enable a comparatively well-off family to throw their liability for the maintenance of an invalid on to the public purse.  I believe we should not legislate in that direction.  If the people are well enough off to maintain every member of the family it should be their responsibility.  If, however, the relatives set out here have gone to America or cannot be made carry out their responsibility, I think we should provide for such a person's maintenance. Persons who have no means of providing for themselves should be provided for.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is very much in this section with which we disagree.  With regard to sub-section (5), it was suggested that the age should be reduced to under 16.  It seems to me that the parents in the <Col N="1127" /> first instance should be responsible for anybody up to the age of 16.  Of course there might be peculiar circumstances in which the parents would not be able to provide, but such cases could be dealt with in other ways, such as relief from the local authority or something of that kind.</P>

      <P>I think this is a good section taking it by and large, because it does deal, as Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned, with people like infantile paralysis cases, as a case which comes to mind, and there are, as all Deputies have experienced, a good many people scattered throughout the country who have no means of support and who are dependent on relatives and I think the provision goes a long way towards meeting that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Allen was speaking just now about people coming under this section who would be entitled to consideration as they would be unable to support themselves, but it seems to me that they are covered all right because it says in sub-section (5):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The persons referred to in subsections (3) and (4) of this section are disabled persons over 16 years of age who are unable to provide for their own maintenance and whose relatives within the meaning of this sub-section, are unable to provide maintenance for them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> The principal reason I got up was because we are in opposition to a good many things and I think this more or less to some extent meets a requirement that is necessary.  There are some disabled people who have no means of support whatever, and when the Minister was giving an explanatory statement on this he did not actually say what was the amount.  In one section here, it says that a certain amount of maintenance allowance would be paid to people but he did not actually state what that amount would be.  It might not have been decided, and the Minister might like to clarify that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is absolutely necessary for the Minister to include in this section a provision for consultation with trade unions.  I am sure his reply will be that any sensible manager will consult the trade unions, but in this particular case I think it would be to the local authority's advantage if there was some clear-cut stipulation that such consultation would take place.  I have had experience in my constituency recently where the manager was very concerned about placing an ex-T.B. patient into a certain type of employment, and he went a certain distance and found he came up with very many snags because he did not have regard to the trade union rules with regard to apprenticeship to which the local authority wanted to put this boy.  He was very grateful afterwards when the particular trade union concerned volunteered to help and advise.  I know that was very much appreciated by the particular manager, but there are very many rules governing apprenticeship especially and the placing or training of disabled young people would be very much facilitated if the local authority had the benefit of the advice and the counsel of the trade unions on these particular rules, or else the local authority might find itself very often in trouble with the individual trade unions and with the trade union movement as a whole.  I do not say that as any sort of a threat but it will just so happen that way not that there will be any antagonism by <Col N="1129" /> the trade unions to the local authority or to any official of it or to this particular scheme&mdash;on the contrary, but the general principle of the trade union movement and the rules for the different trade unions are there and there is certainly bound to be trouble.</P>
      <P>With regard to the payment of maintenance allowances I do not think there can be much criticism in respect of training of disabled persons but there may be some trouble with regard to the payment of maintenance allowances to disabled persons who would be regarded as having been trained and who were, say, working at some particular type of industry within an institution.  The local authority may come up against certain snags because it seems to me that there is a possibility or a likelihood of competition between certain types of industry that might be carried on in these institutions as against the same type of industry carried on outside the institutions. I have a few examples in my mind where there has been competition to the advantage of the industry being carried on within an institution and to the disadvantage not alone of the industry ordinarily run outside, but also to the workers in that particular industry. It has come to my notice in recent times in respect of one particulard industry that they found in this institution&mdash;I will not specify the institution&mdash;that they had unfair advantage over the industry outside.</P>

      <P>Laundry, Deputy McQuillan says, but let us take the boot and shoe industry.  Is it suggested that the industry be carried on and the workers paid a mere maintenance allowance?  I am not saying this section is designed to create the situation I have described <Col N="1130" /> but there certainly could be unfair competition to a similar industry outside and that to the detriment of the workers so that, therefore, I would suggest that all these particular snags could more speedily be overcome and that the difficulties could be met in the initial stages and a training scheme set up or any type of workshop if there was a provision that the local authority should consult with the trade union movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally I do not see that there can possibly be any serious difficulty in the matter that Deputy Corish mentioned, because the number of people to be trained under this section and to be rehabilitated is, in comparison with the number of workers, very small I understand the Minister has in mind collaboration and consultation with the trade unions.  I think that is so, and I think what that really means is not so much the reference down to a trade union movement in a city like Limerick or Cork but that in actual fact before the regulations are made the Minister would consult with the Trades Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions.  That I think is what should be done&mdash;that it is much better that consultation should be at the highest level.  That is the viewpoint I hold, that it would be better for the smooth working of the machinery that that should be so.  My personal experience would be that the trade union movement itself for a long period has been pressing for legislation of this kind and I would be perfectly certain, at least it has been my experience, that every co-operation and help that the Minister should get will in fact be obtained by him in the making of these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one other matter I should like to mention.  I think that while the general sense of the House seems to be that a spouse, son, daughter or parent should have some responsibility for a person who is unable to provide for his or her own maintenance, that obligation should certainly not at this stage be extended to a brother or a sister.  I think it is definitely not an obligation that should be placed on a brother or sister by legislation. <Col N="1131" /> The trouble about it is that if this obligation is put on a brother or a sister by legislation, a brother or a sister may be threatened, in fact blackmailed, by a threat of procesdings in certain circumstances, as does happen under the Mental Treatment Acts at the moment.  Strictly speaking, the section as it stands means that if a person cannot provide for his or her own maintenance or if the relatives within the definition contained in sub-section (6) Cannot provide for it, the State would provide an allowance, but I think there would be, in fact, an obligation on a brother or a sister to contribute to the maintenace of a brother or a sister and that they could be compelled by statute to support or maintain that brother or sister.  What that really means is what Deputy Kyne said earlier, that a disabled person who should receive a maintenance allow-ahce will not receive it simply because a brother or a sister is in a position to provide for the disabled person.  I think that the section would be much improved and that we would be taking a step in the right direction if the words &ldquo;brother or sister&rdquo; were deleted from sub-section (6).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister replies I just want to touch on one point and that is in relation to the question of consultation with trade unions.  The trade unions welcome a-section of this character but I just want to make it plain that whatever may be in the Minister's mind in regard to the question of consultation with trade unions, it should be in the section, not merely from the point of view of recognising that the trade unions are as equally important as, if not more important than, employers, but also to ensure that there is no possibility whatever of this essential. consultation not being carried out, either by the officers of his Department or by any successor that may be later in his place.  In so far as the form of consultation is concerned, I would be concerned to have that consultation at a high level.  The only point at which consultation will be necessary is when the question arises as to whether the person who has been <Col N="1132" /> trained is going to be put into employment and the sooner we face the danger involved the better.  It is all very well having sympathy for people who are disabled and unable to support themselves because of physical disability but those who are speaking here to-night, including myself, are not in the unfortunate position of seeing that that disabled person may be competing for the job we want for maintaining our family.  It is very easy to secure acceptance, merely by the automatic decision of a vote, for the placing in employment of a certain person who is disabled in preference to a man who has got the full use of his faculties but that man may be suffering under another type of disablement. He may have a wife and five or six children.  That is a physical disablement, too, and if we are going to work this section it has got to be done, not by regulations but by inducements, understanding and a sense of sympathy amongst workers, generally, for these disabled people and a willingness to make special provision so that they can be placed in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak with some knowledge in this matter because only recently the Minister's Department was beginning preliminary steps to carry out a scheme of this type.  Without any knowledge of the responsible officer in that Department or without any consultation with the trade unions, certain steps were taken that were quite frankly about to destroy the whole scheme.  It was only saved because at the last moment it was made possible for the trade unions to be consulted. In this particular case, not merely was the individual suffering from a disability being placed in work which was not suitable and which was dangerous, but he was also being placed in that work at a rate, of wages which nobody could justify, particularly the Minister's own Department.  Yet all this happened because some well-meaning individuals had gone in a hurry and made certain arrangements, without the knowledge of the officers of the Minister's Department or without consultation with the trade union.  The same thing could happen under this section.  It is more important in the <Col N="1133" /> case of an adult person who has been trained in a certain occupation than in the case of a young person.</P>
    <P>In most cases, where people are going to be trained, they will be trained to perform operations which form part of trades or crafts, such as metal work or woodwork.  They are not trained as unskilled labourers; they are going into the field of industry where there is, in general, the utmost control and where there have been long-established conditions and regulations.  To fit them in requires not merely goodwill on the part of the workers with whom they are going to work but it also requires knowledge as to whether or not the disabled person will be taken advantage of.  Let us not &ldquo;kid&rdquo; ourselves that all employers in this country are Christians. There will be only too many of those persons offered work when trained at less than half the wages paid a fully capable person although the disabled person may be able to turn out more than the fully capable person.  They may be put into employment under conditions which in many cases are very dangerous or under conditions which are highly objectionable.</P>
    <P>There is then the other side, where in many instances, you will have the position where a disabled person desires training.  It may be difficult to find an opening for him but, yet a few inquiries among the actual workers engaged in an industry, will very quickly elicit information if there is an opening for a definite type of training in which the disabled person will be welcome. Yet all that will not be known if this consultation is not available. Consultation has definitely to be with the trade union and, more important still, it has to be at the point where efforts are being made to get the disabled person into that actual employment. There is no use in arranging to fix rates of wages and conditions for a person of this kind and then find that you have omitted the most important thing of all&mdash;the goodwill of the people he is going to work with.  My anxiety is to see this section put in a way that it will work, and to see that the Department will be able to operate it not merely with the goodwill of the <Col N="1134" /> particular unions concerned&mdash;they will have that in any case&mdash;but with a provision for full protection for the persons concerned, and in such a manner as to get the most out of it.  I would, therefore, urge the Minister not merely to commit himself to consultation but to commit himself to putting it in the section on the Report Stage.  If he does not, and if it is left in such a way that consultation does not take place, then I think it would be far better to drop the section altogether because the section would not work without consultation with the trade unions, and I think the Minister should face that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with what some Deputies said, that this scheme is not perfect.  It is not so easy to produce a perfect scheme where you have not very much experience to go upon.  Unfortunately, I have not got anything to draw from in other countries that would in any way be a guide to me here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tried to get figures from test areas in the country but I am afraid that they were most unreliable.  Therefore, I feel that the section must be put through and that we must go a certain distance before we can make a reliable estimate of what this particular section is likely to cost.  That being the position, I am very loth to go too far.  If we were dealing with a matter such as old age pensions and if I were pressed to make some concession in the means test I would have a fairly good idea of what it would cost&mdash;or if I am asked to make any other concession I can say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;but in this particular scheme I have practically no idea of what a relaxation in any particular direction may lead to in the way of cost.  For that reason, I am inclined to be rather cautious as to how we should start this scheme. If we find it is not costing as much as we feared in the beginning then we can be more generous.  I am sure every Deputy is aware that our experience in regard to social services is that we are getting more generous as time goes on.  Bearing that in mind, perhaps Deputies will not think that I am arguing against some of their pleas or that I am more hard-hearted than they.  As <Col N="1135" /> I have said, in this scheme I want to be cautious in regard to how we start and to be more generous as time goes on, if we can afford it.</P>
    <P>One point that was made by Deputy Allen was that sub-section (1) might be operated by a voluntary body rather than by a local authority.  I am afraid the local authority will have to take responsibility.  We have voluntary bodies working in a small way&mdash;I mean, not achieving very much in the way of numbers&mdash;and yet they are spending a great deal of money for a voluntary body.  In fact, you have a number of people on these voluntary bodies giving a great deal of their time in collecting money for the object which they have in mind.  I am afraid that voluntary efforts will never get us the distance we want to go.  That is why we are putting the obligation on the local authority to provide the facilities. They can arrange with the voluntary body to do the work.  Under Section 59, that can be done, but it is the local authority that will have to arrange with that voluntary body to do the work and give them funds, premises, equipment, or whatever it may be, in order to help them to do the job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen is right also in saying that, as far as sub-section (1) is concerned, there is no age limit and no means test.  That means that, for the training of people, we have no means test and neither is there an age limit. Therefore, under that section, young people can be taken in and trained without any trouble.  The age limit is 16 and the means test applies only when we come down to consider a maintenance allowance.  The section is divided in that way: everybody is eligible for training but only those who need it, from the point of view of means, are eligible for a, maintenance allowance.</P>
    <P>A point raised by Deputy MacBride was that we should enable a local authority to make arrangements with another local authority to do the work for it&mdash;which, of course, is quite a good point.  As a matter of fact, that is arranged for under Section 43.  It is quite obvious that if you take a county with only three or four poliomyelitis <Col N="1136" /> cases, and if these particular cases want a very specialised form of treatment during their rehabilitation, it would pay that particular county very much better to send these three or four cases to an institution in another county which could cater for them rather than to set up one themselves. All that can be arranged under Section 43.  I am quite sure that what we will get under this section is specialised institutions, one in one county and another in another county, and that they will divide the work in that way and send their people to the best place, under that arrangement.</P>
    <P>This may be a costly scheme: I should not care even to mention a sum. In the beginning, it was put to me that probably it would cost at least £500,000 for the country.  It may be less; I do not know.  We have not been able to get a very reliable estimate of the number of people in the country who will require rehabilitation under this scheme and the number of people who will require the maintenance allowance.  At any rate, it will be a fairly big amount of money.  It will cost a fairly big amount and, for that reason, we do not want to be too flaithiúlach for a start off.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the amendment which is being pressed by certain Deputies, with regard to the brother and sister.  I suppose every Deputy can recall such a case.  I know several cases myself where a brother kept an invalid sister and where the brother was sufficiently well-off to do it.  I think that we should not interfere with that arrangement unless it is necessary. In some such cases the brother may have been left fairly well-off but maybe no obligation was put upon him to maintain his sister.  It was understood that he would do it.  He did it. If we bring along a scheme where a brother is not bound to maintain a sister, she will apply, and be eligible, for the allowance and the local authority and the State will have to pay that allowance where, really, there is no great necessity that they should do so.</P>
    <P>With regard to the case put up by Deputy Moran&mdash;he was the first to mention it&mdash;that we might have an <Col N="1137" /> invalid here with a brother in America who is not in touch with the family here, then we must get over that.  I think we would be able to put in some sort of an amendment on the Report Stage, if this clause is adopted, that would ensure that, wherever a reasonable effort was made, the person cannot be victimised because of some brother living far away and not in touch with the family, and so forth. Naturally, if a brother is married and has a family of his own, and is not in a position to do any more than that, then he would not be bound to contribute to the invalid brother or sister. At the moment anyway, I should be inclined to leave the brother and sister in, subject to certain safeguards that the invalid person would not be victimised if he fails to get a brother or sister to contribute, after all reasonable efforts have been made.</P>
    <P>With regard to wages, the system adopted by the voluntary rehabilitation centres is that they pay either on piece-work or by the hour but they pay trade union wages.  That is my understanding of the position.  The people of whom we have any experience so far are ex-tubercular patients, and, in the beginning, the medical officer allows a person to work only perhaps 16 hours in the week. That person is paid for those 16 hours and the maintenance allowance is continued up to a certain point.  I am not sure of exactly where it stops but let us say that it is paid until a person is earning half wage, working half the number of hours a week.  When that is exceeded the allowance is stopped and he begins to get the trade union wage for whatever hours be works.  A scheme like this could work on similar lines and I do not think there is any necessity to be afraid of low wages being paid and that in that way an injury may be done to firms outside which are paying ordinary trade union wages.  Deputy Corish got a false impression when he saw the maintenance allowance.  The maintenance allowance has nothing to do with the person learning a trade.  It is a separate matter and is certainly not meant to cover the work that such a person is doing.  It is put in to maintain a person, so long as he is being trained. <Col N="1138" /> I do not know whether any wage as paid until he turns out something, but when he starts to turn out an article as a result of his training, I think that wages should be paid&mdash;whatever wages are paid in the district or whatever the trade union wage is.</P>
    <P>With regard to trade union representation, I had in mind, as Deputy Cowan said, for a start anyway, that the central committee would have a trade union representative on it.  Any Minister would be foolish to set up a central committee to advise on a matter of this kind without having a trade union representative, because he would naturally know that some of the snags he would come up against would be conditions of labour and so on, and he would be most anxious to have the goodwill of the trade unions and. would, therefore, have representatives of the trade unions on the central committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin made the point that it is most important that the trade unions should come in at the point at which the person is getting work.  I am not disputing what he says&mdash;I am sure that from the trade union point of view it is very important and I am not objecting to it.  I should like to ask the Labour Party to put down the amendment again, because while I do not think I agree with it as it is, I want to avoid laying myself open to charge of bad faith by neglecting to put something in and I suggest that they put it down again for the Report Stage.  What I am afraid of, however, is that, if that amendment goes. in, it may put an obligation on the local authority which would be very embarrassing or might put them in a very awkward legal position on certain occasions.  For instance, there may be no trade union in a rural area. where a person is being rehabilitated. Suppose there is a move for a rehabilitation centre for the training of market gardeners in a rural area.  When a person has been fairly well trained as a market gardener, it may be found that an employer may not have trade union labour at all.  The local authority then may say: &ldquo;Look at the Act.  We must consult the trade union before doing anything.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is not a trade union. I want to examine the wording of the Labour Party amendment to make sure that it will not make it impossible or difficult for a local authority to carry on in having to look around to see if there is a trade union before doing anything. I have no objection to the amendment in cases in which it is quite plain that there is a trade union, in respect of woodworking, the sheet metal business or any other trade, because it would be foolish to try it on without consulting the trade union in that case and there is no reason why it should not be put in, if they think it necessary.  However, we can let the amendment go and I will consider the matter further and see whether I might not like to change the wording a little.</P>
      <P>I want to come back now practically to where I started.  I asked Deputies to look on this as a new scheme which we are trying out for the first time, a scheme in respect of which we have not got very much precise information.  If we are a little particular in putting more safeguards in than perhaps would be necessary, if we knew more about the subject, I would ask Deputies to have patience because it is very easy to amend these schemes afterwards and to make them a little more liberal as we go along.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the viewpoint put forward by the Minister, and I think he has approached the House reasonably in dealing with a number of the points <Col N="1140" /> raised.  I am sorry to raise another point, a point which occurred to me only just now.  I notice that in sub-section (1) the provision of the training facilities is mandatory on the local authority&mdash;&ldquo;a health authority shall provide the training facilities&rdquo;; but when it comes to the payment of the maintenance allowance, it is purely permissive&mdash;&ldquo;a health authority may pay&rdquo; these allowances.  Obviously, the intention of the Minister and of the drafters of the Bill was to leave it optional to each local authority whether or not it would pay these allowances.  I could see many arguments which could be advanced in favour of that viewpoint, that each local authority should have complete discretion whether or not it would pay such an allowance, but I wonder has the Minister considered the possible consequences of that policy.  Supposing, for instance, there was one particularly mean local authority in the country&mdash;as there are no Cork Deputies present&mdash; supposing Cork County Council or Cork Corporation decided they would not pay disablement allowances, because there is already a certain amount of traffic to Dublin, it is quite possible that there would be a drift of the disabled persons, too. Is it not possible that if there is not a uniform policy all over the country there will be a drift of disabled persons from the counties in which no allowances are paid to the counties in which they are paid?</P>

      <P>That is not so.  Am I to take it that the Minister will make that mandatory on the local authority?  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would ask the Minister to deal with that point at a later stage.  I think it would be a pity to let the section go as it is because undoubtedly local authorities will construe sub-section (4) as giving them complete discretion <Col N="1141" /> as to whether or not they will pay these allowances.</P>

      <P>There is one other matter that might be worth examination. It may not be of general application but it is, I think, of some importance. We are dealing with the section in relation to disablement.  In a number of law cases, accident cases, cases in which workmen are injured in the course of their work, insurance companies take into account the value of the national health benefits received by a person who has been injured and deduct that from its liabilities.  The courts have a tendency, too, to deduct such benefits from the amount of compensation a litigant may receive and the net result is that insurance companies very often save a certain amount of the liability by passing it on to the public purse.  It might be well to provide that the payment of disablement benefits should not be taken into account in assessing the payment of compensation.</P>

      <P>Let us hope there will be a general reorganisation of dispensary districts in the near future.  When did the last revision take place?  Populations have changed and some medical officers at the present time are overburdened with work, not alone from the point of view of population but also from the point of view of the bad arrangement of the <Col N="1142" /> district.  In Wexford some doctors have to travel a very roundabout route to reach their patients.  This particular section provides for rearrangement and I think that matter should be reviewed as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two factors governing the rearrangement of dispensary districts: density of population and distance.  Changes have been taking place.  Not so very long ago the town of Wexford was divided into two dispensary districts.  Enniscorthy is now being divided.  Wherever population has changed fairly substantially a rearrangement has taken place.  So far as I know there has been no general revision since the system started.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish mentioned that extra work might be put on doctors in particular dispensaries. It could cut both ways.  At the moment the dispensary doctor is responsible for medical, surgical and maternity services to those who are unable to provide such services for themselves.  From now on there will be a largely free maternity service and in the bigger centres of population, where the range of choice will be pretty wide, the dispensary doctor may in future find himself with less work.  That would seem to call for a considerable redrafting of the areas in the country as a whole.  In some cases it would possibly mean a considerable enlargement of the dispensaries. In other cases it would mean that they would be considerably reduced. <Col N="1143" /> Would the Minister not agree that for the purpose of implementation and discussion from the medical angle it could be necessary for him to have a pretty substantial scheme drafted at the back of his mind to put into effect? At least I would think so.</P>

Surely it is not out of place to ask the Minister that? So far we have had no information. Deputs Dr. Browne had some sort of a scheme.  He had a capitation scheme but the present Minister has not suggested anything like that.  Nobody knows where he stands in regard to the scheme.

      <P>I move amendment No. 69:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  The holder of any office under a public assistance authority to <Col N="1147" /> which sub-section (1) of this section does not apply shall perform such duties as may be assigned to him in relation to the functions of the health authority for the area or district for which he acts.</P>
    <P>This section transfers, to the health authorities, the holders of offices under the public assistance authorities, but there will be certain officers not transferred and their services may be required, even though they are not transferred.  This amendment is to make sure that these officers who are not transferred, but who are carrying out certain duties for the local authority at the moment, will continue to do them, whatever they may be.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should give the House an example.  At the present time, if a dispensary medical officer wants to send a patient into hospital he gets the home assistance officer to do it because, as I mentioned here on a former occasion, when my predecessor, Deputy Dr. Browne, asked the Irish Medical Association to do certain things, including the sending of patients to hospital, they refused to do it.  The local authority, therefore, had to get the home assistance officer to do it.  There are other things of that kind that may crop up.  This amendment is merely to put an obligation on officers who are not transferred, but who at the moment are doing certain duties for the pnblic assistance authority, to continue to do them for the health authority when these functions are transferred over to it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 70:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down the amendment so that I may be able to get a certain amount of clarification in relation to this sub-section. From reading it, it would appear to me to be an attempt to retain <Col N="1148" /> all the more unpleasant features of earlier poor law legislation.  The sub-section seems to me to epitomise the workhouse attitude to what we now call the county homes.  It struck me, when reading the early history of these workhouses, as I am sure it must have struck anybody who has read anything about them, that the general idea was to provide, for the tremendous number of destitute people who were dependent on them, an objectionable form of charity in those times&mdash;in the 19th century and in the early part of this century.  These workhouses were set up more as penal institutions where the occupants were given clearly to understand that they were not going to get any shelter, food, health or sustenance unless they paid for it through work of some sort.</P>
    <P>That was the general idea in the setting up of the workhouses which we now call county homes.  At any rate, the occupants were made feel that they were dependent on the poor law charity dispensed by those in control of these institutions at that time.  One of the conditions of getting shelter in them was the doing of work of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have some explanation to offer in regard to this sub-section which may satisfy the House. From reading it, I personally object to the suggestion that, because a person is sufficiently destitute to require shelter in one of our county homes-and I think the majority of those in them would have to be destitute before they would take that shelter-he or she should have to work.  I do not think that one of the conditions of getting that shelter should be that such a person would have work imposed on him or on her.  That could be open to very serious abuse.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister means that this work could be imposed on the aged occupants of our county homes.  That would appear to me to be quite unthinkable.  I am assuming that this may refer to the unmarried mother or to the able-bodied vagrant person.  I hope the Minister will be able to assure the House that the sub-section does not mean that compulsory labour would be imposed on any of the <Col N="1149" /> aged occupants, in our county homes. That would appear to me to be completely objectionable and to be completely opposed to what is the correct view on these matters in relation to the protection and shelter of our aged people in their declining years.  I should like to know if we are to assume that it is only the able-bodied vagrant or the unmarried mother who is to be subjected to this work and to this imposition by the local authority. If that is so, I am still opposed to it, because I think it is the wrong way of dealing with a person who is completely dependent on the local authority.  I think it would be very unwise and dangerous to insist that work would have to be carried out if such a person is to have the right of shelter.</P>
    <P>I should like to know the attitude of trade unions as to what the conditions of work will be.  I am of the opinion that another amendment, which is to come on later an the names of Deputy Larkin and Deputy Kyne, if accepted, would seem to me to be an advance on the Minister's sub-section.</P>
    <P>I should like to know, too, what the Minister's views are on the matter of the payments to be made to the occupants of these county homes if they are to be made carry out any work.  I suggest that a person in one of these places is very much worse off than the ordinary employee.  If he does not like his work, he can leave it.  That may result in the loss of a certain amount of personal comfort to him, but at any rate he can get out.  These people are in the unfortunate position that if they do not like their employer, they lose the roof over their heads.  That is a very serious consideration.  Personally, I feel, unless I can get an assurance from the Minister, that the enactment of such a sub-section as this would be a very retrograde step to take.  It should not be incorporated in this Bill or in any social legislation that we pass in this century.</P>
    <P>I should like to know, as regards the conditions of pay and the hours of service which these people will be bound to give, whether they will have trade union protection, whether the question of trade union consultation will be considered where, say, they <Col N="1150" /> were used as gardeners or as clerical assistants, if capable of such work, or used as domestic helps, such as cooks, or in laundries.  The latter are now big industries.  Quite a lot of them are worked in this way.  If that were to happen, it would seem to me that trade union employees engaged in laundries outside one of these institutions could be at a very grave disadvantage. The employee engaged on that work within the institution might be regarded as being engaged on a form of cheap labour&mdash;forced labour. It would be forced labour where a person is given the choice of getting shelter or of getting out.</P>
    <P>They might not like the work and might not want it.  I wonder where the freedom of the individual comes. in?  In previous years, when he was in better health and circumstances he provided his share for the upkeep of the county home.  If he happens to be destitute or aged, why should he not have the right to go into those places and enjoy a reasonable degree of comfort which is the standard adopted in most countries like Sweden and New Zealand, who profess to have-reached 20th century civilisation?</P>
    <P>I would be much more in favour of having these county homes as county homes rather than as workhouses, which is implied by this particular sub-section.  It is quite obvious that these places would have to revert to their old name of workhouse, that they would have that penal connotation in the mind of the people.  If a person went in, his being given shelter might be on the condition that he would carry out work which he might not like and which he would have no right to refuse. I think that would be wrong and an unwarranted interference with the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>At the same time I know there may be able-bodied persons without work within these institutions and that suitable work might be made available for them.  Nevertheless, it would be terribly wrong to victimise the majority; I would prefer to lean over towards protecting those few who might not wish to work rather than penalise the whole lot in order to catch the odd able-bodied person who would not work <Col N="1151" /> whether he was in or outside the county home.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister under this section, who would decide under this section what work would be carried out.  I would repeat that if there is any question of the aged working at all in the county homes, I would be totally opposed to it and I would consider that no amendment would make it acceptable.  If we aceept that the Minister is merely thinking of the able-bodied vagrants or the unmarried mothers, I would like to know who would decide the work those persons are to do and that they are able to do it?  Will the medical officer be considered in relation to it or will it be the decision of the head of the institution?  Will it be the decision of the county manager or who will decide what is suitable work for these persons.  Will the doctor's opinion be considered?  Furthermore if work is made available for this small group of peopla within a county home, will it be, as suggested in amendment No. 71, under conditions of work laid down by the different trade unions for the various occupations, namely, in regard to hours of work, terms of employment and remuneration.  I would like clarification in regard to these points.</P>

      <P>The Minister would be well advised to delete that sub-section. This matter must be approached from two different angles. First of all, from the psychological point of view, I feel Deputy Dr. Browne is quite right when he says it is helping to maintain the old workhouse atmosphere and the whole concept of the poor law legislation. Secondly, from the practical point of view.  I imagine that, generally speaking, most of the persons who are driven by force of circumstances to seek refuge in the county home would probably prefer to do some work.  It might be extremely good for them, but the matter should be left to their discretion. The only objection I see to the sub-section is that psychologically it is the wrong approach to the whole question. Likewise I think that the following sub-section&mdash;are we discussing the whole section, Sir?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, we would prefer Dr. Browne's amendment to the one set down in amendment No. 71. Our amendment is an attempt to correct the position, but indeed it is a position that should not arise.  We should not ignore the background to this sub-section.  It is quite definitely the continuance of the workhouse mentality as well as the continuance of the workhouse atmosphere.  You have only to read the sub-section to be quite clear as to its background. It does not set out to say that an able-bodied person who has had to have recourse to the county home shall perform, say, useful work and shall make a contribution to his maintenance, shall engage in some activity that will keep him occupied, and so on.  It merely sets down that a health authority may, as a condition of the grant of institutional assistance, require the person to perform certain work.  The whole idea is to provide the means whereby difficulties can be faced in the way of a person accepting that institutional assistance.</P>
      <P>That was originally the approach in the matter.  The whole idea of requiring work to be done in the workhouse was not from the point of view of getting useful labour but in the hope of driving them out of the workhouse.  It required them to perform such menial, objectionable and useless work that any decent man or woman revolted and only those who had been so broken by circumstances and by life itself that they were prepared to submit to any humiliation, would pnt up with that.  Those who have read about the old workhouse system at its worst will recall always the story of the men and women of spirit who, when required to do this work, revolted and left the workhouse rather than put up with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While conditions have changed, the atmosphere behind this sub-section is still there.  As Deputy Dr. Browne said we should get rid of the sub-section in <Col N="1153" /> order to get rid of the last remnants of the workhouse mentality and try to get a fresh approach.</P>
    <P>In so far as the work to be performed by persons under the sub-section is concerned, I have no doubt that the type of work they will be asked to perform is not work that we in this House would stand over.  It will be the most menial and useless work and in many cases it will be work to which there is strong objection to doing. However, when that pressure is there they must either do the work or be guilty of insubordination; they will thus create difficulties for themselves if they remain; alternatively, they must get out.  There is certainly no conception of the dignity of labour or of the dignity of the person involved. There is no consideration given as to the value of the work to be done.  It is a purely arbitrary attitude that certain tasks have to be performed as a condition of receiving assistance in the institution.  If we feel that people should make a contribution to their maintenance or that they are better off working rather than being idle, that is all right.  It is just a question of approach; it is a question of providing work not merely for the sake of work but because it is useful and performed under the proper conditions.</P>
    <P>That is the approach we have taken in the other amendment, in an endeavour to see that the right kind of work is provided under proper conditions and that proper rates of wages are paid as in the case of cut-side employees who have the responsibility of rearing, families.  There is nothing in the sub-section to recommend it.  It is purely a penal section giving arbitrary authority, requiring the inmates to perform any type of task that may be required irrespective of the uselessness of the task or the character of the task itself.  I am not querying at the moment, as Deputy Dr. Browne does, the position of individuals so far as their age or the state of their health is concerned.  That may be the least objectionable side.</P>
    <P>There is the other feature that we come across, that definitely the, question of the performance of work, particularly <Col N="1154" /> in Dublin, has, in fact, been given a penal character.  It has now become the established practice for persons receiving unemployment assistance to be called before the courts of Referee on the ground that they are not genuine cases and the test is applied that they will not be given assistance unless they go to the board of assistance, the old workhouse in James's Street, and perform task work in return for which they are given money under the head of assistance. The position is so bad that we have cases of men performing the ordinary work of a builder's labourer alongside a builder's labourer.  The ordinary builder's labourer, being a member of a trade union, gets his trade union wages, while the unfortunate worker, doing the same work, gets a few miserable shillings as assistance.  That is objectionable.  So long as that section is there, it can continue.  When I mention that, I am asked: &ldquo;Why cannot the trade unions do something about it?&rdquo; What can we do?  We can withdraw our trade union members and object to their working with the unfortunate worker who is trying to earn a few shillings but we cannot compel the employment exchange to pay his assistance and back he goes to their tender mercies.</P>
    <P>It would be far better to get rid of this altogether.  Where men and women need to take advantage of institutional assistance because of their unfortunate circumstances, at least we should bear in mind that, when they pass the gate, they are still human beings, and if we feel that they should make a contribution to their maintenance by the performance of useful work, it should be useful work, it should be work that they are prepared to do and not, as has already been pointed out, work which they have refused to do even if they have to face the possibility of being turned out. Above all, if the work is worth doing, it is worth paying for.  Then we can ask them to meet a sum in respect of maintenance of themselves and their families.  Because we have treated them as human beings, as useful members of society, we are entitled to ask them to make their contribution in the same way as any other worker who is <Col N="1155" /> in useful employment and earning his wages does.</P>
    <P>We must get rid of these remnants of workhouse mentality and this feeling that it is not a question of providing assistance and aid to a fellow-human being who is in difficulties but rather of creating as many objectionable conditions as we can think of and putting them between that individual and his family and the protection and the ease in so far as material support and comfort are concerned that can be provided by the community in the county home.  After all, what is the purpose of providing the maintenance in the county home if we do not want them to take advantage of it?  The whole of this sub-section has as its background the mentality of the workhouse, that the best way to keep the population of the workhouse low is to drive them out by asking them to do impossible task work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy Dr. Browne and the other Deputies who have spoken in support of his amendment.  It is only right that we should avail of the first opportunity of endeavouring to alter what has been very properly described here as the workhouse mentality and the workhouse atmosphere.</P>
      <P>When a person goes in to receive institutional assistance&mdash;as the section says, it means shelter and maintenance in a county home or similar institution &mdash;that person goes in for the very good reason that he is not able to obtain shelter or maintenance elsewhere.  If it is to be a condition of his getting shelter and maintenance that he has to do certain task work, then the charitable objective of the section is defeated.</P>
      <P>Let us look at any county home that we know.  What work can they provide in that county home?  There is no real work they can provide, no necessary work.  They can, of course, have a considerable number of stones and hammers and they can put the unfortunate person to sit down on a bag of straw or on a bag without straw, to break those stones for a certain number of hours in the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what has been said by <Col N="1156" /> both Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Larkin that those people are humans beings and ought to be treated as human beings.  If there is real work there to be done for which they could be paid a trade union wage, then I am quite sure they would be willing to do it.  If you simply have that prison atmosphere of being made to move a heap of stones from one corner of the yard to the other and, the following day, to move that heap of stones back again, that is humiliating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there has to be in some places.  This section, unfortunately, provides that such a thing could be done because it says that a health authority may, as a condition of the granting of institutional assistance, require him to perform such work as-the authority considers suitable to his sex, age, strength and capacity.  There is no doubt about it, that sub-section gives the authority power to prescribe work to be done by an individual.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne asked the question, who decides what work is to be done, who decides whether the person is fit or not to do that work?  Is the person medically examined?  Is he to be medically tested or is she to be medically tested to see whether they can perform that work or not or is it to be just an arbitrary decision of an official that a certain amount of work, whether it is valuable work or not, must be done in order to be maintained in that county home or similar institution?</P>
      <P>The Minister should agree to the deletion of that clause.  What we should be trying to do in institutions such as this where people who are broken and in need of institutional assistance go is, by kindness and consideration, to rehabilitate them rather than to use this offensive, disciplinary machinery that treats the unfortunate person as a cog to be ordered here and there by an official.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An opportunity is given to us now to <Col N="1157" /> eliminate this section from the Act and to permit us to adopt a completely new approach in regard to the treatment of people who have of necessity to avail of institutional assistance.  I would press the Minister very strongly to agree to the deletion of that section and to leave the machinery of the institution to be developed on humane grounds by the different local authorities, because once that section is there officials will feel it is their duty to continue the old system that has been described here as the workhouse mentality and the workhouse atmosphere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the wording of the sub-section could possibly be different, but I have never known in over 20 years' association with local authorities that in any of the institutions other than voluntary work was performed.  The law that exists at the moment is somewhat similar to what is there.  I think it is even stronger, and there was no such provision in operation as Deputy Cowan suggested as breaking stones or anything else.  If there is anything of that kind in the City of Dublin I would be surprised to hear it because in any local authority that I know they do not require the performance of such work in their institutions and county homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you have able-bodied people in full vigour of health performing ordinary domestic tasks in keeping themselves clean, for instance, or something like that I do not know why there should be an objection to that.  I think it would be very wrong if the management of that particular institution, whatever it might be, could not insist on able-bodied inmates or residents performing the ordinary domestic tasks in their own interests.  We have often heard of occupational therapy.  It is good for humans if they are in health; but such a thing as breaking stones or performing menial tasks or being compelled to hard labour&mdash;I doubt if it exists at all in this country.  I have never heard of it.  If it exists in any institution in the City of Dublin then they are behind the times altogether. I am surprised that even Deputy Cowan should suggest that there was such work being performed in this City <Col N="1158" /> of Dublin.  It would be rather primitive. The Minister could change the wording if there is any objection to the wording of the sub-section as it is. I would not like that able-bodied men in full vigour and health should not perform small domestic tasks in their own interests in an institution.  I think it would be all wrong, and Deputies will agree it would be wrong if that were so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment is serving a great purpose. Either this section is put in the Bill with some particular thing, in mind or else a good Bill would be a better Bill without it.  The Labour Party certainly are prepared to support him to the full in the request that this be taken from it.  It is not any great shock to me to know that people are required to do work.  It is not so long back to the day when casuals went into the county home or the work-house&mdash;call it whatever you will&mdash;and were required to break a lot of stones before they got their breakfast in the morning.  That was the time when they had on their back the members of whatever unions they were.  Everything was done to humiliate them, to force them to keep away so that the rates would be kept down and so that only the very destitute people would avail of them and they were nothing more than down and outs.  That is not <Col N="1159" /> done to-day; but those unmarried mothers who have the misfortune to enter some of those homes are put to some of the most menial tasks, made to do unnecessary work sometimes, just maybe as a lesson to them not to come in again.  I do not agree with that.  If a girl is misfortunate I do not think having revenge on her in that way is going to be any help.  It is going to make her embittered and warped for the rest of her life.  Surely we have a new outlook on these things. People can make mistakes but they can be led back on to the right road rather than driven on the wrong road as they are being at present.</P>

I would think that a service has been done in putting down this amendment which has drawn attention to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We felt that maybe the Minister had something more in this amendment than we could see, and because of that, because we thought that maybe there was some kind of principle of occupational therapy or some system where medical officers might advise inmates of a certain type that in their own interest there was a certain kind of work that could be done to improve them, we put down amendment No. 71 to meet that, so that there would be no exploitation under any other name. We were prepared, if you like, to have a double-barrelled shot at it.  If the Minister overcame Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment with a plausible story of this occupational thing being good for them, then we wanted to make sure that if he is occupied in his own interests he is not going to be a danger to the ordinary workman or to himself by being exploited by anybody. So we have amendment No. 71 down, but we are supporting amendment No. <Col N="1160" /> 70 if the Minister does not give a reason to Deputy Dr. Browne and to us that will satisfy us that we should withdraw that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words about this.  I am certainly opposed to this sub-section (5) here because I have heard a lot about State interference and unnecessary State control and this is, to my mind, a very powerful example of giving far, far too large power, very dangerous power, to a local authority under this Bill.  I have seen examples which have already been reported by other Deputies where unmarried mothers were maintained in an institution and where as part of the return for the maintenance and treatment which they got they were obliged to give certain domestic services for a period of a year or two years, apparently without any remuneration, so that it is a practical fact that legislation similar to this proposed section is actually being used at present here in this city in what is effectively an exploitation of labour. It is a most undesirable section.  This Bill is based on less progressive Acts than the 1947 Act and there are many traces of this type of very undesirable legislation.  I join with other Deputies in asking the Minister to reconsider this section.</P>
      <P>The amendment put down by the Labour Party would help to mitigate the difficulties in the sub-section, but I see no reason for the sub-section at all. It seems a most extraordinarily wide power and I feel it has come into the Bill just because the draftsman felt that it should be inherited from legislation of other days, I do not think it is in keeping with the spirit of the view of any Deputy or Party in the House; it is completely out of date and I would ask the Minister to consider it seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is a good lot being made of this particular sub-section.  The same trouble has arisen very many times on this Bill, where we are re-enacting a certain sub-section that was there already.  It must be done when transferring functions from the public assistance authority <Col N="1161" /> to the health authority, as we have to re-enact whatever we think necessary to carry on the position as it was before.  We are taking over these homes from the public assistance authority and handing them over to the health authority.  In handing them over, what is proposed here is to give them many of the powers that the public assistance authority had&mdash;but not all, as a matter of fact.  There were some drastic powers there which are left out.</P>
      <P>As far as this sub-section is concerned, Deputies should see that they can only be asked to do work which is suitable to their age, sex, strength and capacity.  I want to see these homes run for a little bit longer, until we have time to break them up.  We have been pressing local authorities to remove the unmarried mothers to special institutions.  There are three or four special institutions running for some years, but not sufficiently large to take them all from all the counties. I know that some of the county managers have been in conference on behalf of the local authorities, to see if it is possible to get a home for unmarried mothers that would serve three or four counties.  As soon as that problem is over, as soon as the unmarried mothers are removed to homes, one part of the difficulty will disappear.  I suppose Deputies are aware that in these county homes at the moment you have the old people, those who are incapacitated and not able to work any longer; you have the able-bodied that come in for a night or two and go off again, the unmarried mothers, feeble-minded children and, in some cases, there were even people suffering from tuberculosis, though they have been removed now.  We are endeavouring to get the unmarried mothers removed to special homes.  We are making as speedy progress as we can with the erection of homes for mental defectives so that we can get the imbecile children away from these county homes.  Eventually&mdash;in the near future, I hope&mdash;we will arrive at the position where nobody will be left there but the chronic sick and the old people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very anxious to go further than that.  I have circularised local <Col N="1162" /> authorities promising them certain grants for rebuilding, etc., and encouraging them to try systems of homes for the old people, the colony system or the big house in the country, or anything else, any other suggestion they may make.  I know that some local authorities are considering steps of that kind.  In the meantime, the clause is being left much as it was.  I have visited a number of these county homes in recent months and my experience every place I went was the same, that they are employing more and more people from outside to run the county home. They have people employed from outside in the laundries, in the cook-house, in the kitchen, where they had not got them some years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because the inmates are not being made work as they had to work before.  Up to some years ago&mdash;maybe up to recently, in some cases&mdash;they had the unmarried mothers to do a lot of that work, laundry work and kitchen work.  That has disappeared from some institutions and even where it is left they are not doing as much of that type of work as they were doing before.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about the imprisonment part of it at all, but about the work.  If the local authority had no power to tell a person he or she must do some work, I think it would be very bad.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be in the cook-house or the laundry or elsewhere. There is no other type of work visualised. They do not compel old people to work, though some of them are very glad to do a certain amount of it in <Col N="1163" /> keeping the place nice and tidy or working about the garden.  I myself have seen some of them sweeping up after meals or doing jobs of that kind, but they are not made to work.  It is done only where they volunteer.  It is a great thing to see them helping in that way and it is good for them. Where you have young able-bodied people, even some of them must be made to work.  I had the experience myself&mdash;looking around me now, I suppose there is hardly anyone here at the moment old enough to have the same experience&mdash;of being in three or four internment camps.  We had young able-bodied men there, and some of them had to be made work.  They would be quite prepared to let some of the prisoners do all the work in the camp while they stayed idle.  It would be very bad for morale that that should happen.</P>
      <P>Local authorities should have power to make able-bodied people do a certain amount of work&mdash;whether they are unmarried mothers or not&mdash;and I think we should have some such sub-section as this.  I do not mind if it is modified. I do not think we should give power to local authorities&mdash;I am sure they could not use it&mdash;to make them do work of the type mentioned, like breaking stones.  Breaking stones before breakfast stopped in the British time&mdash;I do not think it went on even in the Cumann na Gaedheal time.  I do not wish to give any local authority power to do that.  Even if they had it, as everyone knows they could not get the work done.  What I have in mind is work around the house, sweeping the place, or a certain amount of cooking, washing, and so on.</P>
      <P>I know it is very difficult to legislate that they must not be overworked, as someone would have to interpret that, whoever did it.</P>
      <P>I would be very much averse to making it possible for the local authority to make them work at all, and if we can get some progress there I would be quite satisfied.</P>

    <P>Someone spoke of occupational therapy.  It is being started in some of the bigger county homes and I suppose it will spread in time to the <Col N="1164" /> smaller county homes.  I have not that in mind, as I think occupational therapy could be carried on without compulsion.  I am not making that a plea for this particular sub-section, as I do not think it would be necessary. The plea I am making is that, as long as county homes remain as they are and as long as we have able-bodied people in them, the authorities should have power to get them to do a certain amount of work around the institution.</P>

      <P>I do not want to suggest that the occupants of these institutions should not be asked to do work which they are able to do.  I am asking that in 1953 we should not put a section in a Bill which would enable a local authority to make people do certain work without payment.</P>

      <P>What I have to say on this possibly should be said on the amendment of the Labour Party.  I should like to refer to a matter which the Minister mentioned, that this is merely a transfer of power to the health authority from the board of public assistance.  I feel that when we are passing legislation we have no excuse for embodying in it the mistake in former legislation.  If I, as a public representative, outside this House condemn severely the type of legislation which was in force from the British Government days, why should I be asked, when I come to this House, to support the carrying out of that legislation, even for a limited period, when we have the opportunity to set a new line?  The Minister suggests that the powers now being conferred on local authorities are not as comprehensive as the powers available up to this. I do not dispute that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1165" /> I think that by allowing sub-section (5) to be embodied in this Bill we are condoning a system of slave labour. Whether that is to last for a long or a short period, we cannot say.  We do not know when the opportunity may arise to change that.  My anxiety is to see that it is not embodied in this Bill.  I believe that if unmarried mothers have to go to these institutions and are asked to work they should be paid for the work.  There is a lot of hush-hush attached to this business.  The only reason I can see why this type of legislation was introduced is that those who envisaged the legislation were afraid that the illegitimate births in this country would be greater than the legitimate births and that severe penalties should be imposed on unfortunate girls who were unlucky enough to fall by the wayside. The position is that only a limited number of girls have to go to these institutions and we cannot close our eyes to the fact that it will not keep down the illegitimate birth rate if in England, Dublin and elsewhere, especially in England, arrangements are made to cater for unfortunate girls who suffer from that mishap.  When they go to England, we do not know what the future holds for them.  That is the shocking thing about it.  There is no incentive to them to face the music at home where good conditions should be available to rehabilitate them.  We are making the position worse by these impositions.</P>
    <P>There is another serious aspect of this.  If we give this power to local authorities, we are giving an example to private institutions to make things even worse for the girls in these institutions because they can point to the example set by local authorities and say that the power has been given by this House.  Many of us know that there are institutions in this country at the moment where unmarried mothers from the day they go in until they die are not allowed out of these institutions.  I can substantiate that statement.  I know that the Minister or any other Ministers would find it very hard to interfere in the running of these institutions because no authority has been given to them by this House.</P>

      <P>It is a shocking position that there are not facilities available.  If we give this authority under this sub-section we are going to set a bad example for private institutions. In the matter of employment and the treatment of those under their care the State and the local authorities should set the best example possible. I ask the Minister in all seriousness to carry out the suggestion of Deputy Dr. Browne and delete sub-section (5).</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties which some Deputies have is accepting from me that we should not delegate responsibility to officials or to local authorities which these local authorities can carry out with safety because it is we who passed the legislation and, once it was in our hands to do that, it would not be objectionable in any way.  I think Deputy Esmonde has a good case for suggesting that in passing a section like this in its present form we are putting into the hands of the county manager, or whoever it may be, power which we would regret to see used in our institutions.  It is because I am conscious of our responsibility that legislation passed by this House must be as nearly as possible the absolute expression of our wishes and intentions in relation to these people that we must ask the Minister to give very careful consideration to this sub-section before putting it through the House or carrying it out in its present form.</P>
      <P>From the Minister's statement, there seems to be only one section left for whom we are now legislating.  He says that the old men and women occupants of our county homes will not be and must not be expected to do any work whatsoever.</P>

      <Col N="1167" /> The only other person is the unmarried mother who is another vast problem.  It appears she is going to leave the county home.  That is a very good thing indeed.  It leaves us with the vagrant, so that really this sub-section is concerned with the unfortunate person who has no home and decides to shelter in our county homes. As long as it is established in this sub-section that we are dealing only with this person then we can consider it from another angle.  At the same time we have got to bear in mind that for many years to come the unmarried mother will continue to live in these county homes.  I consider it no defence at all, as Deputy McQuillan has pointed out, to say that the clause is being left &ldquo;much as it was,&rdquo; quoting the Minister's phrase.  I think that is no tribute to the House.  I think it is a positive reflection on the House. This sub-sections reads very like a sub-section or commentary that I was reading the other day in a Viceregal consideration or report on county homes or workhouses carried out 80 or 90 years ago, in which the same attitude was implied of penalising a man for being so criminally negligent as to be so destitute that he should find his way into one of our county homes.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is prepared to be quite clear on that point in relation to old people&mdash;that they cannot be forced to do that work and that it is quite clear to them that any work they do is voluntary work in the gardens or clearing up.  But at the same time I would be in favour, if it is insisted that the Minister wants to give local authorities powers in relation to making a certain section work &mdash;the vagrant, the person who is there for three or four days&mdash;of the suggestion in amendment No. 71, which presumably we will be discussing later, a leas-Cheann Comhairle, in the names of Deputy Larkin and Deputy Kyne, that any work they do shall be at stated rates and under conditions decided by the trade unions.  So that, on those assumptions in relation to old people first of all, I think it is a great <Col N="1168" /> misfortune that the Minister insists on leaving the clause much as it has been since 1801 or so, I think it is a reflection on the House and on us, and I think the only possible argument that could be made for it is that it is in an attempt to cover the minutest percentage of people who pass through the county homes at present, that this offensive sub-section is to be retained by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think the best thing to do would be to redraft it to definitely exclude the sections which are definitely excluded in the Minister's mind and in our intentions, or preferably to exclude the sub-section altogether.  If that is not possible then I feel that any work that is carried out&mdash;if it was work of a desirable nature decided by the medical officers&mdash;that that work should be carried out under rates specified and agreements as laid down by the amendment of Deputy Larkin and Deputy Kyne, that the work would be under stated trade union conditions. Again, I repeat, that it is unfortunate that such a sub-section has been maintained in legislation of our times.  The ideal arrangement would be to provide accommodation for these people as long as they require it as men and women who had fallen in need of it and who, by virtue of the fact that they had the right of citizenship or were former ratepayers or taxpayers or whatever it might be had a perfect right to get the shelter that is offered to them as long as they need it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, Sir, my trouble in relation to these county homes is my consideration of the correct attitude to be adopted in relation to the inmates of these homes, the aged.  I find it difiicult to legislate for the small percen, tage of difficult persons who seem to dominate the minds of those persons who drafted the Bill and this sub-section (6). I feel that it contains in paragraphs (c) and (d), sub-section (6) the suggestion that the inmates of these homes shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for terms not exceeding 21 days.  I would like to know from the Minister why it is that this sub-section is included in relation to county homes and does not appear to be intended for our other institutions, unless he means by &ldquo;similar institution&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;every person maintained by a health authority in a county home or similar institution...&rdquo;&mdash;to include county hospitals, district and regional hospitals and district and regional <Col N="1170" /> sanatoria, and so on?  Is it intended that this sub-section referring to disciplinary action to be taken against persons who carry on in a particular way, should refer to all institutions controlled by local authorities or is it specifically referring to our county homes?</P>

      <P>I see.  I would like to know from the Minister why it is found necessary or desirable that this form of legislation should be included for our county homes and not for all our other institutions.  Is it because of the type of person we have in these county homes, our aged people, as they are in the majority?  It seems to be a very wrong reason.  I move to report progress.</P>
