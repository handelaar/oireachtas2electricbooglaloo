    <P>* The coming into operation of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, has had the effect of increasing the numbers of persons insured and also, it is believed, the numbers of persons registering in the categories covered by the above table.  In calculating the percentages the number of persons insured has been taken as the number of persons in the specified categories insured in the previous insurance year ended October, 1952.  It may be necessary subsequently to revise the above figures.</P>

    <P>* The content of the figures in 1953 differs from that in the earlier years due to the legislative changes effected by the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  While it is not possible to give a precise measure of the effect of the legislative changes in increasing the Live Register, an investigation made in February, 1953, indicated that the increase at that date was in the region of 10,000.</P>
    <P>&dagger;The March, 1953, figures also differ somewhat from those for the corresponding month in 1951 and 1952 due to the later incidence of the First Employment Period Order, 1953.</P>

Official assistance in seeking and developing foreign markets is provided by my Department as a normal practice.

Does the Minister not consider it in the national interest that steps be taken to expand this trade until we reach the position that Scotland is in to-day in the export of whiskey?  With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

From the survey made the land directly damaged by flooding and waterlogging in the immediate vicinity of the main river and capable of improvement by arterial drainage is confined to a narrow strip along the river and comprises no more than about 800 acres.  The total area of the watershed or catchment is, of course, very much greater&mdash;approximately 52,000 acres.</P>

It is essential that such amendments should be before the House so that the Committee Stage discussion can take place in the light of the House's understanding as to what the Government's proposals are.  It is all the more unprecedented, and indeed all the more objectionable, in the practice of the House that we should be asked to go through this procedure after the Minister had indicated that there were very definite amendments to be made, and that these amendments were of a very important and fundamental character.

We must, therefore, take it that they are of first-class importance. I submit that the Report Stage of a Bill is the stage on which we hear what has happened on Committee.  It has been ruled repeatedly from the Chair that amendments of fundamental importance which have not been discussed on Committee are not presentable for discussion on Report.  The Minister is, therefore, treating the House very lightly in asking it to discuss the Committee Stage of this Bill with important amendments in the background.  He is trampling on the normal procedure of order in thinking that he can introduce on the Report Stage amendments of a fundamental kind that have not been discussed on Committee, even though they have been admitted by the Minister as being required and he has announced his intention of introducing such amendments.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's attitude is quite incomprehensible.  Dáil Éireann, by 73 votes to 50, passed the Money Resolution which permits the Dáil to proceed to the consideration of the Bill in Committee.  I suggest that the feeling of the House having been <Col N="801" /> expressed in no uncertain way, there is now no justification for holding up the whole Bill until the one or two amendments, which have been foreshadowed by the Minister for Health, are available to the Dáil.  On the point that it would be desirable that these particular amendments should be considered in Committee, I think the rules of the House provide for the recommittal to Committee for the purpose of considering specific amendments and we should, therefore, avail, if necessary of that machinery.  I cannot see any point in the argument which the Deputy has adduced.</P>

The purpose of the House, I take it, is to deal with the Health Bill in Committee as efficiently and as expeditiously as we can.

      <P>The Minister said that he proposed to meet these matters, or to attempt to meet them, by amendments which he would thereafter introduce, and he specifically referred in his concluding remarks to an amendment that he proposed to submit to the House in respect of Section 4.  I put it to the Government that Section 4 expressly governs every other section in the Bill.  That is the purpose for which it is in the Bill.  Is it reasonable, then, to ask the House to deal in Committee with every section of a Bill to which the Government itself says it is going to introduce a new amendment, the nature of which nobody knows but which will govern every section?</P>

When replying on the Money Resolution the Minister indicated that he proposed to circulate amendments for the Committee Stage, the stage we are now approaching.  We are in the position that although the Minister has made certain promises in that respect, we have not yet seen the amendments.  I concede that the Minister might need some time to draft the amendments which he proposes to submit.  Is it not possible, however, at this stage for the Minister to turn out whatever amendments are available so that we can tie them up with the sections on the Committee Stage?

      <P>The position is a bit unusual on account of the antics of Fine Gael.  Usually, on a Second Stage, Deputies tell the Minister in what ways they would like to have the Bill amended.  For some reason best known to themselves, they did not discuss the Bill on the Second <Col N="805" /> Stage.  They spoke on the Money Resolution.  A Money Resolution usually immediately precedes the Committee Stage.  In these circumstances, how am I to be in a position to meet the wishes of Deputies?  After all, it is their own fault.  I assume&mdash;although it is a big assumption&mdash;that they are now sincere and honest in regard to this Bill.  When I was winding up the debate on the Money Resolution I said that I proposed to agree to certain amendments though they might have to be redrafted.  Deputy Norton has an amendment in relation to choice of doctor and Deputy MacBride has an amendment in regard to consultative councils.  There may be others besides these two amendments but I have these in mind at the moment.  I said that I proposed to bring in two amendments: (1) to add certain words to section 4 which, I think, any Deputy will agree does not change the meaning of the section but puts it beyond all doubt that there is no compulsion. That is not a fundamental amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I think it is right to say that I, as a Deputy, have at all times received from the Department of External Affairs full co-operation in regard to problems which have arisen at different times. Through the Chair and through the Minister I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation to the Secretary and officials of the Department for their valuable co-operation on such occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One point which I desire to mention in regard to this Estimate has already been referred to by Deputy MacBride &mdash;the extension of our fishing territorial area.  That is a matter on which we desire the Minister to concentrate with a view to bringing about the improvement which has been suggested. Those of us who come particularly from the seaboard areas know the obstacles that are placed before our own nationals at the present time.  If Governments of other countries, through their Foreign Ministers, have been able to remedy a position which was not satisfactory to any of those States, it is possible for us to do likewise. <Col N="808" /> The Minister should concentrate on remedying the situation by having the three-mile limit extended.  If other countries have been able to do it, then we can do it.  In the interests of the country and in the interests of a large section who are depending for a living on such an important factor in our economy as fishing, the Minister should move directly in an endeavour to have the present three-mile radius extended.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to touch on briefly is Partition.  Some members here have spoken on this problem.  I believe every member of this House has similar views on this thorny problem and whatever our views may be as to the approach to the solution of this problem, which is so vital to the life of this 32-County nation, at least our goal is the same&mdash;that is, the unification of North and South.  Therefore my words on this important subject would be much the same as those of my colleague Deputy Tom Kyne, who has spoken, and of other members of this House.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our foreign policy was referred to during the discussion. Mention was made of our representatives going to Strasbourg and also of the number of embassies we had in foreign countries.  Even in some of our newspapers prominence has been given to the fact that this Estimate has been cut down.  We are at a stage in this country when everyone seems to be anxious for a reduction in the Estimate of every Department of State.  However, if we go through the Book of Estimates and consider the reduction in this particular Estimate presented by the Minister for External Affairs, surely it is obvious that the only reduction of any importance is in connection with the amount allocated for the news agency which I do not intend to discuss here.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of reductions in certain items of expenditure provided the expenditure or the increased expenditure is for the good of this nation. Of the money we are spending on this important Ministry of External Affairs, a good portion naturally must be spent on the provision of embassies in other countries and the paying of our ambassadors <Col N="809" /> and staff in these different centres.  I am in favour of such expenditure provided our approach to external affairs is a just and proper one and provided we get the returns. Nevertheless, I assume that no matter how able our ambassadors may be in any of these foreign countries they must of necessity be governed by the approach to external affairs as laid down by their Minister and by his Government.</P>
    <P>I am not anxious to bring in any personal note to this discussion but certain remarks were made in this House last week in regard to our representatives going to Strasbourg.  I believe our representatives can do good work there and that it is right for us to have representatives there, but, leaving all questions of personality out of it, I say to the Minister and through him to the Taoiseach, that we must, above all, be very particular about the expressions and the motives that may be behind the outward expressions of our representatives.</P>
    <P>It ill-behoves us as members of a responsible assembly to agree with the Minister or the Taoiseach in sending a delegate to Strasbourg who will come into this House and use such an offensive expression&mdash;it is recorded in the Dáil debates of last week&mdash;as &ldquo;the Pope's brass band.&rdquo;  I am not dealing with the personal outlook of the gentleman who made that reference.  That is his own matter, but we are governed by the fact that other nations can judge us by our representatives who are sent abroad.  While we have in this country a small Army or defence force, the Minister has in his Department an army that can be far more beneficial to this country in their efforts in other countries if they adopt the proper policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not told us of his policy but in the present world where we hear so much about the East and West, it would be far wiser for us, when we consider the policy of Ireland in what is termed the golden age of civilisation in this country, if the Minister and his Government did their utmost to imitate that policy.  We must know from our own experience <Col N="810" /> of everyday life that no matter how capable our representatives in other countries may be, we do not wish that they would participate in a policy&mdash;as they might have to, due to ministerial and Government policy outlined by certain other countries&mdash;wherein international diplomacy&mdash;as so much can be said against it&mdash;would be a part.</P>
    <P>We should adopt our own line of thought in relation to the international situation.  Much capital has been made from time to time in this House about coalescing, but we must be prepared to co-operate, not just with one great Power or another great Power, but to take our stand in trying to build up the one true civilisation, that is a European civilisation.  I would like to know from the Minister what is his policy and the policy of the Government in connection with this particular line of action.</P>
    <P>Members have spoken a great deal here on the necessity of our going hand-in-hand with one great Power.  In going through the figures as submitted to us, I think it is interesting to see that in some of the great capitals of Europe the amount expended is relatively small compared to what it is in others.  For instance, in the United States, the total cost of our Embassy is, roughly, so far as I can see, £95,800. Yet for our representatives in some of the capitals in Europe, including the Vatican itself and other such very important centres, the amounts asked for here are relatively small.  May I suggest to the Minister that in our ambition to secure political freedom for the 32 Counties we can be judged, in a true sense of democracy, not on what we say here or in London or in Washington but rather on the actions taken by us in these centres in Europe.  Deputy Blowick&mdash;I think other speakers, including one of the Independent Deputies, did not agree with him&mdash;mentioned the importance of the small nations of Europe.  Are we, and I wonder is the Minister himself, inclined to forget that there are so many small nations just like our own Are we inclined to forget that if we do not take our place amongst the small nations but follow the big <Col N="811" /> nations, we shall be swallowed up by these individual large Powers in their own interests?  We should consider the important part we can play, not by talking of guns or atom bombs, but by offering as a true Catholic Christian nation our contribution to the States of Europe who may in the long run realise the honesty and the sincerity that lie behind our words.  If we adopt that policy towards European affairs, if we have less coat-tail pulling and high-hatting after some of the larger Powers, we should be better off.  If we follow that policy, time will enable us to decide whether the policy pursued by the Department is one in conformity with true Christian ideals or is one that is being directed to send people to important conferences in Europe, such as the Deputy who so freely spoke about the Pope's brass band, an expression which, undoubtedly, was a slight on the nation and a slight on every Deputy in this House who agreed to send such a representative to Strasbourg.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here on Friday last to hear the contributions of the various Deputies but I have had since an opportunity of reading what they had to say on this Estimate.  I observe that Deputy Finan, as reported at column 737, stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to summarise what I wish to convey.  Firstly, the importance of the closest co-operation with the people of the Six Counties on all economic matters.  Secondly, the necessity for getting, on every possible occasion, the interest and influence of the American people and the American Government in respect of the vital question of Partition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that Deputy Finan also mentioned that nowadays it is fashionable to run down the American Government and the American people.  I think we should be realistic about this matter.  I am not at all anti-American.  I am not anti-anything, but I should like to recall that a certain very well-known Irishman, approximately about 100 years ago, was subjected to very severe attack by a great number of Irish <Col N="812" /> people and wiped off Deputy Dillon's grandfather's dinner list because he had the temerity to speak the truth about the importance of Ireland in the eyes of the American people.  I say that many Irish people who go to America and live there have the real interests of this country at heart. Many of them are persuaded by politicians, looking for votes in America's interests, that these politicians have the interests of the Irish people at heart but just as Thomas D'Arcy McGee told the people of this country following the civil war in America, that they had been used on both sides and that the politicians making platform promises to the Irish people had no power to honour them, so at the present time many people in America are using the Irish vote there on the pretence that they have some power over the American Government as a result of which we, as a small nation, will be assisted to get rid of Partition and to take our proper place as an independent republican country.</P>
    <P>I think we had better realise that the position now is exactly as it was 100 years ago.  I do not like having to say this but when Deputy Blowick spoke on Friday he mentioned the subject of small nations and stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Both the last world wars were fought on the territories of small nations.  The small nations were ruthlessly trampled upon.  Their towns and cities were bombed and their people were crushed aside. The columns, the tanks and the armoured cars of the bigger nations simply hooshed their way ruthlessly over those countries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder does anybody believe that the larger nations ever change their attitude to the smaller nations when it suits their real interests, particularly in wartime?  Does Deputy Finan or anybody else think that, if a third world war were to break out, which God forbid, that any of the great Powers would pause for one moment on the threshold of this country and say: &ldquo;No, we shall not go in there&rdquo;, if it suited their purpose to come in? We should be under no illusion about what any great Power will do when <Col N="813" /> that great Power is fighting for its existence.</P>
    <P>That brings one logically enough to the question of what attitude we should declare that Ireland will adopt in the event of any such conflict&mdash; whether we should declare ourselves as neutral or whether we should regard the fight as one between Christianity and civilisation, for which we stand, on the one hand, and Godlessness and an effort to bring down social order, as we know it, on the other.  I do hope that when we come to make that decision we shall realise that great power, in all the world's history, has always tended to corrupt.  No matter what principles these nations allege they are subscribing to, they pay only lip service to them when expediency dictates that these alleged principles be broken.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan is right when he says that there is not any great evience of Christianity or the preservation of the social principles of western civilisation in aligning the democratic countries of Western Europe with Communist Yugo-Slavia.  The people who are now colloguing with Communism in Yugo-Slavia are the defenders of Christianity in Western civilisation.  They think nothing of continuing the dismemberment of our country and they would think nothing of taking us over if it were expedient for them to do so. We should declare that our attitude here is the attitude of our people in 1939, a neutrality which we would fight to preserve with all the military forces at our command and against any nation big or small that attempted to violate it.</P>
    <P>In that respect I would like to direct the Minister's attention to an article which appeared in a magazine recently by Professor Kelsen of Geneva University on the subject of neutrality and the U.N.O. Charter.  I do not propose now to go into the arguments in detail; they are rather involved.  In Professor Kelsen's view, no nation, whether a member of the U.N.O. or not, has under the Charter the right to be or to declare itself neutral.  That is a very interesting construction of the <Col N="814" /> U.N.O.  Charter and it comes from a man who undoubtedly knows what he is talking about.  If that is so, it will raise certain problems even as regards the declaration of a state of neutrality, quite apart from the question of preserving it</P>
    <P>On the matter of the preservation of neutrality, Deputy Blowick, who was uncomplimentary to the Taoiseach, in his speech, at column 750, said that the members of the Clann na Talmhan Party were met with frozen silence on the subject of Partition in 1943 when the members of the Clann na Talmhan Party attempted even to mention the fact that there was such a thing as a Border up North.  Deputy Blowick would do well to remember what the Irish people are not likely to forget, that the neutrality of this country was preserved more by that man who is our Taoiseach to-day as he was then than by any pious declarations by the Clann na Talmhan Party or any other Party, in 1943, or during the course of the war.  The Irish people are not likely to forget that but for Mr. de Valera we might never have preserved our neutrality.</P>

The Deputy might do well to read the final article appearing in the current issue.  Anyone who does not know about the part played by the Taoiseach in preserving the neutrality of this country hardly deserves to call himself an Irishman and certainly does not deserve the rewards that this country earned by being able to preserve its neutrality.  Not only am I foolish enough to believe it but every Irishman knows that what I am saying is true.</P>

      <P>As far as neutrality is concerned, another great problem that arises now concerns the position of this country <i>vis-à-vis</i> N.A.T.O., an organisation for which I have no great love.  I do not want this country to be tied to N.A.T.O. one way or the other. I do not think it ought to be tied to it. I do not agree that the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe should ever have changed its rules so as to bring questions of defence within the sphere of its deliberations.  It is a pity that any such assembly could not confine itself to the main problem of consulting on matters of economic and social importance to the various member countries.  N.A.T.O. was entirely a different kettle of fish and it would be a grave mistake indeed if we were to regard the Partition of the country, the abolition of Partition or anything whatever about Partition as germane to the issue as to whether we should join N.A.T.O. or not.  I personally hope that there will not be any statement made to the effect that we should join any organisation if and when the Partition of the country was brought to an end.</P>
      <P>I am very chary of any organisation which is tied hand and foot to a major Power because I have nothing but suspicion for all major Powers, if only because history teaches us that we must be suspicious of nations which control too much power in their own hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up then, I hope that the Government will continue to do everything it can&mdash;which is indeed a very vague way to put it&mdash;to realise the independence of a 32-county Ireland. I shall not make any suggestions at this stage as to what steps they should take although I have certain views of my own.  I hope that, in doing that, they will not attempt to compromise <Col N="816" /> the situation by saying that they will join any organisation, international or otherwise, if and when the independence of a 32-county Republic is established.  I hope that, instead, they will declare that this country will be neutral, in accordance with the wishes of 90 odd per cent. of the people, in any conflict between great Powers and that they will examine under the United Nations Charter what are now the particular problems affecting a country which, first of all wishes to be neutral and, secondly, declares itself to be neutral.</P>
    <P>Finally I can only hope that if a third conflict should develop between the great Powers of this world, a conflict which will, of course, be a materialistic conflict as all such other ones were, despite what the contestants might like us to believe, this country will have a man of the calibre of the Taoiseach.  They cannot hope to have a man as good as the Taoiseach, that is, in the hope that the conflict is a long time away.  I trust they will have a man of his calibre to look after them in the hope that we can preserve our neutrality and thereby preserve some small remnant of the true Christianity which the Irish people were the first to introduce to many parts of Europe and which Europe is trying to preserve now.  If we had that we might be able to contribute again to the revival of the world as we uniquely did for several hundred years in our infancy as a people and thereby preserve the heritage that we hope to cherish and try to keep it free from the materialism which dominates all the great Powers of the world and always dominates them when they come to fight each other.</P>

      <P>Nobody will say of him that he is an innocent abroad.  Nobody will say of him that he is lacking in guile or worldly wisdom.  I think he recognised in his maturity what Deputy Flanagan, in the romanticism of his admirable, youthful, self-confidence, has failed to perceive, that in the modern world the fate of a small nation very largely depends on the quality of its neighbours.  &ldquo;The old dog for the hard road.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach knew that. When he came to weigh up the experience of this country between 1939 and 1945, he conceded to Dáil Éireann that the neutrality of Ireland survived because she had good neighbours, good in the sense that, whatever their inmost heart may have thought, their outward actions were to respect the territorial integrity of a small nation when it would have suited them to infringe it.  When they could have saved lives and money and ships and great peril to themselves by infringing it, it was the Taoiseach of this country who had it to tell that neutrality survived because of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Winston Spencer Churchill.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Flanagan and I always listen to him because, he will excuse me for saying so, I regard him, being a neighbour, as a decent man who comes of decent people.  Although we do not agree about a great many things, it always fills me with some concern if I discern in him a radical difference on fundamental principles. I want to ask him this question.  Does he truly feel neutral between the Moscow of Stalin, Malenkov and the Cominform on the one hand and the Washington of Roosevelt, Truman and Eisenhower?  Does he truly feel that between these two great Powers there is no fundamental difference at all?</P>

      <P>Does he feel that as between the stand taken by these two great Powers there is no degree of difference from the stand that Ireland takes in fundamental matters, in respect of freedom, in respect of individual liberty, in respect of religious freedom, in respect of class war, in respect of the denial of the existence <Col N="818" /> of God?  Does Deputy Flanagan think there is no difference between these two great Powers and what they stand for?  I understood him to say that between such Powers he felt there was nothing to choose.  Perhaps I stirred his conscience now.</P>

      <P>Perhaps, as Tolstoy said: &ldquo;There burns in the heart of every man a spark, and the spark sometimes wearies of burning, but comes some great event that fans that spark to flame and illuminates great deeds.&rdquo;  I assign to myself the task of fanning that spark to flame in the heart of Deputy Flanagan.  I do not think he means what he said or what he makes himself appear to say.  I do not believe, if it comes to a showdown, that Deputy Flanagan does believe there is no difference between Washington and Moscow.  What I think Deputy Flanagan is trying to say is what all the world is trying to say: They do not want war; they do not want to see their neighbours' children sent out to die; all they want is peace and the resources of humanity used to make the world a place in which men can save their souls more easily than happens to be the case to-day.  The best way to arrive at that end is not through war.  I think Deputy Flanagan is aware of the fact that free men everywhere, black, white and yellow, are feeling and saying what he feels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the difference, and it is because I believe that Deputy Flanagan is perhaps allowing himself to be misled that I take this opportunity of addressing much of what I am saying now to the remarks that he made.  If I thought he was talking with his tongue in his cheek I have a rough side to my tongue which I would not hesitate to use But I do not think he is talking with his tongue in his cheek, and in so far as he spoke his view sincerely, I value his contribution to this debate more highly than I would that of a more experienced politician.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> I do not think they are building up armaments to fight a war.  I know the American people fairly well.  I lived amongst them.  I worked amongst them.  Any Deputy who knows them and who has lived with them knows that if there is one thing dear to the heart of the simple American people it is to be released from entanglement in Europe.  There is one aspiration common to every American heart, and that is to get sent home from foreign parts.</P>
    <P>Since the American Republic was founded its history is built upon the emergence of men who have crystallised in their declarations the pattern of law-making for the American people designed to cut away from Europe and to be delivered of the responsibility of entanglement either in the political obligations of Europe or of Asia.  I think, and I sincerely believe, that their presence in Europe and Asia to-day is an instance of their passionate quest for peace.  I do not think that the subversion of the Governments of Roumania, of Hungary, of Latvia, of Lithuania, of Estonia, of Poland or of Czecho-Slovakia, was undertaken by the Cominform in the cause of peace.  I do not think that the slaughter of the Governments of these countries when they crossed the path of the powers of the Cominform was undertaken in the cause of peace. There are graves all over Europe which are the monuments of the kind of peace that the Cominform seeks, the kind of peace that follows when the world is made a desert and there is no voice left in it to disturb the silence of that tyranny that has supplanted the tumult of free men.</P>
    <P>We could have peace here in this House if we accepted the peace of Prague and of Budapest, but I give Deputy Flanagan credit for believing that, deeply as he differs from me on many matters, he would not wish the peace in this House so profound that my voice might be heard no longer. Let me carry that a little further. Senator Wayne Morse has just sat down in the Senate of the United States of America having filibustered for 22 hours and ten minutes non-stop. <Col N="820" /> Can you imagine Anna Pauker being allowed to filibuster for 22 hours and ten minutes by the Supreme Soviet of Moscow, if she ever got that far? She would go the road of Slanski and Ryck and all the other dastards that sold their people into slavery and got their reward at the end of a rope.</P>
    <P>Come! Does Deputy Flanagan in his heart really find a similarity between the Congress of the United States of America, where Senator Wayne Morse can still filibuster, and the dignified peace of the Supreme Soviet in session in Moscow?  I do not think he does.  Whether he does or not, I am not neutral, and if this nation, as between Washington and Moscow, is neutral, then it is damned. But it is not neutral.  Our people have served the cause of liberty too long and in too great tribulation to declare themselves neutral to-day when that precious asset of mankind is imperilled all the world over.</P>
    <P>Let Deputies not forget that even when Mr. Malenkov makes pleasant noises in the Kremlin, like their colleague, Adolph Hitler, the Communists have written it all down.  Hitler wrote <i>Mein Kampf</i> and all the world would not believe that he meant to do all that he had written there.  They found out too late that he did mean it and the German people saw him and their nation perish in the holocaust in Berlin.  Lenin and his disciples, Stalin and all the rest of them, have written down what they mean to do and their purpose is to put an end to the segregation of mankind in nations and to substitute therefor its segregation in classes as an introduction to the class war which is to end in the dictatorship of the proletariat founded on the proposition first uttered by the fool who said in his heart: &ldquo;There is no God.&rdquo; They have made no disguise of that. They have proclaimed it again and again.  In their tactics they advance and they retreat but their objective is always the same, to establish all the world over the servitude of man founded on the proposition that there is no God.  If Deputy Flanagan applies his mind to the dialectic that inevitably flows from the proposition that there is no God I think he will agree with me <Col N="821" /> that its inescapable end is the slavery of men and the triumph of that power of which he recalls Lord Acton's having said: &ldquo;Corruption tends to corrupt and absolute power ultimately corrupts absolutely.&rdquo;  It is against that, that the things we believe in stand.  It is between those two concepts that there can never be an armistice and, while Stalin's might is between them, there can never be enduring peace.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that Ireland, as between these two positions, is neutral. I know that Deputy Flanagan is right when he says that 99 per cent. of our people want to avoid war but I think he understated the case.  I think he could honestly have said that 98 per cent. of all the people in the world want to avoid war.  I think he would very nearly be justified if he added that the other 2 per cent. should be locked up in mental hospitals.  Everyone recoils with horror at the prospect of war.  There is only one thing worse than perishing in war and that would be to survive in slavery.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to turn to certain matters which arise directly on the Minister's introductory statement.  Is it not a queer thing, now that we are a sovereign Republic, that our Minister for External Affairs should twice introduce his Estimate in this House without making any reference whatsoever to the foreign policy of Ireland?  I think Deputy MacBride said well that the objectives of all sides of this House in foreign policy are probably very similar.  We are not asking the Minister to deal primarily with objectives. <Col N="822" /> Having stated them, we are asking him to tell us the policy of the Government in order to arrive at these objectives. Of that, we never heard a word from the Minister since he accepted responsibility for the portfolio which he holds.  Is it not odd that in this Legislature of the Irish Republic we should make no reference, on this occasion of our foreign affairs debate, to the statement recently made by President Eisenhower on the policy of the American Government if they could achieve that stable peace which would permit of a reduction in their burden of armaments?  Do we endorse the purposes which he sets before free nations, when they procure enduring peace, of devoting their resources to rolling back the frontiers of poverty all the world over?  Do we endorse his dedication of the American nation to a crusade against suffering and want in every nation without regard to clime or creed?  Does that declaration of policy evoke from the Republic of Ireland any reaction more than a disinterested shrug and sceptical smile?  I want to say that I believe he meant it.  I believe it would come well from the Irish Minister for External Affairs to say that he believes that President Eisenhower meant it and that, so far as he meant it, he spoke well and that, in so far as he persuades the American people to devote their resources to the objectives set out in that declaration of policy, he will deserve well not only of his own country but of all free nations everywhere.</P>
    <P>If we are to keep freedom we should not be ashamed of those who are prepared to be its champion.  We should not be afraid to salute those who are prepared to give freedom a meaning and a purpose.  We should rejoice that the head of the greatest nation of the world to-day dedicates his life and resources to the relief of the poor and the destitute and the oppressed wherever they may be.  When we come to ask ourselves if these are empty words spoken for effect, Ireland has a right to be the first to say that, coming from the source they do&mdash; Washington, the centre of the American nation&mdash;we are in a position to certify that they are not fraud and that they are not make-believe.  They <Col N="823" /> are the undertakings of a great nation which will surely be fulfilled, given the opportunity by the restoration of peace.  Happily&mdash;I say it advisedly and not for the first time because I was proud to be able to say it in Washington at the meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organisation&mdash;this country does not stand in that kind of need. This country has no wealth to boast of but it can hoe its row and when it comes to the distribution of the necessary benevolence we are in a position to say that there are others who want it more than we do.  I think we might add&mdash;though what we can contribute to the common cause may, in very truth, be the widow's mite&mdash; that such as it is, we would be proud to give it in such a common cause of helping poverty no matter who the sufferer was whenever we found an opportunity of relieving distress and that we would be proud to be in such a crusade that the American nation started.  Would it be unbecoming for the Minister for External Affairs to say that much?  Would it offend Deputy Flanagan's sense of neutrality if he heard the Minister whom he follows state in public that he believes that much in America?  I hope it would not. I do not think it would.</P>
    <P>I think it is relevant and true to say that a united Ireland could do much to promote effective collaboration between the free nations of the world. I see in the world to-day an agglomeration of slave States in unwilling adhesion to the power of the Cominform. I want to see established in the world over against that Power a citadel of freedom secure against aggression by the power and resources it disposes of, where free nations can gather around one another, not for the promotion of war, but for the maintenance of peace, by the creation of a community of nations strong enough in resources, in power and in will to make it manifest to all comers that no combination can ever hope to prevail against it.  I say deliberately that the nexus of such a combine can and can only be an Anglo-American Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to see this country <Col N="824" /> fulfilling its destiny by calling such a commonwealth into existence as a free citadel for free nations all the world over, to gather around in the name of peace and independence for nations great and small.  A united Ireland could make a great contribution to the development of understanding and collaboration between the United States of America and the British Commonwealth nations, in both of which our people are ubiquitous and well and favourably known.  I dare claim this, that, as Rome grew great by the acquisition of her empire, she diminished as a civil power as that empire slipped away.  England grew great as she acquired an empire and has diminished as that empire has slipped away.</P>
    <P>Why did they lose their empire? They lost it because they acquired it with fire and sword, and those from whom they had taken territories could never rest until their grip was loosened and destroyed.  I claim that Ireland has, in her time, acquired a spiritual empire greater and wider than the Roman or the British Empire ever was, and with this remarkable distinction: that in no part of that vast spiritual possession has there ever been manifest the slightest desire on the part of any nation in it to loosen the hold or to reject the imperial claim of Ireland.  For it is not a claim founded on force.  It is not a claim born of conquest.  It is not a claim in the ordinary imperial sense.  It is the fact that our people built these nations up with the neighbours whom they found there, that our people helped to make America America, helped to make Canada Canada, helped to make Australia Australia and New Zealand New Zealand.  It is due to our people largely that the name of God is known west of Buffalo and down through Oceania.</P>
    <P>Has not that empire at the head of which we stand a role to play and a destiny to fulfil?  What stands in the way of our being equal to that destiny? What prevents us keeping our rendezvous with fate?  &mdash;the fact that Ireland does not walk abroad as a united Ireland constituted of all its peoples, orange and green.  I do not know what <Col N="825" /> Deputy Flanagan meant when he referred to D'Arcy McGee and my grandfather. They did not have many dinner invitations in their day.  They were too often refugees, but they had one thing in common which Deputy Flanagan might remember as a symbol of the purpose he and I wish to serve 100 years after their time.  They brought the Flag, which is the national Flag of this Republic, home to Ireland 100 years ago.  They told our people when they unfurled it at Ballingarry that it was not only a battle standard but a symbol, orange and green with peace between them, and that only on that basis could Ireland be truly great and free.</P>
    <P>I would like to say to Great Britain to-day, to Sir Winston Spencer Churchill, now Knight of the Garter, once a good friend of this country, once unafraid to go to Belfast and assert in the centre of Orangeism there that it was unthinkable that six counties of Ulster could stand in the way of the Irish nation's aspirations to be free&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He was in office.  I would remind him of those words, and I would remind him of something else &mdash;that the majority of the Irish people have one quality in common with him, magnanimity.  They could readily forget their wrongs once they were undone.  Would that Great Britain, in this hour of difficulty, might find in Ireland a not insignificant friend if even now she came to understand that men are gathered into nations by powers greater than a British Statute, that there is virtue in accepting a necessity and that the reward of virtue is sometimes very great.  Our people have a reputation for being equal to their destiny and I believe that at this time our people, orange and green, can bring not only to Great Britain but to the world a treasure as fundamental as any treasure Deputy <Col N="826" /> Flanagan is seeking&mdash;the key to peace, a means to build a citadel of freedom for those who love peace that those who hate it would abandon any hope of ever tearing down.</P>
      <P>We surely all welcome the new American Ambassador, Mr. Taft, who came here first as a member of the E.C.A. administration.  I should like the Minister for External Affairs to send a message to the first chief of that administration, Mr. Carrigan, and tell him of the Government's decision to implement this scheme their predecessors devised for the employment of the Grant Counterpart Fund in an institute of agriculture and veterinary science, because he played no small part in bringing these plans as far as they had gone.  Ireland had no better friend than Mr. Carrigan.  It had no more tactful and no more perfect gentleman for a friend than Mr. Carrigan who was the first administrator of the E.C.A. in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to the most distasteful matter to which I must refer.  I think it odd that part of the reception which our Government has devised for the American Ambassador is the despatch to Strasbourg as one of three members of this Oireachtas a Deputy who hates America, one member of this Oireachtas who can be trusted to throw the dirt at America abroad that he has disgraced himself by throwing at home.  He is going to be sent there to represent this Parliament, not by a Government who does not know him, for I invite Deputies or others interested to turn to the file of the <i>Irish Press</i> from January to March of 1948 and they will there read a flood of filth poured forth upon Deputy Cowan by a member of that Government, the Minister for Finance, which is without precedent in the history of this country.  He is described the &ldquo;Red Pope,&rdquo; the &ldquo;crawling Communist,&rdquo; as &ldquo;an unscrupulous menace,&rdquo; as a man &ldquo;who spouts out dirt and filth,&rdquo; as &ldquo;an unscrupulous falsifier,&rdquo; a &ldquo;disgrace to this nation,&rdquo; as &ldquo;somebody whom the Irish people would be ashamed of if they did not know him to be a sort of abortion.&rdquo;  At the time, the man about whom all these things were said was guilty of no graver offence than of offering himself as a <Col N="827" /> candidate for election in a city constituency. It was a source of astonishment to everyone that any candidate could be subjected by a Minister of State to such an attack.</P>
    <P>He poured forth the vials of his wrath upon poor Deputy Cowan's head day after day in the columns of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Day after day we had two or three letters giving a list of Deputy Cowan's iniquities and they were all directed to this end: to prove that he was an agent for the Cominform in this country.  They were all directed to warm our people: &ldquo;Do not trust this man, even if you think he has turned over a new leaf; remember, once a Communist always a Communist: give him a chance and he will betray you into the hands of the Cominform at the first opportunity.&rdquo; These were Deputy MacEntee's words. They were repeated and repeated continually and the people were asked to remember that they had got this warning.  He said to our people: &ldquo;Here is the record going back to 1939.  Do not believe him if he claims to have turned over a new leaf.&rdquo;  He warned the electorate that you could not trust him whatever his protestations were, that he was the &ldquo;Red Pope&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be long sorry to allege that any Deputy in this House should be responsible for what Deputy MacEntee says but in this case he is a colleague of the Minister for External Affairs and there is joint responsibility in that Government. Nobody becomes more hysterical at the suggestion that there is not joint responsibility than the Minister for Finance.  You remember when he came in here with his Budget he told us that they were not like other Ministers, that they had joint responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now here is another burden of their joint responsibility.  Deputy Cowan is going to Strasbourg as the nominee of <Col N="828" /> Deputy MacEntee, Minister for Finance, just as he is going as the nominee of the Minister for External Affairs. He is being sent there to insult the American people.  I prophesy that there will be one voice at Strasbourg heard to affront the American people and it will be a source of humiliation for every decent person in Ireland that, before the world, that voice will appear to come from the Irish delegation.  We know it does not very much matter what Deputy Cowan says.  It does not very much matter if he rose to address the Strasbourg Assembly standing on his head so far as we are concerned. He represents nobody.  He received his membership of this House in the last election with the slogan: &ldquo;Follow Cowan up a stick&rdquo; or something like that and there were highly intellectual crowds of supporters who posted off to the polls to the strain of that flattering refrain.  We know that when he goes to Strasbourg it is not the little man who followed the monkey up the stick into Dáil Éireann&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What they will hear is, not someone up the pole affronting America; they will hear someone, however incongruously, invested with the character of an Irish representative assassinating Ireland's friends.  And, by what right is he sent there?  Whom does he represent?  What group of Deputies in this House sponsored him? Who will stand over that?  Who sends him there to do that?  Is there no reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is he being sent?  Is it to throw the dirt that the Minister himself would like to throw but is afraid?  I can remember when the Minister was the familiar of the Nazi Embassy in this country.  I remember when the Minister's friends used to pass through <Col N="829" /> the corridors of this House inquiring if you would like an invitation to dine with the Nazi Minister in Dublin.  I can remember the time when Deputy Aiken, the present Minister, was the pot-boy of the Nazi Minister in Dublin. I can remember the time when we knew that he loved Nazism and hoped to see it win, because he felt that was the way to govern&mdash;power that tends to corrupt and the absolute power of which Deputy Flanagan is so much afraid, rightly afraid in that it corrupts absolutely.  But, there was one in this House who aspired to it.  There was one in this House who saw himself case for the róle of the Gauleiter, if that power should ever come to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Most prudent men see two sides of the medal in the world, on one side of which was stamped the face of Hitler and on the other side the face of Stalin.  There is no fundamental difference between the philosophy that inspired Berlin and the philosophy that inspires Moscow.  It does not make much difference whether you are a Gauleiter or a Commissar, your purpose is the power that corrupts and ultimately the absolute power that corrupts absolutely.  Those who aspire to those things hate freedom and hate the nations that stand for freedom, and when they are afraid to throw dirt at them themselves they find others to throw the dirt which they supply.</P>
    <P>Give me another explanation for the despatch of Deputy Cowan to Strasbourg to represent Dáil Éireann, to represent Oireachtas Éireann.</P>
    <P>There are only three people in the Dáil and Seanad of Ireland who would affront America and defame it.  Two are in the Seanad and one is here.  We are planning to tell the world at Strasbourg that our choice has fallen on the one in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>My voice will not reach Strasbourg, and, probably, nothing we say here to-day will find record in their books, but, in so far as my voice carries, I would like the world to know that this time there is going from Dáil Éireann to Strasbourg a delegation which contains at least one man who does not represent Dáil Éireann or anybody <Col N="830" /> else, and if he avails of that occasion to strike a felon's blow at our friend, the United States of America, in the forum of Strasbourg, he is as much a traitor to us as he is to the United States of America.</P>
    <P>It is in my judgment a matter of great consequence that those of us who have the chance now to say that, should say it in time.  I hope, that amongst our delegation, if the felon's blow is struck, there will be voices heard from Ireland to repudiate the hand down whose sleeve the dagger comes stealing.</P>
    <P>This country has no reason to hang its head in the councils of the nations of the world.  We have never claimed to be great.  We have never claimed to be powerful.  We have never claimed to be rich.  But, we have claimed that we were faithful to high principles and that we were prepared to make great sacrifice for the defence of them.  There is no finger in the world that can point at us to say that we have been untrue to that claim and in any company of nations where Ireland's representatives happen to be that claim puts them in a proud position.  The question we have got to ask ourselves now and to answer is this: having demanded and secured the status and the rights of independence, are we prepared to discharge its obligations?</P>
    <P>Switzerland is an oft-quoted example. I remember in <i>The Third Man</i> by Grahame Green someone saying in the Tiergarten in Vienna: &ldquo;War, pillage and ravine ravaged Europe for three centuries and begot the Renaissance of Velasquez, Beethoven and the rest. Peace, law and the constitution reigned supreme in Switzerland for five centuries and begot the cuckoo clock&rdquo;. Ireland's is a stormy and tempestuous history of great effort, of sacrifice recklessly but resolutely made.  I think her genius appertains more to the glories of the Renaissance than to the utilitarian respectability of the cuckoo clock.  I can understand those yearning for security typified by that domestic utensil, but I hope and pray that the bulk of our people will keep their eyes on a wider horizon, will believe in a higher destiny for Ireland, and will join with me in hoping that, with the resources we dispose of, it may yet be <Col N="831" /> our mission as a united Ireland to make a material contribution to the construction of the citadel of peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right, as has been said, that we have achieved the rights and the status of independence. Of course, that status confers certain benefits and certain obligations, not only on the country, but on the people of the country and on the representatives of the people.  While I am not to be taken as agreeing with everything that Deputy Dillon has just said, he has the right to say those things. That is the freedom that we fought for in this country, the right of Deputy Dillon and any other Deputy to make the type of speech, of Christian speech, that Deputy Dillon has just made.  As I say, the rights of independence conferred benefits and obligations.  I sincerely hope that, in the few remarks I have to make on this Estimate, I will be guided by the obligations conferred on a free man.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been criticised for not setting out in his speech introducing this Estimate what our foreign policy is.  He has been criticised for not stating what our foreign policy was last year.  It is perfectly clear to the House and to the people what our foreign policy is.  That policy has been very clearly laid down by the people, and is being followed by the Government and by the Minister.  There is no necessity, as far as I can see, for any declaration by the Minister or by the Government in regard to that foreign policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last few years there has been considerable talk about war.  In speaking on the Estimate for this Department on a number of occasions, I advanced the view that war was not inevitable, and the general feeling at the moment seems to be that the danger of war is not so great as it was. That has been welcomed not only in this country, but in many countries throughout the world.  As far as the ordinary people are concerned, I think that more than 90 per cent., perhaps almost 100 per cent., of the people do not want war, because war is a cruel thing.  A modern war, with its atomic <Col N="832" /> and worse weapons, is a menace to humanity.</P>
    <P>We must realise, however, that if the war machine which has been geared up in Britain and in America were to be stopped to-morrow, millions of people would be thrown out of employment. One of the great dangers that I see is that the war machine may be kept geared up to avoid grave unemployment and to avoid revolution within these countries.  The danger of maintaining the war machine geared up is that some person or persons may be tempted to put that war machine into actual operation.  That is the danger that I see in the present situation.  I have heard it declared here, time after time, that war was necessary to destroy Communism.  I studied that, and I find that the first World War&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the first World War resulted in a Communist Russia.  The second World War resulted in a Communist half of the world.  It is anybody's guess what a third World War would result in.  I have expressed the view here on many occasions that the Russian nation or the Russian people were not anxious for war.  I have expressed that as a view I believe in, having made some study of international affairs.  When I see a great nation like China becoming Communist without Russia engaging in a world war, I am inclined to the view held by many responsible people throughout the world that Communism will make very substantial advances on the Continent of Asia without either engaging or wanting to engage in a world war.  That is the situation as it stands.  Neither Deputy Aiken, as Minister for External Affairs, nor the Government of which he is a member, can say or do anything which will alter that situation. If that situation results in war, we cannot stop that war.  If it results in peace, we will welcome that peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it results in war, what will be the policy of this nation?  If I understand the voice of the people, and I think I do, the policy of this nation will be the <Col N="833" /> policy of neutrality, the policy of steering clear from entanglements and of doing everything in our power to avoid being involved in a war which would do tremendous damage and would, in fact, endanger the existence of the Irish nation.  When anyone says that we should join with one side or the other, that individual is not voicing the feelings of the Irish people, for we have no desire to be involved in any war irrespective of the reasons that may be given for it.</P>

      <P>We remember the first World War which was fought for the independence of Belgium.  Many hundreds of thousands of our young men adopted that slogan and joined the British forces.  Many thousands of them found their graves on the continents of Europe and Asia.  The independence of Belgium was the excuse. The reality behind the war was a very different thing.  Fortunately for us we had at that time great leaders, voices in the wilderness as it were, until by a bloody sacrifice in Easter Week they were able to get the people to see things in their proper light.  As a result of that this nation steered clear of any further entanglement in war in so far as it could.  The experience gained at that time made it easy for the Government to declare, though perhaps not so easy to maintain, with the full support of the majority of our people a policy of neutrality in the second World War.  We were told that that second World War was to combat Nazism and Fascism.</P>
      <P>What do we find to-day?  A few short years after the cessation of hostilities we find the Fascists rising to power again and being elevated to power by the very people who went to war to destroy them.  Western Germany is being elevated to-day to a great power again by the very people who set out to destroy her.</P>

      <P>Those who intend to bring Western Germany back to the fold of nations are the very people who <Col N="834" /> sought to destroy her.  Those who would bring Germany back are the Nazi leaders, the followers of Hitler, Goering and all the rest of them who were executed by order of a British-American court martial held at the end of the war contrary to all concepts I have ever held as to the responsibilities of a victorious army.</P>
      <P>I do not want to talk about the brutality of that.  For what were these two wars fought?  Who has gained anything out of them?  If we had had the good fortune to have had our own Government in 1914 we would not have been involved in the first World War and thousands of our young people would not have found their graves in Flanders and in Asia.  When we had our freedom and liberty and the right to choose our policy in 1939 we decided to maintain neutrality and nothing that has happened since has shown that we were wrong in adopting that course. In fact, everything that has happened since goes to show that in a third World War we must at all costs keep out.</P>
      <P>I think people are inclined to be led away by words, by talk about Irish citizens, Deputies of Dáil Éireann or members of the Oireachtas being traitors to the United States.  I have no obligation to the United States.  I have no obligation to any country except Ireland, and I hope I will do my duty to Ireland, no matter what may be said.  There are many of our countrymen living in the United States.  There are many good characteristics in the American nation, but there are things in the American nation that I do not stand for.  There are policies carried out by the United States that I do not agree with.  Am I to be muzzled?  Am I to say that I agree with them when I do not agree? I do not agree with the way the United States treats its Christian citizens who happen to be coloured black.</P>

      <P>I am saying that the suggestion has been made here that we ought to ally ourselves with the great American nation, that, like Britain, we should become subservient to the great American nation.  I speak against any such policy of alliance or subservience.  Our duty here is to maintain a policy of neutrality, to preserve and maintain that policy in every way we can, and not to have, as has been suggested lip-service to neutrality while we ally ourselves with one of the great Powers that may be involved as a principal in the next war.  As I see it, our foreign policy is a very simple one.  It is a policy that has been adopted by the Irish people.  So long as this Government or any other Government in this country can keep us free from war, can keep us outside of war, that Government will be carrying out the policy of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other matter has been mentioned in this debate and that is Partition. It is one of our most difficult problems. It has always been difficult but it has been made more difficult in the last couple of years.  I myself had the idea &mdash;having satisfied myself that it could <Col N="836" /> be done&mdash;that there should be an end to all this talk about Partition and that the unity of this country should be brought about by a policy of force.  I had satisfied myself that it could be done.  I had satisfied myself that the people of this part of the country could do it, if they were so determined, within the short period of 24 hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had to correct certain impressions.  I had to change certain views.  Would it be right to force the people of the North to come into this part of the country if they were not to be given the freedom that they had the right to expect and which I believed and always believed they should have?  The unfortunate crisis that developed here in connection with the mother and child scheme made me alter the views I had held up to then.  A great number of the people who live in the North are not Catholics. Are they to be told that they cannot do anything within this State unless it is approved of by the Bishops of a religion to which they do not belong?  I feel that we have to do a great deal in this part of the country before we can hope to see the end of Partition.  Certainly we have got to do a great deal before any person in this part of the country would be justified in using even the minimum of force to bring those people who are not Catholics and who live in the Six Counties into the Irish united State. The sort of talk we have had in this House in the last couple of weeks is not a happy augury for the ending of Partition.  We have had a display in this House in the last couple of weeks when there was bandied about a described document which I, as a representative of the people, have never seen but which, apparently, was issued to the Press and withdrawn by the Bishops who issued it.  If we are going to have that sort of conduct in this House how can we justify the use of any force against anybody in the Six Counties to bring them in here?</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin has done grave injury to this country by his conduct in this House during the last couple of years and particularly in the last couple of weeks.</P>

He has set himself up here as the moral teacher of the Irish Parliament&mdash;a position to which he has no right.  When he was speaking here one day last week I interrupted and I used the following words: &ldquo;Sadlier and Keogh.&rdquo;  I used those words because the conduct of Deputy MacEoin was the conduct and the policy of Sadlier and Keogh in their time, 100 years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have many authorities for it but I will quote from one.  Those men, Sadlier and Keogh, by their conduct at that time&mdash;and I quote the authority of Canon D'Alton, <Col N="838" /> an uncle of the present Cardinal D'Alton, who wrote an excellent Irish history which many Deputies in this House should read&mdash;were known publicly and historically as &ldquo;The Pope's Brass Band&rdquo;.  I made that historical description of them to General MacEoin in this House, that he was again adopting that same policy.  I perhaps should not have been surprised by some ignorance in regard to that outside the House but I was astonished at the ignorance displayed by some Deputies, and particularly by Deputy Desmond, here this evening, who, apparently, has not read his history of 100 years ago, because this only happened in 1852, and in 1853 those two gentlemen, Sadlier and Keogh, betrayed the Irish people and accepted office in the English Government, one of them as a minor lord of the Treasury&mdash;he ended up with his brains blown out on Blackheath Common in London&mdash;and the other for his betrayal was made Solicitor-General and in time elevated to be a judge who not only condemned but used every language of insult against the Fenians who came before him for trial.</P>
      <P>We do not want a repetition of the Sadlier and Keogh antics.  We do not want Deputy General MacEoin adopting the role of being the leading Catholic in this country or in this House and that anyone who opposes him on any ground is a poor member of the Catholic Church.  We want no more Sadliers and Keoghs.  We want no more Irish politicians termed as Canon D'Alton called them, and as they have been called in Irish history, &ldquo;The Pope's Brass Band&rdquo;, and I hope when Deputies in this House want to make any reference to the Pope's Brass Band that they will refer to it from history and not from ignorance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grave damage has been done to the cause of Irish unity in the last couple of years.  It will take a very determined effort on our part down here to show our fellow countrymen in the North that they have nothing to fear if they unite with us, that they will have all the rights of citizens in this State if they join up with us and that the policy that has been adopted by <Col N="839" /> General MacEoin and by the Fine Gael Party is not the policy of the Irish people and does not represent the Irish people.  We must do that in this House and the people outside must do it.  There is one thing I am opposed to and there is one thing every decent Irishman is opposed to and that is sectarianism.  Those of us who went through the old Sinn Féin movement, who imbibed the teaching of Griffith, who imbibed the teaching of Tone and of Emmet, of Parnell and the other leaders of the Irish people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is right. I was quite interested to hear the remarks of the last speaker with regard to Partition, but if he protested that Deputy General Seán MacEoin did damage to the cause of unity in this country, he, in his remarks, has done much more damage.  Deputy Cowan has got this question altogether wrong when he tries to place against it the issues which were raised in regard to the health scheme.  Again, I do not want to go into the moral issues of the health scheme or the justification for a united Ireland, but I would merely say this to Deputy Cowan.  He often represents that the Hierarchy dictates to the people of this country.  It is not so much a question of dictation by the Hierarchy on any such question as the Health Bill as a question of acceptance of the Hierarchy's opinion by the people.  I think it would answer Deputy <Col N="840" /> Cowan's arguments to some extent to say that as far as I am concerned I am an Irishman second; I am a Catholic first.  Whether that sums up my position to Deputy Cowan or not, I do not know, but that is how I view the controversy Deputy Cowan suggests is going on between the Hierarchy and the members of this House in regard to the health scheme.  If the Hierarchy gives me any direction with regard to Catholic social teaching or Catholic moral teaching, I accept without qualification in all respects the teaching of the Hierarchy and the Church to which I belong.</P>
      <P>It is not unusual for the Government of any country to accept, or to put it at its minimum, to have regard for the teaching of the Hierarchy and the Church of which the majority of the people are members.  Deputy Cowan is very fond of criticising the people of this country for their acceptance of the viewpoint of the Hierarchy.  We never hear criticism of the acceptance by the British Government of a viewpoint or an opinion expressed by the Hierarchy &mdash;or however they describe themselves &mdash;of the majority religion in Britain. We know they have been advised. Deputy Cowan would prefer to call that dictation.  The British Government have been advised on health matters, on divorce laws, and have accepted the advice or, as Deputy Cowan likes to call it, the dictation of that particular majority Church in Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of misrepresenting Deputy Cowan.  That is merely my interpretation of what he said.  It is on that I base the remarks I make now.  I said I did not propose to follow Deputy Cowan or Deputy Dillon in their journeys throughout the world.  I had great sympathy with and great appreciation of the remarks made by Deputy Flanagan in regard to our position in world affairs and as to our <Col N="841" /> attitude towards Russia and the United States of America.  He spoke at some length on neutrality and I think he asked that there should be a clear definition with regard to our position in the event of another war and for a clear statement as to our attitude towards the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary for the present Minister to reiterate the attitude of this country on the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.  He and his predecessor have done so several times inside and outside this country. Our whole objection to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, in a few simple words, is that we believe that the members of that organisation do not subscribe to the principles enunciated in that particular treaty.  The Irish Ambassador in America has been taken to task by a member or two of my Party in regard to his speech reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 30th March.  I would say that the speech, or that portion of it reported in the <i>Irish Press</i>, is open to misrepresentation, and, as a follow-up, I would say that I do not believe that what could be taken out of it was intended to be conveyed by Mr. Hearne, our present Ambassador in America, because from what I know of him and of the officials of the Embassy from whatever little contact I had with them, I would say that they are absolutely dead in line with the present Minister and the previous Minister so far as the neutrality or the participation of the country in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is concerned.  I think the attitude that has been outlined by the present Minister is roughly that we shall not even consider joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation so long as the principles enunciated in the treaty are not applied to Ireland. That treaty guarantees, everyone understands, the right to national self-determination of the member nations. That is not guaranteed to Ireland, and there has been no indication that either America, Great Britain or any of the other nations have the slightest intention of applying that particular principle to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation <Col N="842" /> also purports to guarantee to member nations territorial integrity. That is not guaranteed to this country nor is there any indication that it will be guaranteed.  Therefore we could not participate in a treaty that is in itself a fraud and a lie.  If we join that organisation by subscribing to another of its principles it would provoke a civil war in this country because one of the terms of the treaty is that we might be called upon to join in the military alliance with other member nations or with a member nation.  It might well happen that the people of this country would by that article find themselves joined in a military alliance with Great Britain, a Power which is occupying the six north eastern counties of this country at present.</P>
    <P>So far as the foreign policy of this country is concerned, I would say that the only statement there can be in that respect is simply the statement that so long as we can, no matter what the conditions are, we will remain neutral. By reason of the fact that we are a small nation, that we have not large resources, particularly in armaments, we cannot pursue a foreign policy in the same way as the United States with all their might can pursue a foreign policy in one direction or the other.  Similarly Britain with her Empire and colonial possessions can pursue a foreign policy in one way or the other.  The same remarks apply to Soviet Russia.  What can we do, but again express the unanimous desire of the Irish people to remain neutral and to maintain a small army, the army our resources will allow, to make some effort to preserve neutrality?</P>
    <P>Deputy S. Flanagan threw many bouquets at the present Taoiseach for his stand on neutrality during the 1939-45 period.  It was amusing to hear him attribute to the Taoiseach sole responsibility for maintaining peace and neutrality in this country during the last war.  Does that necessarily mean that if the Taoiseach had decided that this country would not be neutral in the last war, that is the attitude the people of this country would have generally adopted?  If any Taoiseach had proclaimed that we would take one <Col N="843" /> side or the other in the last war, that in itself would have caused civil war.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said there were two people to whom we owed our neutrality in that war&mdash;Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston S. Churchill.  May I say that if it suited Franklin Delano Roosevelt to invade this country, or any part of it, he would have done so and he would have justified it to his colleagues and allies.  If Winston S. Churchill wanted to do the same thing, and to violate our neutrality in part or in whole, he would have done it and he would have made no apologies to the Government of this country.  The only reason that we were able to maintain our neutrality in the last war was that circumstances enabled us to do so.  At least, we were never given any guarantee by either Churchill or Roosevelt that our neutrality would not be violated.  It did not suit their purpose to violate our neutrality and that is the reason why we were able to preserve neutrality in the last war.  All we can say is that it was the unanimous desire of the Irish people to remain neutral and it was an act of God that we did.</P>
    <P>In the debate on this Vote for last year, whilst I was reported correctly, needless to say, in the Report of the Dáil Debates, I must say that I was misinterpreted to no small extent by one newspaper in this country and by several Irish-American societies in the United States.  In the few remarks I made in the debate on the Vote last year, I said very clearly that I thought that the only hope for ending Partition in this country lay in the friends and the support we had in the United States.  I said that, as far as Britain was concerned, I did not see much hope, but that, in the friends we had in America, there was great hope.  I advised that the Minister should make an attempt to co-ordinate the efforts of these societies so that, in turn, they might bring pressure to bear upon the public representatives in the United States of America to help undo the wrong of Partition.  I did mention, incidentally, that it was alleged to me not as a statement of fact&mdash;I did not <Col N="844" /> give it even as my opinion&mdash;that some of these societies in the United States of America were more interested in furthering their personal interests than the cause of Irish unity.  I want to say now that I thoroughly disbelieve the allegation that was made to me on a particular occasion.  The only reason I mentioned it at all was that if there was any difference of opinion between the different societies in the United States of America the Minister and his representatives in that particular country would make an effort to co-ordinate the activities of these societies so that they might bring pressure to bear on their public representatives.</P>
    <P>I might say this.  As far as my contact with any of them has been concerned, I found in them men always willing to make the utmost sacrifices in time and money to build up the societies for the purpose for which they were formed.  There is, in particular, one society in the United States of America which seems to me from reports and actual personal contact to be doing an amazingly good job with regard to the unity of this country. That is the American League for an Undivided Ireland.  There is only one last item that I want to mention.  Perhaps the Minister might say something on it before the debate is over.  I appreciate that he may not have had an opportunity of mentioning it or knowing of it when he spoke on Friday morning.  That is the conscription of Irishmen in Britain.  This has come as rather a big blow not so much to the people in this country or even to the relatives of the people concerned in this country but to the young men in Britain at the present time who are liable for conscription.  It may be said, of course, that if our young Irishmen go across to Great Britain, get employment there and derive the benefits that exist from the British Government and people the least they could do would be to fight for the country of their adoption as it might be described.  I do not think that any of us could say that any small percentage of the young Irishmen who are working in Britain at the present time regard Britain as the country of their adoption.  All of us know that so far as these young <Col N="845" /> men are concerned it is only intended to be a temporary home where they find the employment they cannot get in their own country.  I am not trying to make any point of that at all.  If I were to go to France, Canada, the United States of America or any other country in the world, including Britain, to make my home there for the rest of my life I would have no objection to comply with any law that might be passed by the Government of these countries.  As I said before, the great majority of these Irishmen affected are young men who, through force of economic circumstances, have had to go to Great Britain to seek employment hoping for better times and that within a short time they might return to this country.  I believe that the Minister, as Minister for External Affairs, and the Government ought to do everything in their power to see that conscription, which is so objectionable to Irishmen, will not be applied to the young Irishmen who are liable to conscription in Britain at the present time.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware&mdash;he has made a statement in that connection&mdash;of the keen way in which the people of this country feel towards the title which has been given to Queen Elizabeth of England in her coronation next month. In reply to a question tabled last week, the Minister replied that the Irish Minister in London was attending the ceremonies.  I am not one who wants to make a song and dance about this.  I am not one who is in favour of any public demonstration, especially a demonstration that might bring the country or its representatives into disrepute but I think that as a simple gesture this country should refuse to have itself represented at the coronation of a queen who includes in her title Queen of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Eighty-five per cent. of the people of this country do not, and never will, regard a British king or queen as sovereign of six of our north-eastern counties.  Therefore, I suggest that we should protest in this way and that we should show we are still determined to make this a 32-county republic.  We should show in a quiet, simple yet forceful way not alone to Great Britain but to the peoples and nations of the <Col N="846" /> world that we in this country do not regard Queen Elizabeth, whether she be the first or second, as Queen of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>With reference to the possibilities of war, it would seem to me that the attitude adopted by the Communistic bloc in the countries behind the Iron Curtain is an indication of the fact that they appreciate the free countries of the world have advanced considerably in their armament programme.  I do not believe it was ever the intention of the Communistic bloc to have a war if it was possible for them to procure by other means what they desire.  As far as I can read it, the object is the total enslavement of the world.  The situation from their point of view was that as the free countries rearmed and the strength of the free countries gradually grew it was in their interests to indicate that they were prepared to talk peace.  Their policy has always been as far as they can to infiltrate peaceful countries and get in behind the scenes in order to create as much hate, discord and disturbance as possible.</P>
      <P>Some Deputy mentioned this evening that if the rearmament race were to cease to-morrow you would have vast unemployment in the free world and that economic chaos would follow.  That would seem to indicate more or less what the suggestions of peace that have been held out to the world to-day by the Communistic bloc mean. What the free world is endeavouring to do is to rearm.  If the armament programme upset the economic situation in the free countries, then the Communist countries would trade in on the evil results that might accrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our policy with regard to any disturbance that may take place in the world is crystal clear.  I find myself more or less in full agreement with what Deputy Corish said.  We can never join N.A.T.O. for two reasons. First of all, we cannot make a defensive agreement with any country until we are in a position to speak for the country as one entire unit.  It is absolutely impossible to defend Ireland if she is attacked if you are going to have two Governments functioning: <Col N="847" /> one in the North and one in the South &mdash;the one in the North in the main being controlled from Westminster or by finance from Westminster.  There is also a principle involved.  There is no country in the world whose boundaries are as clearly defined as ours.  Every schoolboy in every part of the world knows what the Irish nation is.  It is one single and solid country whose boundaries are there for anyone to see.  So long as we are denied the justice which is our right&mdash; we have been denied that right down through the centuries&mdash;we cannot be expected, as a nation, to co-operate with any other nation in any defence programme.  Apart from the fact, as I have stated, that it would be impossible to defend this country with two separate Governments that is our policy.  I think that is the policy which is being adumbrated by the present Minister.  It is the policy of every Party in the House and will continue to be the policy and the wish of 98 per cent. of our people until such time as they are given the justice which has been so long withheld from them.</P>
    <P>With regard to Partition, I do not think any useful purpose has been served towards ending it by the speech which we had this evening from Deputy Cowan.  During the past couple of years there has been a certain amount of intercourse between the two Governments. First of all, we had the Erne scheme and later the Railways Agreement Bill.  There is no doubt but that the group which is governing in the North believe that they are in the right, and they wish the world to believe that they are entitled to continue with their own Government.  We must accept it that it is a Government which exists <i>de facto.</i>  We do not accept it <i>de jure</i>, and never will.  The fact, however, is that it has been there for about 25 years.  Therefore it is necessary for us to endeavour to break down, as best we can, the barriers that are there.  I think that anything which leads to co-operation between the two parts of Ireland in the way of negotiations or by the recent visit of the Lord Mayor of Belfast to Dublin is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="848" /> I say that because when the two peoples get together to discuss a business proposition, eventually, as time marches on, they will get to discussing their political problem.  It will have to be faced sometime.  Even Sir Edward Carson, in his heyday, never accepted Partition as anything but a temporary expedient.  The present Prime Minister of England, Sir Winston Churchill, as we must now call him, said 25 years ago that the Six Counties, as part of a province, had no right to impose a permanent veto on the Irish nation. Partition will end in its own time.  I think that the type of speech that we had to-day from Deputy Cowan in which he dragged in the Bishops, the Health Act and the parliamentary debates that have taken place in this House, will not help to settle the problem.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter that I would like to mention.  It refers to the Irish News Agency.  Journalists have told me that they consider that the Irish News Agency, which was originally established for the very good purpose of putting out world news about the Irish nation, is not adhering strictly to the principles on which it was originally founded.  I am only expressing the opinions that were put to me by journalists, not in this country but outside of it, namely, that this agency is in certain instances competing for what is known as &ldquo;hot news&rdquo;.  I think it is a mistake to do that because it is to a certain extent a State institution.  By competing for &ldquo;hot news&rdquo; it is competing as a State institution with private enterprise.  I do not believe that a State enterprise of this kind should be put on an equality with private enterprise.  The private individual or company has not at its disposal the vast resources which the State has.  I may be entirely wrong in what I am saying but that is what I was told by journalists when recently I was on a visit to another country. Some of those journalists were actually connected with Irish newspapers.  If what they told me is the case I think it is wrong, and I would ask the Minister to look into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise two matters on the Estimate.  First of all <Col N="849" /> I want to ascertain from the Minister what is the present position of the Mansion House All-Party Committee in respect of Partition.  That committee was set up about five years ago. Certainly for about three or three and a half years it functioned regularly and dealt with many matters affecting the partition of the country, but for the past two years I think the committee has only met on two occasions, and on the last occasion I understood that it was the desire of the Government that the committee should be dissolved and that the Government would take in hands the kind of work which the committee up to then was doing.</P>
      <P>A good period of time has elapsed since that intimation was conveyed to the committee.  I would like to know now whether the committee is still under sentence of death and when the Government propose to carry out the execution of the committee.  If it is intended that the committee is to be dissolved and its work transferred to the Department of External Affairs, or to be handled jointly by the Department of External Affairs and the Government, I think we ought to have some statement on the matter, so that we can know where we stand in relation to this committee.  I think it is a mistake, from the public point of view and the national point of view, that there should be any doubt as to where the committee stands at the moment.  Is it in existence, is it going to meet again, or, alternatively, have the Government decided to liquidate the committee and take on the work of the committee themselves?  The Minister might give us some information on that when replying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I want to raise is the question which has been adverted to, to some extent, by Deputy Corish, and which has come to light in the past few days by the decision in what is now known as the Brosnan case in Great Britain.  The position of Irishmen in Britain under the British Military Service Acts was that if they were in England for a period of two years for a non-educational purpose they were assumed to be domiciled there for the purposes of these Acts, <Col N="850" /> and were liable to compulsory military service in Britain.  When these Acts were first introduced, Britain was at war, and, indeed, for some time after the war you had a very uneasy peace which was even as menacing as war. The whole situation, I think, has undergone a considerable change in the meantime.</P>
    <P>When the Acts were introduced in the first instance, Britain was fighting on many fronts throughout the world; but that situation has undergone considerable change for the better from a world point of view and in particular from the British point of view.  The British are still maintaining the full force of the Military Service Acts in Great Britain against Irishmen at present resident there, and I think the time has arrived when representations might legitimately and on substantial grounds be made to the British Government by this Government, asking for a complete review of the existing arrangements whereby Irishmen who are in Britain for two years or more will be required to serve a period of compulsory military service.  One might understand a situation in which a Britain at war, beleaguered and with enemies just outside the gate and all round the coast, would say to everybody who was there at the time: &ldquo;The situation is critical and serious and if you are living here you have to turn to and try to repel the invader, because if he gets in there will be no living for any one of us.&rdquo;  That is the kind of situation one might understand, but that is not just the situation at the moment.  Britain is no longer beleaguered; Britain is no longer dominated from the sky; Britain's coasts are no longer menaced; and the whole military position in Western Europe has undergone a considerable change&mdash; for the better, so far as Britain is concerned.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, therefore, to be rather odd that, in a time of peace and when Britain has no enemy on the battlefield&mdash;outside the North Koreans and their Chinese allies&mdash;she should still be insisting on the application of her military service Acts to Irish citizens in Great Britain.  It is also a bit <Col N="851" /> odd that if the ordinary British citizen will not join the British army voluntarily in order to fill up whatever gaps exist in Britain's army, she should be resorting to the conscription of Irishmen to make good the deficiencies.  In 1953, with the prospects of war having receded, in the judgment of those qualified to express an opinion on the matter, we would be quite entitled to say to Britain: &ldquo;Whatever your justification might have been when you were engaged in war, or even immediately after the war, in present circumstances we do not think that you are entitled to conscript our people, who have a separate nationality and who stand in relation to you the same as our people stand in relation to other countries, the saparatness of their nationality being clear.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not suppose this is a matter which can be handled easily, nor is it a matter in which you merely ask to have the thing done to ensure it will be done.  I put it to the Minister very seriously and very strongly that in the altered international atmosphere he could now, especially in the light of the recent judgment, ask the British Government to reopen this whole matter with a view to ensuring that our people who go to Britain to work and to retain their separate Irish nationality while there, should not be conscripted into the British armed forces merely because the British will not supply the number of troops which they ought to supply from their own citizens to make good whatever Britain feels is necessary.  I would like to hear from the Minister what views the Government has on this matter and whether it is proposed to make any representations on these lines to the British Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

      <P>I am extremely grateful to Deputy Dillon for having reminded the House that during the last war he told the world that I was a Nazi.  I am delighted that he repeated the charge to-day, because I suppose that before very long he will be calling me a Communist.  I just want to mark that, to keep it in the minds of <Col N="852" /> Deputies, that Deputy Dillon proclaimed 12 years ago to a lot of people, who did not know, that I was a Nazi. Unfortunately for this country and for the world, international relations are usually not discussed in a reasonable way.  One of the things that has damned this country for the last century is that the political relations between two sections of our people have been bedevilled by groups on top of either side who want to use religion for political purposes.  You have, unfortunately, a group in the six north-eastern counties who are doing that and it is quite obvious to everyone that there is a group here that wants to use exactly the same tactics for exactly the same political ends.  It is also unfortunate that in talking about international relations in various Parliaments, including this one, there are people who want to make powerful foreigners believe that they are the only ones who are their friends.</P>
      <P>Following Deputy Dillon's allegations in 1940 and 1941 I had to go to the United States and the newspapers put it to me: &ldquo;You are pro-German.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I am neither pro-British nor pro-German; I am just pro-Irish.&rdquo;  At that time Deputy Dillon thought that it was to his benefit to put that story out.  He is foolish enough to have repeated it to-day and I suppose he will be calling me a Communist to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Deputies asked me what our foreign policy is.  Our foreign policy is agreed to by 98, if not 99.8 per cent., of our people.  There is no necessity for me or any other Minister to reiterate what the foreign policy of this Government is and what the foreign policy is that our people want. Of course, from time to time the words in which that policy are expressed will differ.  For instance, in the last war, if I were speaking to a friendly person I could explain, as Deputy Esmonde here very quietly explained, that after all we were as much entitled to freedom as any other country, that if they wanted us to take an interest in the freedom of any other country they should take an interest in our freedom first.  You could explain it in that reasonable tone of voice or you could <Col N="853" /> explain it, as I had to explain it in the United States during the last war, because of the propaganda by Deputy Dillon and others, in very forcible terms indeed.</P>
    <P>It is known that Deputy Dillon's chief friend in the last war advocated that we should be starved into it. Deputy Dillon knew it and I knew it and, therefore, I had to bring it home clearly and definitely to anybody in the United States or Britain or anywhere else that we would not be starved into the war and would not be driven into it by any other means.</P>
    <P>I was looking up, as a matter of interest, a speech I made in Boston on 18th April, 1941.  It was a standard speech which I made in most of the principal cities of the United States and which I handed into the State Department so that no one could say that the American Government did not know exactly what I was saying.  The speech is a long one and if any Deputy wants a copy I can give it to him, but I want to make one quote which shows the rather forceful way I had to put the attitude of the Irish people to the war because of Deputy Dillon's carrying on.  I talked first about how we had declared our attitude to the war and went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been asked whether there is any chance of our people changing their attitude to the war.  There is none.  We took our decision in the full light of the circumstances and the interest of our partitioned nation, and neither economic pressure nor threats of military aggression, nor promises of an Irish Utopia after the war are going to shift us.  We have learned a little wisdom in the hard school of experience and if we fight in this war it will only be when we are attacked.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde put our attitude to the present war, the war which we hope will not come, but the war which is now in the cold phase.  We believe that our country has a right to freedom, to complete freedom for the whole of Ireland.  We believe that it has as much right to self-determination as a unit as has Britain, America, <Col N="854" /> France, Germany, Belgium or any other country in the world, and we are not going to be content with less, and 99 per cent. of our people, if asked to-morrow should we go to fight for the freedom of another country, while our own is denied, would say no.  We did that before; we did it in the 1914-1918 war, and, at the end of it, we got not freedom, but the Black and Tans.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the world is moving along, and I am hoping that there will be on the banners of most of the big nations the principle of the right of self-determination, and that not only will it be on their banners, but that they will apply it in the areas over which they have influence.  We have recently seen in the speech of President Eisenhower, to which Deputy Dillon alluded, how President Eisenhower repeats and underlines the statement made by the American Ambassador to Germany that it is the American aim that Germany should be free and united.  It is a very generous thing, indeed, of the American people that they should state an aim so clearly about a people who, until recently, were at war with them.  We have never been at war with America, thank God, and we never will, I hope.  We do not ask America to fight for us, as she may have to fight if she is to implement that aim in regard to Germany; but we do believe that we are entitled to have our attitude respected when we say that we are as much entitled to freedom and unity as is Germany, France, Belgium, England or the United States itself, and that we are not going to be content with less.</P>
    <P>There was discussion here as to what big nations would do and what big nations would not do.  In my belief, some of the big nations, at any rate, have improved in our generation. Britain herself has improved to a certain extent, although I do not believe, as Deputy Dillon believes, that she lost anything by respecting our neutrality in the last war.  At least, she did respect it and my belief is that if she had not respected it, she would have lost very heavily indeed.  It has been my duty to speak to quite a number of people, Americans, both in the Government and out, and other people, in <Col N="855" /> regard to the partition of Ireland and our rights in the matter of the declaration of war, of participation in war, and I found that by and large the representatives of the bigger countries understand our attitude.  I am not going to blame them because up to this time they have not taken steps to see that that complete freedom and right to unity and self-determination should be applied to us, but we hope that, as time goes on, even though we may not wish them to take up arms to assert and vindicate our right, at least they will use their influence to make certain that our rights are granted to us.</P>
    <P>The behaviour of America since the last war has indeed been most enlightened and generous.  Some nations before were generous and some were enlightened, but very few big nations &mdash;none that I know of with the same relative power relationship to the rest of the world&mdash;have been as generous and enlightened as the United States has been, and all we can hope is that they will continue to be generous, not with their money but with their instincts, and will become even more enlightened as time goes on.  There is no doubting the truth of what Napoleon said: &ldquo;In war, morale is to <i>matériel</i> as three is to one.&rdquo;  I do not want to see war come and, if it ever comes, I should like to see a clear-cut case between right and wrong and I should like to see the various countries standing for something clear-cut and definite which any Irishman could support.</P>
    <P>I want to see them standing for the principles that are enshrined in our Constitution and the principles for which the Irish people have fought all their lives.  It is hard, of course, for the President, Cabinet or Congress to swing the vast United States even though the President or Cabinet might believe that certain things should be done but we hope that, as time goes on, they will be brought around to agree with the principle which is enshrined in the resolution on the partition of Ireland, that a couple of times was brought before the American Houses of Congress.</P>
    <P>By the way, I want to say that I <Col N="856" /> was very glad indeed to hear Deputy Corish clearing away any misunderstanding that there might be on foot of what he said on the last occasion that we were debating External Affairs. I was very glad indeed to hear him pay tribute to the Irish organisations and particularly to the American League for an Undivided Ireland for the work they have done for Irish unity.</P>
    <P>All over the years when Ireland was fighting with its back to the wall for the land or for Home Rule or for anything else that the Irish people agreed upon, for the Republic of Ireland, for the freedom of the Republic of Ireland, we have had in the United States of America, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and elsewhere very loyal friends.  Knowing the Irish organisations in the United States of America since 1926, which is 27 years, I do not believe that at any time in Ireland's history had we more devoted, more unselfish and energetic friends than we have at the present time in the United States of America.  They have pursued the object of bringing the American Government and people to a recognition that what Ireland stands for is right and proper.  They have pursued that quietly and very energetically. They have not been fully successful but, to the extent that they have been successful, it is due to their very patriotic and very persistent efforts.</P>
    <P>Talking about relations being bedevilled, the relations between our country and Britain are also being bedevilled.  As time goes on, an increasing number of the British people feel that their past history in Ireland is something that should be obliterated and should be obliterated in the only practical way, that is, by substituting good relations between Great Britain and Ireland, to make restitution, to see that the unity of the country that was divided for British military or political reasons, whichever way you like to put it, should be restored, and to recognise that the Irish people have a right to choose their own form of Government and to govern themselves in their own way.  But you have in England, just as you have in this Dáil and in <Col N="857" /> many other parts of the world, troublemakers. You have certain journalists &mdash;indeed, you have them in this country&mdash;who want to see trouble between ourselves and Britain.  You have certain gentlemen living in this country who regard themselves as exiled Britishers. They are prepared to do everything for Britain except to live in it. They prefer to stay here and keep their jobs and take our money.  They have given wrong impressions to American reporters they have met here.  They have given wrong impressions to English reporters they have met here. Indeed, some of the English reporters coming over were looking for bad impressions of us.  Some of the gentlemen I have alluded to wrote the stories that have been complained about in this debate by several Deputies&mdash;Deputy Kyne, I think, and others.  But you have in England to-day, just as you had during the Black and Tan war and at the various times that the British Government were trying to crush the Irish people, people who are fair-minded and who do not want to be enemies with anybody and who, particularly, do not want to be enemies with our people.</P>
    <P>While you have the type of articles such as those complained of appearing in the British Press, there has appeared in what is, from one point of view, the most important of the British papers, <i>The World's Press News</i>, a paper for newspapers, read in every newspaper office in Britain and in many other countries, an article which I will quote. In <i>The World's Press News</i> of April 24th, 1953, under the heading: &ldquo;A Dublin Diary, by B.B.&rdquo;, there is this paragraph which I should like to put on record in honour of the man who wrote it and as a thankful gesture to the paper that published it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Irish newspapermen have a serious grouse against the British Press for the way in which it treats Irish news.  For years, they say, any piece of news that shows Ireland as being silly and irresponsible is headlined. Favourable news is suppressed. This line culminated in the reports appearing in the British nationals&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is, national papers,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" />&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;of riots in Dublin on the opening of An Tóstal.  There was no riot, they say, beyond a few stones thrown at windows by hooligans in O'Connell Street.  I asked my friends, many of whom know Fleet Street, London, as well as they know Fleet Street, Dublin, whether they thought it was a national bias on the part of London editors or whether it was a case of a bad habit persisting.  They were inclined to think it the latter.  We think it important enough to ask our correspondent in Dublin to write a special feature on this question, giving the facts as the Irish see them.  This will appear shortly in <i>The World's Press News.</i>  At the moment there seems quite a running sore in Anglo-Irish relations which needs healing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We appreciate that objective paragraph in that important paper, and we trust that having it repeated here will help to assuage some of the anger that is naturally aroused in our people by the very scurrilous and very unfair articles that were written in some of the British papers.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies stated that we had no foreign policy.  The basis of our foreign policy, of course, is in our Constitution.  Somebody said that war was to carry over into forcible means the pursuit of ends which one had failed to obtain by more peaceful means.  At any rate, the Government cannot carry over our foreign policy into war without the assent of Dáil Éireann.  Article 28 of the Constitution says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;War shall not be declared and the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have indicated that this Government, any more than 99 per cent. of the Irish people, have no intention of considering getting into war.  It has been indicated before by previous Governments and by this Government that the question will not even be considered by the Twenty-Six County Parliament unless we are attacked.  If attacked, of course, we will resist; but, unless we are attacked, this nation will not go into war and will not consider going into <Col N="859" /> war unless and until that matter is considered by an all-Ireland Parliament. I cannot say, and nobody can say, on behalf of that Parliament, what decision it will take.</P>
    <P>In that regard, the remarks of our Ambassador in America were adverted to here.  In reply to a parliamentary question the other day, I said that the Ambassador was not reading a written statement when he made use of the words reported in our daily newspapers. The Ambassador was trying to deal with something like the attitude of Deputy Dillon, that if we are neutral we are indifferent, that if we are neutral we must be pro-Communist, that in the last war when we were neutral we had to be pro-Nazi.  The Ambassador was dealing with that situation and pointing out that our people were anti-Communist, that we were not indifferent.  But he stressed the fact which I have stressed to-day, which was stressed by Deputy Costello when he was Taoiseach, and by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins when he was Minister for Defence, that this country was going to be neutral and had no option. Winding up his reply to one question as to what our attitude was to N.A.T.O. and other such organisations, the Ambassador said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let us have applied to our country the democratic principle by which the majority of the whole people would decide the destinies of the people as a whole, then we would be free to take whatever attitude our people as a whole thought proper towards any pact or treaty or other international instrument of any kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough in regard to that matter.  I just want to underline what the Ambassador said in the words I have quoted.</P>
    <P>So much for our foreign policy as regards going into war or declaring war.  As to what we would do if war broke out, that has been announced by our Government many years ago.  It was announced by the Taoiseach, Deputy de Valera, in 1935.  We said that much as we resented British injustice to Ireland and their occupation of six of our counties, we would not <Col N="860" /> allow our country to be used as a base for attack on Britain.  That, of course, continues to be the policy of this country and I am sure our people would thoroughly approve of it.  It continues to be the policy, not alone in relation to Great Britain, but also in relation to America.  But, much as we resent Partition, and even if we do not abandon our right to decide when to make war, we will not allow our country to be used as a base for attack on these countries.</P>
    <P>I was asked what our attitude was to various international organisations, what we proposed to do about U.N.O., European co-operation and so on.  Let us have a look again at the Article of the Constitution which refers to international relations.  Article 29 (1) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland affirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the League of Nations and in all our international relations since, we have sought as a people to get in international relations co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality.  There are no other principles upon which international relations can be founded if we are to remain at peace permanently.</P>
    <P>Much as we hear to-day about war receding into the distant future, my belief is that if the proper principles are not set out and carried into operation by the international Powers war will come sooner than later.  In that regard, I believe the one thing which we can do to prepare ourselves is to build up our resources so that we can protect ourselves economically and, if the worst comes to the worst, militarily. There is a policy there which is good for our country either in peace or in war, and that is to build up our resources so that if war should come and supplies are cut off we will still be able to exist on some reasonable standard of comfort.</P>
    <P>Clause 2 of Article 29 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or by judicial determination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> In the past we were one of the chief advocates of that approach in the League of Nations.  In more recent years we have, through the activities of our representatives on the Council of Europe, shown that we still adhere to that principle of pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination. That is the type of world we want, a world wherein there is a law which applies with equal force to the big and the small and which can be invoked should a small nation have a grievance against a large nation or should a large nation have a grievance against a small, belligerent, trouble-making nation.</P>
    <P>Clause 3 of Article 29 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland accepts the generally recognised principles of international law as its rule of conduct in its relations with other States.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that we do not claim to have any law made specially for us and that we are prepared to have applied to us the law applicable to other countries.  On the other hand we do not hold with laws being made specially for us to drive us to do things that other countries are not prepared to do.  We think that the best way in which large nations can behave is to define laws and enforce laws which they themselves are prepared to have applied to themselves.</P>
    <P>In that connection it was my duty not so very long ago to make a protest to the representative of the Government of a very large nation because certain forces had come into the Six Counties against our will and against the will of the Irish people. He started talking to me about treaties, if you please.  I took it that he was indicating that by the Treaty of 1921, to which we had agreed, and its subsequent amendment in 1925, that we were bound by that Treaty.  I told him that both the Treaty and the amended Treaty were null and void, that they had no force or effect and that they had as much validity here now as something that was signed by the French Government when that <Col N="862" /> country was overwhelmed during the last war.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to accept the application to us of laws made, laws applicable by a court representative of other countries equally prepared to have those laws applied to them.</P>
    <P>Clause 4 of Article 29 says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The executive power of the State in or in connection with its external relations shall be in accordance with Article 28 of this Constitution to be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is well known.  Article 29 (4) (2) says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For the purpose of the exercise of any executive function of the State or in connection with its external relations, the Government may to such extent and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be determined by law, avail of or adopt any organ, instrument or method of procedure used or adopted for the like purpose by the members of any group or league of nations with which the State is or becomes associated for the purpose of international co-operation in matters of common concern.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of talk about that article in relation to one matter. As we pointed out when we were invited to the Council of Europe that Article of our Constitution permits of the association and co-operation of Ireland with the countries of Europe without any amendment to our Constitution such as would be necessary in the case of many other countries if those countries wanted to act in the way in which this Article permits us to act.</P>
    <P>I think the Irish delegations have done good work in connection with the Council of Europe.  The worst of it is, that even if we only talk a little about what we have done it is regarded as boasting and it might detract from our ability to do more.  The Council of Europe has done one practical thing and recommended another.  It adopted the Human Rights Charter.  If there <Col N="863" /> is one group responsible for the adoption of that Charter it is the Irish group.  I also had the pleasure of hearing the Council of Europe claiming that its deliberations were responsible for the setting up of the European Payments Union&mdash;the one European association which has ridden all the storms of the last four or five years.  That has been a success.  Even those who did not hold with it have had to admit that it has been a success.  It was claimed by the Council of Europe in some of its documents that it was the Irish delegation that promoted the idea in the first instance.  Deputy Norton and some of the others who were at Strasbourg in 1949 will remember that the promotion by the Council of Europe consisted in my trying to get a resolution through and I could only get one vote for it.  Nevertheless it is now claimed that it was in the Council of Europe that the idea of the European Payments Union was first mooted.</P>
    <P>A few minor points were raised. Someone asked whether we were going to withdraw our application from U.N.O.  That is not the Government's intention.  I think it was a Fianna Fáil Government that first applied for admission to U.N.O.  The application was left there by the previous Government and we have left it active since we came back into office.  If we are admitted to U.N.O., we will try to play our part there, as we have done in the Council of Europe, to see that the attitude expressed in our Constitution is carried out.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the Green Pool.  The Green Pool is not under the Council of Europe or O.E.E.C.  The Green Pool assembly was collected, on the initiative of the French Government, outside the Council of Europe or O.E.E.C.  We sent our Ambassador to the first meeting to explain our attitude in regard to the matter.  Deputies have seen the speech which he made and there is no necessity for me to repeat it.  Naturally, anything which affects agriculture, or which might affect the sale of agricultural produce, is of great interest to us.  That is the reason why we were represented in the Green Pool by our Ambassador and by <Col N="864" /> a representative of the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Somebody raised the question of two gentlemen who claim they are going off to Moscow.  I think I saw in the paper the names of the two gentlemen referred to.  They do not hold passports from our office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde referred to the Irish News Agency.  He said that there were complaints that the news agency was fighting with private enterprise. He told me that he heard that over in England.  I think that the news agency have had many conferences with Irish journalists here.  So far as I am aware, they have come to very reasonable working relations with them.  Of course, they are fighting against the Press Association and Reuter and other institutions of that kind, but these are private enterprise companies promoted by Britain or by some other foreign country.  I do not think that the Irish News Agency can be accused of unfair play in competing against them, because these organisations are very often subsidised by other Governments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish referred to a rather more important matter&mdash;the question of conscription in Britain.  I think Deputy Norton is very well aware of the history of the British claim to conscript Irish people who have been living in Britain for more than two years.  Before 1948, the British claimed they had a right to conscript them on the basis that they were British subjects.  In 1947, when negotiations were going on in relation to the British Nationality Act which was passed in 1948, I remember distinctly that we got them to admit&mdash;in 1947&mdash;that we were no longer British subjects, that our constitutional position was such that we were not British subjects.  As Deputies are aware, they insisted, however, that the status of our citizens living in Britain would be changed from that of &ldquo;British subjects&rdquo; to &ldquo;non-aliens&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When representatives of the inter-Party Government went over to London after the repeal of the External Relations Act, one of the then Ministers&mdash;Deputy McGilligan&mdash;succeeded in having that changed to &ldquo;non-foreign.&rdquo;<Col N="865" /> The British insist that people who can be classed as &ldquo;non-foreign&rdquo;&mdash;our citizens, for instance&mdash;render themselves liable for conscription if they reside there for non-temporary or non-educational purposes for more than two years.  The only break in that is that, for a period of six weeks after they get the call-up for medical examination, they are allowed to return home.  That has been the state of affairs since 1940 when the British Military Service Act first came into operation.  Our first anxiety was whether it would be applied to the Six Counties.  After prolonged negotiations with the British, they very wisely agreed not to apply it to the Six Counties.  Then, in 1940 or 1941, they began to apply conscription to Irish citizens living in England.  As a result of protests which we made at that time, they agreed not to conscript our citizens if they were there for less than two years, or if they were there for longer than two years but could prove that they were there for nonpermanent or educational purposes. The position is by no means satisfactory. There is a question about it for answer to-morrow and I shall deal with it then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate at this stage whether it is proposed to reopen discussions on the matter with the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The last formal protest about it was made when we were negotiating in 1947 and this has been in operation since.  There has been no formal protest, but the British Government are fully aware, from our talks with them, that our attitude is one of continuing protest against Irishmen being conscripted into the British Army&mdash;particularly in view of the fact that British forces are still in occupation of our six northern counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish raised the question of our being represented at the British Coronation.  When the British announced that they were going to have in the Royal Style and Title the expression &ldquo;Queen of the Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&rdquo; I protested.  I felt that, in so protesting, <Col N="866" /> I was expressing not only my own wish but the wish of the Government and the wish of the people as a whole. I think it is too bad that the British Government should have committed this sort of outrage on Irish sentiment at this time.  I feel certain that if Ireland were united and free in the morning and if there were no such obstacle as the claim to sovereignty over Ireland in the Royal Style and Title, our people would rejoice in a new head of State coming to the British Throne, and we would wish them good luck. Unfortunately, the situation is this.  As long as the British claim to use Ireland in their Royal Style and Title or in any statute or instrument, it can only provoke resentment in the Irish people. We cannot for that reason send a specially accredited mission over to the Coronation but, as I pointed out in the reply, our Ambassador over there has accepted the invitation which is issued to Ambassadors who are not specially accredited to attend the Coronation. He is there as a member of the Diplomatic Corps and he must carry out the ordinary courtesies that are his duty to carry out.  However, there is no specially accredited mission going.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If we cannot rejoice in the circumstances of the new head of a State coming to the Throne, what is the function of the Ambassador?  Is he the sorrow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Norton wants us to withdraw our Ambassador so that we will have no official communication with the British, good, bad or indifferent, on any matters, whether it be conscription or anything else, he has a way open to him, and that is, to put down a motion in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out what the function of the Ambassador is.  If he cannot rejoice what is he to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton knows perfectly that the function of an Ambassador is to convey the wishes and opinions of his Government to the Government to which he is accredited. Withdrawing of an Ambassador is the <Col N="867" /> first stage to a declaration of war, but, as I say, if Deputy Norton or anybody else thinks we should have no diplomatic relationship with the British, the Dáil Order Paper is there for them to put down motions in that regard.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go back to Deputy Dillon for too long but I want to warn the people abroad about him.  We all know here he is a bit &ldquo;bats in the belfry&rdquo; and that at certain phases of the moon he goes queer.  We know also that he has advocated that our people should go into every war that ever occurred in any part of the world but he takes jolly good care never to go himself.  We know, for instance, in relation to our own country that he denounced the war of independence and he took no part in the civil war. Years after he denounced the Flag as a bloodstained rag and he would have nothing to do with it.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants me to go ahead card indexing or showing what the card index would disclose, I will tell him a little bit more.  There is one thing I can tell him.  Deputy Dillon was very glad to be a member of Deputy Costello's Party.  In 1934 Deputy Costello said: &ldquo;The Black Shirts have won in Italy, the Brown Shirts have won in Germany and the Blue Shirts are going to win in Ireland&rdquo;; and Deputy Dillon himself was going around for a while with a blue shirt and so was Deputy Mulcahy.</P>

It is the professional Protestants and the professional Catholics who make professions of their respective religion in public and do not practise it in private who have caused a lot of trouble.</P>

I want to say further if Deputy Norton wants to get that information he has the telephone or somebody to do the typing for him.  I do not see why he wants to make a public demonstration about this matter.  In reply to Deputy Norton, the committee is in existence and it has met as often as the representatives thought it should meet.

      <P>Go ndeonfar suim nach mó ná £20,500 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfas chun bheith iníoctha i rith na blíana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1954, chun ranníoc do Chomhairle na hEorpa agus don Eagras um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta san Eoraip agus i leith tionscadal áirithe Eagrais na Náisiúin Aontaithe agus chun costas eile ina dtaobh sin.</P>
      <P>Is é méid iomlán an mheastacháin £39,800.  Sin méadú £2,400 ar an suim a soláthraíodh anuraidh.  Tá mioneolas san imleabhar clóbhuailte ar an méadú nó an laghdú faoi na fo-mhírchinn éagsúla.</P>
      <P>An tsuim atá ag teastáil uainn le haghaidh an ranníoca chun an Eagrais um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta san Eoraip bunaíodh í ar an suim a caitheadh sa bhliain 1952/53.  Tá sí cuid mhaith níos lú ná an tsuim a soláthraíodh anuraidh.  Tá laghdú £1,500 sa tsoláthar le haghaidh costas taistil agus mion-chostas eile a bhaineas leis an Eagras.  Tharla sin toisc nach gá do thoscairí ó Bhaile Átha Cliath bheith i láthair ag cruinnithe chomh minic agus ba ghá roimhe seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> Tabharfar faoi deara nach bhfuil beartaithe againn aon ranníoc a dhéanamh i mbliana i leith Cláir Chúnaimh Theicniúil na Náisiún Aontaithe. Os a choinne sin, áfach, tá airgead á sholáthar i mbliana, den chéad uair riamh, le haghaidh ranníoca £10,000 chun Ciste Teagmhais Eadarnáisiúnta na Náisiún Aontaithe do Leanaí.  Usáidtear an ciste sin chun airgead a sholáthar i gcóir cláir fadtéarma de scéimeanna sláinte leanaí sna háiteanna sin ar fud an domhain atá in iargcúl eacnamaíochta.  Déantar an dea-obair sin i gcomhar le hEagras Sláinte an Domhain agus leis an Eagras Bídh agus Talmhaíochta.  Seo a leanas cuid de na nithe atá ar láimh faoi láthair:&mdash;an eitinn agus an malaria a laghdú san Aifric agus san Áise, feithidí a dhíthiú agus bainne a chaomhaint cois na Mheán-mhara Thoir, ionaid sláinte do mháithreacha agus do leanaí agus gléasraí caomhainte bainne a chur ar fáil i dtíortha áirithe agus scéimeanna chun teagasc ar chothú leanaí a thabhairt i dtíortha in Aimeirice Theas.  Ina dteannta sin tugann an Ciste cúnamh díreach i gcásanna éigeandála, mar shampla, chun leanaí teithimh a chothú.</P>
    <P>Gheibheann an Ciste formhór an airgid trí ranníoca saorálacha ó rialtais. Sa bhliain 1952 cruinníodh beagnach $11,000,000.  Gach tír a gheibheann cabhair ón gCiste bíonn uirthi earraí nó airgead a thabhairt atá comhionann ina luach leis an méid cabhrach a thugann an Ciste dí.  Iocann Rialtas na Stát Aontaithe suim atá cóimhéid le trian na ranníoc go léir ó rialtais eile.  Uime sin má thugann an rialtas ranníoc don Chiste tugtar cabhair do leanaí is fiú i bhfad níos mó ná an tsuim a ranníocadh.</P>
    <P>Tá 61 tír tar éis ranníoc a dhéanamh ó bunaíodh an Ciste.  B'fhacthas don Rialtas gur chóir dóibh ranníoc éigin a dhéanamh leis an gCiste sín de thoradh na n-achainí a rinneadh orainn. Tá beartaithe againn a shocrú go gcaithfear an t-airgead a ranníocfar ar cheannach earraí sa tír seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Comhairle na hÉorpa ba é beartas na hÉireann riamh agus i gcónaí an méid dob fhéidir léi, do réir a hacmhainne, a dhéanamh chun síocháin agus comhar cairdeasa a chur in áirithe do náisiúin uile an domhain. <Col N="873" /> Dá réir sin ghlacamar páirt ghníomhach in obair Chomhairle na hEorpa i rith na bliana atá faoi léirmheas.  Sa Tionól Comhairlitheadh, a tháinig le chéile i mí Bealtaine agus i mí Meán Fómhair, 1952, agus arís ag cruinniú urghnáthach i mí Eanáir, 1953, bhi ionadaithe ó gach aon dream polaitíochta sa Dáil i láthair agus chuireadar in iúl an léargas a bhí ann againn ar na ceisteanna a bhí dá mbreithniú. Ar na coistí a chuir an Tionól ar bun, agus a dhéanann obair nach bhfaigheann an oiread poiblíochta agus a gheibheann Seisiúin an Tionóil féin, rinne ár n-ionadaithe obair fhónta chomh maith.  Bhí cruinniú le déanaí i mBaile Átha Cliath ag ceann de na Fo-choistí, a cheap an Tionól chun cúrsaí taistil thar teoranta a phlé. Dála an scéil ní miste a rá gur mhol ionadaithe na hÉireann ag Strasbourg, tamall ó shoin, gur ceart coistí den tsórt sin a thabhairt le chéile ó am go ham i bpríomh-chathracha na Stát-chomhaltaí.  Ar an gcuma sin tarraingeofaí umhail an phobail i dtíortha éagsúla ar obair na Comhairle.</P>
    <P>I gCoiste na nAirí leanadh den obair ar roinnt nithe a beartaíodh chun comhoibriú praiticiúil na gComhaltaí lena chéile a thabhairt i gcrích.  De thairbhe na hoibre sin tá comhaontuithe áirithe réidh lena síniú.  Orthu sin tá comhaontuithe maidir le cúrsaí slándála sóisialaí, cúnamh sóisialach agus cúnamh liachta, comhionannas teastais chun daoíne a ligean isteach in Ollscoileanna agus simpliú na bhfoirmiúlachtaí a bhaineas le hiarratais ar phaitinní.  I measc na nithe eile atá dá scrúdú ag saineolaithe faoi láthair tá Cóireáil Chomhionann do Náisiúnaigh Stát-chomhaltaí, Réiteach Síochánta Díospóidí, Eistríriú, Comhaontuithe Cultúra agus cúrsaí breise a bhaineann le Paitinní agus le Slándáil Shóisialach.</P>
    <P>Daingníodh, thar ceann an Rialtais, an Coinbhinsiún chun Cearta an Duine agus Saoirsí Bunúsacha a Chaomhaint agus an Prótocol don Choinbhinsiún sin, ach go ndearnamar forcoimeádas amháin maidir le cabhair dlíthiúil in aísce.  San am céanna rinneadh dearbhú ag aithint chumhachta an Choimisiúin um Chearta an Duine chun achainí a ghlacadh ó dhaoine aonair nó ó eagrais, nach eagrais <Col N="874" /> rialtais, adeir gur sáraíodh ina leith na cearta atá leagtha amach sa Choinbhinsiún, agus dearbhú ag aithint dlínse éigeantach na Cúirte um Chearta an Duine.  Go dtí seo tá ocht dtíortha tar éis an Coinbhinsiún a dhaingniú agus sé tíortha tar éis an Prótocol a dhaingniú. Is gá deich n-ionstraimí daingniúcháin a thaisceadh sa dá chás chun feidhm a thabhairt don Choinbhinsiún agus don Phrótocol.  Níl dlínse na cúirte aitheanta fós ach ag Éire agus an Danmhairg, ach tá an cheist sin dá breithniú faoi láthair ag a lán Stát-chomhaltaí eile.  Ní cuirfear an Chúirt ar bun go dtí go mbeidh an dearbhú is gá ina leith déanta ag ocht Stáit.  Ba í Éire an dara tír&mdash;an tSualann an chéad cheann&mdash;a rinne dearbhú maidir leis an gCoimisiún.  Tá an Danmhairg tar éis é a dhéanamh ó shin.  Teastaíonn sé dearbhuithe den tsórt sin sara bhféadfaidh an Coimisiún achainí aonracha a ghlacadh.  Cuireadh timpeall chun comhaltaí an Oireachtais Páipéar Bán, ina raibh téacs an Choinbhinsiúin, an Phrótocoil agus na nDearbhuithe.</P>
    <P>Faid atá an Chomhairle ag leanúint dá cuid oibre ar cheisteanna a bhaineas le comhoibriú praiticiúil idir na Stát-Chomhaltaí tá cionn saothair, chun tíortha Iarthair na hEorpa a thabhairt le chéile níos dlúithe, á chur ar scáth ag rudaí atá ag tarlachtaint lasmuigh den Chomhairle. Is é atá i gceist agam, an ghluaíseacht i leith aontachta níos dlúithe fós, trí chomhaontais sainiúla, ina bhfuil páirt ag Rialtais na Beilge, na Fraince, na Gearmáine, na hIodáile, Luxembourg agus na hÍsiltíre.  Níl ach comhaontas amháin den tsórt sin ar bun go fóill, is é sin an Comhaontas Eorpach um Ghual agus Cruach.  I mí Bealtaine, 1952, shínigh na sé Stáit sin Conradh chun Comhaontas Eorpach um Chosaint a bhunú, ach níor daingníodh fós é.  Le déanaí bhí Tionól <i>ad hoc</i> ann de pharlaiminteoirí ó na sé Stáit sin.  Ligeadh parlaiminteoirí ó thíortha eile atá ar Chomhairle na hEorpa&mdash;ba cheann acu Éire&mdash;isteach mar bhreathnadóirí. Tharraing an Tionól sín suas dréachtreacht le haghaidh Comhaontas Polaitíochta Eorpach.  Tá beartaithe an Comhaontas um Ghual agus Cruach <Col N="875" /> agus an Comhaontas um Chosaint a chomhtháthú ansin.  Tá an dréachtreacht sin dá scrúdú faoi láthair ag na sé Rialtais a luas, agus táthar ag súil go dtabharfaidh siad a dtuairimí air ag cruinniú a bheas acu an 12ú lá de Bhealtaine.</P>
    <P>Tá staid Chomhairle na hEorpa, de thoisc na gcúrsaí sin, faoi bhreithniú agus scrúdófar arís é ag cruinniú de Choiste na nAirí an mhí seo chugainn. Ar dtúis moladh go bhféadfaidh Comhairle na hEorpa bheith ina bonnchreat do na comhaontais sainiúla sin go léir.  Ach go dtí seo, de bharr an eolais atá faighte ar an gComhaontas um Ghual agus Cruach (agus níl ach comhbhaint an-bheag leis), dhealródh sé go mba leasc leis na comhluchtaí fornáisiúnta sin bheith faoi smacht ag eagras eadar-rialtais ar nós Comhairle na hEorpa.</P>
    <P>Chun scéal gearr a dhéanamh de, is í aigne atá againne maidir le haon chomhcheangal a bheith ag an gComhairle leis na comhaontais sin&mdash;cé go gcaithfear gan breith chinnte a thabhairt ar an gceist go dtí go mbeidh na Coistí ar bun&mdash;go n-aontóimis le haon tsórt liaison a mbeadh na Státchomhaltaí eile sásta leis, ach nach lagódh an liaison sin in aon tslí comhaltas na Comhairle mar atá faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Tá an tEagras um Chomhar Eacnam aíochta san Eoraip go beo bríomhar agus tá Éire ag leanúint dá cion a dhéanamh ann go dúthrachtach.  Bhí ceithre cruinnithe ag Comhairle na nAirí i rith na bliana 1952/53.</P>
    <P>Níl aon bhaint ag an Eagras faoi láthair le roinnt na cabhrach ó na Stáit Aontaithe.  B'shin cuid mhór den obair a bhí le déanamh aici sna blianta tosaigh.  Anois is é is mó a bhíos ar a haire na fadhbanna móra, eacnamaíochta agus airgeadais, atá ag cur as do na Stát-Chomhaltaí, do na Stáit Aontaithe agus do Cheanada.  I rith na bliana 1952/53, chuir an tEagras dhá fhoilseachán mhór-thábhachta ar fáil. Grúpa neamhspleách saineolaithe a rinne an chéad shaothar acu.  Bhain sé le cobhsaíocht an airgeadais intíre i gcás Stát-chomhaltaí.  Is fiú a thabhairt faoi deara go raibh na beartais airgeadais a glacadh i gCáinaisnéís na <Col N="876" /> tíre seo anuraidh ag freagairt go dlúth do na prionsabail a moladh sa tsaothar sin.</P>
    <P>Ba é an dara saothar Ceathrú Tuarascáil Bhliantúil an Eagrais agus foilsíodh é i ndeireadh na bliana 1952/53 faoin teideal <i>Europe&mdash;the Way Ahead.</i>  Sa Tuarascáil sin rinneadh miondealú cruinn beacht ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta agus airgeadais sna Stát-Chomhaltaí, sna Stáit Aontaithe agus i gCeanada.  Scrúdaíodh go cúramach na modhanna trína bhféadfadh na tíortha sin, dá n-oibrídís i dteannta a chéile, na deacrachtaí a shárú a thagann as barrachas mór a bheith i gcomhardú íocaíochtaí na Stát Aontaithe i gcónaí.  Bhi misiún speisialta ón Eagras um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta i Washington le déanaí ag plé le húdaráis na Stáit Aontaithe i dtaobh na mbeartas a moltar sa Tuarascáil seo.</P>
    <P>Is aidhm mhór ag an Eagras an trádáil a shaoradh.  B'ainneoin gur casadh constaicí áirithe ar an Eagras tá dul ar aghaidh mór déanta aige chun an trádáil idir-Eorpach a shaoradh de tairbhe a Chlaír Iomscaoilte agus Aontais Iocaíochtaí na hEorpa.  De thoradh Aontais Iocaíochtaí na hEorpa tá comh-mhalairtiú páirteach airgeadraí Eorpacha tugtha chun críche.</P>
    <P>Tá an tEagras um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta san Eoraip tar éis a chruthú go soiléir chomh tábhachtach agus atá sé mar ghléas chun comhoibriú eacnamaíochta agus airgeadais a chur i gcion idir thíortha Eorpacha ar thaobh amháín, agus idir na tíortha sin agus na Stáit Aontaithe agus Ceanada ar an taobh eile.</P>

      <P>Tá rún ar an bpáipéar, fé Orduithe an Lae, im ammse, an Meastachán seo a chur thar n-ais chun é d'athbhreithniú agus tairgim an rún sin anois.  Mhol an tAire an obair a rinneadh ar Chomhairle na hEorpa.  Thagair sé don chlú a thuill na hionadaíthe a chuireamar ann ó am go ham.  Tá súil againn go léir go leanfaidh an chlú sin a thuill an tír seo mar gheall ar an saothar a dhein na daoine a chuireamar go dtí na <Col N="877" /> cruinnithe den Chomhairle.  Nuair a bhí an príomh-Mheastachán á phlé chuireas ceist mar gheall ar ainmneacha na ndaoine a ceapadh le dul go dtí an chéad chruinniú eile.  Tá orm tagairt níos fuide a dhéanamh anois don scéal sin.</P>
      <P>Ar an 22ú Aibreán, do réir colún 400 d'Imleabhar 138, Uimh 4, de na Díospóireachta Parlaiminte, thug Rúnaí Parlaiminte an Taoisigh an fógra seo leanas don Dáil:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Tá orm a chur in iúl don Dáil go bhfuiltear tar éis na daoine seo leanas a roghnú mar Thoscairí agus Ionadaithe ó Éirinn don Chúigiú Seisiún de Chomhthionól Comhairlitheach na hEorpa a thiocfas le chéile i Strasbourg an 7ú Bealtaine 1953.</P>
      <P>Toscairí: An Teachta Gearóid Ó Beoláin, Aire Dlí agus Cirt; Séamas Mac an Chrosáin, iar-Sheanadóir; an Seanadóir Prionsias Ó Lachtnáin, agus an Teachta Liam de Nortún.</P>
      <P>Ionadaithe: An Teachta Seán Ó Beirn; an Teachta Niall Bléine; an Teachta Peadar Ó Comhdhain, agus an Seanadóir Micheál B. Yeats.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Do lean sé i mBéarla an uair sin:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have to inform the Dáil that the following have been selected as representatives and substitutes from Ireland to the Fifth Session of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, which will meet at Strasbourg on the 7th May, 1953.  The representatives chosen are: Deputy Gerald Boland, Minister for Justice; James Crosbie, a former Senator; Senator Frank Loughman, and Deputy William Norton.  The substitutes are: Deputy John Beirne; Deputy Neil Blaney; Deputy Peadar Cowan, and Senator Michael B. Yeats.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister has praised the work done by our former representatives at Strasbourg.  We are gratified at the work which they have been able to do.  When this notice was given to the House I raised the question as to who was responsible for the nomination of Deputy Peadar Cowan to go to Strasbourg to represent Ireland there.  I move this motion now simply for the purpose of getting clear <Col N="878" /> on that point.  I object to Deputy Peadar Cowan being sent abroad to represent this country in any way.  He covers, with a mercurial coat and a particular type of viciousness, certain matters of policy that are of vital importance to this country.  I cannot see his taking part in any discussions at Strasbourg without bringing discredit on this country by antagonising or insulting some of the countries that are on friendly relations with us here.</P>
    <P>I asked on the 22nd April last who was responsible for the recommendation and the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;The group&rdquo;.  I asked: &ldquo;What group?&rdquo; and the Taoiseach replied: &ldquo;The group to which the Deputy belongs&rdquo;.  I asked who was responsible ultimately for the choice &ldquo;as to who will represent Ireland at the Assembly&rdquo;, and the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;The Dáil ultimately&rdquo;. I then asked: &ldquo;By what action does the Dáil show how it nominates these persons&rdquo;, and there was no answer forthcoming to that.  Later the Taoiseach said that he was nominated by the Independent group, and later again, on behalf of two Deputies at any rate in the Independent group, Deputy Alfred Byrne and Deputy Alderman Byrne, there was a repudiation that they, as Independents, had any responsibility for the nomination. The type of representative group that will represent us in Strasbourg consists of two representatives representing the Government side of this Assembly and two representatives representing the Opposition side.  Three substitutes represent the Government side and one substitute represents the Opposition side.</P>
    <P>As far as we here are concerned, we feel that it is vitally important that we shall know who is responsible for what may transpire to the discredit and the difficulties of our country as a result of Deputy Peadar Cowan being sent to represent us abroad at any kind of an international assembly, and I want to fix the Minister with the responsibility. I think the Minister cannot shed that responsibility.  No matter what he may say with regard to anybody else in the House being responsible, he cannot shed that responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> I would like to draw the attention of the House to a statement made on the 12th July, 1950, by the former Minister, Deputy MacBride, with regard to the representatives at Strasbourg.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have no governmental responsibility for the acts and affairs of Irish delegates and substitute delegates, once appointed to the Assembly; they are independent and free to act as they choose.  That is as it should be, as the Assembly is composed of parliamentary representatives rather than governmental representatives.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not regard Deputy Cowan as a proper person to send as a parliamentary representative from this country. However, it is the Minister's responsibility in asking the House to provide this money and it is his responsibility ultimately for deciding who is to be sent there.  If the Minister wants to shed that responsibility, as the Taoiseach apparently wanted to shed it, and to pin it on certain persons in this country, I think it is important that we should know who those persons are.</P>
    <P>The appointment has been repudiated by Deputy Alfred Byrne and by Deputy T. Byrne.  The other persons in the house who could be brought into the group that the Taoiseach mentioned are Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll, Deputy Lehane, Deputy Cowan, Deputy Cogan, Deputy Sheldon and Deputy McQuillan.  I submit, from what we know generally of Deputy Cowan's approach and his temperament, we should know who of these people are responsible for sending him there&mdash;if the Minister washes his hands of any responsibility.  I do not think the Minister can do that, but I repudiate the appointment and I move the motion &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration&rdquo; so that the matter will be fully and seriously considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy is aware of the procedure which has been followed here in this Parliament in regard to the nomination of delegates and their substitutes to the Council of Europe right from the time it was set <Col N="880" /> up in 1949.  The procedure has been that the Government, or the Government Whip, consults other Parties in the House as to whom they would like to have representing them.  In the time of the last Government there were two representatives from the then Government side of the House, there were two representatives from the Opposition side and there were four substitutes, three of whom came from the Government side and one from the Opposition.  That is to say, the Government had two representatives and three substitutes and the Opposition had two representatives and one substitute.</P>
      <P>We have followed that procedure since we became the Government.  We offered to the Opposition groups two representatives and one substitute and we kept for ourselves and for certain of the Independent members two representative and three substitutes.  We, being the single Party outside the Independents, kept for Fianna Fáil two representatives and two substitutes and we offered to the Independent group one substitute.  The Independent group nominated Deputy Peadar Cowan.  I take full responsibility for the negotiations and for having brought the nominations to the Taoiseach and from the Taoiseach to the House.  It is like every other act of Government, if the Dáil wants to repudiate any other act here they can do so but can do it only by motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan and all the other delegates and substitutes when they get to Strasbourg will represent themselves as members of this Parliament or members of Parties associated with this Parliament.  The delegate, Mr. Crosbie, is not now a member of the Seanad but he has been nominated by the Fine Gael Party to represent them and we accepted him and he is one of the delegates which the Taoiseach nominated here the other day.  Of course, the last Government did not take any responsibility&mdash;they were not asked to take any responsibility and had no right to take any responsibility &mdash;for anything that I did as a substitute at Strasbourg or anything that Deputy de Valera or Deputy MacEntee, who were then delegates, did in Strasbourg. <Col N="881" /> I take it that the same situation exists to-day.  I do not feel the slightest bit responsible for whatever Mr. Crosbie or any of the other Fine Gael people do, or for what Deputy Norton may do.  I feel that the team going out will express their own ideas on the matters that come before the council and I have no doubt that they will express them honestly.</P>
    <P>My experience has been that it is natural in this House&mdash;in order to get matters properly discussed, some would say&mdash;that we should exaggerate the differences that exist between us.  One of the reasons why debates on external affairs sometimes get into a rather personal sphere is that there are in fact very few differences between us and they are differences only of personality. I feel that the team going out to Strasbourg will, on this occasion, as on the last occasion, consult with one another and will act in a manner that will bring credit to the country.</P>

The Deputy is wrong in saying that I do not take responsibility for it.  I take the responsibility as a member of the Government.  It happened to be my special bailiwick to get in touch with the Chief Whip to ask him to consult the Parties and to get the nominations.  I take full responsibility for that.  I take full responsibility for the nomination to the Dáil of Deputy Peadar Cowan and the other seven representatives and substitutes.</P>

    <P>That provision shall be made by statute for the making by the Minister for Health of regulations relating to filling material for bedding, cushions, articles of upholstery, toys or similar articles and providing for the imposition of certain charges.&mdash; (An tAire Sláinte.)</P>

      <P>When we were discussing this Resolution on the last occasion, the Minister was not able to tell us very much about it.  Deputy Briscoe intervened to fill in the gaps, but could the Minister now tell us what he has ascertained in the meantime as to the necessity for requiring licences for these matters, what the licence is for, what amount of money will be charged for the licence and what amount of money he expects to make?</P>

      <P>The Rag Flock Act of 1911 was abolished in the 1947 Health Act and re-enacted with certain additions. The 1950 Act which was approved by Deputy Mulcahy as Miniister was drafted exactly as the section is drafted in the Bill, so that I am really putting a section before the Dáil which has the approval of every Party in the Dáil.  This deals with fillings for mattresses&mdash;not only flock but other fillings&mdash;to ensure that they are clean and healthy and the provision has been asked for not only by people engaged in the trade but by the Trade Union Congress.  A Financial Resolution is necessary, because, even though the Act might be passed providing for the making of regulations, including the licence fee, the licence fee cannot be collected except after the passage of such a Resolution.  The licence fee is very small&mdash;I cannot say exactly what it is, but I think it is about £2 &mdash;but there is no change, so far as that is concerned.  It has been there since 1911 and is being continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a provision to get rid of infectious filth, some of which is noticeable here on occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is covered by the 1947 Act?  I have looked up Section 67 of that Act and it seems to cover all the things implied in this Resolution, with the possible exception that finished mattresses now appear to come into the offing.  Does this mean that if people want to engage in the manufacture of mattresses, a licence will in future be issued to such as want to do so?  In other words, it would appear to me that this is a restrictive trade practice.  The 1947 Act enables any sanitary inspector to go into any house on behalf of the health authority, inspect anything that is not clean and have it destroyed, whether it is a mattress or a child's toy&mdash;anything which is stuffed with some sort of material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot quite understand why the Minister comes to the House looking for money because he seems to have everything he requires under the 1947 Act.  His officials are enabled to go into a house and seize anything they think is unclean and have it destroyed. <Col N="884" /> They are enabled to prosecute anybody in any way responsible for housing or storing filth.  Why this Resolution now? Why does the Minister seek further powers?  There is a gradually growing conviction in my mind that the whole meaning of this Health Bill is to enable health authorities to get complete control of everything in the house to-day. I cannot read the Bill in any other way.  What else can be behind it?  Surely all the authorities exist already&mdash;the sanitary authorities, the medical officers of health and the people responsible for enforcing the provisions of the 1947 Act?  Why must the Minister now come in and look for further powers?</P>
    <P>Is it that the Department or the health authorities feel that they have not enough control already and must come in on this, or is it from the other angle that we must look at it, that there is to be a rigid control of the manufacture of this particular type of article?  Could the Minister give us any information as to how many firms will be affected by this licensing provision, how many licences exist already for the manufacture of these articles and how many further licences it is intended to grant?  What is the sum of money which is to be collected as a licence fee?  Is it £100 or 30/- and is it something which is going to turn this type of manufacture into the hands of the well-off?  Is it to be a sort of trade ring or racket?  That is what we on this side are anxious about.</P>
    <P>We look on this matter from two angles.  We dislike the licensing provision and we object to State control and have never made any secret of our objection.  Deputy Browne has spoken about the door being open and the foot ready to kick it open further and he is quite right when he says that.  We are gradually handing over our birthright to the State and some day we will cease to be individuals and will be known as units, as a result of all this type of legislation.  This is another step on the road towards that condition of affairs.  These are the two aspects which we do not like&mdash;we do not like this licensing provision and we do not like this idea of monopolistic control and further interference with the private life of the individual.  The <Col N="885" /> State has stepped in and taken control and is regimenting and assessing our lives each day.  We object to that in its entirety.  Therefore we are opposing this Money Resolution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am really amazed at the attitude being adopted by the Fine Gael Opposition and in particular by a member of the medical profession.  The Minister stated a few minutes ago that the section for which this Money Resolution is required was already in the 1911 Act.  Even if it were not recollected by Deputies opposite, the Minister has pointed out that in the 1950 Bill that particular section was drafted as it is presented to-day.  All this opposition with regard to this Bill by Deputy Dr. Esmonde is amazing. Does Deputy Dr. Esmonde really want to pretend that he believes what he has just stated?  He has talked about the power under the 1947 Act for a sanitary officer to go into a house for the purpose of destroying infectious material which may be there as a result of an infectious or contagious illness.</P>
      <P>This particular Money Resolution is in connection with a section of the Bill which is designed to prevent manufacturers or business people collecting infected materials and handing them on to others to be used as raw material for a commodity to be sold to the public.  Will Deputy Dr. Esmonde tell me that he is against protecting the public from the possibility of such behaviour?  As a medical practitioner, does he think the State should not take the necessary steps to ensure that raw material of that nature which could be dangerous to the public will not be so used?  Does he think he is justified in getting up here pretending that he thinks so?</P>
      <P>There has been all this talk about State control and about the fee.  I listened to the Minister answering Deputy Mulcahy in connection with the fees.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde says it may be £100 because Deputy Dillon said so the other night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Deputy tell me what the fee is likely to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has just <Col N="886" /> said it will be a negligible sum, possibly £2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear him then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Deputy did not hear him, because he did not want to hear him.  Nobody on the other side of the House to-day wants to hear anything that appears to have any sense in it.  They only want to hear what they think will suit the line they are taking at the present moment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, the other night, was amazed to discover that the Money Resolution related to something which was already in the Bill before us.  He was further amazed, and so were some of his colleagues, to discover that the explanatory note with the Bill when circulated gave in clear detail interpretations or explanations of the sections concerned.  This comes from a Party for which Deputy Costello has stated that the Bill has been examined line by line, section by section, and will be opposed line by line and section by section.  They did not even know that Section 53 was in the Bill and did not even know what it meant or what it was all about.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the idea is behind the present behavious.  There can be differences of opinion on certain principles and members of the House are entitled to express a point of view they believe and about which they believe other people may have a view. It stretches the elastic too far when Deputy Dr. Esmonde can make the opposition he has made to this Money Resolution.  He cannot say he is not an educated person.  He has a degree from a university where he must have had sufficient education to be regarded as a normal intelligent person.  I have heard that there are certain comedians who are well known for making the ridiculous out of the serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Money Resolution is quite clear to me.  I hope the public will understand it also.  It is to ensure that there will be ample protection for the public against the sale of any material or article containing something which could be injurious to health.  The ordinary people will understand <Col N="887" /> and will appreciate that we are now taking the necessary steps to prevent the use of contaminated materials. This section is bound to stop that.</P>
    <P>There was talk about rackets. Deputy Dillon said that this Money Resolution was the basis for the creation of a new racket, a racket to create monopolies.  Deputy Dillon knows quite well that that is not so. If this were to create a racket, why did his Party, as a member of the Coalition, include it in the 1950 Bill? Were they thinking in terms of rackets and do they now think that we may be thinking in terms of rackets in relation to a section of a Bill which they fathered?  It is stretching the imagination a little bit too far.  It is stretching political dishonesty a little bit too far.  It is about time Deputies over there took a serious view and tried to help improve legislation and to stop legislation which might be against the rights and privileges of the people.  They should certainly not stop something which is designed to improve and protect the health of the people.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand it.  Deputies opposite profess to be able to lead this country, not only in the production of a health service, but out of every difficulty and to win back everything that belongs to it.  By their attitude on this particular section they are proving that they are not fit to lead the smallest group in the smallest rural council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The thing is that we do not want to lead a group representative of a vested interest that desires to proceed triumphantly on their own particular racket.  I want to direct the attention of the House to a series of significant instances that have arisen in connection with the discussion on this Financial Resolution.  Deputy Briscoe cannot get it out of his head that we are discussing Section 53 of the Bill.  We are not.  We are discussing a Financial Resolution.  Section 53 of the Bill empowers the Minister to make a series of regulations for the control of certain materials which might become contaminated in course of user or trade and Section 53 confers <Col N="888" /> on the Minister wide powers to prevent any harm accruing to the community as a result of such contamination.</P>
      <P>The Financial Resolution does not do that.  The Financial Resolution tells us how the Minister will go about it.  The section gives him a wide variety of powers, to any one of which he may have recourse.  The Financial Resolution tells us the power he is to avail of and how.  Is it not an interesting thing that when we asked the Minister on Thursday night last to tell us how he proposed to implement Section 53 and what this Financial Resolution indicated as to his intentions he did not know?  Those of us who are familiar with the procedure of the House saw him turn to his officials and ask for further and better particulars.  To help him out of his difficulty, I asked him to read us his brief.  I said that if he would give us the kind of particulars he himself was getting from his permanent officials that would probably clarify the whole matter.  While he was going through his papers to get that material, Deputy Briscoe intervened and showed in a moment that he knew all about it.  The Minister knew nothing about it and said: &ldquo;You are being unreasonable in pressing me to give a whole lot of particulars about a Financial Resolution which I thought would pass automatically and I am not posted on it.&rdquo;  Ultimately, he said: &ldquo;I will read you my brief&rdquo;, and he implied, &ldquo;If I had known there was to be a whole lot of discussion on this, I would have briefed myself and been in a position to answer&rdquo;.  Note the difference. Deputy Briscoe knew all about it.</P>

      <P>Just as the proceedings were coming to a close, out of the oratorical bag that Deputy Briscoe was carrying there leaped a large cat and the proceedings concluded with the strident mewings of Deputy Briscoe's <Col N="889" /> cat.  Here is the cat, as reported in column 720 of the Official Debate. Remember, to-night it is the defenceless public who are in danger of disease or even death with this sword of Damocles hanging over their head who rush to the Minister for protection and, with paternal zeal, he casts his cloak around the suffering public to see that nothing happens them. Deputy Briscoe shakes his head in approbation, but he has forgotten the cat.  Did Deputy Briscoe look at what he himself said, as reported in column 720?</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe did not say then: &ldquo;All my constituents asked for this.&rdquo;  He did not say: &ldquo;Defenceless people from all over Ireland approached Deputies of our Party to seek protection from this menace.&rdquo;  What he said is deeply significant:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Briscoe: All the trades requested it.&rdquo;</P>

If you once can get a trade in this country subject to licence, it is only a matter of time until you have a restricted number of persons licensed to trade in it and everybody else becomes their agent.  Rag-pickers are humble folk, but I have known rag-pickers not 100 miles from this House who began with nothing but a bag on their back and a capacity to collect rags and old iron and, because they lived in a free country, they built up a considerable business and became rich men.</P>

      <P>Why should you put on a fee?  The purpose of this is not to raise revenue.  Is not that so?  The case made by Deputy Briscoe, not by the Minister, is that this is merely implementing Section 53 to exclude contaminated material from the trade. The Deputy wants to ensure that any person who culpably introduces deleterious matter into a trade of this kind is prevented from the occasion of doing so thereafter and you say: <Col N="892" />&ldquo;To that end we will provide that anyone engaging in this trade shall henceforward hold a licence and if he ceases to hold that licence for stated misconduct then he will not be allowed to trade at all.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Briscoe is mistaken.  I think the dog licence, the tobacco licence, the wine, beer and spirit licence were all devices in the earlier stages of ours and Great Britain's fiduciary history for raising revenue.  That is the tradition.  I know how it is being done to-day.  If one wishes to introduce a regulation to-day the procedure in modern times is that the first requisition you receive from the Department of Finance is for the purpose of introducing some levy to meet the cost of administration of the proposed regulatory procedure. I myself have repeatedly resisted such proposals on the ground that I could not see why a person should not be allowed to ply his trade freely and if the Government wants to exercise a regulatory supervision of that man's business in the interests of everybody but the trader, the last person to be called upon to bear the burden of costs should be the trader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot prophesy how the rag-pickers' licence will be administered, but I ask the House to judge by previous experience.  We passed a Fellmongers Bill.  Fifteen years ago in this country there were hundreds of people dealing in sheep skins and the result of that competition for sheepskins was that the butcher who had a <Col N="893" /> sheepskin to sell could get one man to compete against another and he thereby got a better price for the sheepskin and he paid a better price for the sheep.  The Fellmongers Bill was passed and the purpose of that Bill was to ensure that the Minister for Industry and Commerce could regulate the trade allowing the export only of what he thought compatible with the industrial life of the country and retaining what he thought should not go out.  It was pointed out at the time that the only purpose was to get the material under control.  What happened?  How many fellmongers are in the country now?  About half a dozen.  And it is easier to become a member of the French Academy than it is to become a member of the fellmongers' association.  I remember the time when any man who had an ass and cart could deal in hides.  I remember fellows going around in spring cars to butchers' shops competing for a pile of hides.  Then the system of licensing was introduced.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about exports.  I am talking about dealing around the country.  I am talking about men going around in spring cars to butchers' shops to buy hides. Then we introduced licensing and the persons who got the licences formed a Hide Improvement Society.  Everybody thought that meant a society to improve hides, but in fact it turned out to be a society to improve hide merchants, and the next performance was that as a condition of getting a licence to buy hides one had to be a hide improvement member, but when one applied for admission to the charmed circle of the Hide Improvement Society one was told by the society that it had as much as it could do to improve the hide merchants already in it and they were unable to take in any more.  To-day if one has a parcel of hides that one wants to sell to a tanner, can one just bring one's hides to the tanner and sell them?  One cannot.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We are talking about regulations and regulatory improvements. One has a parcel of hides and there is a tanner 20 yards away to whom one wants to sell those hides. First of all one must invoice the hides to a member of the Hide Improvement Society, 120 miles away, and the hides must sit on one's floor until one is told by the society that one may shift them up to the tanner.  One invoices the hides to the fellow 120 miles away and he invoices them back to the tanner and then one puts them in a wheelbarrow and rolls them up to the tanner's yard.</P>
      <P>How long will it be before we have a rag improvements society?  We will all think it is something to improve rags but we will discover in time that it is not a society to improve rags but a society to improve rag merchants and any man who has a bag of rags and wants to sell them to a man who uses rags will have to communicate with a member of the Rag Improvements Society, and having invoiced them to that society and the society having invoiced them back to his nextdoor neighbour, he can then put them on a wheelbarrow and roll them round to the door and leave them in.  There is an interesting question always in connection with these transactions.  It is that the invoice from the hide proprietor or the rag proprietor to the member of the society goes up at first cost, and when the invoice comes back from the rag or hide improver to the manufacturer there is 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. added on.  Is it any wonder they form societies for the improvement of hide and rag merchants?</P>

      <P>All I want to provide is that, if it is necessary for the prevention of trafficking in deleterious material, those who deal in it shall do so by licence.  I desire that the issue of the licence shall not be subject to any charge, that uniform conditions will be laid down and that any person whether he be rich or poor, high or low, who conforms with the conditions will be entitled to a licence as a rag dealer.  If these points are conceded, I do not see any serious objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, originally, it was a revenue matter.  I think the Minister would tell the Deputy, if he asked him, that the proposal of the fee was inserted at the instance of the Department of Finance on the grounds that any administrative arrangement of this kind must have attached to it a revenue-producing proviso which will finance the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If our experience led us to believe that it always stopped at that we might possibly consent.  However, I have shown the House how this device has been taken up by vested interests and how, for their purposes, traders have gradually used the licence proviso as an instrument to ensure that a very few people will ultimately establish a monopoly.</P>
      <P>Who would imagine, for instance, that feathers would constitute any very valuable asset?  Yet, I should imagine that the feather trade of this country is worth an immense sum.  There will be licences to deal in feathers.  It is very strange and interesting&mdash;when you get to see these things from behind a ministerial table&mdash;to realise how rich an asset the monopoly of anything can become.  Vespasian, an Emperor of Rome, was not too proud to establish a monopoly in public urinals and he grew richer.  He has a lot of spiritual descendants.  I know of vested interests in this country who got tariffs put on commodities because they knew the market was so small that it was just sufficient to provide relative riches for one and that the one entrenched would make it unprofitable for anyone else to venture in&mdash;and they are doing very nicely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I ask the Minister is to provide that licences will be issued to anybody who asks for them, free of cost; that <Col N="897" /> so long as they conduct the trade inoffensively they will not be interfered with and that the withdrawal of the licences will only be the penalty of deliberate misfeasance on the part of the licensee.  If that is done, the greater part of my objection falls to the ground.  To be quite honest, I can see that the Minister could imagine that he meets the case immediately by saying: &ldquo;I will limit myself to 5/-&rdquo; I do not think he does.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he contemplates a fee not in excess of £2. If a case is made in five years' time&mdash; when we have all forgotten this&mdash;what will happen?  If I ask Deputies in this House in five years' time: &ldquo;What do you know about issuing licences to rag-pickers&rdquo; they will not have the faintest notion from whence the power came.  We would have forgotten about it.  But the rag improvement society would not have forgotten.  They would know&mdash;and they would take very good care to ensure that neither Deputy Dr. Maguire nor I would discover it without a good deal of search.  If you asked one of them how the business of licences began they would close up like clams.  The case might perhaps be made&mdash;not to this Minister but to his successors&mdash;that it was expedient to keep unreliable people out of the trade or to provide that, as there were too many people buying rags, everybody having a licence would be confirmed in it but that, for the next ten years, no more licences would be issued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy does not agree that 5/- will be adequate to keep undesirable people out of the business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but do not forget what happens once you get your toe in the door.  Deputy Dr. Browne has given us the headline as to how we should go on after that.  They cannot put on any fee if they do not pass a Financial Resolution because they do not mean to bring the money into the Exchequer.  If you pass a Financial Resolution for as little as a penny then, for any fee whether it be for a penny or for £1,000, there is a conduit pipe into the Treasury through which the money would pass.  In five years' time, having kicked the door <Col N="898" /> down, they could then make a strong case to raise the fee.  They might even come to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Here is a method of increasing revenue&rdquo;. They are quite prepared to pay 200 guineas or 500 guineas if that means that they can get a monopoly.  It is awfully hard, if people have a monopoly for rags, to get inside it. People will shrug their shoulders and say: &ldquo;Who wants to buy rags?&rdquo; I do not say that there is a monopoly in feathers, but, suppose I announced to the House that there is a monopoly in feathers, who would lose a night's sleep over it?  Who, here, wants to deal with feathers?  Who is interested in feathers?  But have we not a duty to see that our legislation does not create a monopoly?</P>
      <P>If we cannot achieve our purpose of the protection of the public health by a device that will not open the door that chink which will permit vested interests to kick it down, ought we not ask the Minister to provide the guarantee hereafter against the door's being kicked down by any monopolist? That is the case.  Deputy Briscoe gets excited about this.  Does he think that Fine Gael hope, in the coming by-elections, to be swept to victory on the tumultuous votes of the rag-pickers of the country?  They are a very respectable body of people but if the whole tribe turned up in Wicklow or East Cork, unless the contest is much closer than I think it is going to be, I do not believe they could sway the result one way or the other.  Is there any conceivable way in which the rag-pickers of this country, financially, electorally or otherwise are likely to affect the political destinies of any Party or any Deputy in this House?  I do not think there is.  If ever a case was made for a body of citizens who have no conceivable <i>quid pro quo</i> to offer in return for the advance of their interests, it is truly the rag-pickers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not any more interested in rag-pickers than I am in fellmongers or any other body of people of this country. The principle I seek to defend is this.  The ordinary people, however humble, have a right to earn their living in their own country without the permission of the rich or the strong.  If <Col N="899" /> a man is poor, hardworking, honest and efficient and can ply his trade in a manner consistent with the public welfare, he is just as much entitled to ply in his humble way as the largest monopolist conceivable.</P>
    <P>I think that is a principle worth defending and one worth fighting for. I do not think it is a principle that is going to get votes for anybody who does support it but I suggest to the Minister that it would be a graceful gesture on his part&mdash;he is in the mood at present for making graceful gestures verbally and legislatively&mdash;to announce that he did not propose to levy any fee, and that the Financial Resolution could be dropped.  If, at any future time, he found the powers of the section inadequate without the power to collect the fee he could come back to the Dáil on some other occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are indebted to Deputy Briscoe for the explanation we got concerning this Money Resolution. Like the previous speaker I am opposed to the system of issuing licences except where it is in the public interest and it cannot be argued that the issue of licences in a case like this would be in the public interest instead of being to the detriment of people who wish to engage in the various trades connected with the provision of furnishings.</P>
      <P>Obviously if a system of licensing is introduced, power will then exist which will enable regulations to be made. Regulations, however stringent, can then be made which would have the effect of putting out of business small people without licences or the people who were not wanted in the trade.  A system of regulations could be prepared in a manner which would make it in the long run a restrictive practice and would restrict the competition that might arise in connection with this rag and bone and feather trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We saw ourselves the abuses connected with licensing systems, particularly where the Fianna Fáil Party were concerned.  May I remind them of the issue of cattle licences some 15 years ago?  Everybody knows the scandalous rackets that arose in connection with the issue of those licences, <Col N="900" /> so that it is no argument to say that there is no possibility of any abuses arising.  We know that abuses did arise in connection with the issue of cattle licences and if it is proposed to introduce a system of licensing in this case abuses can also develop.</P>
    <P>When the Minister referred to this matter he did not mention that the people who wished to engage in this trade could register instead of getting licences.  Why not ask the people to register if they wish to engage in the trade?  You would then know who was engaged in it.  The argument was put up that the issue of licences would enable those people to be known, but if they are required to register in order to engage in this rag and bone business, as a feather merchant or as a merchant in regard to other types of filling which might be used in mattresses or other things which would be subject to the provisions of this measure, surely that should be sufficient. If he is merely required to register at least he brings himself to the notice of the authorities who might wish by reason of certain powers to interfere in the conduct of that man's business, but when a licence is issued to him it can be withdrawn and he can be put out of business.  The real danger I see in it is the possibility when the licence is issued of introducing a set of regulations which will put all unwanted persons out of action and restrict the operations of those engaged in the trade.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe put up one argument here and said there was a clause of this nature in the 1950 Bill.  However, he did not quote the section; neither did he indicate that the 1950 Bill was not acceptable to the inter-Party Government as it stood.</P>

      <P>There is no use in Deputy Briscoe talking about the 1950 Bill.  It was not acceptable to the inter-Party Government.  If it was acceptable to the inter-Party Government it would have gone through this House.  There were sufficient members to put it through.  The Deputy knows very well the reception that Bill got from all concerned.  I was very interested to hear from Deputy Briscoe that apparently a number of traders had discussed with him the desirability and probably the advantage of having a section like this in the Bill.  It is obvious that that was the approach to this problem made by Deputy Briscoe.  He certainly knew more about this section of the Bill than the Minister did, because when the Minister was questioned and asked what was the meaning of this section he merely told us that it was for the purpose of issuing licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="902" /> He was not able to indicate either whether there would be a limit.  No matter what the licence may cost, that is not the danger involved in this system of licensing.  The danger is that advantage may be taken of the existence of a licensing system to introduce restrictive regulations and that is what makes this Financial Resolution unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years prior to 1950, precautions such as those which the Minister seeks to implement by means of the Financial Resolution were suggested by the Public Health Committee of the Dublin Corporation. Some Deputies are worried at the prospect of having a system of licensing introduced.  I am not particular about licensing as such nor as to what the licensing fee is to be but definitely there should be some control of the work mentioned in this Resolution and in Section 53.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think you should drop the Resolution and in that connection I want to make a specific statement.  Deputy Dillon may not be aware, as I and other members of the Public Health Committee of the Dublin Corporation are, that a racket worse than any licensing racket was in operation some time ago and is perhaps in operation to-day.  I am sure the Deputy would be shocked to know that mattresses that were thrown on the Corporation tip heaps were recovered by certain individuals, sold to people engaged in mattress filling, enclosed in respectable covering and then sold to other unfortunate people as good mattresses&mdash;the worst possible carriers of disease without any disinfection whatever.  It is quite obvious that if the precautions outlined in the section, which the Financial Resolution seeks to implement, are not taken that that same racket will still go on.  Obviously where such vitally important materials as bedding and filling for mattresses are being handled, you must have supervision and the only way to get proper supervision is to have the premises in which the work is carried on registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not anticipate any racket in this <Col N="903" /> licensing system.  I was very amused at Deputy Dillon's statements.  He dealt with hides and skins and I was hoping he would go on to deal with dermatology, because the greater part of his remarks in regard to hides and skins had nothing to do with the Bill. However, I do not anticipate the racket that Deputy Dillon seems to fear.  I do not see how any trader engaged in the business to-day, either manufacturer or distributor, would be interfered with as a result of having to take out a licence or having to have State-registered premises in some form or other.  I know the provisions of the section and I know that there is a certain action which may be taken under the Public Health Act and Sanitary Acts, but the Minister has said that these provisions are necessary and I hold they are necessary.  I was chairman of the Public Health Committee who in the first instance reported to the Minister before 1950 that this racket of mattress filling from material taken from the corporation tip-heaps constituted a menace to public health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no difference between Deputy McCann and myself. I am quite prepared to say the only effective way of bringing filling material under control and avoiding contamination of mattresses is by registering and licensing premises.  All I am asking is that it should not be by way of a licence in respect of which a fee is payable, but it should be by way of free licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am afraid of is that a proviso put in here by the Department of Finance, for the purpose of making the licensing issue procedure self-supporting from the point of view of the Exchequer, will ultimately be used by the technique known to Deputy Dr. Browne as putting your toe in the door for other purposes hereafter. Once you have got the conduit pipe of a Financial Resolution through which you can pass the proceeds of any licensing fee, the vested interests will deliberately urge on the Minister to increase the licensing fee to a point which consolidates them in the enjoyment of a monopoly and makes it virtually certain that there can be no <Col N="904" /> new entrant to the trade.  For instance, the Deputy may know a rag and bone merchant in the city who may have two or three children helping him in the business.  One of these children may want to set up on his own.  All I want to provide is that if that one gets a store, puts it into proper condition and conducts his trade as well as his father conducted it, he will have the right to go to the Custom House and say: &ldquo;Here is my name and here is the address of my premises.  I want to register the premises and I want a licence to carry on the trade.&rdquo;  I want to provide that once these premises have been taken, he will get his licence, that thence-forward he will be free to trade and that the only circumstances in which he can lose that licence will be, if he is convicted of misfeasance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or by such gross negligence as would contaminate the material which he has on his premises, in violation of the rules laid down for everybody.  I think I am making a most reasonable request to the Minister on behalf of a defenceless section of the community.  I am quite certain that if the Minister were not in a somewhat irritated mood about this infernal Health Bill, he would waive this condition in regard to the payment of a fee and say: &ldquo;We shall give the licence without charging any fee simply on being satisfied that the character of the applicant is satisfactory and that his premises conforms to all the requirements.&rdquo;  That is all that is in it.</P>
      <P>The division is of those who insist on a fee and those who are against it. Surely most rational Deputies will feel with me that where you are dealing with a body of people, large or small, but in a humble way of business, what might seem to you and me a very trivial sum as fee is something that should not be exacted from them unless there is very good reason for it, when you bear in mind the technique of Deputy Dr. Browne of getting your toe inside the door and the danger inherent therein&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We shall discuss that on another occasion and I shall be an interested witness of the Deputy's gyrations on that.  I was going to end on a conciliatory note.  I was going to say that if the Minister's own rag were not out, he would probably meet us on this matter.  I suppose that when a man gets his rag out, reason is unseated and prejudice holds sway. Against such prejudice even the gods wage war in vain.  As I do not aspire to be numbered amongst the gods, I reconcile myself to the fact that the task I have undertaken may be impossible. I can assure the Minister that if he would show a readiness to meet the views of other Deputies in so trivial a matter as this, the effect of oiling the wheels of progress would be out of all proportion to the concession made.  Who is going to vote for the fee?  We are all prepared to agree to the licence.  There is nothing between us now but the fee and the half-open door which may be kicked down hereafter. I urge the Minister, without breaking his heart, to meet the view which would be good democratic practice in a deliberative Assembly not because he agrees with it himself but because he thinks he can operate the section without it.  Such a concession would in no way abridge the proficiency with which the necessary regulations would be operated.</P>

      <P>It seems that we are beginning to get some sort of unanimity on this Money Resolution. I am glad that the first submissions that were made, the objections to the actual inspection of premises and the safeguarding of public health in respect of flock and the different other materials that may be used for filling, have not been persisted in.  It seems also that the operation of this particular type of business by licence is not objected to.  There now only exists the small objection by Fine Gael on the question of the amount of the licence.</P>

      <P>Sorry, I meant to-night.  I do not see anything unusual in the payment of a fee.  As some Deputy pointed out, a hawker has got to pay a fee of 5/-.  The man who wants to earn a few coppers by paying a fiddle or a kettledrum has got to get permission and pay some sort of a small fee, if my memory serves me right.  Trade unions who want to operate as effectively as possible in this country have got to deposit £1,000.</P>

      <P>I must pay a tribute both to the Minister and Deputy Dillon&mdash;to the Minister for looking into the future as he may be accused of by Deputy Dillon, and to Deputy Dillon who discovered that he is looking into the future.  I cannot attribute any ulterior motive to the Minister with regard to the payment of a fee nor do I see there is any <Col N="907" /> intention on his part to create any type of monopoly whether in the rag trade or in the sawdust trade.  The only question I would like the Minister to answer is this.  Why is it necessary to have a second Money Resolution?  My experience in this House has been that the one Money Resolution does for any Bill of this kind which requires a Money Resolution but in this particular case there are three different Money Resolutions. What the reason for that is I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is simple. In the case of most of the other Bills money goes out from the Treasury. These Resolutions are to make the money flow in.  That is why we have two.  Deputy Corish strengthened the case I sought to make.  The auctioneers have a fee and a deposit.  Did Deputy Corish ever ask himself why? Did he ever try to become an auctioneer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I accepted the reason given by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Deputy Corish was a very much more cunning and sophisticated Deputy than that.  I know that the trade unions, when they fixed the fee at £1,000, were concerned merely to give an example of thrift and prudence but I wonder could it conceivably be true that the trade union movement desired to discourage the multiplication of trade unions?  Once there was a good, well-organised union catering for an easily recognisable section of the unemployed population, they required to be deposited a fee which would discourage irresponsibles from forming alternative unions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If they did that they were very wise.  With a trade union functioning efficiently for a recognised branch of working men it could become <Col N="908" /> a great evil if there were two unions catering for the same people started by every malcontent who took it into his head to do so.  But suppose the rag-pickers began to operate this technique and succeeded in kicking in the door.</P>

I am grateful to Deputy Corish for giving point to the case I am making.

      <P>Is it not so at the present time, that the sanitary inspector is charged with responsibility for inspecting other premises?  Does he not inspect at the present time the premises of rag-pickers and of rag and bone merchants in the City of Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is very little between us.  I venture to say that if every Deputy spoke according to his true belief he would agree with me that the levy of a fee in connection with the issue of this licence is an unnecessary and an undesirable thing. By all means, let the public health authorities say that the supervision associated with the licensing of registered premises is the only means of avoiding evil.  Let us have that, but why levy a fee?  I suggest that the common-sense view for a democratic Minister to take is to say: &ldquo;Take the fee away if you feel deeply about it.&rdquo; That is not going to alter the supervision of the premises.</P>
      <P>Should he not say: &ldquo;If you feel deeply about it, then I will drop the fee; let it go, and let all of us agree that there is appropriate machinery for carrying out the work of supervision&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>That was my attitude when I was on that side of the House.  That was how I met the Opposition when that kind of thing arose here.  I did that because I thought it was the right way to run Parliament.  If the Minister were prepared to do that now, in dealing with this Bill, he would find that things would go much more smoothly. Otherwise, I think that most reasonable Deputies will agree that the conduct of parliamentary business is going to become extremely difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are all really concerned about is the safeguarding of the public health.  I fail to see how the charging of a fee for a licence is going to do that.  I have had much the same experience as Deputy McCann. I have tried for nearly three years to check a practice that has been in operation in some places where these mattresses are dealt with.  There is no <Col N="910" /> proper supervision, and they are being dealt with in a most unhygienic way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that there were no registered premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The premises of rag and bone merchants are registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>If these things can be manufactured and bolstered up in places that are not registered, then I suggest they should be registered. I know certain places were they could be made up in a proper manner, but they are not taken to them by the people I have in mind.  I have seen those mattresses come from the most objectionable places.  They are never taken to the recognised up-to-date mattress makers by these people, but are fixed up in holes and corners. These latter are the places that I want to see registered.</P>
      <P>What I am at a loss to understand is how the charging of a fee is going to safeguard the public health.  The charging of a fee of 5/- or 10/- is not going to safeguard what Deputy McCann has referred to.  I agree with him that, from the health point of view, there is an urgent necessity for this thing to be done, but the charging of a fee is not going to accomplish it. I think it is a matter for the public health authority and for the inspector of factories to see that supervision is properly carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If, as Deputy Hickey has pointed out, the object of this is to have premises inspected, surely registration ought to be sufficient. There is a big difference between registration and the issue of a licence.  The issue of a licence gives powers which really are not needed when a person, in fact, only requires to register.  It appears to be agreed now, though it was not at the beginning, that a nominal fee only would be charged. The Minister, in an offhand way, mentioned at first that it might not exceed £2.  Suppose it comes down to 2/6 or 5/-, has the Minister seriously considered the argument that has been made by Deputy McCann, and would a fee of 2/6 or 5/- pay the cost of inspection which is normally carried <Col N="911" /> out by a sanitary inspector in the employment of the local authority?  He is paid in connection with his normal work as a sanitary inspector, and would be required to visit these premises in any case.  I do not believe that the Minister should ask for power to collect money from these people in the form of a fee.  I think that if he required them to register it would be sufficient, and would fulfil the requirements which he considers are desirable in connection with this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the case made by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Hickey.  I have full knowledge of the truth of the case that Deputy Dillon has made in connection with the hide society organisation and the fellmongers' association.  I had occasion, when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, to bring deputations to him protesting against the activities of those gentlemen when they got in under a device such as is now proposed in this case.  I agree about registration, but I do not agree with the charging of a fee.  If the fee starts at 5/- what I feel is that it will go to £5 or maybe £50, and so will be sufficient to exclude the ordinary person to the benefit of a few select people.</P>
      <P>In connection with this Resolution, what surprises me is that no provision is made to stop the sale of second hand clothing by regulation.  The position at the present time is that infected clothing can be sold any day on a public market by hawkers.  I think there should be some provision to stop that &mdash;that is if we are anxious, as we on this side of the House are, to safeguard the public health.  We cannot agree, however, that it is necessary to charge a fee.</P>

      <P>At the start this was a matter of no great importance.  It was first enacted in 1911.  The Flock Act was extended in 1947 to take in more than was provided for in the 1911 Act. It was then put in by the Coalition Government in the 1950 Bill.  That Bill appeared in print and was circuated to the House.

On everything that comes in, Deputy Dillon points out the racket, he seizes on everything and examines every measure to see where there may be a possible racket.

      <P>Deputy Dillon started the last night about rackets and he veered around to-day, when he thought he had gone a bit too far, and ended up by <Col N="916" /> pointing out that almost everybody here agreed with registration.  I am quite sure that if he reads his speech of last Thursday night he will see that registration would have the objections he made that night, that we can put certain people out of business.</P>

      <P>Surely he will agree&mdash; Deputy Rooney will agree, if he can see the point&mdash;that if I as Minister register premises I must have some way of withdrawing that registration, as the Deputy pointed out when he got a bit more sense towards the end of the discussion, if there is misconduct, let us say.  Therefore, I can do what Deputy Dillon said last Thursday night I would do, that is, operate a racket and put certain people out of business by saying they were guilty of misconduct.  However, as the discussion went on, he became more reasonable and in the end had practically everyone in this House agreeing with him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon started that talk about rackets and veered around until he got a good point, I admit, in the end, the point a sane person could argue, that it would be better not have the licence fee.  If the Deputy had started like that, instead of telling us about rackets, I must say I could listen to him with sympathy&mdash;I am not saying I would agree with him &mdash;but I dislike this thing, that every time the Deputy gets up he lowers this House and lowers the country, by pointing out to everyone listening to him that there is nothing but dishonesty in the Civil Service, in the Government and amongst traders everywhere, except amongst a few shopkeepers in the West of Ireland. They are the only people in this country who are honest according to Deputy Dillon.  Is it not better to drop all that sort of stuff the Deputy goes on with?</P>

Everybody in the country is dishonest, according to Deputy Dillon.  Does he believe that?</P>

      <P>The Coalition Government had some reasons for agreeing to this section.  That reason was that, in 1946, the Trade Union Congress passed a resolution asking that this matter be more closely dealt with or more carefully looked after.  As a result, consultations were held&mdash;I am not sure whether it was in my time or in my predecessor's time&mdash;between officers of the Department and&mdash;let us see who were consulted&mdash;the bedding and upholstering manufacturers and representatives of the retail furnishing trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were held with the bedding and upholstering manufacturers and representatives of the retail furnishing trade after the Trade Union Congress had made its request.  The Deputy now bows across the floor. Deputy Dillon thinks there is a racket in it.  That is the kind of mind the Deputy has&mdash;we did not go further than the trade.  God help the man who has that mind.  The Department wrote to the medical officer of health in each of the cities, to the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, the Irish Furniture Manufacturers' Association, the Irish Waste Trade Association, the National Amalgamated Furnishing Trade Association, the Amalgamated Union of Upholsterers of Britain and Ireland, the Irish Trade Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions.  Is there anybody else we should have written to that Deputy Dillon could suggest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose Deputy Dillon does, because he knows everything. They all agreed that there should be closer supervision in the trade; that there should be registration; that there should be inspection; that there should be control of these waste materials so that no manufactured article could leave the works unless it was guaranteed to contain clean materials.  None of them, so far as I know, suggested a licence, so that Deputy Dillon who, with his lovely clean mind, accuses the trade of looking for a licence but nothing else is wrong.  They looked for control of the business so that clean mattresses would be sent out but did not look for a licence.  So far as they are concerned, they had not seen the possibility of a racket as clearly as Deputy Dillon sees it or as quickly as he saw it.  He should advise these people where the rackets are to be found. These mattress manufacturers and waste trade people are too slow&mdash; Deputy Dillon could see miles ahead of them where a racket could be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> They will not see it until they are right up against it and they would need Deputy Dillon to advise them where the racket is.  He would be a good adviser for them because he can see it around a corner, as he always has seen it and, I suppose, always will.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMaguire" hpid="Dr. Maguire Dr. Maguire">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The idea is to make the regulations to deal with finished articles of upholstering, bedding, etc., bindings and covers to be dealt with also; standards of cleanliness to be prescribed and to regulate, if necessary&mdash;I do not know whether it will be necessary or not, but it appears to be proposed at any rate&mdash;the marking, branding or labelling of filling materials so that if anything is found wrong afterwards, they can be traced back to their source; and to provide that appropriate records be kept, and that the definition of &ldquo;filling material&rdquo; be widened to take in wood shavings, sawdust and straw.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what this simple Resolution is about.  As Deputy Dillon rightly surmised, it appeared so inoffensive and so trivial, if you like, to me that I did not examine the brief very carefully.  I thought that when the big Financial Resolution was taken, these things would go through automatically, and I was not as well briefed on this as I should be to enable me to stand the very severe cross-examination of Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Dillon, but I do not know why we should have spent hours on this Resolution.</P>

      <P>It is a mere extension of what has been the law since 1911 and it is a repetition of what was approved of by the members of the Coalition Government.  For that reason, I suppose, too, I did not think there would be any opposition, but I notice that most of the Coalition Ministers other <Col N="921" /> than Deputy Dr. Browne, disclaim all responsibility for what was done by their colleagues during the time they were Ministers, even though we are told that there is collective responsibility as between the members of the Government under the Constitution.</P>

      <P>This Financial Resolution asks that provision shall be made by statute for the making by the Minister for Health of regulations relating to radio-active substances.  It would have helped a great deal if the Minister had clarified the purpose for which the Financial Resolution is asked.

The <Col N="922" /> Minister merely introduced the Financial Resolution and left it at that.  As I happen to be a medical man, I shall try to indicate to the House what radio-active substances are, since the Minister has not chosen to do it.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, this is a new feature in the medical life of the country.  It is a new substance or a new drug.  Radio-active isotopes are used for diagnosis and treatment of certain blood diseases, cancer and other diseases.  The method of giving them is injection. They take the form of a liquid substance which is put into a syringe and injected into a human being.  They are also used by the veterinary profession. According to the Financial Resolution, certain charges are being imposed.  We are not very sure what these charges will be.  In dealing with radio-active substances, which will be used by doctors and veterinary surgeons, the Minister should have clarified the position.</P>
      <P>Legislation of this kind was passed in the British House of Commons recently.  It empowered the British Minister for Health to have control over these substances.  I take it that this Resolution and the subsequent legislation are for the same purpose here.  It should be borne in mind that when the Minister for Health in Britain acquired these powers of complete control over radio-active substances he handed it back to the Medical Research Council again to control them.  On behalf of this Party I would ask the Minister whether that is the Minister's intention or not.</P>
      <P>I may have a suspicious mind, but it seems to me in connection with all these Resolutions we are going the same old road.  Again may I quote Deputy Dr. Browne?&mdash;&ldquo;The door is open; he has got his foot inside it; they are kicking ahead.&rdquo;  It appears to me that the State will take control of these drugs.  These drugs take the form of vapours or fluids.  Radio-active substances are in the embryonic stage.  The majority of us do not know very much about them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It means X-ray apparatus, infra-red ray, ultra-violet ray.  Am I to take it that people who use these apparatus have to have a licence?  If a nursing home wants to buy an X-ray outfit they have to go to the Department of Health to get a licence.  Is that the case?  If they have to get a licence, we want to know what they will have to pay for it.  Has a nurse who is carrying on the business of a masseuse and who has to have electric equipment for the after-treatment of fractures, etc., to get a licence?  If she has, how much will she have to pay for the licence?  Will the Minister give us information on these points?  Perhaps it is a means of raising money.  Perhaps it is for the purpose of preventing people getting these apparatus for some reason or other.  I cannot fathom what is in the Minister's mind.  In any case, it seems <Col N="928" /> to me entirely wrong that a nursing home, a public hospital or other institution or a private person that wants to get the simplest apparatus, provided it is an irradiating apparatus of any sort, should have to go to the Minister for a licence.</P>
      <P>I make no apology for coming back to the point that in this Bill it is the old story of the State wanting to get control of everything.  That is really what it boils down to.  The freedom of the individual is gradually being taken away.  I can see no reason for all this. If the Minister can give us a reasonable guarantee that the right of the individual will not be interfered with we will withdraw our opposition.  It is only natural that we on this side of the House should be suspicious of this. Every Financial Resolution that comes along is for the purpose of prescribing a licence.  That removes the freedom of the individual.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party are against that.  If Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Cowan, Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll and the Fianna Fáil Party are for that, we are not.  As long as we are sent here by the people we will oppose that sort of thing.  We do not want to become units in this country.  We want to retain our independence as free individuals. We do not want to have to turn to the State for everything.  Private enterprise makes for the best in every individual and in every walk of life. That is the policy of Fine Gael.  We stand four square behind that.  If the Minister is prepared to delegate this to a responsible authority such as the Medical Research Council or an advisory body of scientists on the industrial side, we are prepared to withdraw our opposition.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is a question of doctors differing on this point because I am certain that Deputy Esmonde will agree with me when I say that when one considers a meteoric development associated with radio-active materials one must have some control in the administration.  After all, we have at present control in the administration of cortisone.  The same thing applies in connection with radio-active material.  When we consider that atomic development may result in such <Col N="929" /> advances that even Deputy Dillon may be a potential guinea pig, then for Deputy Dillon's safety we must ensure that the control of such atomic development must be of necessity under the supervision of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something about this Bill which engenders fury.  I heard Deputy Dr. Browne expressing indignation.  If he will exercise a little forbearance he will realise that there is force in the case made by Deputy Esmonde.  I do not suppose anybody in the House will contend that radio-active substances are to be used indiscriminately. It is a matter of which I have no technical knowledge and therefore I am probably the best legislator to deal with it.  The doctors go daft once you let them loose on a problem of this kind.  Having taken control of a dangerous substance by statute, some body like the Medical Research Council should have delegated to it the issue of licences to individual practitioners and the Minister should hand over that power holus-bolus and simply say: &ldquo;As Minister I will countersign any licence you desire to issue to a properly qualified person or institution for the purchase, acquisition or use of these materials.&rdquo;  If that proviso is made I do not think there would be very much fuss about this in so far as radio-active substances are concerned.  I think it is quite likely that is what the Minister intends to do and all he has to do is to say that that is his intention. That gets over that difficulty. But then we come on to irradiating apparatus and the provision and imposition of certain charges and it has been said very properly that this Financial Resolution is simply a tax, and nothing else.  To tell you the honest truth, I do not know why we should levy a tax on any nursing <Col N="930" /> home, hospital, dispensary doctor or other person who wants to buy some type of X-ray installation, portable or permanent.</P>

It may be argued, and possibly it is true, that the therapeutic value of many of these appliances is doubtful.  I do not know if that is so but I venture to say that <Col N="931" /> if I took all the doctors in this House and put them in a row I would get a different answer from each one of them.  I am sure however of one thing: there are a number of respectable citizens in this country who, if they have a crick in their necks, get a hot iron, put a piece of brown paper over the crick and iron it out.  There are others who, in similar circumstances prefer to buy an ultra-violet lamp. Some people when they get fibrositis put a bit of red flannel around the knee, but others like to buy an infra-red lamp and get their infra-red treatment not from self-radiation but from external radiation.</P>

      <P>Do I exaggerate?  Are not these the facts?  Is it reasonable for this House to bring in a Bill which prevents some harmless citizen who wants to buy apparatus of that kind from doing so?  Under this Bill one cannot in future go into Hodge's on the quay and quietly buy a lamp and carry it home pretending it is a new lamp for the drawing-room because one does not want to admit to the neighbours that one has begun to feel a twinge of rheumatism in one's shoulder.  In future you must go down to the Custom House and let them hear your shoulder creak and then they will very kindly issue a licence and you will pay your fee.  After that you can go to Hodge's, present your licence and the shop assistant will be satisfied that your shoulder has creaked with sufficient eloquence in the Custom House to qualify you for the purchase of a lamp, and you can then buy 5/11 worth of infra-red lamp.</P>

      <P>Do we really mean to provide that if anyone wants to buy some innocuous appliance of that kind the procedure of getting a licence <i>ad hoc</i> must be gone through.  I do not think any of us mean that.  I do not think the most wrong-headed physician in this House believes this is necessary.  I would be sorry to think that Dáil Éireann had reached a stage in which it just shrugs its shoulders and says: &ldquo;Oh, what the hell?  Why be worrying about trifles of that kind&rdquo;.  Does it not mean something to us that we can go about our lawful occasions without licences provided we put nobody else in jeopardy?</P>

      <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board are the authority responsible for the dredging of Balbriggan Harbour.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the board that the harbour was dredged in 1948 and that subsequent siltation was cleared by pump-dredging in 1951 and again in January and February, 1953.  If necessary, further dredging will be carried out later this year.  I understand from the board that their experience shows pump-dredging to be the most effective and economical method of removing siltation at Balbriggan Harbour.</P>
