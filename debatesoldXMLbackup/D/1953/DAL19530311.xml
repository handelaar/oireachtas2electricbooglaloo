      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether his attention has been drawn to a leading article in a Dublin evening newspaper of 27th February, 1953, which said that Robert Emmet's insurrection was a miserable affair, a tragic farce that was squashed in a few hours, and that he exerted no influence on the story of Ireland; and, if so, whether he will take steps, if necessary by the introduction of proposals for legislation, to prevent anti-national attacks such as this on Irish patriots.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the paper is the <i>Evening Mail,</i> which has a wide circulation mainly amongst our young people and can influence wrongly the minds of people in matters of this kind?  If steps cannot be taken, surely that paper should not receive Government support in the shape of advertisements?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of An Ceann Comhairle to answer Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairs in question were required to supplement existing stocks of gilded bentwood chairs which are held for use at official functions in the State apartments, Dublin Castle, and elsewhere. As it was desirable that the chairs should match, the Commissioners <Col N="6" /> of Public Works accepted the advice of their technical officers that the design and construction to be sought should be those of existing chairs.  Consideration was given to the question of obtaining alternative types of chairs for which Irish manufacturers could be asked to tender, and the commissioners were advised that the alternatives would not be as suitable for the specific purpose required and would be much more expensive.</P>
    <P>The cost of the chairs, which are of Polish origin, was approximately £2 17s. each inclusive of import duty; they were gilded in Dublin at a cost of £87, and the total cost of the 300 chairs was £940 2s.  6d.  A transaction of this nature would not be submitted to me in the ordinary course of business. As regards the last part of Question No. 13, I am, of course, aware of the quality of Irish manufactured furniture but, as I have already indicated, the question here was essentially one of suitability for a specific requirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it should be possible to get if not the actual chairs, something similar from some of the chair manufacturers in this country? What explanation can the officials of the Board of Works give for not asking the chair manufacturers all over the country to tender for the chairs and give them some opportunity to meet the requirements of the Board of Works?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This castle is in very good order, with central heating and every facility.  If it is left there it will be a burden on the ratepayers of the town, and it is from that point of view that I put down the question. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs promised us that he would take it over but he now says that it is not suitable. Why pay private landlords around the town big rents for various offices when all these Departments could be housed together&mdash;social welfare, unemployment insurance, and even the Guards? It would be relief to the ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on 23rd October, 1950, to a similar question asked by him.  In connection with these figures, I would like, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to correct any misapprehension which may have arisen as a result of a statement made by me on the Second Reading <Col N="10" /> of the Health Bill, 1952.  I stated that there are at present about 1,106 hospital beds for maternity patients.  I was asked by Deputy O'Higgins how many of these beds were reserved for unmarried mothers.  I told him correctly that I was not referring to such beds at all.  He then asked me if I was talking of public wards, and I replied in the affirmative.  What I meant to convey was that these were beds in hospitals as distinct from private maternity homes.  I may mention that some beds in hospitals are described as &ldquo;private&rdquo; beds because they are in single or two-bed wards, but in all the local authority hospitals, and to some extent in the voluntary hospitals, they are available when needed on medical grounds for the type of patient generally described as a public patient.</P>
      <P>I gave full information on all maternity accommodation available in reply to a series of parliamentary questions by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins which I answered in October last and I am sure the position in the matter was clear to the Deputy.  I merely mention it now in case it is not equally clear to other Deputies.</P>

      <P>The Corporation of Dublin and the Corporation of Cork are the only local authorities which, to my knowledge, have availed of the adoptive provision of Section 85 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907.  This provision empowers local authorities adopting it to regulate employment agencies catering for female domestic servants and is the only statutory provision enabling the <Col N="13" /> compulsory registration of these agencies.  Accordingly, the answer to (a) of the Deputy's question is that the only registered employment agencies operating in this country are in Dublin and Cork, where, I am informed, the numbers registered are 15 and 4 respectively.</P>
      <P>With regard to the grades of workers catered for, and the fees charged by these agencies, I am informed that they deal for the most part with domestic and hotel workers and to a lesser degree with nurses and teachers. I understand that in Dublin there is no registration fee for applicants who, however, are charged, when placed in employment, a fee of 10/- where the wage offered is under 30/- a week and a fee of 20/- where the wage offered exceeds 30/- a week; whilst in Cork the registration fee is 2/6 with an additional 7/6 for women and 10/- for men, upon placing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state (a) the date on which a decision was made to acquire a new Dublin sorting office; (b) whether, at this moment, a site has been agreed on; (c) when it is expected to have the acquisition of such site completed; (d) if any plans exist for the reconstruction of the proposed site, and if he can state, in connection with these plans, the approximate number of workers, skilled and unskilled, who will be employed on the work, and the duration of the work to completion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith (for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs)</NameTxt>
      <P>A new central sorting office for Dublin has long been recognised as desirable and various proposals for providing it on an existing departmental site have been under examination from time to time during the last 20 years.  Due to growth of postal traffic it became clear <Col N="29" /> in 1949 that none of these proposals offered a satisfactory solution and that some new site would be necessary.  A suitable clear site has been agreed on and the legal formalities in connection with its transfer to my Department will, I expect, be completed within a matter of weeks.  Building plans have not yet been decided upon and no estimate can yet be made of the number of workers to be employed or of the duration of the work.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the new fixed prices for butter and milk, he will direct that the profit which will be made out of the sale of New Zealand butter at the new price will be utilised towards reducing the milk prices in Cork City, where the greatest increase has been sanctioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>As already announced, the surplus of approximately £200,000 accruing on the sale, at the new prices fixed at the beginning of March, of butter imported in 1953, is being paid into the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund and will be applied in defraying the cost of cold storage of butter, which otherwise would have to be met by the taxpayers generally.</P>
      <P>I could not see any justification in principle for subsidising liquid milk prices as suggested by Deputy O'Higgins, nor would such a proposal be administratively practicable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, if that is the case why has it been found necessary to enter in the Book of Estimates for the year 1952/53 a sum of £162,000 for the payment of these expenses which the Minister now tells us are to be paid, over and above the £200,000 which it is proposed should be applied towards the cost of the cold storage of butter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Dairy Produce Act, 1924, creameries must pay for milk supplies strictly on the basis of the butter-fat content of the milk and do not, therefore, pay differential prices for the portions of their total milk intake which are used for the manufacture of butter or other dairy produce.  The statistics regarding creamery milk prices which are collected by my Department accordingly relate only to the average price paid each year by creameries for their total milk intake. The figures for the year 1952 will not be available for collection by my Department for some months' time, when creameries will have had their accounts for 1952 audited.</P>
      <P>The recent increase in the retail price of butter from 3/10 to 4/2 per lb. will, of course, enable creameries to pay higher prices for milk than heretofore. It is a matter for each creamery to determine what average price it can pay for milk, having regard to the various uses to which the milk supply generally is put, including butter-making, cream, liquid milk, chocolate crumb, etc., and on returns from other trading activities.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that it is, to say the least, disingenuous to ignore the fact, as it is generally understood, that the present price of creamery milk is 1/4 per gallon in the summer and 1/6 in the winter.  What is the relative price to be paid under the new butter price, or has the Minister any intentions in that regard?  Deputy Cogan has told us that he settled the milk strike on the basis of an equitable price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I said before the debate was adjourned that the members of the Labour Party would not have intervened a second time in this debate were it not for the necessity to refute the allegations made against the Party by members from the opposite side of the House.  Deputy Cowan suggested that our Party, in opposing the grant of an additional £250,000 to the National Stud, were motivated by anti-national spirit.  He suggested that we did not wish the Irish Stud to secure the best.  Nobody realises more than Deputy Cowan that the Labour Party have never taken second place to any Party in Ireland when matters of national importance or national interest were at stake.  We intend to continue that record.  On this Bill or on any other Bill we will never take a line that in our opinion is contrary to the national interest.</P>
      <P>I suggest that if Tulyar were owned outside this country, in the United States of America, in France or in Britain, he would do as much for the prestige of this country, because of his birth here, as he will do if he is kept in this country.  From that point of view alone, Deputy Cowan's suggestions are absurd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of what Tulyar will gain for this country is a matter on which any Party can differ in opinion from the Government or from the <Col N="42" /> National Stud Board without laying itself open to the charge of being anti-national in outlook.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan suggested that in proposing to vote against the Money Resolution we were not good socialists. In view of the fact that the National Stud is a State controlled body, which does not cater for private interests, Deputy Cowan suggested that the Labour Party, as such, are bound to vote for it.  That is just as absurd as his other suggestion that we are anti-national. Deputy Cowan would appear to be thinking along the line that the Labour Party should vote for a proposal to give television sets or wireless sets to all people because the Post Office is State controlled.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party's objection to this Money Resolution is not based on any &ldquo;ism.&rdquo;  We say that the time when the country is taxed to the hilt, when there is unemployment, when subsidies have been removed from essential commodities, is not the time when the Government should agree to increase the capital of the National Stud so that they may purchase a racehorse, even one as famous as Tulyar is.  When there are people unemployed, when people are pouring out of the country seeking work, the country cannot indulge in the luxury of buying a Tulyar.  Therefore, the Labour Party are opposing this proposal with all the resources at their command.  We feel it our duty to oppose any suggestion to spend money other than in a way that will give a direct and speedy solution to the unemployment problem and that will help to reduce the heavy cost of essential foodstuffs due to the removal of the subsidies.</P>
    <P>Austerity and the buying of a luxury horse do not go hand in hand.  We are determined owing to the opportunity given us by this proposal that we will in the name of the people express the resentment that has been conveyed to us by those whom we represent.  I can say, interpreting the views and the wishes of the people who elected me in the Waterford constituency, that they are to a man and a woman opposed to this proposal and that they feel it is a slight <Col N="43" /> on this nation that it should be considered at this time.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Justice, speaking at Roscommon some few days ago, stated that this money was not being used to purchase Tulyar, that it was being used to increase the capital of the National Stud.  To my mind, that is saying the same thing that we have been saying in different words.  It has been suggested that this is a capital charge and that there is a prospect&mdash;I hope there is&mdash;of not losing any money put into it entirely, or even of showing a profit over a long term of years, and, therefore, it is not a case of using money that could otherwise be used for the immediate relief of unemployment.  I suggest that the people know what is being done and resent what is being done while the country is in such a state.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe that the money spent on the purchase of such a stallion by the National Stud will not improve the breeding of animals owned by the ordinary small farmer and we feel that we are justified in our opposition to it.  If we were satisfied that this money was being used in the interests of the farming community as a whole, who are working people like the people we represent, we would agree even in the exceptional circumstances. We are satisfied, however, that the purchase of this horse will, in the main, be in the interests of a very small section of the people.  I suggest that the people who represent the ascendancy party in this country will get the main advantage from it. Because of these things, because of the chronic state of unemployment, because of the heavy taxation and, above all, because we wish to show where the Labour Party stand, the Labour Party have decided to vote against this proposal and, as far as we can, we will expose all attempts to push this over as something which is being done in the national interest.</P>

      <P>I understand that some Deputies, with a malevolent interest in my welfare, were anxious to know what my views were on this motion. Unfortunately, I was present at a <Col N="44" /> meeting when the Second Stage of the Bill was taken and, as the debate concluded rather abruptly, I was not therefore permitted to participate in the debate.  I am, however, leaving no doubt as to what are my views on the matter.  They are precisely the same views as were expressed by the Labour Party and I propose to give the reasons why I hold these views which are in complete accord with the views expressed by the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>We cannot consider the purchase of this racehorse apart from the background surrounding the purchase and the circumstances of the nation at the time of the purchase and apart from other vital problems which cry out to-day for a speedy solution.  We have in this small country of ours an unemployment problem proportionately worse than is to be found in any country in Western Europe to-day.  We have here an unemployment problem represented by having 13 per cent of our insured workers idle.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of doing that, nor have I the time available to discuss the question of unemployment or the question of high prices, but I submit that I am entitled to make a passing reference to them at a time when we have 90,000 people unemployed, when prices are higher than at any time in living memory, and when Irish people are going to Great Britain at a faster rate than was ever known before, and to say that this is not a time for this House to be asked to spend £250,000 in the purchase of this racehorse.  That is all I propose to do.  I propose to come to the merits of the purchase, but these are the cold, cruel facts which the Minister, travelling the main roads of the country, may not know are causing concern to men and women up and down the country, in the cities, in the towns, and in the rural areas.</P>
      <P>I put this to the Minister.  If he has been at any meetings recently and has not been shielded from the indignation of the people, he must know that there are widespread complaints against the burning economic evils of unemployment, high prices and mass emigration. It is in circumstances like that, and against that background, that this House is being asked to vote £250,000 for the purchase of a racehorse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A few months ago we were told that this country is living beyond its means, that it is eating too much, consuming too much and wearing too much clothes.  We were told that we could not afford that standard of living.  We were told that the necessary correctives for that situation were an austerity Budget and a hair-shirt economic policy.  At the same time as we are being told that, the Minister for Agriculture is sent in here with a green Bill to deceive green people and the House is asked to vote £250,000 to buy a racehorse.  I do not know how the Minister can reconcile talk about our financial position, described by the Minister for Finance as serious to the point of desperation, and the homilies from Ministers every week warning the country of the grave economic crisis with which it is confronted with this proposed purchase.  It is in a welter of despair and bleakness that the Minister for Agriculture comes in here and asks us for £250,000 to buy a racehorse.</P>
      <P>The question as to whether this is a good investment has been posed in the course of this debate.  I do not know that anybody here is qualified to express an opinion, not even the Minister, as to whether this is a good investment.  Nobody knows what this horse, untried at the stud, will do in the years to come.  I think Deputy Briscoe was quite right and very candid when he said: &ldquo;This is in the nature of a gamble.&rdquo;  We do not know what this sire's progeny will be like. Nobody can say with any certainty whether his progeny will or will not be a success.  Its progeny will certainly be remarkable if they fetch prices comparable to the animal itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> We are being asked to pay £250,000 for this horse.  Let us ponder well upon the fact that this horse is, after all, the progeny of a mare and a stallion the total cost of which was about £4,000.  The parents of this animal cost between them £4,000.  It is their progeny that is being offered to us at £250,000.  In a paper the other day I saw a statement by somebody with a flair for horseflesh.  He ascertained the weight of this animal and, having ascertained the weight, he converted the animal into gold and he discovered that this small country with the grim future indicated by the Government has literally bought this racehorse for its weight in gold.  We have, in other words, asked the owner of the horse to weigh it and told him that we will give him its weight in gold.  That is what we are doing and we are doing that at a time when our people cannot pay their way, when our people are flying to Britain faster than they ever did in the past and when every employment exchange is a living picture of misery.  This is the time when we decide to buy a racehorse for its weight in gold.</P>
    <P>Imagine the way the welkin would ring had the inter-Party Government done this.  The Fianna Fáil propagandists would have turned out at every chapel gate on Sunday morning and the people would have been told the crime the Government proposed to commit against the nation in buying a racehorse for its weight in gold.  That is exactly what the Fianna Fáil Government is doing now and it has selected the worst possible time, according to its own members, in the economic position of our country to engage in this recklessly extravagant experiment.</P>
    <P>Simple minded Deputies have affirmed here that this is a bargain.  I hope we do not fall for any more bargains of that kind&mdash;£250,000 for a racehorse&mdash;because if we do there will be more and heavier blisters on the backs of our people in a very short time.  We have a situation here in which other countries interested in horseflesh and in the bloodstock industry could probably have bought this animal and would have infinitely <Col N="48" /> greater resources for paying for it than we have.</P>
    <P>The United States of America has lent thousands of millions of pounds and given free grants of thousands of millions of pounds to various countries in Europe but the United States stopped short at buying this animal at the price we are proposing to pay for it.  If it be alleged that somebody in America offered a price higher than we are paying I would like to have the identity of that person established.  I would like to know why that transaction did not go through.  Some interesting stories might be told at that level if people probed the matter a little further.  The truth of the matter is that there was obviously nobody in the market willing to pay this price. We developed a fetish in connection with the purchase of this animal at £250,000 and our people are being asked to pay for it at a time when they are being told they are eating too much, wearing clothes of too good quality and a hair-shirt austerity Budget is necessary to bring them back to the realities of a situation in which the Government proposes to purchase a racehorse for its weight in gold.</P>
    <P>I wonder have we lost all sense of human values when we go into the market and pay £250,000 for a racehorse. If we want to sell ourselves to the world as the most simple people in it, we seem to be making pretty substantial progress in that direction because paying £250,000 for an animal in the circumstances in which the Government says the country is to-day is in my view taking leave of our senses.  If the Government or the Directors of the National Stud want to invest some money in humanity they can begin to do that with their own employees down at Tully in the County Kildare. They might take a look at the wage rates paid by the National Stud&mdash;the National Stud that proposes to buy this racehorse for its weight in gold&mdash; and they might see whether there is not a distorted sense of human values in paying £250,000 for a racehorse while maintaining the standard of wages in force at present in the National Stud. If there is to be any extravagance let us be sure first of all that we are being <Col N="49" /> fair, humane and prudent with the staff employed in the National Stud.</P>
    <P>I wonder what the House or the people would think of an individual who, while not able to provide for his children, not able to ensure that they got work, not able to ensure that they had a decent standard of living, not able or unwilling to pay his bills, nevertheless decided that he would buy the fastest motor car in the world.  I think a very low valuation would be placed on that individual if he presented himself for public examination.  But that is precisely the position of this Government to-day.  It cannot provide for its 90,000 unemployed.  It cannot ensure that people will get the bare necessaries of life.  It will not pay its debts to lowly-paid civil servants who have secured an award from an arbitration board.  The Minister for Education will not admit to the teachers their entitlement to an increase in wages to compensate them for increased prices. Although the Government defaults on all these fronts the Minister for Agriculture comes in and says: &ldquo;Give me £250,000 to buy one racehorse.&rdquo;  That caps a previous decision to spend £500,000 of the same people's money in running an air service between this country and America.  An air service is of no interest whatever to 99.9 per cent. of the people who will never be able to afford the luxury of paying high rates for travelling on a transatlantic service.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to consider the purchase of this animal strictly on its mathematical merits, if there be any mathematical merits in the purchase. You have to consider this whole question with the background against which we are being asked to pay the money.  The Government tells us the country is in a most unhealthy state economically.  This Government is responsible for creating an all-time record in respect of high prices and an economic disorganisation which shows itself in 90,000 unemployed people.  We have now reached the stage under this Government at which the Celt is leaving the country faster than he ever went before.  This Government tells us it has no money for this, that or the other worth-while scheme.  In the <Col N="50" /> midst of that welter of despair, the Minister for Agriculture says: &ldquo;Forget about that, why not let us have a little gamble on this horse with £250,000&rdquo; without evidence that it is worth £250,000, without any recommendation to this House that it is worth anything like that figure.  That unpredictable step is taken at a time when the Government is preaching to everybody in the country the necessity for cutting down on the present standard of living.</P>
    <P>Whatever view we might take of this matter in other circumstances in which the country was enjoying a higher standard of living and a larger measure of prosperity than that which exists to-day, in present circumstances, we in this Party, at all events, are opposed to the nation's money being used in this way because we think it is a lop-sided and distorted conception of economic and human values.  The purchase of this racehorse has been recommended by some Deputies on the Government Benches with a boastful and bragging reference to purchasing horseflesh.  I would be much more interested if we were boasting our achievements in elevating human beings to a higher standard of dignity than they have to-day and in doing something to rescue the 90,000 unemployed people from the plight which they are enduring to-day and from the grimmer plight which awaits them if even half of what the Government Ministers say is likely to happen takes place.</P>
    <P>There are much more urgent problems to be undertaken than running a transatlantic service and buying one horse for £250,000.  There are human problems encompassing human misery, involving human sacrifice, and involving an invasion of the standard of living of our people.  These call out for urgent solution and instead of concentrating their endeavours on relieving the problems which encompass so much misery this Government engages in the reckless task of buying a racehorse, doing something which, as Deputy Briscoe said, is just a gamble, and a gamble which may turn out to be a very considerable loss for the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Government would have been <Col N="51" /> well advised to tell the directors of the National Stud, if they initiated the move to buy the horse, the present was not considered to be an opportune time to engage in this reckless expenditure. At the same time as the Government was pleading it could not pay its debts in other directions and had no money to put the 90,000 unemployed people into employment, this purchase was proposed.  It is because I think it represents a completely distorted sense of values and a complete abandonment of all prudence in governmental and economic matters that I am opposed to the expenditure of £250,000 on this animal, so long as there are many human problems to be dealt with in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been discussing this money Resolution now for about five hours and with the exception of one or two references to the purpose for which the Bill was introduced, the discussion has centred around the purchase of Tulyar.  There has been a lot of confused talk.  The purpose for which this money is being sought by the directors is not merely to buy a sire for the stud but also to buy mares, carry out necessary repairs there and a number of other things.  It is a question whether the House is prepared to extend the capital of the company or not.  It is not a question whether they should buy more mares or not.  All the talk that has been going on here for the past two or three days centred around the one purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what is the purpose of setting up this stud.  Away back in 1946 the Government of the day decided that it was in the interests of the country to take over this stud to carry it on as a National Stud, to develop and foster the bloodstock industry.  For that purpose a sum of £250,000 was voted as capital.  Having regard to the devaluation of the £ even since then, the higher prices for bloodstock&mdash;because it was necessary for the directors of the National Stud if they were to make a success of the venture to acquire at least reasonably good mares and reasonably good sires &mdash;they succeeded in getting a number <Col N="52" /> of mares but not a sufficient number for the size of the stud.  They set out to get some sire horses and succeeded in getting reasonably good horses, and one exceptionally good horse, Royal Charger.  He was a short distance horse and for the past two or three years they have been on the look-out for a long distance horse.  As a matter of fact the directors have already gone to Britain, to France and to Italy for that purpose.  They have been looking for this horse since 1951 and at any time that it was possible for them to get the horse it would have been necessary for me to come into this House to ask for additional capital for the stud.</P>
    <P>Some months ago a rumour was circulated not merely here but also in Britain that the Aga Khan was prepared to sell Tulyar.  He had won the Derby and many other races.  Three other winners of the Derby were sold to America.  The directors of the National Stud considered that this was the ideal type of horse for them. He was what they were looking for, a long distance horse with staying power, blood, and so forth.  We have a number of horses in the country that could be regarded as being high-priced.  The Phoenix, for instance, is syndicated here and a number of other horses, at prices ranging from £150,000 to £180,000.  It is the belief of the directors and many other people in the country that there is no comparison between Tulyar and the horses that are already at the stud in this country.</P>
    <P>His performances on racecourses indicate that he has been one of the outstanding horses produced in the present century.  We do not know how successful he may be at the stud but we can only hope for the best.  That is all that can be done in any event with any horse purchased for the Stud, but we do know that he has all the qualifications to command a high price. He has broken all records in winning stakes.  He was the best three-year-old in 1952.  It is my belief that this is a good investment from the point of view that I regard the progeny of Tulyar as being worth at least 2,000 guineas per head more than the progeny of any horse at stud in Ireland to-day. <Col N="53" /> Whether, as yearlings, they are sent to the sales at Ballsbridge, Doncaster or Newmarket, I believe that they will be capable of bringing in, on the average, 2,000 guineas more than the progeny of any other horse.  If we take it that the allocation of nominations will be on the same basis as in the case of Royal Charger&mdash;in his case 25 per cent. of the mares were selected and the other 75 were balloted for&mdash;it would give us 30 yearlings a year in this country.</P>

      <P>No better chance.  It depends on the nominations in that case.  This Bill as I have said provides for an extension of the capital of the National Stud.  Even if Tulyar were out of the question, it is necessary I think for the directors to get a staying sire.  They have been trying unsuccessfully for a number of years to get a sire of this type.  If the Government in the morning went into the market for a French horse, the possibilities are that they would have to pay about £200,000 for one.</P>

      <P>The value of the bloodstock industry to this country is very considerable.  Our export trade in horses alone is value for over £3,000,000.  We can enhance that value and at the same time enhance national prestige which has been, and which continues to be, high.  Our reputation did not start in the last few years.  It has been there I might say for the past half century.  We started off with troopers, cavalry horses, in every army in Europe.  Similarly this country was noted for producing high-class hunters which we sent across to Britain.  The small farmer who bred a hunter, worked it for a couple of years and hunted it perhaps for a year and then sold it, regarded it as an asset to his farm.  Our chasers have won world renown because of the number of successes of Irish-bred horses in the chief 'chasing event of the world, the Grand National.  In the past 50 years more than 50 per cent. of the winners of that race were Irish-bred horses.</P>

The reason why we have been so lucky in that respect is that we have all the elements necessary for producing good horses in that we have the climate, we have the soil and our people have the skill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In lines 21 and 22, to delete &ldquo;five hundred thousand&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two hundred and sixty thousand&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the course of the debate the Minister made several efforts to put two fingers in the eyes of the Irish people. On more than one occasion he has said that he does not know what this money would be used for.  He has admitted in reply to questions by Deputies that he has not the foggiest idea what the directors of the stud will do with the money.  He has tried to suggest that there is no relationship at all between the provision of £250,000 for the stud and the purchase of this racehorse. For a piece of political impudence that takes some beating.  It is based on the assumption that the ordinary people are unable to appreciate facts.</P>
      <P>No matter what the Minister may say, everybody knows that the addition to the capital of the stud is for the purpose of purchasing this horse. As we have stated repeatedly, we believe that this is not the time for expenditure of so large a sum upon the National Stud.  There has been a great deal of talk about prestige and how important it is that the prestige of the bloodstock industry should be boosted and, as has been so well described by Deputy Norton, a great deal of idle boasting about the importance of purchasing this particular horse.  There has been a suggestion that we got away with something, that we beat the Americans, that we got a bargain.  Only the most juvenile delinquent type of mind will accept that argument.</P>
      <P>The fact is that we are paying what is probably the highest price that has ever been paid in sterling for a racehorse. The Minister is being dishonest, to say the least of it, when he tries to get the Dáil or any member of the Dáil to accept that he has no particular knowledge as to the intentions of the directors of the National Stud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is the case, in law, that the directors of the National Stud have no <Col N="62" /> responsibility as to how they spend the moneys provided by this Dáil, the sooner a change is brought about in that respect the better because there is something fundamentally wrong with that.  We as a Parliament are being asked to vote moneys which must come out of the people's pockets, no matter what may be said to the contrary, and if that money is to be provided for any group, whether they be State-appointed or not, we certainly should have the right to question the manner of expenditure.  The Minister has tried to establish that we have no such right.  We of the Labour Party do not accept that.  We insist upon questioning this and every similar matter which is brought before us.</P>
    <P>Is the National Stud in need of improvement?  We all assume that it is.  We assume that certain steps and certain expenditures are necessary from time to time for the improvement of the National Stud but, at a time such as this, when it is found impossible to give people increased wages to enable them to live, we of the Labour Party say that £250,000 is totally disproportionate to the importance of the stud to the country.  The expenditure of that amount shows no sense of proportion whatsoever.</P>
    <P>We have based our approach to this matter on the facts.  The country is completely opposed to the idea of spending so large a sum upon a horse. It is quite understandable that horse-breeding enthusiasts will make a case for this expenditure.  Persons who are interested in horsebreeding for any reason whatever will try to justify it. I am quite prepared to accept that to some people the purchase of this horse is far more important than the creation of employment-giving schemes.  As far as we are concerned, we do not believe that so large a sum should be spent at this time on this project when there is such great need for expenditure of such amounts in other directions.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the similarity between the National Stud and Bord na Móna.  The only thing they have in common is turf.  Bord na Móna. which employs between 10,000 and 15,000 men at reasonable wages, is being compared by a responsible <Col N="63" /> Minister with the National Stud, which employs, in Tully at any rate, no more than a handful of people and does not over-endow them when it comes to pay-day at the end of the week.  That shows the lengths to which this Government are prepared to go to justify this.  Of course everybody knows that the Government now realise that they have made a mistake in regard to this matter but that it is too late to turn back.  Some of their most loyal supporters are critical of the Government because of the proposal to spend this money.  The Minister tried to make the case that the progeny of this animal will be of immense benefit to the country because he anticipates that they will be sold at £1,000 or £2,000 at least more than the progeny of any other sire.  What guarantee have we that he will produce any at all?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the case that the sum by which the Government propose to expand the capital of the National Stud is excessive.  We believe that the sum of £10,000 which we have suggested should be sufficient at this time to enable the National Stud to carry on.  I do not accept the view that there is any comparison between the bloodstock industry and its importance for the country and a project such as Bord na Móna.  The Labour Party have been criticised on the score that their function should be to support anything which is put forward by a Government board.  Of course that kind of specious and foolish argument convinces nobody.  As far as the Labour Party are concerned, we have been and will be prepared to examine any project on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will somebody explain what benefit will be bestowed on the agricultural community by the purchase of this horse?  Surely it is not suggested that the ordinary working farmer will benefit to any degree by its purchase? Is it not a fact that if there is any <Col N="64" /> benefit, which is highly problematical, that benefit will be confined to a very minute fraction of the people, those who are directly engaged or interested in the bloodstock industry?  It cannot be suggested that, of all sections of the people, these people are most in need of being helped.  I think the reverse is the case.  Is it not true that persons who can afford to engage in bloodstock production are fairly well looked after already without the Government coming to their aid?  If there is a need for bringing this exile of ours home&mdash;incidentally, the only thing we have not done is play &ldquo;Come Back to Erin&rdquo; for him&mdash;why must the ordinary people be called upon to fill that need?  Is there not sufficient money in the bloodstock industry to raise £250,000 to bring this horse back?  Surely it is most unjust to force the people against their will to meet the bill?</P>
    <P>We have been told that this is the repatriation of an external asset.  That is another attempt on the part of the Government to wrap the green flag round them.  When in doubt, wrap the green flag round you&mdash;that seems to be the principle of the Fianna Fáil Party. We believe, however, that there are interests in this country who are very closely bound up with the bloodstock industry, who live by it and who regard it as a very important industry sufficiently strong financially to buy several Tulyars without calling on Dáil Éireann to provide the money.  In the last analysis, is it not the case that if any benefit does come from the purchase of this horse, assuming that he does some good, the people to whom I referred, the people who control and run the bloodstock industry, and who would be financially able, at least as a syndicate, to purchase this horse even at £250,000 will be the principal beneficiaries of this deal?  Can anybody suggest that this is a fair and honest way of dealing with the people of Ireland?  We have referred&mdash;I do not think it can be mentioned too often&mdash; to more urgent problems which need attention and to the background in which this deal was carried out, with unemployment rampant and getting worse every week.</P>

      <P>We are still waiting for a lot of information which has not been provided.  We are still waiting to be told what is the position with regard to insurance.  I do not suppose we will ever be told.  We should like to know what is happening so far as the policy of the National Stud is concerned. Is it proposed in the near future, as is rumoured, to sell Royal Charger at a high price?  Perhaps the Minister will give us some information as to that.  If that is proposed, should it not be possible by internal management of the National Stud to refrain from making this exorbitant demand on the taxpayers at this time?  If there is such a proposal, who are the people to whom it is proposed to sell that horse?  I want some information on these points.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that Irish horses have been our best ambassadors abroad.  It is a matter of one's perspective and point of view.  The Minister obviously holds the point of view that horses are more important than human beings.  We take the view that it is more important to create employment than to increase even the prestige of the Irish bloodstock industry.  It is for that reason we put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not the time at which to propose such a heavy expenditure on the improvement of the National Stud. The Minister tried to make the case that this additional capital is required for the improvement of the National <Col N="66" /> Stud.  If there must be some improvement, by all means spend £10,000 on it.  A good deal can be done with that amount.  It might even be possible to purchase for less than £10,000 a sire that might prove more productive in every sense than the one we are proposing to purchase now.</P>
    <P>The Government is displaying a lamentable and unique irresponsibility. The Government is displaying a lack of responsibility in their approach to the people in this matter.  They do not seem to appreciate what the people are thinking.  This proposition has been met with amazement throughout the length and breadth of the country.  The people are asking: &ldquo;Is the Government mad?&rdquo; I am sure the members of the Minister's own Party know that as well as I do.</P>
    <P>Even at this late hour let us have some common sense.  Let the Minister display some sense of responsibility.  He should admit that this money is for the purchase of Tulyar.  He should not endeavour to make futile and foolish attempts to hide that fact.  That is the purpose for which this money is required.  I hold that the sum should be reduced to £10,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the debate was going on too long.  What sort of outlook has the Minister on this question? Does he think it is unimportant? We regard it as of paramount importance. We regard £250,000 as an expenditure holding great potentialities if applied in the right direction for the relief of hardship.  If the House agrees to this expansion of capital, it is simply ignoring the rights and the needs of the great mass of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dunne has tabled an amendment that the sum of money to be voted for the National Stud should be reduced by £240,000.  He talked about Tulyar.  He would have been more honest had he said he was not prepared to give any money to the National Stud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For almost two years the directors of the National Stud have been looking for a suitable sire and, irrespective of who was Minister for Agriculture, when a suitable sire appeared on the market <Col N="67" /> the capital of the National Stud would have had to be increased for the purchase of a suitable sire.  Last year the directors decided to purchase a mare. She cost £11,500.  Even the £10,000 expansion that Deputy Dunne would be prepared to support would not be sufficient to purchase that mare.  I do not think it would be sufficient to carry out the repairs and extensions needed in the Tully Stud at the present time.  We must now provide the capital to purchase a suitable sire.  It would be better to say we should not purchase one at all rather than put down an amendment such as this.  It would be more honest to say we do not want any expansion of the National Stud.</P>

      <P>There is no sire for sale here of the type needed by the National Stud and the directors have had to go abroad.  They went to Britain and to the Continent.  They have now succeeded in getting a suitable sire.  When Tulyar came on the market they were determined to purchase him simply because it was good business and not because he was Irish bred or for the purpose of repatriating him.  The directors of the National Stud are good businessmen.  It is because they are good businessmen in their particular line that they were appointed as directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> I believe this investment is a good one.  The progeny of this sire will be very valuable.  There is no reason to think the progeny will not be very valuable having regard to his performance on the racecourse, his breeding and his qualifications.  He has the distance and that is exactly what the directors have been looking for&mdash;a long distance horse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne referred to rumours in connection with Royal Charger. The sale of Royal Charger is a matter for the directors since they are charged with responsibility for running the National Stud.  If at any time we feel the directors are not doing their duty in the best interests of the nation it will be our task to get rid of them.  They were placed in charge of the National Stud because of their ability and because they were men well qualified to carry out their duties.  We must, therefore, regard this proposition as a good business proposition on their part.  When the request was made to me that I should go to the Government for an extension of their capital I had no hesitation in doing so. It is wrong for Deputy Dunne or any other Deputy to compare this investment with something with which there can be no comparison at all.  This has no relationship to any other project. The bloodstock industry must be regarded as being a valuable industry to the country.  It is an industry that can be extended and, in my opinion, will be extended by the acquisition of this horse.  If yearlings from the Tully Stud go to Ballsbridge, I believe that apart altogether from people being interested in this animal, the fact of these yearlings being in the catalogue and being offered at the sales, will be a good advertisement for the sales and will encourage people to come.  If people interested in Tulyar come from America and other countries and do not buy the progeny of Tulyar, they may buy something else.  In that way this may prove a very good investment by inducing people to come across to attend the sales and buy the yearlings that are on offer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne has mentioned insurance. All these matters are the responsibility of the directors.  We must have <Col N="69" /> had confidence in them when they were appointed and the Coalition Government must have had confidence in them because there were no changes made during their term of office.  They have been there since 1946 and their investments over that period have been good.  For instance, they purchased Royal Charger.  He had a good record and it is believed that he is worth considerably more now than the £52,000 paid for him five or six years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He is worth more than twice that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That was a good investment and a good business transaction not merely from the point of view of his enhanced value but from the point of view of his progeny, the good-class horses he has produced.  This year I think he is second in the list of winning sires in Britain and he is first in the list of winning sires at home.  There is no reason to think that the purchase of Tulyar will not have as successful a result as the purchase of Royal Charger.  I know every Deputy in this House, irrespective of what action he took regarding the expansion of the capital, would wish that Tulyar would be as successful at the stud as Royal Charger has proved to be.</P>
      <P>My offering the National Stud the sum of £10,000 as increased capital would be no use.  It would not meet their requirements.  They must purchase a sire and, as I pointed out in concluding the debate on the Money Resolution, there is no sire of the desired type to be had for anything like £50,000 or £60,000.  Those days are gone.  A reputable sire with any record on the course to-day is costing anything between £150,000 and £200,000. There is no use in making all this noise and fuss about Tulyar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that we have been bluffed into buying this horse. There has been no bluff.  Other people are just as interested in its purchase as we are.  On the conclusion of the debate on the Second Reading I quoted an article in an American magazine that deals with the bloodstock industry in America.  It was stated there that <Col N="70" /> a syndicate was being formed.  There is no doubt that we could have syndicates formed even in this country but then the purpose we have in mind would not be served because any sire syndicated in this country would get the best mares at the fee at which he is quoted.  It could happen that if a private individual owned Tulyar he might not get more than four or five Irish mares and that we would have mares coming from France, from America and from Britain.</P>
    <P>In our case, as has happened with Royal Charger, a number of mares is selected.  These may be regarded as the best mares that can be found. There will be many applications for him and the directors will have the right of selecting the mares.  In the case of Royal Charger 25 per cent. were selected.  Possibly there will be a big number of applications for nominations and what has been done as regards Royal Charger will probably be done with Tulyar, that is, there will be a ballot for them.  I do not know whether there is any suggested change but I take it the procedure will be the same as obtained with Royal Charger.</P>
    <P>When the National Stud sought the increase in capital, the Government decided that they would increase the capital by £250,000, bringing it up to £500,000.  As I pointed out already, it is the intention of the National Stud, first of all, to buy Tulyar and then to increase the number of mares at the National Stud, possibly to carry out schemes of repairs and extensions and whatever else needs to be done.  If the purchase of Tulyar is to be completed, it is urgently necessary to have this Bill passed by the House.  There is no use in Deputies criticising the Government because they are increasing the capital for the purpose of buying a horse.  It is part and parcel of the business of the National Stud to get the best.  If the Government is to finance a National Stud I believe that stud should be the best.  Why should we spend money on mediocre sires and on mediocre mares?  We have enough of them in the country already. If we intend to retain the National Stud let us put the best material we can obtain into it.  We have at the <Col N="71" /> present time at the National Stud as good mares as can be found in the country.  It is our duty to put in sires equal to, if not better than, the sires we have been sending there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two points to bring to the Minister's attention.  I have heard, whether it is true or not, that there is a full brother of Tulyar running as a two-year-old this year. The Minister would be well advised to check on that because it might have a deleterious effect in regard to Tulyar. Apart from that, I want the Minister to put the country's mind at ease in connection with the informed, misinformed and allegedly inspired information that some British papers are publishing in connection with what Tulyar's career may be for next year. Certain suggestions have been made by responsible members of the Opposition to the Minister that he should at least, when this capital extension has been granted, indicate to the directors of the National Stud that we felt that Tulyar would not enhance his value by further running this year.  I should be grateful if the Minister would put our minds at ease with regard to certain information which appeared in the English daily papers purporting to set out the full racing campaign for Tulyar for the coming year.  I know it is bunkum but I think the Minister should take the opportunity now to set the minds of Deputies at rest.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment. I fully appreciate the importance to the nation of the National Stud and of its being maintained in a condition to enable it to earn the greatest possible profits for this country.  I suggest, however, that were it not for the appearance on the horizon of a horse called Tulyar, this item would not appear on the Order Paper.  The amount it is proposed to devote to the extension of the capital of the National Stud and the figure which is mentioned as the purchase <Col N="72" /> price of that horse significantly coincide to a remarkable degree.</P>
      <P>I think we are entitled to assume that if this horse had not been purchased, the existing capital provision would have been ample for the functions which the National Stud has to carry out.  By adopting the ordinary parliamentary phraseology, we propose in the Money Resolution to amend and extend the National Stud.  I suggest that is strictly not correct.  It is admittedly the correct parliamentary form but the House is perfectly entitled to assume that the National Stud was carrying on successfully without this additional capital until the appearance of this horse on the market which they felt it desirable to purchase.  All down the years this country has been famed for its bloodstock.  Horses bred in this country have won races in England, France and all over the world.  Going back to an earlier period, European armies were continually looking for Irish bloodstock.  Russia, Germany and Austria in turn sent representatives to this country to buy famous sires here in order to introduce Irish bloodstock into their armies.  Remembering these facts, I am wondering when we come to consider the colossal figure paid for Tulyar, if there is not something more in the minds of the directors of the National Stud than the mere production of horses for running on racecourses.  Up to the present we have been able to produce racehorses to complete successfully against the best that other countries could produce without having to embark on the expenditure of the colossal figure involved in the purchase of Tulyar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Dunne make reference to the fact that Gay Time which was beaten a neck by Tulyar had been sold for £50,000.  Now we are paying £250,000 for Tulyar which Deputy Dunne rightfully points out means that we are paying £200,000 for a neck.  I do not wish to take from his merits but I do suggest that the figure that has been paid for him is out of all proportion to what we should have paid for him.  The sire and the dam of this miracle worker were themselves moderately-priced horses.  He is a decent horse, coming from poor but decent <Col N="73" /> parents, but he immediately becomes an aristocrat in his own right.  Why should we have to go to this stupendous figure to secure the services of this sire?  I might recall that Ardpatrick was bought by the Russian Government for £25,000 and, even allowing for the altered value of money, there is still a big discrepancy between the price paid for Ardpatrick, Galteemore and other famous sires and the price which it is now proposed to pay for Tulyar.  I think that you cannot get a single instance in the world of a horse which fetched such an enormous price.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Dunne asking for more information in regard to the purchase of this horse and I think notwithstanding all the facets of this transaction which have been developed here there are some further items which have not yet been disclosed.  Is it the intention to use this horse for some purpose other than the production of racehorses?  Some people might be inclined to think that it was the intention to produce cavalry horses for the Army from this strain but we have it from the Minister for Defence that recent trends in the Army, in common with most modern armies, is towards motorised transport.  Similarly it can scarcely be suggested that we intend to produce horses for the armies of the Continent.  At one time, of course, we had representatives of the Spanish, French, Austrian and Russian armies constantly coming to this country looking for mounts for their armies but we are scarcely likely to see a renewal of demand from these quarters.  Is there some other army for which we intend to produce horses? I am reminded of the incident when Sarsfield's mount collapsed when he was making a dash to the North.  A certain lesson might be drawn from that incident in our past history but still it can scarcely be suggested that the purchase of this sire is prompted by a desire to provide better mounts for the Army of to-day.  Yet it would appear that the expenditure of such a large amount in money could only be justified on the ground that something other than the mere production of horses for racing was visualised.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister was rather <Col N="74" /> unwise in rather chippily suggesting that if the £250,000 were distributed amongst the unemployed, it would provide only £3 per man.  I think that is a rather cheap suggestion.  Following the same line of reasoning, if £500,000 were provided, it would mean only £6 per man.  Are there to be any limits whatever to the amount that the National Stud will pay for a sire?  We suggest that a figure of £250,000 is altogether unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I have not once adverted in the few remarks I have made to the impoverished state of the country but that is visible to the eyes of everybody in the country.  Quite apart from the impoverished state of the country, I say that £250,000 is an unreasonable figure.  Such an expenditure incurred by a small country gives a false idea of our true position to anybody else with whom we have to deal.  It gives the false idea that there is no lack of money in the country.  If Tulyar never existed we would still have to carry on with horses that have made the name of Ireland famous for the last 30 or 40 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne waxed musical in regard to this transaction.  I heard him say that the only thing that had not been done with Tulyar was to bring him back to the air of &ldquo;Come Back to Erin.&rdquo;  I suggest that Erin would more appropriately be spelled &ldquo;E-A-R-N&rdquo; in this case.  If that is so, I think he will have a whale of a job to earn £250,000.  There has been a good deal of facetious comment in regard to the purchase of this horse but the feeling expressed in this House is only a pale reflection of the indignation that has been felt throughout the length and breadth of the country in connection with it.  Now and again. this transaction may have been made the subject of jokes but the jokes were tinged with sadness.  As I say, whatever we have heard in this House in the way of jokes and gibes, it is only a pale reflection of what is felt throughout the country.  The people believe that this transaction should not have taken place.  We believe it should not have taken place.  We believe we could carry on the National Stud and this great tradition without this huge <Col N="75" /> impost which is creating a wrong impression in the minds of the people who are suffering very grave hardships at the present time.  It is an ill-timed and unwarranted act to spend £250,000 on the purchase of an animal.  I trust that, with God's help, it will prove a success in the functions which it has to perform but, nevertheless, its purchase is a gamble.</P>
    <P>I support this amendment which suggests an extension of the share capital of the National Stud by £10,000. If there were no question of the purchase of this horse I submit that £10,000 would be more than ample&mdash; and, as a matter of fact, the directors would not have asked for £10,000 at all, as they would be able to carry on quite well on their existing capital of £250,000.  This sum of £250,000 is to cover the purchase of Tulyar and not for the purpose of extending the National Stud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that Deputies on all sides of the House, and that the Irish people as a whole, understand and agree with the desirability of improving our bloodstock.  Surely, however, nobody would ever have suspected or expected that a small country like ours would ask the Irish taxpayer to provide a sum of £250,000 for the purchase of a horse, no matter how valuable or how high its reputation might be.  The National Stud was established to improve our bloodstock industry.  It has been in existence for quite a number of years now and if the business of the stud is being carried out efficiently, surely at this stage it ought to be in a position, financially and otherwise, to provide whatever sires or mares it might require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister states that we should not mix up this matter with other projects.  Surely, however, when this House is asked to vote money for any purpose we should have the right of suggesting other projects on which the money could, in our opinion, be spent to better advantage.  That is how the people of this country will look on this matter.  The vast majority of the people of this country will want to know what benefit the purchase of this <Col N="76" /> animal will confer on the community. Of what benefit, for instance, can the purchase of this animal be to people living along the western seaboard? They will point out that if they asked for money to purchase, for instance, the best types of bulls or cows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As Deputy Dunne stated, we cannot be sure what type the progeny of this animal will be.  As several Deputies have stated, the purchase of this racehorse is a gamble &mdash;but it is too costly a gamble for the ordinary people of this country.</P>
      <P>A few minutes ago Deputy Collins asked the Minister to take steps to ensure that this racehorse will not be run.  The Minister states that he has no function in regard to the National Stud.  How, then, can he prevent the directors of the National Stud from running this horse, if they so desire? Suppose this horse is run and that it runs badly, as could happen.  That would reduce the value of the horse by reducing what I may call its prestige.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We suffer losses in various ways in various Government enterprises.  We have to vote money to make up for the losses of C.I.E., of Shannon Airport, and so on.  Now it looks as if we are voting money for the losses of the National Stud&mdash;because that is what it amounts to when they cannot carry out their own business.  The Minister sold the land project machinery: I think it would be just as well for him to sell the National Stud too.  Surely some individual, <Col N="77" /> some second Aga Khan, some company, firm or syndicate would purchase it. We should be rid of the whole matter by allowing it to be run by private enterprise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes the case&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that the money is for the purpose of the National Stud and not for the purchase of a horse.  A few days ago, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Boland, made the very same case.  In his last speech, however, the Minister for Agriculture sought to prove that that is not, in actual fact, the truth: he sought to trace the good points of the racehorse Tulyar and to show that its purchase on behalf of the stud is good business.  No more than anybody else, the Minister cannot have it both ways.  I think this House could agree that while the money itself is for the purpose of increasing the capital of the National Stud, the object of the increasing of the capital is the purchase of Tulyar.  As Deputy Keyes remarked, if the question of the purchase of Tulyar by the National Stud had not arisen, we should not have this request for an increase of £250,000 in its capital.</P>
      <P>At the risk of repeating myself, I should like to say that the Labour Party have no objection to the purchase by the National Stud of a good stallion for improving the bloodstock industry in this country.  If the case which the Minister made to this House were made either by a syndicate or by a private individual to an ordinary bank manager for an overdraft, I suggest that they would be laughed out of the office.  If you went to an ordinary bank manager and sought a loan or an overdraft of £250,000 and made the case which the Minister made to this House for that sum, not only would you be refused but you would be laughed out of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could say that this is a good horse and that if he goes to stud it is very likely that, in the future, the country will gain.  Even if this horse is as successful as the Minister hopes, then the National Stud will scarcely be able to earn in hard cash as much per year as it will cost it to insure the horse. <Col N="78" /> It is quite true that if he is successful, and if the dams are Irish dams, a certain amount of money and of prestige will accrue to the country.  From the point of view of a business proposition, there is a very weak case to be made for this.  At best, it can be called a gamble.  Should ill-luck follow this magnificent horse then the country will be at a loss of £250,000.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the Labour Party should not drag into this debate the fact that we have a large number of unemployed at the moment, and that the country is also labouring under various other restrictions. Is it not true to say that, if one of us is seeking for a bank overdraft, our present style of living and our prospects of earning are closely examined by the bank manager?  Therefore, is it not quite correct for this Parliament to examine with a jealous eye and a critical mind this proposal of the Minister for a sum of £250,000?  I suggest that if the Dáil examines this proposal against the background of poverty and unemployment that is facing a very large percentage of our people at the present time, it should say to the Minister that the Labour Party's amendment is not only justifiable but a laudable one.</P>
    <P>We feel that this is not the time, when the money of the nation is so badly needed to meet the needs of our people, to gamble on this horse.  There is the saying: &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass.&rdquo;  Are we to tell the unemployed that the purchase of this animal is good for the country?  That would be tantamount to saying to them: &ldquo;Live on and you will get grass.&rdquo;  This, surely, is not the appropriate time to tell the unemployed that the purchase of Tulyar is a good thing for them.</P>
    <P>A volume of protest has arisen amongst those whom the Labour Party represent at this action of the Government. The people are amazed that it should even be suggested that we can afford £250,000 for the purchase of this animal, especially when at the same time the people are told that we must have austerity, that the gap between imports and exports must be <Col N="79" /> reduced&mdash;a policy which was advocated by the Central Bank two years ago and adopted by this Government.  Are we to tell the people that they must do without butter, that they must eat less bread and have no work at a time when we are squandering £250,000 on the horse-breeding industry?</P>
    <P>I think the Labour Party are perfectly justified in suggesting that £10,000 is sufficient, if not more than sufficient, for the National Stud.  The purchase of this animal has aroused a storm of criticism in the shops and market places throughout the country. The witty stories that are told indicate that the purchase of Tulyar is not only a live but an important issue amongst the people at the present moment.  We suggest that if the National Stud needs more money, £10,000 should be sufficient for its purposes.  It was disclosed a week or so ago that the National Stud could not afford to pay a fair wage, according to the findings of the Labour Court, to sections of its employees.  Therefore the employees had to avail of the good offices of the Labour Court to secure an increase to compensate them for the increase in the cost of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the Minister has no direct responsibility, but I am suggesting that this money should not be given to the National Stud unless the Minister is satisfied that it is carrying out its work in a manner which meets with his approval.  I bow to the ruling of the Chair, and suggest to the <Col N="80" /> Minister that he should encourage the National Stud to use this £10,000 to pay reasonable and honest wages to its employees.</P>
      <P>We of this Party are not against any proposal which would mean an improvement of the bloodstock of the country. That is quite a laudable thing, but we are not satisfied that the purchase of a high-priced stallion, no matter how good, is any guarantee that his progeny will be of equal value.  It was pointed out at least twice to-day that the sire and the dam of Tulyar did not themselves rank as high priced animals.  If they can produce more offspring reaching the status of Tulyar, does it not necessarily follow that there is no vital reason why it should be necessary for the National Stud to purchase the most famous horse of his year in the interests of bloodstock breeding in this country?  When he has been purchased, we are not satisfied that the ordinary small breeder, even if he gets the opportunity of doing so, will be able to take advantage of his services.  We believe that the purchase of this horse will be something like the Managerial Act&mdash;the reserved function of the National Stud managers and their nominees, and that on the whole, the ordinary small breeder will derive little advantage from the purchase of this horse.</P>
      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill, Deputy Briscoe made the comment that very few members of the Labour Party were able to produce any telegrams or messages to support their claim that the money for the purchase of this horse had not the support of the people.</P>
      <P>I have received a telegram from a reputable association.  It was handed in to-day at 2.48.  It is addressed to Deputy Kyne, Leinster House:</P>

    <P>Would you touch in debate money being spent on racing army jumping national stud public inquiry is wanted on lines of greyhound inquiry if Government is to continue subsidising racing and breeding they should get some direct representaately-price <Col N="81" /> tion on racing bodies or new statutory board formed right of appeal must be allowed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is signed &ldquo;O'Brien, Hon. Sec., Point-to-Point Association.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is significant that the secretary of a point-to-point association, which is the small man's association, does not attach to the purchase of Tulyar the same degree of confidence as is expressed by individuals or organisations which are more in touch with the upper-class horseracing bodies.  It is significant that the point-to-point association suggests that, before issuing public money, the Minister should have a full investigation on the same lines as the investigation that was held into the greyhound industry, that he should satisfy himself that all is well and that he should give representation on bodies and boards that are subsidised to organisations of the small man, the small breeder.  I suggest that the Minister would be well advised to consider that request from the point-to-point association.</P>
    <P>I stress the fact that the Labour Party are not against the National Stud as such.  We are interested in putting to the House that this is not the time to spend £250,000 on a gamble.  We are prepared to face the country on that issue, if necessary, and I have no hesitation in saying that in my constituency I would make a much better case against spending the £250,000 than the three other Deputies would make for spending it.  I feel that they would be much happier making the case that I would be making than the one they will have to make if this becomes an issue at any future election.</P>

      <P>I do not think that any further arguments have been adduced by the Minister in support of this proposition to add to the capital of the National Stud for the purpose of buying Tulyar.  Has this money been paid?  Have we, in fact, bought Tulyar?  If the money has not in fact been paid to the Aga Khan, is there a period wherein an option operates, as has been suggested by other speakers in the House?  If there is such a period or time-limit, what is <Col N="82" /> the final date?  The Minister should be able to give us that information.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>These are matters in which the public are interested.  I have asked these questions with a view to getting some further information. If ever there was a dark horse, this surely is one.  We have been told that he will be raced this year in four races, including the Coronation Cup, that the President of the Republic will compete with the Queen of England for the Coronation Cup.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Who has told you this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we have been told.  It is in the Press.  I will show the Minister statements by very reliable racing reporters in the Press that this horse will be run four times this year.  God between us and all harm, I think the Minister will be offering up prayers while these races are being run.  We all hope that this horse will never see a bad hour so far as racing is concerned, but if he loses by a nose in any of these races where is our £250,000 then?  I have already adverted to the fact that Tulyar beat Gay Time by a neck.  Gay Time was sold for something like £100,000&mdash;or was it £50,000&mdash;at any rate considerably less than £250,000.  I am sure everybody in the House realises that there is no such thing in racing as a certainty.  We have had political tipsters for the last three weeks giving us this certainty, persuading us that they cannot lose.  Not only are they telling us what this horse can do now, but they presume to tell us what his progeny will do and what his progeny will earn, before they appear in the world at all.  As Deputy Blowick quite rightly said, how do we know we will ever see his progeny?  There is no <Col N="83" /> guarantee of that.  There are these multifarious aspects of this colossal gamble.  First of all, if the horse runs and is beaten, particularly if he is beaten in the Coronation Cup by the Queen's horse, we will feel very aggrieved, but if he is beaten in any race our so-called trustee investment goes up in smoke.  Secondly, if he survives the journey to this country and survives long enough to serve a sufficient number of mares who, if they are fortunate enough, may produce progeny for him, we will have a gamble as to whether any of the progeny will ever win a &ldquo;bumper&rdquo; or a point-to-point race.  We have all these problems facing us.  Absolutely nothing has been said in this debate by the Minister or those who support him to justify this step.  Our line has been consistently that this sum of money is too much to demand from the people at a time such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the fact that, undoubtedly, this is a dark horse.  Was there ever an animal in history about which it was so difficult to get information? The Minister has consistently refused to tell us whether the horse will be insured and, if he is insured, what the premium will be or what firm, if any, will insure him.  If he is not to be insured, that increases the enormity of the gamble.  If he is to be insured, it will increase the cost by £9,000 or £10,000 a year.  All these facts have been referred to again and again in this debate and we know as much now about the horse as we did in the beginning.  The Minister just comes in and says in effect: &ldquo;I want for this group of people connected with the National Stud £250,000 of the taxpayers' money.  I do not know what it is to be spent on.&rdquo;  Everybody else in Ireland knows that.  People all over the world know about it by now.  We have done our share to try to boost the value of this horse by giving it free publicity.  We have tried to oblige the Minister in that way.  But the Minister, the man who is to make the money available to the National Stud, does not know to what use it will be put. Probably by now he will have abandoned that particular line.  As I was <Col N="84" /> out of the House for some time, I do not know if the Minister answered my query regarding Royal Charger.  Is it a fact that he is to be sold or are any negotiations in process for his sale?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>And stories.  It is not impossible that at some future date the Minister or the National Stud will be very glad to dispose of Tulyar because he may not prove a worthy investment.  But supposing all the progeny he produces will be the best this world ever saw, supposing he delights the hearts of every bloodstock owner in Ireland, that would be nothing in importance compared with the fact that we are giving, in effect, to a small group of people, to a small fraction of the population, who are well able to pay themselves, the people's money to the extent of £250,000.</P>
      <P>The case has been made, with the usual effrontery of the Fianna Fáil Party and with that customary brazenness which has gained so much for them in the past, but which is now coming to be recognised by the Irish people for what it is, that this money could not be put to better use.  Because we mentioned unemployment, the fact that there were 90,000 people registering at the employment exchanges, an effort was made to put anybody who did that in the dock and, in one case, out of the House, because a Deputy was ejected from the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister was joking when he said that our best ambassadors abroad were our horses. He must have meant that in a facetious sense.  It is quite true that in jumping competitions our horses have won prizes in Nice, Toronto and other places abroad.  That does reflect a certain amount of credit on the nation and adds a little lustre to the Irish name. But what good is that to the fellow who has to depend on the farmer for his weekly wages?  It is only a matter of relative importance.  The Irish nation always had the reputation of being proud.  The Fianna Fáil idea seems to be that the poorer we get the prouder we get.  Logically then, we will eventually reach the very top level of pride when we all die of starvation.  We will have the satisfaction of knowing that the prestige of the nation has been kept up, that it is important to keep up our name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We suggest that the money which is being asked for by the Minister as necessary for the further development of the National Stud is excessive.  If the National Stud is in need of improvement, by all means let us have it improved; let the bloodstock experts in the National Stud avail of the £10,000 for any purpose they think necessary for the improvement of the National Stud.  Surely we could easily buy a couple of dozen, if not 50, horses equally as good as the dam and the sire of Tulyar for the amount which it is proposed to pay for Tulyar.  A great deal of misconception exists amongst people who are connected with racing. Racing is important and the bloodstock industry is important, but they are not as important as the well-being of the mass of the people.  We say that the balance of this money, namely, £240,000, if the amendment were accepted by the House, could be used for the building of a factory and the employment of up to 1,000 workers. Such an industry would not alone provide employment for them but would provide employment in the future for <Col N="86" /> their children and their children's children.  The money could be used in many ways for the improvement of the national position.  The Minister has not made any case to justify opposition to this amendment of ours.</P>

      <P>I would like to know why the Minister has not availed of the opportunity provided by that section in this Bill to require the directors of the National Stud to take the responsibility of providing an annual statement of accounts in the conduct of their business for the benefit of this House?  The section provides that the Minister for Agriculture may in consultation with the Minister for Finance direct the manner in which the accounts may be kept and so on but there is no proviso such as there is in respect of other State-sponsored projects to present the accounts to this House.</P>

Even though the Deputy may regard himself as the last word in matters of law and may have some idea of his own capabilities I would prefer to have an answer from the Minister to my question.  Is it the position that Deputies are entitled to receive a copy of the annual statement of accounts of the National Stud?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point and I think it is appropriate to raise the point on this section.  Since the Government has decided to enrich this concern to the extent of £500,000 I believe we have a right to receive from the National Stud the scant courtesy of being circularised with a statement of their accounts.  I have never seen <Col N="88" /> such a statement.  Bord na Móna, the activities of which are more open to public question and public scrutiny and which has placed upon it a very important responsibility in the fundamental economy of our State, employing as it does thousands of workers, can find the time and thinks it desirable to circulate their accounts to members of this House.  Is it too much to ask that the gentlemen running the National Stud&mdash;sometimes I think the word national is used in a very ironic sense&mdash;should circulate their accounts in like manner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might be as well for me briefly to repeat, for the information of the Deputies who have just come in, a matter to which this debate has reference.  As far as we can discover from this Bill before the House the National Stud has placed upon it no obligation to circularise to the members of the House any statement of annual accounts as is done, to give one instance, as far as Bord na Móna is concerned.  I feel members of the Fianna Fáil Party will be at one with me in the view that this organisation known as the National Stud should have that responsibility and should be made to discharge it in common with bigger and more important projects such as Bord na Móna. There is no requirement whatsoever in Section 3 of the Bill that members of the House should have access even to the accounts.  It is stated that the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance may direct what way the accounts be kept, but even therein there is no reference to the fact that the State should have the right to supervise, to examine or even call in question here in the House the manner in which these moneys are to be expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a matter of a few hundred pounds being placed at the disposal of a State company.  It is big business. We have entered into competition with the money moguls of the world.  We have outbid the Americans and have captured for ourselves a racehorse of which we do not know whether it will ever be fit to produce a colt that will win a race.  However, we have done <Col N="91" /> something, according to the Minister and his Party, to raise the prestige of the country.  That remains to be seen. A lot of people think the whole business of racing&mdash;I am not one of them&mdash;is not one which adds to the prestige of a country.  I take a different view from that but I emphasise the need that exists to have in the future, now that we have capitalised the National Stud to the extent of £500,000, the annual statement of accounts circulated to Deputies.  I do not think that is asking too much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The section introduced into the Bill is merely a book-keeping section.  At present you have a stock account.  The proceeds of sale of stock, and so forth, have to be placed in this account.  The directors of the company are not permitted to spend that money without the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  The suggestion here in the section is that in future that sanction will not be necessary&mdash; in other words, that the directors will have authority to spend any moneys that may accrue from the sale of bloodstock or the general business of the stud.  What is asked for in this section is that they be permitted to spend their own moneys.  Section 26 of the National Stud Act, 1945, requires the company:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To maintain a fund to be known as the Stock Replacement Fund.</P>
      <P>There shall be paid into the Stock Replacement Fund the net proceeds of any bloodstock purchased out of capital and disposed of by the company, all moneys received from time to time by the company on foot of insurance of bloodstock so purchased, and such moneys as the company may from time to time allocate to the said fund out of surplus net revenue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is all that is being asked for: that they be given that permission. Regarding the circulation of audited accounts, provision has been made in the 1945 Act for submission by the Minister for Agriculture of the accounts.</P>
      <P>Section 25 (4) states:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;A copy of every balance sheet, <Col N="92" /> profit and loss account and report furnished to the Minister for Agriculture pursuant to this section shall be laid by him before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after such balance sheet, profit and loss account and report are so furnished to him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that provision is already made for the audited accounts of the company to be laid before each House.  In my opinion, if the Deputy is interested in the National Stud, he should be expected at least to take the trouble of going down to the Library where the balance sheet is available and perusing it there.  I do not for a moment agree that it would be of any material benefit to a Deputy to have the report circulated.  Certainly it would mean more expense to the National Stud and it would entail more administrative trouble.  Somebody must be employed, presumably, to have all these balance sheets circulated and, once the thin end of the wedge is inserted, it would mean, I suppose, that we must have somebody to look after the correspondence. Deputy Dunne has cited the case of Bord na Móna, but surely Bord na Móna bears no relation to the National Stud whatever.  It is necessary of course that in an undertaking of the magnitude of Bord na Móna the report should be circulated, but in the case of the National Stud there should be no necessity to do that. Every Deputy who is interested in the National Stud, it is reasonable to expect, would go to the Library, where he could inspect the audited accounts.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that there is no comparison between Bord na Móna and other State sponsored bodies and the National Stud.  There is not, perhaps, in the amount of money which they handle each year or the extent of the activity in which they engage but why is it that some State sponsored bodies such as Bord na Móna, the Sugar Company, E.S.B. and C.I.E. circulate their reports to Deputies?</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister when he says that the <Col N="93" /> circulation of the balance sheet would involve the employment of extra staff. I do not think so because I understand the usual machinery for circulating such balance sheets is that a number of them are sent into this House and they are included in a Deputy's post in the ordinary way just as the daily Order Paper for the Dáil and Seanad is.  The circulation of the report and balance sheet of the National Stud would not involve an additional expenditure of £1.  It would mean only that about 300 or 350 extra copies would be sent in here to be distributed in the ordinary way amongst Deputies and Senators by the staff.  We get copies of the daily debates and of various other documents and if additional copies of the balance sheet of the National Stud were made available, it would simply mean sticking them into the envelopes already provided.</P>

      <P>Why should the Minister trample on our rights in order to go running to the Aga Khan with this present of £250,000?  I am not clear now as to what position we have arrived at.  It seems, Sir, that you have accepted a motion from the Minister that the Report Stage be now taken.  Has that ever happened before? I see you nod your head in assent.  As I understand the position, it has been the custom and, in fact, it has been the Standing Order that only in the case of agreement is the Report Stage taken immediately after the Committee Stage.

      <P>Whenever a Minister may, for reasons of urgency or otherwise, desire to get all stages of a Bill my experience in the ten years in which I have been a member of this <Col N="100" /> House is that the Minister always asks for it and tries to get agreement on it. In this case, the Minister moved a definite closure motion when he moved that the Report Stage of the Bill be now taken.  I submit that this is a most unusual step.  The Minister has made his position very clear.  He has given his reason why he wants the Bill reported this evening: he said that Deputy Dunne had spoken ten times. Apparently, ten times is the limit, in the Minister's mind.  I understood that if a Deputy had spoken one thousand and ten times it did not prevent him from speaking again and that it did not exhaust the privilege which every Deputy of this House enjoys of speaking as often as he likes on the Committee Stage so long as he keeps within the rules of order and so long as his remarks are relevant.  I submit that the Minister has no right to move this motion.  I submit that, for the taking of the Report Stage now, the Minister must have the agreement of the House.  I submit that a simple closure motion such as that which the Minister has just moved is completely out of order and cannot be taken by the Chair.  I submit that the Minister has acted in a very dangerous manner.

      <P>I want to ask whether it is reasonable, having completed the Committee Stage, that it should be announced to Deputies that they may now put in amendments for immediate discussion?  I submit that is not a proper procedure.  I think we have the right to be able to peruse to-day's debate, and should be given a reasonable time to do so, to see if there are any points which call for amendment on Report.  To say to a Deputy that he should now put in an amendment for immediate discussion is not, I think, a proper procedure.  In fact, I am sure it is not.  Otherwise, why should there be a time limit between Committee and Report Stage?</P>

      <P>On a point of order.  I want to move under Standing Order No. 94 that the Bill be recommitted as I am entitled to do under that Standing Order.  I think I should explain to you that I consider I have been deprived of an essential right of a Deputy in this House.  The ground on which I move this is that on the conclusion of the Committee Stage of this Bill the Minister demanded that the Report Stage should be taken forthwith, thereby depriving me of the right which is given by custom and usage and which I believe is also given by Standing Orders to Deputies, to get time for the submission of amendments on the Report Stage.</P>

It says that, on the Order of the Day to consider a Bill on Report, the House shall proceed to consider the Bill on Report unless an amendment be moved to recommit it, in which event the Deputy making that motion shall be allowed to make a short statement and another Deputy who is opposing that motion shall be allowed to make a short statement, when the Chair, in its discretion, shall put the motion or hear further representations. I think that is the Standing Order.  I respectfully submit that the Deputy would be within his rights in moving under that Standing Order to recommit the Bill, and that you would hear one Deputy against that and then allow the matter to be put to a division.</P>

      <P>Having to some extent got out of the technical jungle in connection with this matter I want to revert to the origin of this dispute. The Minister might have displayed some reason in my view on this whole question and not tried to steamroll the Opposition on the matter of the purchase of Tulyar.</P>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now recommitted for the reasons I have already outlined, the principal reason being that I have been deprived of the right given to Deputies for time for consideration in the submission of amendments on the Report Stage.  The Minister has shown himself in a dictatorial frame of mind this evening.  We intend to stand by our rights, rights inherent in membership of this House and we will ensure as far as we can that these rights shall be enforced in the interests of every Deputy.  I do not know whether or not I am entitled to proceed at any length on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The title of this Bill is a misnomer.  This Bill should not be styled, as it is, &ldquo;The National Stud Bill, 1953&rdquo;.  Its proper title would be &ldquo;The Purchase of the Racehorse Tulyar Bill, 1953&rdquo;.  The Minister in his attitude to-night to opposition on this measure has shown the Fianna Fáil Party in their true colours.  As a matter of fact it seems to me to be very strange that discussion in this House can be stifled in the fashion it was to-night.  If it is permissible for a Minister to take action such as was taken to-night by the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="113" /> there is something wrong with our Standing Orders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It probably does require a separate motion.  I take it I am entitled to refer to statements that have been made by representatives of the Government during the course of the Bill.  One of the statements which the Minister made in the course of the debate on this Bill was that he was going to see to it that I would not be allowed to speak any more.  It was for that purpose that the closure motion was moved and discussion stifled. Fianna Fáil know very well the feelings of the people of the country so far as this Bill is concerned.  They do not want any more talk about it.  It is too embarrassing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>If some of the gentlemen who confine themselves to odd interruptions exercised their minds and their vocal chords a little more in regard to important matters, it might be of benefit to this House and to this country.  I think I am entitled to say here at this stage, the last opportunity we will have of saying anything on this Bill, that I object to it in every phase and in every clause which is contained in the Bill.  I object to the dishonesty which is stamped upon it.  The Minister came in with the story, that would not deceive an infant child, that this Bill had nothing at all to do with Tulyar, the Aga Khan or anything like that.  This was simply a Bill to enlarge the resources of the National Stud.  He even stated to a Deputy, in reply to a question, that he did not know what the money would be used <Col N="114" /> for, whether it was to be used for a racehorse, a greyhound or a camel. That is the Minister who claims to represent a responsible Government. Everybody knows the Minister is anxious to facilitate the wishes of his Royal Highness the Aga Khan.  That is why he was in such a hurry to-night to put this measure through.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I do not believe we have heard the whole story about this Bill.  There is something in this undue haste to get this Bill through that should have been revealed to us during the course of the debate.  If that is not the case, why stifle democratic discussion on a Bill of this kind?  If there was not the need for this haste why should this step not have been taken by the Government who have now succeeded in holding themselves up before the country as dictatorial?</P>
      <P>It is amazing the change that time brings about.  One would never have thought that a very decent man, as was the Minister for Agriculture when he was in opposition, would turn out the tyrannous martinet he displayed himself to be to-night.  I suppose it comes from environment and mixing with the wrong people.  However, I do not wish to take up any more time in the House on this matter.  I raised the issue originally when news was first made available that the Government were planning this purchase.  In opposing this Bill at every stage I have been carrying out the wishes of 99.9 per cent. of my constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency there are stud farms and many people who earn their living by the bloodstock industry, but even racehorse owners have expressed to me the view that the Government must have been insane in spending such a large sum on one horse.  The industry, no matter how important it may be, as has been said on many occasions, is only secondary to many other pressing national issues.  We think this Government shows a complete and utter disregard of what is happening in the country.  Every month that has passed since they came into power brought greater and greater misfortune to the people, higher taxes, more unemployment and a reduction in <Col N="115" /> the purchasing power of wages.  Fianna Fáil's only effort to stem that trend has been to buy a racehorse from the Aga Khan and to try to wrap the green flag around a most objectionable transaction.  It is a sorry plight for Fianna Fáil.  It is yet another of the milestones that mark its way to its political grave.  With these few remarks, I reiterate my opposition to the proposal contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support Deputy Dunne in his objection to the speed with which the Minister has steered this legislation through the House.  Deputy Dunne has objected to the manner in which the Government have accelerated the passage of all stages of the Bill this evening.  The Bill is described in its title as the National Stud Bill, 1953, and the last speaker has made some reference to that title.  I think the proper title of the Bill would be the Aga Khan Presentation Bill, 1953.  That would be a more honest title for the Bill. As a result of the passing of this Bill we are called upon to vote no less than £250,000 of the taxpayers' money to the National Stud authorities, and the main purpose is to enable these authorities to purchase this racehorse.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe was very loud in his challenges to Deputies on certain stages of this Bill to produce any letter or document they had from their constituents protesting or expressing their anger against the Bill.  I say that every single Deputy, no matter what Party he belongs to, must have received a large volume of protests from the taxpayers of this country.  Not alone have Deputies received letters by the score, but every citizen who approached or met a Deputy in recent months availed of the opportunity to comment on the stupidity of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I have received a letter within the past 48 hours from a constituent, an Old I.R.A. man.  He states that he is on the verge of poverty and that his five children had to emigrate.  He refers to this Bill in his letter in which he states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am over 60 years of age.  My five sons have had to emigrate as <Col N="116" /> there was no work for them.  I am in very dire poverty but instead of the Government helping me and the Old I.R.A., we find that they have room for accounts to be provided for this great stud horse.  Allow me to protest.  You can read this for Mr. de Valera and all the other Ministers and let them know that I and many of the Old I.R.A. are neglected while more consideration is given to a stud horse.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That letter may not be phrased in the usual Civil Service language but it is the best attempt that an honest Old I.R.A. constituent could make, to voice his protest to his local representative in connection with the expenditure of the money provided under this Bill.  I am sure every Deputy has had proof in some shape or form, of the anger of taxpayers on being asked to foot a Bill for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have allowed the Deputy to travel a long way.  The principle of the Bill has been adopted by the House on Second Reading and the only matter that is open for discussion now is what is in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in this Bill for the expenditure of £250,000 on a horse.  The Minister stated on the Second Stage of the Bill that he was not concerned with what the National Stud authorities did with this money.  I think that was an extraordinary statement for a responsible Minister to make, that he was prepared to hand over a large sum of money without any supervision whatever, either from himself or his Department, to see in what way this money was being expended.  I asked the Minister if he would clear up the rumour that the purchase of this horse for £250,000 was only one of three purchases which the National Stud authorities proposed to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill to purchase one horse at £250,000.  I want to make my position very clear.  I would not object to money being voted for the improvement or the general reconstruction of <Col N="117" /> the National Stud and I would be inclined to support by every means in my power, and encourage in every way, the good work carried on by the National Stud authorities.  My objection to this Bill arises from the fact that a very large sum of money is being provided under the Bill for the purchase of one racehorse.  I consider that the establishment of National Stud headquarters elsewhere in the country would have been a better way of spending this money.</P>
      <P>I join with Deputy Dunne in opposing this Bill.  I think it is a foolish Bill, and that there is no sense in it. It has been steered through this House by big men with small minds and empty heads.  It is a Bill that is looked upon with disgust by every taxpayer and citizen throughout the country.  I believe that the decision to purchase this animal was not a unanimous decision on the part of the National Stud authorities, that there was a difference of opinion and that certain influential people, who have a right to advise the Minister on these matters, opposed the purchase of the horse and said that it was not worth £250,000.  I want to place on record in this House that in conformity with the wishes of my constituents, I am strongly opposed to the Bill.  I believe that the time of the House could be profitably occupied with more important and more serious work, work which would bestow a greater measure of benefit and some relief on the already overburdened citizens and taxpayers. For these reasons, I am opposed to the Bill, and I ask the House to reject the passing of the Bill in its final stages.  It is an unwelcome Bill.  This is no time to present such a Bill.  I think that the Minister and the Government were very unwise, in the circumstances which prevail throughout the country, to ask the House to finance such a measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If ever a horse was galloped almost to the point of death, I think it is Tulyar.  I think there has been a lot of hot air about this Bill and that certain people on the Opposition Benches were not either honest or sincere.  This is a short Bill which <Col N="118" /> provides for the enlargement of the capital of the National Stud.  Inasmuch as any serious attempt was made to oppose the granting of additional capital to this company, it was based on the assertion that this is a luxury industry.  Let us, for the sake of argument, accept the statement that it is a luxury industry.  Let us accept that horse breeding and racing are, in general, luxury industries.  That, in itself, is no reason why the Bill should be rejected.  Some luxury industries provide large-scale employment for our people and help to raise the standard of living of our people.  Many small nations depend to a great extent for the upholding of the high standard of living of their people on luxury industries&mdash;luxury industries designed, in the main, for the export market. Therefore, if it increases the wealth of the country and provides employment, it is not a case against the Bill to say that the bloodstock industry is a luxury industry.  That applies to any industry whether it be the bloodstock industry, the manufacture of nylon stockings, or other such industries. It is all to the benefit of the nation if the industry provides employment and increases our national wealth and our national output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that there was very much honesty or sincerity in the opposition which was expressed in this House to this Bill.  This Bill was promoted by the Government but it had the support of almost the entire front Opposition Bench.  Deputy O. Flanagan was kind enough to say that this Bill was supported by big men with small minds.  Those big men with small minds include Deputy Dillon, Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Seán Collins.  If Tulyar has done one thing in this House he has cut the Opposition Party in twain.  No longer does a united Opposition face the Government Benches.  We have, instead, the Tulyarites and the anti-Tulyarites.  On the side of Tulyar we have the practical men, the realists.  Opposing them, we have the idealists and the high-brows&mdash;men such as Deputy Dunne, Deputy O. Flanagan and, I suppose, a few light-weights thrown in like Deputy Blowick.  Perhaps it was not a bad <Col N="119" /> thing that that should happen.  Perhaps it is just as well that this particular issue gave certain members of the Opposition an opportunity of voicing the discontent which may, perhaps, have been pent up within their breasts for a long time.  Be that as it may, the Bill has the support of the majority of the members of this House.  It has the support not only of the present Government but of most of the ex-Ministers, including the ex-Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I think that the ordinary sensible people of the country realise quite well that any industry that gives employment and that helps to strengthen the economic position of the nation is of benefit to the nation.  The money invested in this industry will not prevent the investment of other moneys in other industries.  It is nonsense to say that the investment of this sum of £250,000 in this particular industry will deprive some other industry of adequate capital.  If there is any industry in this country that can show a reasonable prospect of making a profit I am quite certain that the necessary capital to finance it will be forthcoming.  Provision is made in the Book of Estimates this year for increased expenditure on afforestation, on the land reclamation scheme, on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the extra sum of £250,000 which is required to increase the share capital of the National Stud.  I think that, on the expert advice that has been given to us, I am justified in so doing.  Many of us in this House know very little about horses, and many of us cannot claim any expert knowledge on that <Col N="120" /> subject.  We know, however, that the Minister for Agriculture, who is a practical man, has consulted experts on the matter and has acted on the expert advice which he has received.  I am quite sure that his opposite number, Deputy Dillon&mdash;who supports this Bill&mdash;also got expert advice on the matter and that he, too, is satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of making this company a success.  In spite of the attempts that have been made to discredit this particular industry, we wish it success and hope that it will continue to develop so that Irish bloodstock will become even more famous all over the world, with the result that there will be increased employment for our own people in that industry in our own country.</P>

      <P>The suggestion that the Opposition has been torn asunder as a result of this Bill is just so much eye-wash.  The fact of the matter is that the members of the Opposition were free to express their opinions on this measure.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the importance of the bloodstock industry and recognise that, at a more favourable time, the voting of a sum of £250,000 for the purchase of this racehorse might be accepted by this House, in the conditions which prevail at present throughout the country it would be impossible to expect members who represent the ordinary rank and file of the community to support this Bill.  I appreciate the fact also that if the Whips were not put on the members of the Fianna Fáil Party we should see some Deputies of that Party walk into the Opposition side of the Lobby.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that Fianna Fáil Deputies have no option but to vote for the measure and that they must all go in the one direction.  With respect, Deputy Cogan was permitted, in your hearing, Sir, to suggest that there is a division in the ranks of the Opposition arising out of the introduction of this Bill.  We object to the principle of the Bill.  We appreciate the importance of the <Col N="121" /> bloodstock industry.  We feel that should be a secondary consideration when related to other conditions.</P>
      <P>It is in the light of the prevailing conditions outside that the ordinary Deputy is opposing this measure and for no other reason.  Our opposition is not concerned with the gentlemen who are engaged in the development of this industry.  We are opposing this Bill because there is so much poverty, unemployment and emigration, and because of the fact that we find it so hard to get from the Minister for Finance moneys to carry out essential works of development which are more important than the purchase of a racehorse at a cost of £250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When those of us, on earlier stages of the Bill, put forward our views in opposition to the purchase of this animal, we were castigated by some of the Deputies who are now supporting it.  We were charged with being divided on it. Surely, on a matter like this, Deputies are entitled to put forward the views of their constituents.  I am expressing their views in opposing the final passage of this Bill.  They feel that the expenditure of this large sum of money on this animal, and at this particular time, is uncalled for.  They do not think that the country can afford it.</P>
      <P>We are told that this expenditure is for the betterment of the bloodstock industry.  What we feel is that the same facilities are not being afforded to other sections of the community. This is an important branch of our live-stock industry, but it is no more important than other branches of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister's introductory remarks were largely to blame for a lot of what has been said.  He referred to the value of our exports of horseflesh without telling us what proportion of the £3,000,000 which he mentioned applied to bloodstock.  I mention that for this purpose.  There was a very large horse sale in my home town recently.  A considerable number of horses were on offer and many of them were bought for export, but there was not one pure-bred animal amongst them.  That is one reason why I suggest <Col N="122" /> that the picture which the Minister gave in regard to the bloodstock industry was not a faithful picture.</P>
    <P>The country is considerably incensed at this huge expenditure, principally because of the fact that 12 months ago the Government painted very gloomy pictures for the people as regards what they would be called upon to face.  It was, therefore, expected that the Government would be circumspect in the spending of the people's money.  Demands have been made on the Government by various sections of the community&mdash;demands for increased wages and increased prices to meet the high cost of living and the higher costs of production, but the Government say that these demands cannot be met, due to the financial position of the country. On the other hand, the people see the Government spending this huge sum of money on one animal.  Deputy MacBride was ridiculed the other night for suggesting that if this money were spent on the purchase of good premium bulls people could understand it, because such expenditure would be of benefit to the live-stock industry.</P>

      <P>I am just giving to the House the views of my constituents.  They think that this is an extravagant purchase.  Admittedly, this is a great horse.  The horse may prove to be profitable, but still the people think that the price is exorbitant because the country cannot afford it. I would be failing in my duty to my constituents if I did not give expression to their views.  Charges of dishonesty and insincerity have been levelled at those Deputies who have opposed this Bill.  We claim to be quite honest and sincere in our objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bloodstock industry has been described as a luxury industry.  We dispute the case which has been made for it, that it gives considerable employment. I think that the people who will benefit directly from this purchase are people who, if they had clubbed together, could have put up the money required to buy this animal <Col N="123" /> without any State aid.  We have many other sections of the community crying out for help.  They are not the best-off sections of our people either. Their case should be considered by the Government.  In view of what the Government have done in this case, we can only hope that they will be prepared to come to the assistance of those other sections of the community which are far more in need of help than those engaged in the bloodstock industry.  We hope that, when measures are introduced in this House by the Government for the benefit of the people I speak of, the Government will show as much anxiety in their case as it has done in this case, to have them passed speedily through the Dáil.</P>
    <P>If that is done, then the people concerned will be in a position to have a higher standard of living for themselves, to employ more people, pay better wages and ensure that the number of the unemployed will be reduced.</P>

      <P>On the Final Stage of the Bill, I want to correct a statement which was made by Deputy Cogan who suggested that in opposing this Bill we, on these benches, were opposed to the development of the National Stud.  I want to say that is not so.  We are as determined as the people on the other side of the House to protect and foster the National Stud and all that it stands for.  We do not believe that this Bill is the best way of doing that.  The title of the Bill is &ldquo;to amend and extend the National Stud&rdquo;.  I suggest that if it were not for the fact that this horse had become available, there would have been no such Bill as this before the House.  Therefore, to say that this Bill is to amend and extend the National Stud is a misnomer.  The National Stud was able to carry on very well on the original capital provided for it.  It was doing an excellent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we object to is calling this a Bill to amend and extend the National Stud when its real purpose is to pay £250,000 for one animal.  That is really what the Bill means&mdash;the provision of money to purchase one sire.  We suggest that there could have been <Col N="124" /> developments carried out in other directions at much less cost to the State.  Apart altogether from the impoverished state of the national finances, we think that £250,000 is a fantastic figure, an unwarranted price, to pay for any horse, even for Tulyar, with his great record.  I mentioned earlier that the sire and dam which produced Tulyar were lowly-priced animals.  They were respectable but poor stock.  He has become an aristocrat, and we are told that, unless we pay £250,000 for him, the whole national bloodstock industry of the country will collapse.  We suggest that that is not in the best interests.  The people who have advised that this purchase should be made under a Bill called an Act to amend and extend the National Stud, put the House, to my mind, under false pretences because this is not for any purpose other than the purchase of a horse.  In order to give it the proper legal clothing, we call it an extension and amendment of the National Stud Act.  An amendment was moved by the Labour Party which would make the provision under this Bill £10,000.  That £10,000, in my opinion, would have been ample and even unnecessary, because there was no request from the people who control the Stud for any money whatsoever for the purposes mentioned, except for the purchase of this horse from the Aga Khan.</P>
    <P>Through the years we have maintained a splendid standard.  We have sent our racing stock all over the world.  We have sent sires to other countries for purposes other than racing.  That continued unhindered and unhampered.  Our record was untarnished. We suggest that this expenditure on this animal is a gamble, as any such purchase would be.  Admittedly, the directors were guided by his parentage and history.  Tulyar has an excellent record.  We contend that the country could not at this juncture afford the luxury of spending £250,000 on a horse.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of sires available. Tulyar won by a neck from Gay Time. Gay Time was sold for £50,000 and we are paying £250,000 for the horse that merely got his nose in front.  Where is the justification for it?  It gives the <Col N="125" /> House cause for serious thought as to whether or not the people who are in control of the National Stud are acting with the best wisdom in the control of its destinies.  So far, they have been working wisely and well.  This seems to indicate a false step, a step that is unjustified and unwarranted.  I want <Col N="126" /> to reiterate that I and the Deputies on these benches are opposed to this measure as being unwarranted and ill-timed, having regard to the circumstances obtaining in the country at the present time.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, No. 2 of 1941, No. 14 of 1943, No. 3 of 1946 and Nos. 19 and 28 of 1949); Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, No. 33 of 1938, No. 5 of 1944, Nos. 11 and 34 of 1945 and Nos. 7 and 29 of 1949); Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936, No. 9 of 1948, No. 30 of 1950 and No. 27 of 1952); Payments in respect of Compensation for Members of the Local Defence Force (No. 19 of 1946 and No. 15 of 1949); and for sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessitated by the enactment of the Pensions Act, 1952, which, as Deputies will recollect, provided for the grant of pensions to the widows of two former Mayors of Limerick and of a gratuity to the daughter of a former Lord Mayor of Cork.  The payments during the present financial year can be met from savings on the Vote for Army Pensions generally and this token Estimate therefore, is necessary merely to regularise the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £40,000 be granted to <Col N="128" /> defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for Children's Allowances (No. 2 of 1944; No. 8 of 1946; and No. 12 of 1952).</P>
    <P>There is another Estimate for Social Insurance, Vote No. 73, and perhaps I might deal with both together. These two Estimates, as I explained last week on other Estimates, arise out of the Social Welfare legislation of last year.  The Social Welfare (Children's Allowances) Act, 1952, widened the scope of the earlier Acts by granting an allowance of 11/- per month for the second child in a family in respect of whom no allowance was previously payable.  In addition the allowances in respect of the third and subsequent children were increased by ? per week and put on a monthly basis.  It was estimated in June of last year that these enlargements of the Children's Allowances Scheme would increase the cost of the service by £2,120,000 in the present financial year and a Supplementary Estimate for that amount was taken at the same time as the general Estimates for my Department were taken.  It now appears that the amount required was slightly underestimated and that a further £40,000 will be needed this year.  The under-estimation was mainly due to the fact that the number of second-child claims was greater than was expected.</P>
    <P>The second Estimate before the House, that for social insurance, is a new one which has not appeared before in the Book of Estimates.  As will be seen, it provides mainly for the payment by the Exchequer to the Social Insurance Fund of the amount by which the expenditure out of that fund exceeds its income.  This was the method of financing the new insurance scheme laid down in Section 39 of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, and this one Exchequer payment now takes the place of the grants formerly made by the Exchequer to the National Health Insurance Fund, the Unemployment Fund and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund.  These former grants were substantial in amount, and have ceased as from the 5th January of this year, when the Social Welfare Act, <Col N="129" /> 1952, was brought fully into operation.</P>
    <P>The amount provided under sub-head B of the Social Insurance Estimate is a continuation of the provision formerly made in the Vote for National Health Insurance by which the Exchequer paid to the National Health Insurance Fund an amount equal to the interest which would have been received on the moneys expended under Section 21 of the Social Welfare Act, 1950.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Children's Allowances Estimate I want to raise one or two matters.  I can quite understand that since the introduction of the new Act quite a considerable amount of work has been thrown on that section of the Department.  It was my experience, and I am sure it was the experience of other Deputies, that there was a considerable delay in dealing with claims for children's allowances.  One of the difficulties I experienced was that claimants wrote to the Department in respect of applications they had made, and unfortunately they did not quote the reference numbers of their claims, with the result that identification of the claims was rendered very difficult.</P>
      <P>I believe there has been some improvement in the rate of payment and in the clearance of cases which were the subject matter of complaints.  What is the present position in respect of the work in that section?  Is it now up to date?  Can applicants expect to receive payment of their allowances as they become due?  I have not got the 1950 Act before me at the moment but perhaps the Minister could tell me what exactly Section 21 of that Act does.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a <Col N="130" /> matter in connection with the unestablished civil servant who, when he falls ill, may receive a weekly payment of £4.  He does not receive national health insurance.  Under the old rates he forfeited national health insurance to the extent of 22/6 per week.  There is now a deduction of £1 16s. under the new Act because the marriage allowance is deducted as well as the amount he himself receives.  Obviously that was not intended, and I do not believe the Minister would sanction that.  I have not the exact date before me because I only received particulars last night and I did not know then that I would have this opportunity of raising the matter.</P>
      <P>So far as the unestablished civil servant is concerned the increase in the national health is no use to him. There may be some mistake in interpretation. There may be a mistake in the Act or in the regulations made under the Act.  I want to take this opportunity of asking the Minister to put the matter right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Complaints of delays in the children's allowances section were very numerous after the new Act came into operation and I must admit that they were justified.  There was a good deal of confusion for some time after the new benefits became payable.  For the last two months or so I have not received any complaints.  I made inquiry a few weeks ago and I was told that the work is now up to date and correspondence is dealt with immediately. If there is any complaint I would like to have details of it, because any Minister for Social Welfare, and I am sure Deputy Norton will endorse this, would like to get genuine complaints in order to have them investigated. That is a good way of keeping the work up to a satisfactory level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount spent on Store Street is <Col N="131" /> almost £900,000 and £8,000 or £9,000 has been spent on furniture.  I do not know what the final bill for furniture will be but I will give the Deputy the information if I get notice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that this payment of £8,300?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  When this money was taken out of the fund to purchase the premises the fund naturally lost the interest.  The Minister for Finance gained on the other hand by having a premises supplied for which he would not have to pay and he very magnanimously agreed to pay the interest on the amount spent on the building into the fund.  This represents only a quarter's interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a different Minister for Finance from the present Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Minister has agreed to that.  The only thing is, he has raised the interest a bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>He has done that on everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a quarter's interest. The interest is somewhere between 4½ per cent. and 5 per cent.  If £1,000,000 is paid out by the end of this financial year then of course the interest will be the interest on £1,000,000 for 12 months.  Any Deputy can make the calculation for himself. The interest last year was £33,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it is a good proposition&mdash;a scheme by which the Minister pays interest at that rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the Minister for Finance builds the premises himself and says: &ldquo;That is your premises&rdquo; or whether he says: &ldquo;You can use that fund for building the premises&rdquo; then I must recoup the fund the interest it <Col N="132" /> would otherwise be earning.  I do not think it makes very much difference except that it gives the Minister more freedom in the building of the premises. Freedom of that sort carries responsibility and trouble.  I do not know which Minister gets off best in the transaction.</P>
      <P>In regard to the unestablished civil servant the practice is the same as many good employers adopt with their employees.  If their employee is out sick, many good employers continue to pay him his full salary for the week less what he receives for national health insurance.  If the man's salary was £5 a week, the employer gives him £2 10s.; he receives 50/- national health insurance and he is no worse off as far as income is concerned.  The same principle is adopted for the unestablished civil servant.  The Minister continues paying the full salary but he does not give him national health benefit.  The principle is the same; the payment is made in a different way.  It would be hardly fair to ask the Minister for Finance to pay more than the difference because if he did the man would be better off sick than working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the whole story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, that is the story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some unestablished civil servants get full sick pay less national health insurance benefit for a limited period when they are sick, but there are other unestablished civil servants who get only two-thirds pay less national health insurance when they are sick.  Take the case of a civil servant who had, let us say, £6 a week. When he was ill he used to get £4 a week from the Department and he got 22/6 from the National Health Insurance Society.  That meant that when he was sick he got £5 2s. 6d., losing 17/6 a week.  The Social Welfare Act of 1952 entitled him to 24/- a week for himself, 12/- for his wife and 7/- for each of two children.  The Department of Finance put out their greedy hand and said to that particular person: &ldquo;We are not merely going to deduct <Col N="133" /> from your pay 24/- for yourself, but we will deduct your wife's share as well; we are not going to stop there because we will also deduct allowances for each of your two children.&rdquo; Therefore, instead of deducting from the officer 22/- a week as previously they are now deducting 50/- a week from that person and he is getting less benefit than the Department of Finance, because the Department of Finance is raiding the Social Welfare Fund.  So far as the unestablished civil servant is concerned, the Social Welfare Act might as well have been passed for the benefit of the Department of Finance.  He is getting not one penny more, but the Department of Finance is now receiving 50/- a week from him if he has a wife and two children.  I think that is a shame, and I have no hesitation in telling the Department of Finance that.  It looks like highway robbery to take from the officer his wife's and children's allowances. If the Department of Finance is going to act in that way, in respect of the person who is not in receipt of his full pay through illness but only two-thirds of his pay, I suggest that the Minister is bound to take some steps to make at least the officer's wife's allowance and children's allowances inalienable so that the Department of Finance cannot get their hands on them.  It is completely against the spirit of the Act that the Department of Finance should raid the children's allowances and the wife's dependence allowance as well.  That is the situation, and the Department of Finance know that well, because it has been brought to their notice.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Store Street premises, could the Minister say how much it is anticipated the furnishing and equipment of the building will cost?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act, 1936, provided for the payment of pensions, gratuities and allowances to and in respect of former members of the 1st Battalion, Connaught Rangers, who joined the mutiny which took place in India in 1920 and who, as a result, were sentenced by general courtmartial to death, penal servitude or imprisonment for a period of 12 months or more. <Col N="136" /> Pensions payable under the Act are of three types&mdash;service pensions, wound pensions and disability pensions.</P>
      <P>At the present time, there are 29 former Connaught Rangers who are in receipt of service pensions and one has a disability pension.  No wound pensions or dependents' allowances are now being paid, nor will any such be payable in the future as the conditions of the Act of 1936 governing them can no longer arise.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the present Bill, therefore, is to increase, as from the 1st January, 1953, the amounts of the pensions at present being paid, and, as all these pensions are less than £100 a year, the proposed rate of increase is 50 per cent. which is the appropriate rate, having regard to the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1950, and the Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Bill, 1953.  The provision in this regard is contained in Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1936 provided for a system of abatement of Connaught Rangers' pensions by reference to receipts from public funds, similar to that which applies under the Military Service Pensions Acts.  As in the case of those Acts, it is now proposed to discontinue abatement as from the 1st January, 1953, and Section 3 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
      <P>That disposes of the Bill itself, but I am happy to be able to inform the House that it has been decided to make Connaught Rangers pensioners eligible for special allowances in the same way as, and at the rates and under the conditions applicable to, former members of the Old I.R.A. Provision to that effect will be made in the forthcoming Army Pensions Bill.  I feel sure that this proposal, as well as the provisions of the present Bill, will meet with the full approval of the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I think it will be welcomed by the House generally.  The substantial increase of 50 per cent. in pensions will be appreciated by members of the Connaught Rangers who are entitled to a pension.  The decision to remove the abatement, in accordance with the recent decisions in connection with military service pensions, will also be welcomed, but I think that the best aspect of the legislation is the provision whereby these men will be eligible for the special allowance.  I think the Minister is dealing with this matter in a generous way and that the improvement which he brings about by this Bill will be welcomed by ex-members of the Connaught Rangers and by the House generally.  When we do get an opportunity of congratulating a Minister on bringing in legislation of this kind, I think we should avail of it.</P>

I also welcome the Bill which I think is a very good measure but what a pity that we cannot do for the veterans of 1916-21 what we are now proposing to do for the ex-Connaught Rangers who mutinied in India.  We do not grudge the increase to those who are going to benefit by this Bill but, as I said some weeks ago, we should also try to implement the Military Service Pensions Acts by providing these pensions for the men who enabled us to obtain the quantum of freedom which we now enjoy.  As I have already said this State owes so much, if I might quote somebody else, to so few that we should make a serious effort to make the situation of these brave Irishmen at least comfortable for the remainder of their days.  The number of the veterans of 1916-21 is dwindling from year to year.  Year after year their numerical strength is decreasing and I would appeal to the Minister in his generosity to do for them what he now proposes doing for ex-members of the Connaught Rangers. We, country Deputies particularly, know all the disadvantages from which ex-I.R.A. men are suffering.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of this Bill is to enable established, i.e., permanent and pensionable, status to be conferred upon the forester staff of my Department without the necessity for the holding of a competition by the Civil Service Commissioners under the Civil Service Regulation Acts.  I feel sure that Deputies on all sides of the House will welcome the measure, and I do not think I need speak at length in support of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the administration of forestry in Ireland became the responsibility of a native Government there was a scheme afoot to grant pensionable status to at least a proportion of the <Col N="141" /> forester staff of the British Forestry Commission.  The scheme had not reached finality, however, at the time of the change of Government, and the matter was not pursued in the case of the Irish forestry service.  The question has been the subject of long standing and pressing representations from the forester staff.  Their claim has always had the full sympathy of my Department, but various difficulties of a general nature precluded a favourable decision in the past.</P>
    <P>There are at present 163 foresters serving in the Department and of these only one has the pensionable status and degree of permanence which is enjoyed by established civil servants. The exception I have mentioned is one officer remaining from a small group whose cases were dealt with under Section 12 of the Agriculture Act, 1931, as having had reckonable service remunerated out of some of the special funds mentioned in that section.  The employment of a forester is essentially permanent in character.  Once a forest is established there will always be need for a forester to take charge of its management.  Even if the forester who supervised the initial planting were a young man he could not hope to see the first crop reach maturity before he passed the normal age for retirement.  In such circumstances it is anomalous that the forester staff should be employed in a temporary capacity and denied any hope of enjoying a pension on retirement.</P>
    <P>When the decision was taken last year to grant established status to the foresters it was felt that the normal procedure of establishment by competition held under the Civil Service Regulation Acts would not be appropriate for a variety of reasons.  Since no future need for contraction of staff could be foreseen there was no reason for confining the benefits of establishment to a proportion of the forester staff and retaining the remainder on a temporary basis to provide against a future reduction in total numbers. There was therefore no question of selecting only the best qualified and most suitable officers for establishment and no real competitive requirement to be fulfilled.  Nor was there any <Col N="142" /> issue to be determined as to the standard of qualification of the officers affected.  Forestry development in this country is almost entirely the concern of the State and there are scarcely any opportunities outside the State Service for acquiring a good knowledge and experience of large-scale forestry work.  My Department's forester staff requirements normally have to be met by teaching and training suitable candidates at the State Forestry School.  Most of the present forester staff were so trained.</P>
    <P>They are all qualified and experienced officers already engaged on the work, and there is no need to test their qualifications and suitability for established forester posts by the holding of an examination.  In these circumstances establishment by way of a competition held by the Civil Service Commissioners would have been a futile and time-wasting procedure.  To give some appearance of real competition it would have been necessary to announce a limited number of vacancies but from the outset it would have been the intention to extend the successful list to include all candidates who qualified.  There were, furthermore, some technical difficulties in the way of the holding of a competition as, for example, the complications arising from the fact that four separate grades of forester were in question.  In effect, the situation was one which the Civil Service Regulation Acts were not designed to meet, and the Government felt that in this case rather than render a formal lip-service to the procedure ordained by the Civil Service Regulation Acts the proper course would be to seek the approval of the Oireachtas for a straightforward measure to enable the benefits of establishment to be conferred upon the forester staff without the formalities of a competition. That objective will be attained by Sections 2, 4 and 5 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The only other provision in the Bill is of a consequential nature.  Provided there are sufficient vacancies available, forestry trainees who satisfactorily complete their course of training and show promise of fitness for appointment as foresters enter the forester staff without undergoing a <Col N="143" /> competition&mdash;the course of training itself having been awarded on the results of a competition held by the Civil Service Commissioners.  Existing forestry trainees are not, however, eligible under their conditions of service for appointment as forester in an established capacity without competition. Section 3 of the Bill is designed to remove this difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of these things which it is as well to have done.  The Minister is to be congratulated on being able to side-track the Civil Service Commissioners.  I take it that the head forester and all those people who hold these appointments in Grades I, II and III, irrespective of their age, become permanent.  Is that assumption correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a pity that, having done so well, the Minister spoiled it a little by still having to get the concurrence of the Minister for Finance in his recommendations. Section 5 of the Bill reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The giving of a recommendation under this Act shall, without prejudice to the necessity of having the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, be within the absolute discretion of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I hope that he will hold that tight in his hand and will not let anyone in the Department of Finance or in the establishment section interfere with it.</P>
      <P>These men now become permanent officials of the Minister for Lands. That is a big step forward.  It is one that will have far-reaching effects.  I imagine that it will apply to other sections of State servants, and that this will be taken as a precedent for them. I think it is right that it should.  I hope that in other cases, where similar circumstances apply, the Ministers concerned will take their courage in their hands and come to this House to have legislation on these lines passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> I think it is going to assist forestry by giving those who are in charge of the work security of tenure in their employment. They are now to be made permanent, and I hope that they will give valuable service to the State in their new status.  I trust they will do the work which the nation requires to be done and that is to increase forestry generally.  As I have said, I do not know how the Minister got over the difficulty of being able to sidetrack the Act dealing with the Civil Service in this matter, or how he got the Minister for Finance to agree.  But, having achieved that, he is to be congratulated.</P>

      <P>This Bill is to be welcomed. It has been contemplated for a long time, and we are glad that, at last, we have it before us.  It is about time, I think, that foresters were put on the same footing and were granted the same rights and privileges as other State servants.  The foresters who will benefit directly from this Bill when it becomes an Act are fulfilling a very useful part in the life of the country. I should like to pay a tribute to them because I can speak from personal knowledge of their work.  I know and appreciate their work.  They are certainly equal to those in any similar service in Europe.  The work they have done over the years is a great credit to them.  They have a masterly knowledge of their work and are enthusiastic about it.  I am very proud indeed that this Bill, which gives the Minister power to establish them in their positions, has come before us.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward.  I hope that it will be the means of creating amongst our foresters a feeling of solidarity and security which, I am sorry to say, was lacking up to this.  It was possible, of course, for them to advance from the position of head forester to the inspectorial rank, but, in the case of the young foresters, promotion in that direction seemed a long way off.  I often felt that they were under the impression that they were not getting a fair deal from the State which they were serving so well and so faithfully.</P>

    <P>As regards the Bill itself, there are <Col N="145" /> some points on which I should like to get more information, and others on which I want to offer some criticism. I should like, first of all, to refer to sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 2 which read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where on the passing of this Act a person holds a situation to which this section applies, the Civil Service Commissioners may, on the recommendation of the Minister given with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, grant to him a certificate of qualification for that situation.</P>
    <P>(2)  A certificate under this section shall be expressed to take effect from the date of the passing of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the adoption of these two sub-sections would nullify, to a very great extent, the good effects of the Bill, and I would urge on the Minister the necessity of altering them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>You mean that their service is to count only from the date of the passing of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  My reading of the Bill would lead me to the conclusion that the period of service by the foresters prior to getting the certificate will not be taken into account in computing their pension.  Therefore, they will be placed at a disadvantage when compared with the position of other civil servants.  While this Bill represents a step forward in their case, that is a matter which, I think, should be corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 15 foresters over 50 years of age.  I know there is a statute in existence which debars civil servants over 50 years of age from being established. I should like to have information from the Minister as to whether those 15 foresters, of all grades, who are over 50 years of age will be entitled to a certificate under this Bill or whether they will be debarred by previous legislation, or whether the sub-sections I have referred to are due to an oversight in the drafting of the Bill&mdash;that is to say that a previous enactment passed, I think, in 1925 was not repealed for the sake of those <Col N="146" /> foresters.  Five of the foresters have from 28 to 30 years' service; one has 25 years' service; three have 23 years' service; 74 have from ten to 20 years' service.  I have taken their cases, and I have made a rough and ready calculation as to what it would cost the Minister for Finance extra to include them and give them the same benefits as civil servants with the same period of service in other Departments.  I think I am not far wrong in saying that if they were included, and got the same terms as other civil servants, the extra cost would not be more than £3,500.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but according as each forester had reached retirement age and started to draw his pension. The total sum, I think, after a period of from 12, 14 or 15 years, would reach £3,500.  In the first seven or eight years after the passing of the Act, it would not be more than £20 to £100 per year.</P>
      <P>The Minister can take it that Deputies on all sides of the House are very proud of the work which the foresters are doing.  A forester in charge of a forestry centre in the country may have charge of from 20 men to 70 or 80 men.  It is these head foresters who are really doing the work.  They give advice to the Minister, to a great extent, when offers of land reach the Department.  They advise as to whether the land offered is suitable for planting or not.  It is he who must lay out the particular piece of land and advise his superior officers as to the best species of trees to plant and the species most likely to succeed in the particular soil.  He must estimate the drainage to be carried out and the preliminary soil preparation necessary, and he must supervise it all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my personal knowledge, most foresters work overtime to keep the accounts right.  They take such a keen interest in their work that they stay on the mountainside and the bogs where the men are working while there is light in the sky, particularly in the winter time.  Then some of them have to do three or four hours' overtime to <Col N="147" /> keep accounts right and to reply to queries from the Department.  If the Minister were to tell us how many foresters have fallen from the path of virtue since the establishment of the Forestry Division, the number would be very small, and would compare more than favourably with any other branch of the State service.</P>
    <P>I admit I am putting up a strong plea for these men.  During the period that I was in charge of the Department of Lands I took a very keen interest in their work and I have yet to discover a lazy or backward forester.  I never met one that was not like a dynamo, full of enthusiasm for the particular work.  So much so, that at times one of the faults I had to find with them was that they would recommend the planting of the best arable land in the country, if they got their way.  That is the best compliment I can pay them. The trouble was to keep them in check.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave me some figures the other day which are, roughly, that there are nine foresters with from 20 to 30 years' service; 74 with from ten to 20 years' service; and 80 with service less than that.  It is the first category with which I am particularly concerned. Will they get the same benefit or will they not?  The amount of money involved will not develop into a substantial sum for perhaps 12 years and even then it would be no larger than £3,500 to £4,000 a year.  That is a rough and ready calculation I made in trying to estimate the cost.  Only one has 30 years' service; two have 29 years' service; two, 28 years' service; one, 25 years' service; one, 23 years' service.  It will be another ten to 15 years before these are due to retire.  There would be only nine who would benefit within the next 20 years.  If the Minister amends the Bill in the way I suggest the amount involved will be small. These men should be put on the same footing as other State servants.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The giving of a recommendation under this Act shall, without prejudice to the necessity of having the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, be within the absolute discretion of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> That is the Minister for Lands. According to Section 2 he must have the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  Is there something wrong with the drafting of the Bill here? Section 5 would seem to invalidate or at least negative the provisions about the Minister for Finance in the earlier sections.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister God-speed with the Bill and I would ask him to amend the Bill in the way I have suggested. If the amendments do not appear from the hand of the Minister, they will appear from my hand or from the hand of someone on this side of the House. The Minister would be well advised to bring the forestry service into line with all the other Departments of State in this matter.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom comhgháirdeachas a afráil leis an Aire as an gcéim seo atá sé ar thob a ghlacadh, is é sin, gradam stáitsheirbhiseach a thabhairt do na foraoiseoirí. Is maith an rud é agus is maith liom a fheiceáil go bhfuil an chéim seo ghá glacadh agus comhartha é go bhfuil an tAire agus Coimisiún na Talún, Rannóg na Foraoise, ag glacadh na ceiste dáríre agus chun foraoiseoireacht sa tír seo a chur ar ghradam mar ba chóir.</P>
      <P>Is maith an rud é go mbeidh scrúduithe do stát-sheirbhísigh mar is é an t-aon tslí amháin é chun na daoine is fearr a phiocadh, ach tá ceist speisialta anseo agus mar adúirt an tAire nuair bhí sé ag caint, ní fhéadfaí é a réiteach trí scrúdú; agus ghlac an tAire an chéim ba chóir a ghlacadh chun na daoine seo a bhunú sa tseirbhís.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire mar gheall ar oibritheoirí a ghlacfar isteach san am atá le teacht. Dúirt sé go dtabharfaí tréineáil dóibh i bhforaoiseacht, go mbeidh scrúdú chun dul ar an chúrsa tréineála sin agus ansin go bpiocfaí na daoine&mdash;níl a fhios agam ar dhúirt sé na daoine go léir&mdash;isteach sa tseirbhís, nó an bpiocfaí na daoine is fearr.  Má ghlacann daoine dream ar bith de bhuachaillí agus má tugtar tréineáil dóibh, ní hé sin le rá go mbeidh gach duine acu fóirstineach don tslí bheatha a dtugtar tréineáil dóibh ar a son.  Má chuireann tú dream fir óga ar treineáil i gcóir <Col N="149" /> foraoiseoireachta agus má tá, agus is dóigh liom go mbeidh, i ngach buíon a cuirtear ar an tréineáil sin, duine nach mbeidh fóirstineach don phost ar chor ar bith, conas, dá bhrigh sin, mura mbíonn an dara scrúdú ann, a bheifear ábalta a rá cé atá fóirstineach agus cé nach bhfuil?</P>
    <P>Pointe eile a thugaim don Aire&mdash; luaigh An Teachta Blathmhare an rud céanna: Na foraoiseoirí seo a bhfuil seirbhís, abair, 20 bliain nó 15 bliana, nó 30 bliain, tugtha acu, an gcuirfear san áireamh an tréimhse sin i gcóir pinsin, is é sin le rá, má tá&mdash;agus tá&mdash; tréimhse fhada tugtha, deirim gur ceart an tréimhse sin, pé acu atá sé fada nó gairid, a chur san áireamh chun pinsin a thabhairt do na daoine seo.</P>
    <P>Tá buntáiste ag baint leis an Bhille seo.  Beidh a fhios ag na daoine seo anois go mbeidh post seasmhach acu. Cuirfidh siad níos mó suime ina gcuid oibre ná mar a chuirfeadh dá mbeadh siad ag súil ó lá go lá go gcuirfí as an tseirbhís iad.  Beidh siad ábalta suim a chur ina gcuid oibre ós rud é go bhfuil post buan seasmhach acu.</P>
    <P>Deirim, mar adúirt An Teachta Blathmharc go bhfuil obair an-tábhachtach ghá dhéanamh ag na daoine seo.  Is féidir go mbeidh líon na bhforaoiseoirí ag dul i méid ó bhliain go bliain, is é sin le rá, i ndeireadh 10 mbliana tá súil agam go mbeidh a dheich n-oiread d'oibritheoirí ann agus atá anois ach ba mhaith liom an pointe sin mar gheall ar dhaoine a tabharfar isteach sa tseirbhís san am le theacht, ba mhaith liom iad a thabhairt isteach trí scrúdú agus go mbeadh scrúdú eile ina dhiaidh sin chun daoine nach bhfuil fóirstineach don obair a bhaint amach agus a chur ar leataobh.  Is pointe tábhachtach é, tar éis cúrsa tréineála go mbeadh scrúdú ann chun na daoine nach bhfuil fóirstineach agus nach mbeidh ariamh, iad a phiocadh amach.  Dá bhrí sin, ba mhaith liom nach nglacfaí an tslí seo chun lads óga eile a thabhairt isteach sa tseirbhís a glactar sa tseirbhís go ginearálta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the last speaker and Deputy Blowick in congratulating the Minister on this very excellent measure.  There <Col N="150" /> is no use in criticising the Minister or his predecessor for what happened years ago.  I suppose the old saying &ldquo;better late than never&rdquo; applies in this case.  It is important that the House should realise that the work of the Forestry Department, little and all as some of us think it is, could not be carried out without the active help and the intelligent direction of these foresters.  The work performed by these men is similar to that of commandants, captains and lieutenants in the Army while on active service. These are the men who have to carry out the hard work of leadership and guidance on the field of battle, and in the planting and the planning which is necessary for the carrying out of the afforestation programme the foresters have played a very important part. For that reason I think it is all the more extraordinary that after a service of 30 years or more by some of these foresters it is only now that legislation is being introduced to establish them; in other words, that these men have been employed in a temporary capacity for the last 30 years or more working energetically and earnestly on behalf of the State.</P>
      <P>This measure is one which I am sure all sides of the House will welcome.  I should like to impress on the Minister also that all sides of the House would like him to give sympathetic attention to the suggestion made by Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Blowick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to these foresters is similar to that of many other unestablished ranks in the Civil Service and, without widening the scope of the discussion, I suggest to the Minister that a forester who has given 20 or 30 years' service to the State and who is to be established under this Bill, unless his previous service in a temporary capacity is allowed for, will have very little opportunity to take advantage of what should have been his right for the last 20 or 30 years.  Some of us would wish to put down amendments to improve the section in the Bill dealing with the pensionable service of the foresters, but these amendments would in all probability be ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  I should like, therefore, to impress on the Minister that <Col N="151" /> these foresters should get full recognition for the service they have given to the State in a temporary capacity up to the present.  I think it is only fair that we should consider especially the position of the older men.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick said that the effect of this Bill will be to give a sense of security to those men who have worked so hard up to the present, and that it will be an encouragement to the right type of men in future to go into forestry work.  It may be the first step towards that real expansion we are all so anxious to see in forestry in this country.  Deputy Blowick mentioned that these men had to be held back, that they were straining at the leash at times, and were urging that more work should be done in connection with reafforestation.  That is a splendid recommendation for these men.  I am only sorry that that spirit did not move more than the foresters, that the heads of the Department and the Minister himself were not prodded into action earlier by the wishes of these men who are trying to help in connection with this matter.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on the good work he has done by introducing this Bill, and I hope he will see his way to consider amendments which may be submitted to improve the Bill as far as we are concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has taken courage at last to bring in this measure.  It is a ridiculous state of affairs to have an employee in any undertaking for three or four or five years without his being given permanent status.  In industrial employment a man is considered to be a permanent employee after 12 months' continual service, while in the Forestry Department and other branches of the Civil Service we have men and women with 20, 25 and 30 years' service still without the status of permanent employees.  I hope the Minister will give credit to these men for the years of temporary service which they have given.  I know employees who had given from 15 to 25 years' service before they were established and when they were established they were only <Col N="152" /> given credit for four years out of that period of temporary service.</P>

    <P>The Vote on Account is an annual feature of our financial procedure. Both this Vote and the Central Fund Bill which gives it statutory confirmation must be passed before the beginning of the new financial year.  The Vote on Account, as its name implies, is a provision on account, usually a four months' provision, towards meeting expenditure on Supply Services in the new financial year.  It is the practice to obtain by means of the Vote on Account enough money to enable the public services to be carried on during the period from 1st April to 31st July, in which month the Appropriation Act is usually passed. As Deputies are aware the Dáil grants supply only for the service of a particular financial year and, consequently, moneys granted by the Central Fund and Appropriation Acts are available only for use in the year in which they are voted.  If there were, for instance, a surplus on the Votes for the current year, that surplus could not be carried over into 1953-54.  It would have to be surrendered and would not be available to defray expenditure in the next financial year.  In order, therefore, that Government services should not be brought to a standstill at the close of business on 31st of the present month, it is necessary by a Vote on Account for Dáil Éireann to grant a sufficient sum to cover expenditure on Supply Services in 1953-54 until such time, at least, as the Estimates for that year have been discussed and approved by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is, as Deputies are aware, customary to provide in the Vote on Account for a sum approximating to one-third of the total of the Estimates.  This proportion is subject to variation in the case of particular Estimates depending on whether the payments arising on them are expected to be heavier or lighter in the part of the year covered by the Vote.  The amount asked for in this year's Vote on <Col N="155" /> Account is, as stated in the Resolution, £34,185,410.</P>
    <P>Deputies have no doubt noted that the net total of the Estimates for the Supply Services for the coming year is £100,548,106, representing an increase of £5,676,483 on the figure published in the Volume of Estimates for 1952-53. I shall mention later how this increase arises.  Meanwhile, however, regard should be had to the alterations which were made in the 1952-53 figure in the 1952 Budget.  It will be recalled that this Budget provided first of all for heavy extra expenditure on social welfare services, which was offset by savings on food subsidies.  Allowing for these changes, but ignoring the sum of £1,000,000 which was also included to cover unspecified Supplementary Estimates, the net figure for the Supply Services in 1952-53 was £93,954,000; so that the increased sum required to pay for these services in 1953-54 is, accordingly, £6,594,000.</P>
    <P>The Vote on Account, founded as it is on the detailed Estimates of public expenditure set out in the Volume of Estimates, presents a statistical survey of public policy, as formulated by successive Governments and endorsed by Dáil Éireann.  The policy finds expression to a large extent in voted public expenditure, the details of which are shown in the Volume.  As Minister for Finance, being not only a member of Dáil Éireann and of the Government but also the custodian of the public purse, I find myself in a difficult position when I come to speak on the Vote on Account.  I certainly cannot approach the question with the single-minded irresponsibility of certain Private Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You are the most irresponsible Deputy in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of Dáil Éireann and of the Government which is responsible to Dáil Éireann, I share, of course, public responsibility for the public policy embodied in the Estimates for the year 1953-54.  Like all the other members of the House I share responsibility for the extra expenditure on social assistance, on <Col N="156" /> health services, on teachers' pensions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>And on racehorses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and on the remuneration of the Civil Service.  On the other hand, it will fall to me, in formulating the Budget, to try to reconcile this policy and these expenditures with the country's capacity to pay.  It is only natural, therefore, that I as Minister for Finance should be concerned at the evidence which the Estimates for 1953-54 present that State expenditure still continues to mount until, without any allowance whatsoever being made for contingencies, it has now reached the point where the Supply Services require over £100,000,000 in one year.</P>
      <P>How has this increase arisen?  To answer that question it is necessary for me to refer briefly to the main services which show an increase as compared with the current financial year. Normally, as I have indicated, comparison should be made with the original Estimates for the expiring year, but it has been necessary during the year to ask for several Supplementary Estimates, often for appreciable amounts.  Apart from the extra outlay on social welfare, these heavy demands were not and could not have been foreseen when the Budget was being drawn up, though a modest allowance was made to cover contingencies. There is nothing very unusual in the emergence during the year of unexpected demands of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been in fact the normal experience and the year which is just closing is merely repeating it.  Perhaps I should say here that the total amount provided by Supplementary Estimates in 1952-53 is £9,281,735, or almost £10,000,000 as Deputy Morrissey has reminded me, of which £4,526,915 relates to services other than social welfare, and a considerable sum, I think it is £1,100,000, represents an additional payment made to the undertaking of which Deputy Morrissey was at least the putative <Col N="157" /> parent; I refer to C.I.E.  Even if the amount of these supplementaries is taken into consideration in comparing the provision for the two years, the increase in the 1953-54 provision over the total provision for 1952-53 is still as much as £2,981,348.</P>
      <P>Supplementary Estimates are bugbears of every Minister for Finance. Unfortunately they are a recurring phenomenon.  No year has been free from them, and it would be unrealistic to suppose that 1953-54 will be different in that respect, although every effort must be made and will be made to prevent their occurrence.  For the purpose of our comparison with last year, therefore, I shall leave the Supplementary Estimates out of account and, in general, I shall refer back to the original provision in 1952-53.  Where, however, the picture has been significantly altered by Supplementary Estimates like that taken for C.I.E. in 1952-53, I shall draw attention to them.</P>
      <P>For the coming year the largest increases are to be found in the Estimates for Health, Social Welfare and Defence.  There are significant increases as well on the Votes for Local Government, Primary Education, Lands, Forestry, Wireless Broadcasting, Army Pensions and Tourism. Broadly speaking, in so far as public outlay on the Supply Services sustains employment, welfare and individual incomes, the Estimates show that these effects will not be diminished in 1953-54 as compared with any preceding year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of the net increase in the Health Estimate is accounted for by the fact that, owing to the exhaustion of the capital of the Hospitals' Trust Fund, it has become necessary to supplement the resources of that fund by direct Exchequer grants in order that the hospital building programme may proceed.  In 1953-54 the assistance required from the Exchequer is expected to amount to what I might truthfully describe as the enormous sum of £4,500,000.  In addition to this, grants to health authorities towards the cost of public health services show an increase of £833,000 on the original provision for 1952-53 or of £253,000 if the Supplementary Estimate which the <Col N="158" /> Dáil has recently passed is taken into account.</P>
    <P>On the social welfare side, at very little under £20,000,000, State expenditure has expanded so enormously that not merely is it demanding the £4,754,810 which was provided by Supplementary Estimates in 1952-53, but on top of this again it wants a further £1,708,322 in 1953-54.  Put in another way, social welfare expenditure will cost £6,463,132 more in the coming year than was originally provided in 1952-53, i.e., before the additional and compensatory benefits granted under the Social Welfare Acts, 1952, were taken into account.</P>
    <P>The principal elements in the increase of £6,463,132 are: Contributory Social Welfare Services, £920,700; Old Age Pensions, £1,207,000; Children's Allowances, £2,794,000; Unemployment Assistance, £340,000; and Widows' and Orphans' Non-Contributory Pensions, £840,000.</P>
    <P>One might say here that this £6,463,132 represents performance as against the promise of our predecessors. It will be observed that there has been a reorganisation of the social welfare group of Estimates designed to show clearly the provision for the contributory and non-contributory services. The Social Insurance Estimate covers the contributory services and the Social Assistance Estimate the non-contributory services.  Costs of administration of £587,000 are provided for in the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Defence Estimate is up by £1,381,350 compared with the original provision for 1952-53.  The increase arises mainly under the heads of Pay (£172,466), Provisions and Allowances in lieu (£179,637), and Defensive Equipment (£949,311).  The increase under the two former heads arises mostly from the increase in numbers due to the successful recruiting drive. The increased expenditure on defensive equipment is required to provide the Army with additional and up-to-date equipment without which it could not be maintained as an effective force. Defence is another service for which the original provision for 1952-53 was found to be inadequate with the result, <Col N="159" /> as is well within the recollection of Deputies, that Supplementary Estimates totalling £715,000, mainly for defensive equipment, had to be taken. If allowance is made for the Supplementary Estimates the increase of the Vote as a whole is £666,350.</P>
    <P>There are substantial and significant increases on certain items in the Estimate for Agriculture.  The amount demanded by the land reclamation scheme, now generally known as the land rehabilitation project, having undergone a transmutation and baptism in the three years 1948 to 1951, is up by no less than £897,304 over the original figure for the current financial year.  The figure for ground limestone subsidy at £600,000 is double the original figure in the 1952-53 Estimates, while the provision for advances under the Grain Storage (Loans) Act, 1951, is quadrupled at £200,000.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the non-recurrence of the repayable advances to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann for the importation of superphosphates and a prospective receipt of £500,000 in repayment of these advances, together with certain substantial reductions under other sub-heads, have made it possible to reduce the Estimate in the first instance by £1,738,920 as compared with the aggregate of £7,264,230 which was voted for this financial year.  I mentioned that it has been possible to reduce the Agricultural Estimate in the first instance by almost £1,750,000.  A further reduction in the total of the Estimate has been secured since the Estimate was sent for final printing, and as a result of this it will not be necessary for the Dáil to vote the £162,000 in respect of storage charges on butter cold stored to meet next year's winter consumption. Instead this charge will now fall to be met out of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund which, as older members of the House will recollect, was established under the Act passed in 1933, and was of such material assistance to the dairying industry during the pre-war depression.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> There is as I have already mentioned an increase in the demand for the Department of Local Government and an important item contributing to it is the provision of £400,000 for grants to local authorities for the improvement of roads in the Gaeltacht and congested areas.  This expenditure which is being undertaken to encourage and develop the tourist industry in these districts will also give considerable employment in them.  There is a large increase, to be exact £300,000, in the amount to be provided for grants for the purchase, erection and reconstruction of dwelling houses by private individuals and public utility societies.</P>
    <P>As Deputies who were members of the last Dáil will, no doubt, recall, the Transition Development Fund which had been established by the present Minister for External Affairs, my colleague Deputy Aiken, when he was Minister for Finance, was wound up on 31st March, 1951.  The undischarged commitments of the fund are, of course, dwindling each year, a fact which is responsible for the decrease of £350,000 in the appropriate sub-head. I mention that and I emphasise it in order that this reduction will not be misrepresented in the manner in which it was misrepresented in this House in the debate on the Vote on Account last year.  This decrease of £350,000, arising mainly from the action taken by our predecessors is, of course, much more than counterbalanced by increased State advances and increased subsidies towards housing loan charges. The sub-head, &ldquo;Grants to Local Authorities under the Local Authorities (Works) Act,&rdquo; is reduced by £250,000, but against this reduction we may set the proposed outlay of £400,000 on Gaeltacht roads and the increase of almost £900,000 as compared with the original Estimate in the provision for land rehabilitation both of which will be supplementary in their effect on employment to the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>There is an increase on the Vote for Primary Education which is attributable in the main to improved superannuation terms for teachers.  The Supplementary Estimate of £167,300 recently taken was mainly for expendi- <Col N="161" /> ture involved in increased benefits for teachers who had already retired. Including the Supplementary Estimate in the calculation, the net increase on the Vote is £177,140.  May I appeal to the Chair that, if Deputy Dillon and Deputy Norton want to engage in a conversation, there is a smoke room behind the Division Lobby?</P>

      <P>On the Vote for Lands, the provision is £135,000 greater than the original provision for 1952-53, arising mainly on the improvement of estates, etc.  The Forestry Estimate also shows an increase, being £295,100 more than the original Estimate for the current financial year.  More land is now being acquired and more employment is being given in looking after existing forests and preparing the ground for new plantings.  In that connection, I should like to give the House some very illuminating figures.  For the year which ended on the 31st March, 1951, the gross expenditure from the Vote for Forestry amounted to £800,000 approximately.  May I repeat that for the year ended on 31st March, 1951, the last year of the Coalition, the gross expenditure for the Vote for Forestry amounted to £800,000 approximately. It is estimated that the corresponding figure for the coming year will be £1,391,050, or almost £600,000 more.  It will be noted that I have given figures for gross expenditure.  In each year this gross expenditure was reduced by certain Appropriations-in-Aid, these appropriations being almost entirely receipts from forests and saw-mills.  In 1950-51 these amounted to £126,000 thus making the net expenditure from the Vote in that year £674,000.  For the coming year they are expected to increase to about £170,000, which will leave £1,220,000 as the net amount to be provided out of voted moneys for the forestry services.  Thus the net amount which we are asking for forestry in the coming financial year is exactly 84 per cent. greater than in the last year of the preceding Government.</P>

      <P>The growth in the receipts from State forests and saw-mills is noteworthy and deserves some further elucidation, particularly when we recall that for the year 1939-40, income from these sources amounted only to £17,500.  Eight years later, however, in 1947-48, it had increased, almost six-fold, to £99,700; and next year, as I have said, it is expected to be not less than £170,000.  I need not remind the Dáil that this substantial and increasing income is being derived from trees and forests planted many years ago under the Fianna Fáil afforestation programme and while we have not, so far, derived a penny-piece from what the Coalition spent on this service I am glad that the Deputies find their record in regard to this service a source of amusement.</P>

      <P>We did not ask the Dáil to provide money which we never intended to spend.  We did not ask the Dáil to provide money when we were unable to procure the land.  We built up a reserve of plantation land which was there available to maintain a carefully calculated and planned afforestation programme.  Unfortunately, that is not the situation which we have inherited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the Vote for Industry and Commerce, the progress being made on rural electrification&mdash;another Fianna Fáil project&mdash;is reflected in the increase of £400,000 in the amount required for subsidy which this year is expected to absorb over £900,000.  A <Col N="163" /> sum of £240,000 is being provided under the head of fuel subsidy, compared with the token provision of £5 in 1952-53.  This amount is required to cover losses connected with the stocks of coal accumulated by Fuel Importers, Limited.  It is proposed to reduce these stocks during the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>At first sight, a person looking at the Estimates might think that the provision in the Industry and Commerce Estimates for semi-automatic turf production is less than last year by as much as £239,110.  The gross provision for this item, however, has to be considered in relation to the credit item of receipts from sales, and on this basis the reduction is £95,360. I regret that I have to say that turf production by semi-automatic processes has not justified itself, as costs are very high and it is difficult to dispose of the finished product.  A less uneconomic method of maintaining and utilising the product of labour on the smaller bogs is to be tried by erecting small turf-driven generating stations at suitable points.  This has already been announced, and I understand that the Dáil have approved of the project.  The total of the grants for Bord na Móna housing, which shows a decrease of £268,620, is related to the rate of building justifying disbursements of grants on the present statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The provision for An Foras Tionscal, which is £150,000 less than for 1952-53, represents merely a more realistic assessment than was possible last year of the amount likely to be spent.  It does not represent any change of policy.  It merely indicates that experience has taught us that demands which are likely to be made under this sub-head for this purpose are not as great as we had anticipated.  The same remark applies to the provision for technical assistance.  Provision for expenditure under this heading is now made in the Votes for the Departments sponsoring technical assistance projects, which is a more convenient way of dealing with the matter than having a separate Vote.</P>
    <P>I come now to the Vote for Transport and Marine Services.  A sum of <Col N="164" /> £1,300,000 was originally provided, as the House knows, for C.I.E. in 1952-53. Unfortunately, this proved inadequate and, as I have already mentioned, further assistance to the extent of £1,100,000 had to be made available. This year we are providing in the Vote a sum of £1,500,000.  This is intended as a maximum subvention from public moneys for this undertaking which has drained the Exchequer of millons of pounds over the past few years.  I feel that I should refer here to a statement which was made during a recent debate on a Supplementary Estimate by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He issued a warning against any assumption that there is some bottomless well of Government subsidies which may be drawn upon when wage increases are being sought and being granted.  As reported in Volume 136, column 1410, of the Official Report, the Tánaiste said&mdash;and it may be well to repeat and emphasise it&mdash;that &ldquo;wage increases or other variations in operating costs would, in future, be offset as far as possible by increases in fares and charges and if these increases in fares and charges should cause a falling-off in traffic that situation will have to be dealt with by a reduction of services and a reduction of services may involve a reduction of staffs.&rdquo;  That is a hard economic fact which it is necessary for us who are concerned with this problem to face.  As I have said, in fixing this figure of £1,500,000 as the amount of subsidy which C.I.E. may be expected or may be entitled to get this year, we are fixing it, I trust, as a maximum. It will be necessary, therefore, for every person interested in this undertaking to bear that fact in mind when they are making demands or when they are organising and providing services.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything about the G.N.R.  Company, as the Tánaiste referred to it last week when moving the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I think the appropriate time for further comment will be when the Bill covering the acquisition comes before the House.  It will suffice, I think, to say that the amount provided approximates to the original and supplementary provision for 1952-53 but is. <Col N="165" /> £185,000 more than the original provision alone.</P>
    <P>There is a net decrease of £354,700 in the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  This decrease is mainly attributable to reduced expenditure on stores.  The revised plans for financing and operating Radio Eireann were announced last November. The Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting reflects these changes.  Henceforward, in the normal year, the income of Radio Eireann should cover its expenditure and will be expected to do so.  This will not be the case, however, in the coming year mainly because it is proposed to provide new transmitters, which are estimated to cost £115,000, and which, we anticipate, will give a better service to the listening public.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the Defence Force as a major head of the increased expenditure in 1953-54.  There is, however, an increase in the provision for Army Pensions.  As will be seen, the bulk of the increase of £291,510 on this Estimate arises on the sub-head for Military Service Pensions, and is due to provision being included conditionally for the increases in pensions which will take place subject to the enactment of the Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Bill.</P>
    <P>To conclude this commentary on the Estimates, I should mention that £375,000 is being provided specifically under Vote 67 in the coming year for the development of the tourist industry.  This is £140,000 more than last year.  In addition, however, to this specific sum of £375,000 there are other provisions in the Estimates which will also materially contribute to the expansion of what is now, after much misrepresentation, acknowledged by all Parties to be at least our second most important industry.  I have already referred to the sum of £400,000 which is being made available for the improvement of roads conducive to the development of the tourist industry in the Gaeltacht and congested areas.  A sum of £7,550, small, of course, by comparison with the other items, is also being provided out of the Transport and Marine Services Vote for works on railway premises at Cobh to improve accommodation <Col N="166" /> for tourists entering there, and in addition to what is spent under Vote 67 itself, money will also be spent out of the Vote for Public Works and Buildings on National Monuments, the preservation of which in other countries is regarded as being not merely a patriotic duty but a work which gives an adequate commercial return.</P>
    <P>I come now to deal with an aspect of the Estimates which has provoked some controversy in the past.  However, the pros and cons of setting apart certain items of expenditure in the Supply Services and dubbing them as capital and proclaiming that they are proper to be met from borrowing, have been sufficiently discussed before this, and I do not intend to enter upon the subject now.  I might mention, however, for the information of the House, that the amount provided in 1953-54 for the &ldquo;capital services&rdquo; designated as such in 1951-52 is £9,366,000, as against £9,277,000 in 1952-53.  The services in question were detailed in the preface to the 1951-52 Volume of Estimates. Now, before I conclude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not.  At this stage I must emphasise that the Vote on Account refers only to the Supply Services Estimates, and that these do not present a full picture of State expenditure.  The account, in fact, can be completed only when the requirements for Central Fund Services and &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; issues have been finally ascertained.  As is usual, the estimates under these heads will be included in the White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure issued prior to the Financial Statement.  The White Paper also, as its title implies, presents estimates of the yield of revenue at existing rates of taxation and of receipts on capital account.  This general assessment of next year's finances cannot yet be formulated and it seems to me, therefore, that the time for reviewing the economic and financial background generally and the demands of the Supply Services is in relation to the budgetary proposals for <Col N="167" /> 1953-54.  I do not think I can be expected at this stage to enlarge on these topics or to defend or announce budgetary policy.  I must say, however, that unless present rates of public expenditure are substantially reduced, the present indications are that the problem of next year's budget will be grave and difficult.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I am anxious to know what the Dáil is going to do about this matter.  To all responsible people the steady increase in the scope and cost of the public services must be a matter of great concern.  Year by year the proportion of the national income taken for public services is rising and the proportion that is left to the individuals who produce that income to spend as they desire is decreasing.  In this House, particularly in recent years, we have become so accustomed to thinking in terms of millions that an entirely uncritical attitude has developed with regard to proposals for extension of State Services.</P>

      <P>That is precisely the point I am coming to.  Deputies who are most critical of expenditure which will be reproductive and become a source of income to the community are themselves most vociferous in demanding expenditure which will yield no return whatsoever.  Expenditure is advocated by them without any genuine attempt to consider the feasibility of raising the money to meet it.  Notwithstanding all that has been said by these Deputies on the score of excessive taxation and on the score of the cost of living, I have no doubt that there would be clamant resistance from them to any measures designed to reduce existing services or to estop proposals to increase them.  It is inevitable, however, I think, that serious measures will have to be taken to bring State expenditure into line with the capacity and, what is equally important, the willingness of the public to bear the <Col N="168" /> cost and in the coming year this will be the main purpose of the Government. Supply Estimates have now passed the £100,000,000 mark and it is imperative that the rise should be halted.  Positive steps will have to be taken to that end but these will require further consideration.  In the meantime, however, one thing can be done readily and in this connection I am authorised to say that the Government have decided to adopt the principle of the motion before the Dáil in the name of Deputy Sheldon providing for the appointment of a committee of public expenditure.  What will be the activities of the committee will naturally be asked.</P>

      <P>One can visualise the work of such a committee as that projected by Deputy Sheldon as a continuous operation, taking various sectors of the Estimates in turn and carrying out a detailed inquiry into each one of them, not with the object necessarily of making any report or recommendation within a time limit, but of providing material and conclusions which would be of use in achieving economy in future expenditure and administration.  In Britain, experiments in the establishment of parliamentary committees and subcommittees of the kind envisaged by Deputy Sheldon have a history of some 50 years.  Not all of these experiments have been successful.  Not all of them have been useful.  Not all of the committees appointed have been able to do anything significant, but, from 1946 onwards, an Estimates Committee has been functioning in the House of Commons, and it is claimed that it is fulfilling a very useful purpose.  The Government, therefore, will, in due course, propose that a committee on similar lines should be set up by Dáil Eireann.</P>

      <P>I was saying that in due course the Government will ask the Dáil to set up a committee on similar lines to the Estimates Committee which has already been functioning so usefully elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Let us be quite clear about this. The usefulness of the proposed committee will be dependent on many factors which only experience will resolve but it is to be hoped, and I think it may be expected, that the real gain from it will be twofold.  First, it will serve to focus the attention of Dáil Eireann as a whole upon the importance of achieving economy in public expenditure, that is, in carrying out the policies for the time being in force and, secondly, it will strongly reinforce the responsibility on Departments of ensuring that wasteful administration and unnecessary use of public money will be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> I do not think it would be fair or just if what I said in that latter regard would be considered as reflecting on the existing administration of the Departments.  I am perfectly certain that the majority of the officers who are concerned with the direction and administration of these Departments are as zealous and as anxious as any member of Dáil Eireann to ensure that waste will not occur and that extravagance will not prevail.  But, Departments grow up over a great number of years; they fall into an accepted way of working and it is difficult often for the higher officers, many of them very hard pressed, to find time to ask themselves: &ldquo;Is this the best way, is this the best procedure for doing such and such a thing?&rdquo; They are content, so long as the machine works under them and so long as they get reasonable results, to allow it to continue its traditional way.</P>
    <P>The fact that there would be a Committee of the Dáil which would scrutinise the administrative methods of Departments would at least impress the officers with the need to consider whether, after all, because it was done this way 20 years ago or 50 years ago it must continue to be done this way to-day.</P>
    <P>This Committee, I should also point out, will not overlap with the work of the Public Accounts Committee.  The work of the Public Accounts Committee is a specialised type of work.  It is merely concerned to ensure that money expended comes within the ambit of the Vote and has been properly expended in accordance with the expressed policy of Dáil Eireann.  If the Comptroller and Auditor-General does not note that there is any doubt about a particular item of expenditure being in accordance with the Vote or coming within the ambit of the Vote it is 100 to one that no member of the Public Accounts Committee will think of asking whether other expenditures have been justifiably incurred in the sense that only as much money as was absolutely necessary to procure the objective aimed at had in fact been expended.  Therefore, as I said, I do not think there will be any overlapping between the work of the Committee which Deputy Sheldon proposes and <Col N="171" /> the existing operations and responsibilities of the Public Accounts Committee but only time will demonstrate that.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should sit down without repeating that the volume of Estimates which has been presented within the past few days to the Dáil and to the public must give us all food for thought.  We must ask ourselves are we going to be able to continue to raise the necessary revenue to maintain these services at their existing levels.  I think we can do that but we can do it only on one condition.  We can do it only on the condition that there is increased production in this country, that we produce from our soil and our resources and by the work and labour of our people a sufficient income to enable them not only to maintain but to improve their existing standard of living and to provide for the cost of all these public services.</P>
    <P>If we do not secure that increased production then, inevitably, we must reduce the services, because we cannot continue to provide them out of borrowings; we cannot continue to tax the people heavier than the people are prepared to accept willingly.  This is a problem which not only this Government has to face, but which must be faced by every Deputy in Dáil Éireann.  It is not merely the capacity of the people to pay, but the willingness of the people to pay that counts, and if the ordinary taxpayers of the country begin to manifest unwillingness in this matter, then, of course, the public finances will get into a state of confusion and the public credit will be destroyed, and if the public credit were to be destroyed, it would be no longer possible to maintain the public services at least upon their existing scale.</P>

      <P>It will be acknowledged that this motion, tabled by Deputy Byrne, has achieved one result.  It has resulted in two very important speeches being delivered, one by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and one by Deputy Cosgrave.  Of the two, I would say that the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce offered more hope for the country than that of Deputy Cosgrave.  The speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce was one of confidence in the future and an assessment of the problems that lie before us and how they may be overcome.  In striking contrast to that speech, we had the speech of Deputy Cosgrave, in which he could hold out no prospect of remedial measures, even with a change of Government.  He is, of course, aware that while the cost of living has risen 23 points since August, 1950, an increase occurred when he was in the responsible position of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and while his Government was in power.</P>

      <P>I have got the reference. The page is 228 of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i>&mdash;cost-of-living essential items index numbers, base 1947, 100.  We will take 1950.  In August, 1950, it was 100; November, 1950, 102; February, 1951, 103; May, 1951, 109; August, 1951, 111. These are the figures I have quoted, and they are given on page 228 of the current <i>Trade Journal.</i>  There ought not to be any question about that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is that half of the <Col N="174" /> increase in the cost of living occurred prior to the change of Government. Therefore, if there is any charge to be made against anybody for increasing the cost of living, half of the guilt of that rests on the inter-Party Government. I do not think, however, it is altogether right to blame either the inter-Party Government for the increase of 11 points up to the time they went out of office or to blame the present Government for the further increase. In the main, the increases in the cost of living were brought about by increases in the cost of imported raw materials and imported essential goods and by increases in wages.</P>
      <P>I think that that fact ought to be recognised and that there ought to be a more realistic approach to matters of this kind.  Bandying charges across the House on falsified figures does not get anybody anywhere.  It is about time that Deputy Morrissey, after being in and out of office, ought to begin to acquire a sense of responsibility similar to that which appears to have been acquired already by Deputy Cosgrave, because Deputy Cosgrave made a serious speech.  He was not trying to score little narrow Party points.  He was trying to face up to the problems in his own way as he saw them.  As reported in the Official Report for Friday, 6th March, column 2496, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not deny that some decisions which may have to be taken will be unpopular.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very useful kind of statement for a Front Bench member of the Opposition to make, because he raps on the knuckles Deputies like Deputy Flanagan and others who claim that they will solve all our problems by one wave of their hand when they get into office.</P>
      <P>Running through all of Deputy Cosgrave's speech was a note of pessimism. In the course of his speech he said that he did not know how these difficulties were to be overcome or how they could be solved.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The position that now exists is that it is difficult to see what immediate remedy can be applied.  The suggestion of the Minister that it <Col N="175" /> would require substantially increased taxation in order to reintroduce the subsidies is undoubtedly true...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Again at column 2496 he makes it quite clear: &ldquo;We do not believe there is any easy solution of these problems.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave and some other Deputies tried to make some capital out of things that have happened recently.  Both Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Cosgrave tried to condemn the Government for increasing the price of butter.  They knew perfectly well that that increase was rendered necessary in order to provide a better price for milk producers.  When they condemn the increase in the price of butter they are indirectly attacking the farmer, his rights and his standard of living.  They know that the increased price of milk was rendered necessary because of the increased wages paid to agricultural workers.  Therefore, when they attack the increase in the price of butter they are attacking the standard of living of the lowest paid workers here, the agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>I think it is time to get away from that attitude of irresponsibility.  Better wages cannot be paid to the agricultural worker unless the price of food is increased.  Higher wages mean higher prices.  One cannot increase general expenditure to subsidise prices without increasing taxation.  Higher expenditure means higher taxation. Higher wages mean higher prices.  It is nonsense for Deputy Dunne to suggest that the increase in the price of food and other essential commodities has been brought about because of excessive profits gained by those engaged in the respective industries. There is no excessive profit for the farmer or the creamery in the production of butter.  If one analyses the cost of production one will find that the heaviest items of cost come under the heading of raw materials and labour. What might be saved as a result of reducing profits would be very, very small and would have very little effect on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave knows all these things.  Because he knows them and because he is honest he does not make the flamboyant speeches that some <Col N="176" /> other members of the Opposition insist on making.  Deputy O'Higgins made a flamboyant speech when he said that the decontrol of bacon had resulted in an increase in the price of bacon and at the same time a reduction in the price of pigs.  In actual fact he is entirely wrong in relation to the price of pigs because in the two years prior to decontrol the price paid to the farmers averaged about 200/- per cwt. and since decontrol it has averaged 250/-.</P>
    <P>There has been some increase to the farmer, a very necessary increase because the production of pigs was going down.  The production of pigs had gone down very materially under the inter-Party Government because the price paid to the farmers for their pigs was not a satisfactory one.  It would be a good thing if those who profess to be interested in the cost of living, in wages and in the standard of living generally of our people would get down to the problem in a serious way.  It is desirable that an effort should be made by voluntary cooperation between the trade union leaders and employers to prevent any further rise in the cost of living and any further substantial rise in the general level of wages.  There may be need for adjustment in regard to some of the lower paid workers.  That is true of the lower paid State employees just as it is true of the ordinary workers outside.  In fairness to the general community I think the time has come when people ought to be satisfied with a reasonable reward in order to keep the cost of living under control.  In the case of the few who are very lowly paid something should be done.</P>

      <P>If it were not for the interruptions of Deputy Morrissey I would have concluded before this. Deputy Morrissey is indulging in his usual tactics.  I appeal now to Deputy Dunne, to the leaders of the Labour movement and to employers to sit down around a table and realise that this is <Col N="177" /> a serious matter.  The country can only be saved by stabilisation of conditions generally.  It is a bad thing that prices should fall too low.  It is equally bad that they should rise too high.  Everybody should be satisfied now to adjust matters in a reasonable way, prevent the cost of living rising and by increased efficiency and increased production and employment provide for a raising of the general standard of living of our people.</P>

      <P>Who was talking about interruptions?  I have not got the document before me but from recollection I am satisfied that the Deputy was quoting figures and trying to compare figures that were not comparable.  The Deputy said that the cost of living in August, 1950, was 100.  The cost of living in August, 1947, when the Fianna Fáil Government at the time established a new cost-of-living index, was 100.  The inter-Party Government administered this country from February, 1948, to August, 1950, without the cost of living increasing by as much as one point.  That was over a period of two and a half years.  The Deputy is now supporting a Government under whose administration the cost of living has increased more in the first six months than it did in the previous three and a half years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

I can listen to them even if I do not agree <Col N="178" /> with them, but when I hear some Deputies preaching about zeal and effort it makes me feel a bit sick. When I hear a Deputy deliberately twisting figures in relation to pig and bacon prices over certain areas I cannot but be annoyed.  When I hear such a Deputy, and some of his colleagues too, holding himself out as the only member here who has any interest in or any right to speak for the farmers I cannot but be irritated.  Perhaps one should not waste too much time on Deputy Cogan.  He is not concerned with the merits of any motion that comes before the House.  He will vote for and play with that side of the House for whatever length of time he remains there.  He must do that because immediately he ceases to do that he ceases to be a member of this House.</P>

      <P>At column 2483, Volume 136 of the Official Debates of 6th March, 1953, Mr. Lemass said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nobody is denying that the cost of living has gone up, that prices have risen.  What has happened is, in my view, permanent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce says that the cost of living as it is to-day will not go back.  I am pleading for the people who are on low wages, small pensions and small incomes.  They are not now able to buy the necessaries of life to keep them in good health.  With the price at which foodstuffs stand at the present time the low wages group cannot buy sufficient ordinary food.  It is because of <Col N="179" /> that I am asking the House to censure the Government for their failure to keep the cost of living within reasonable bounds so that ordinary working-class people, people on small incomes and small pensions and those who are Government employees could have a reasonable standard of living.  Most of us, having received a circular in this connection, know that there are employees in the Civil Service, married men, with only £5 per week.  What are these married people in the Government service to do if the Government refuses to give effect to the arbitration award?  It is true that the person in receipt of £5 per week would receive only 10/-, but it would be 10/- towards the increase in the cost of bread and in the cost of butter.  I am asking the Government to ensure that these people will be able to buy the ordinary necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>I would like also to say a word or two on behalf of the unemployed.  It is impossible for people to live on the small incomes they receive from the employment exchange.  People receiving domiciliary treatment for tuberculosis are at a similar disadvantage and those on poor relief are not getting any increase to meet the increase in the price of foodstuffs.  I am asking the House to tell the Government that the increases that have taken place must not remain permanent and that the Government will be failing in its duty if it does not take steps to reduce the cost of living.</P>
    <P>As I quoted, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that what has happened is, in his view, permanent <Col N="180" /> and that we are not going to get back again to pre-war prices.  Nobody wants to get back to pre-war prices but if the people cannot get sufficient food, the Government should provide the money to get that food.  The Government should set an example in this regard by providing compensation for the cost of living to its own employees. Women cleaners, for instance, receive 15/- less than the rate paid to E.S.B. cleaners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am condemning the Government for their failure to keep the cost of living within reasonable bounds.  The amount paid to employees in Government service in many cases is not sufficient to enable those people to buy food.  When the bread subsidies were removed the price of bread rose from 6d. to 9d.  When the subsidies were removed, the Government gave nothing to the soldiers, to their wives or families, to the Gardaí or postal workers, to meet the increase in the price of bread and butter.  These people cannot engage in alternative employment. They must give their full time to Government service.  In regard to industry the number of unemployed is growing at the rate of 1,000 a week for the last six months.  The Government is not doing its duty because it is not trying to solve the important problems of unemployment and emigration, of low wages and high prices.  Only to-day, I was speaking to a group of women who said: &ldquo;Mr. Byrne, when are you going to get rid of that gang?&rdquo; Motion put.</P>

      <P>Before moving this motion, I ask the permission of the Chair to make a technical alteration with regard to the year mentioned in the motion&mdash;the year 1952-3.  This motion was put down a considerable time ago.  For that reason, I ask the permission of the Chair to alter the motion to read as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That, with a view to putting a greater area of land into productive condition and as a means of stimulating rural employment, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act for the year 1953-54 should be raised to the 1950-51 level.</P>

    <P>That, with a view to putting a greater area of land into productive condition and as a means of stimulating rural employment, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act <Col N="183" /> for the year 1953-54 should be raised to the 1950-51 level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Beirne and myself felt constrained to put down this motion, because we believe that nothing is more conducive to the economic development of the country than the drainage of the land.  I think it has been admitted by Government Ministers within recent times that agriculture is the mainstay of our economy and that on its development will depend the development of secondary industries.  We believe that, in the present condition of vast areas of land, the full production which the nation demands cannot be achieved until a proper system of drainage is carried out.  I want to make it quite clear that, in anything I may say, I do not wish to minimise in any way the importance of the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945.  I wish, however, to emphasise that works carried out under that Act are necessarily slow, and that it will take a very long time before the complete arterial drainage of this country can be achieved.  In the meantime, I submit that much valuable work could be done by the fullest possible implementation of the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I venture to say, also, that no legislation in this country received a greater welcome from the farming community than the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the land rehabilitation scheme.  I agree with what the Minister for Finance said here to-night, to a certain extent.  These two schemes are interdependent and the successful operation of the one depends on the successful operation of the other.  I do not think it fair, however, to suggest&mdash;as the Minister suggested to-night&mdash;that to reduce the money available under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and to increase the money available under the land rehabilitation scheme is a proper way of attacking the problem.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister is aware, as the House is aware, that many people are clamouring for schemes under the land rehabilitation project but such schemes cannot be undertaken until the outfalls are first completed <Col N="184" /> and drained off.  In my county many tenants have made application for work under the land rehabilitation project but when the inspectors or officials call&mdash;while they agree that the work is very necessary and would be of value&mdash;they say that it would be impossible to carry out the scheme until the local authority had first done its share of the work.  In almost every county in this State there are&mdash;comparatively, at least&mdash;vast areas of land lying undeveloped and unproductive. They are in that condition for one reason only, namely, that they are water-logged from one end of the year to the other.  Would the work of developing these lands and making them productive not be a sound investment for any Government?  I want to emphasise at this stage that there is nothing political in this motion.  There are rural Deputies on all sides of the House.  These Deputies realise how those schemes are welcomed by people, irrespective of their political affiliations. Much work needs to be done and can be done if local authorities went into it with enthusiasm.  They submitted schemes&mdash;councillors, at least, submitted schemes to the county engineers, some of which were sent to the Department of Local Government. Subsequently, it became the custom to direct the county engineers that only schemes which come within certain financial limits should be submitted. In my county we are very much perturbed by the attitude of the Department in regard to this matter.  That will readily be appreciated when one remembers that for the year 1950-51 County Roscommon received £51,000 in grants.  For the year 1951-52 we received £33,000.  Last year, 1952-53, that sum was reduced to £15,500.  A sum of £15,500 is a negligible amount of money for anything in the way of drainage on a county basis.  No sensible person will suggest that, over an indefinite period, vast amounts of money should be provided.  I think, however, it is reasonable to submit that, for the first five years at any rate, substantial sums of money should be made available for the work.  It is well known that periods of long neglect have resulted in making this a very big task.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> Those Deputies who are members of local authorities know that, since the passing of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, it is not legal for any authority to undertake any drainage work except in certain approved drainage areas&mdash;and then, in such areas, only the merest maintenance work can be done.  Last year, the Estimate was reduced by something in the neighbourhood of £400,000 and for the coming year there is a further reduction of £250.000.  There is a very familiar ring about the sum of £250,000 in this House.  It has been mentioned here time and time again for some weeks past.  It happens to be just the precise sum of money which has been referred to so often in the past few weeks&mdash;a sum of money devoted to a different purpose.  I think that the reduction in the Estimate shows a complete lack of appreciation of the importance of the agricultural industry in this country.  At least, it convinces me that the Government is not aware that the first step towards achieving full agricultural production is the putting of the land into proper condition.  In the Minister's county, in my county, and in every county, farmers are constantly crying out to have something done about the drainage of the land.  In 1950-51 there was rejoicing amongst the farming community because they expected that, until the job was completed, substantial sums of money would be made available for this essential work.  I suggest to the Minister that he should take up this matter with his colleague the Minister for Finance in order to see if any alteration can be made in the present allocation for this important work.  Would it not be a far better economic proposition to provide money for putting the land of Ireland into proper condition to produce food for the people than for people who will do nothing, people who must degrade and demoralise themselves by parading every week at the local civic guard barracks in order to get money for which they have no respect and which is of little practical value to them?</P>
    <P>I submit that this is a matter which the Minister could usefully discuss with <Col N="186" /> his Cabinet colleagues.  I believe that they, as well as every member of the House must think on this matter in the same way as the sponsors of this motion do.  I submit that we are making a sane suggestion to the Minister, and that in this year there should be a very substantial increase in the provision of money under this head.  I believe that it is money that could be well spent, and that might even yield political dividends to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support what the previous speakers have said on this motion.  The arterial drainage plan announced in 1945, was a recognition of the urgent need there is for drainage work which is not progressing quickly enough to make manifest the advantages expected from the 1945 Act.  Arterial drainage, as carried on, is a slow process.  I believe it is to extend over a period of 26 years.  We think that a good deal of work was done during the last few years in connection with minor drainage.  That is work which should go hand in hand with arterial drainage.</P>
      <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act was operated successfully in conjunction with the land project and so enabled farmers to make their land more productive.  We know, however, that many areas in the country are flooded and water-logged.  That is mainly caused by water overflowing from streams and small rivers.  I am aware that when local authorities made application to have drainage work carried out on these streams and small rivers, the reply they got from the authorities was that the work should be done under the Arterial Drainage Act and had been so listed under that Act. The result is that the advantages, which could be obtained from the land project and the Local Authorities (Works) Acts, are to a great extent nullified.  The latter Act was designed to bring drainage relief to many areas as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My opinion is that a general drainage plan for the country must be approached in a more vigorous way.  If its execution is going to extend over <Col N="187" /> a period of 26 years, I believe that nothing very effective will be done. The Government should see that effect is given to the plan more speedily.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was operated very successfully during the period of the inter-Party Government and brought great advantage to those farmers who also wanted to avail of the land project.  The position to-day is that they are not able to take advantage of the land project because the Department of Agriculture will not sanction the drainage of their land until arrangements are first made to take the water off it.  That is the purpose for which the Local Authorities (Works) Act was designed.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not going to carry out the latter Act, can he tell us whether he intends to do anything better for the farmers under the Arterial Drainage Act of 1945 than is being done at present?  I agree, of course, that that Act was effective where it was implemented.  But, taking the country as a whole, one must admit that it will be a very long time before proper drainage schemes under that Act can be carried out.  The result will be that a lot of our land must remain derelict for the next 20 years or probably longer if something is not done speedily.  If the Minister would accept this motion it would mean that many farmers could get immediate advantage from the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That is an Act which, I think, everyone must admit brought great advantage to the nation and to the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to support this motion.  I am well aware of the good results produced in many rural areas by the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It is fitting, I think, that tribute should be paid to the late Mr. T.J. Murphy who, during his term as Minister for Local Government, was the originator of that Act.  It was a measure which brought new hope to very many people in rural Ireland in possession of water-logged and low-lying land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimate for the work to be done under that Act in the coming year reflects the very big reduction of <Col N="188" /> £640,000 compared to what was payable two years ago.  I suggest that such a substantial reduction practically means the death knell of the scheme.  I think that is a great pity because there are many people who are willing to operate schemes under the land project but are debarred from doing so because they must wait for the outfalls to be created by the clearances under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, when local bodies desired to take up such schemes, they were confronted by many difficulties. The position to-day is that the rates have increased to such an extent in recent years that it is beyond the capacity of local bodies to do anything effective in this way.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was welcomed extensively because it was administered locally and the money was provided from the Central Fund, which meant that there was no corresponding increase in rates.  It had the added advantage that it assisted those most in need of assistance.</P>
    <P>There are demands from all quarters for increased production, for more tillage, for more cattle to be carried on farms.  That can be done only if the land is drained and fertilised. There are drainage schemes in operation and a great deal of good work is being carried out under arterial drainage but I submit that the Local Authorities (Works) Act provided for schemes that every local councillor, no matter what his politics, was only too anxious to push forward.</P>
    <P>The reduction in flooding brought about by work carried out under that Act saved the Roads Estimate considerably inasmuch as it freed many low-lying roads that had been ravaged by winter flooding.  In my constituency there is a considerable amount of work still to be carried out.  The main road, extending some 40 odd miles to the City of Cork, was in years back on many occasions flooded at various points.  As a result of clearances carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, there has not been an instance of flooding on that road in the past few years.</P>
    <P>Where work has been completed, the people have been encouraged to go in <Col N="189" /> and to continue the work by extensive drainage and fertilising.  A great deal of land which could not carry a machine in the past is now cleared by mowing machines.  Lime distributors are able to go on land which formerly, because of flooding, could not be brought into full production.  Many farmers in my district who depend on upland meadowing suffered great losses in the past.  It was a gamble to go in on them to cut the crop.  More often than not, it was full of grit. There were various obstacles, barbed wire, and so on, brought along by floods, and their machines were damaged in the operation of hay-cutting. As a result of work carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, they are saved from the perils which affected them in the past. Furthermore, they can now manure this land, safe in the knowledge that a flood will not sweep away the manures.</P>
    <P>The extension of the Act was expected to continue for some time.  The majority of my constituents were very seriously perturbed when the grants were reduced last year.  They regard the present reduction with some misgiving because they see money being spent in other directions which have not the same employment content as works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act have.</P>
    <P>People who are trying to eke out a livelihood, in very many instances on poor farms, deserve any help which the State can give them.  It is not encouraging when they realise that they must maintain an army of unemployed that could be very usefully engaged in works such as were envisaged under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and which were proceeding well until the funds were curtailed. I would appeal to the Minister to devote as much money as possible to the purpose of resuming full activity under that Act.</P>
    <P>Too many people are restricted in their efforts to increase production by reason of the fact that their land is water-logged.  Young cattle develop diseases from drinking stagnant water. That can be borne out by veterinary surgeons.  Farmers who drained their lands over the years were well repaid <Col N="190" /> in the improved health of their live stock.</P>
    <P>I heartily support this motion. Seeing that the Government can find money for people who do not need it half as badly and who are not contributing nearly as much to the benefit of the country as the people who would benefit by an extension of the Local Authorities (Works) Act, I would earnestly suggest that some of the huge sums that are so readily made available to people who have plenty of capital should be made available under the Local Authorities (Works) Act to help those who are trying to maintain themselves and their families against ever-increasing losses and new problems that arise every day.  The solution to the problem facing these people is to ensure that their little holdings will be made economic, that they can carry more stock, that they will be able to till their fields without fear of their crops being swept away by floods.</P>
    <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act was working well.  There was not a complaint from any county councillor against the scheme.  Why was it curtailed? No more suitable scheme could be adopted for the employment of the army of unemployed that we have to-day.  Every penny spent on schemes under that Act would go into the pockets of people who are living on the dole and would give them a standard of living which the miserable pittance they collect every week could not give them. It is a matter for regret that the amount of money provided for the scheme is reduced.  The work being carried out is negligible in comparison with the many worthwhile schemes submitted and passed by the Department and, in many instances, completed a few years back.  I have schemes in mind which would have brought prosperity to my home locality if they had been completed and which would have saved many industrious people loss from flooding in wintertime. Tributaries of a larger river swell out over these lands.  That discourages people from cultivating low-lying land.</P>
    <P>The land I am speaking of must be continually nursed.  The people must keep making drains in it, clearing <Col N="191" /> water courses, liming and fertilising it and, as I said, it was a very wrong thing to curtail the money which was being provided for such work.  There was a united response from the people to that scheme which was an excellent one.  I have paid tribute to the memory of the man who introduced it.  I am proud to be a county man of the late Deputy Murphy who introduced that scheme which in such a short time brought such benefit to so many.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to extend that scheme and complete the work which was so well begun.</P>

      <P>For the last 12 months we have had statements from Ministers making an appeal for more production, particularly on the land.  I submit that this motion deals with a matter <Col N="192" /> which is of importance in connection with greater production on the land and yet the Minister for Local Government has refused to speak to the motion.  There are five Fianna Fáil Deputies on the benches behind the Minister.  The interest which the Government Party is taking in this motion has been shown by the Minister refusing to speak on the motion while these Deputies seem to get great amusement out of it.  If Deputy Blaney, Deputy Carter and Deputy Fanning had to make a living on a small holding of land half of which was under water I wonder would they display the same sarcasm towards this motion.  The Minister will send out the sheriff if the rates are not paid on this derelict and useless land.  If these Deputies were in that position perhaps they would not treat it as a joke.</P>

The Minister for Finance to-night made great play with the fact that the Vote for the land rehabilitation scheme was increased this year. My answer to that is: &ldquo;The devil thank him.&rdquo;  The Government took over a scheme which was initiated by Deputy Dillon and was fully working.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that Act was initiated was that when the inter-Party Government sought to put the land rehabilitation scheme into operation we found we were hamstrung by the fact that most of the small rivers and main drains were choked and that the land rehabilitation scheme could not succeed without the Local Authorities (Works) Act being brought into operation.  I submit that the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the land rehabilitation scheme are interdependent, that you cannot separate them. It is impossible to discuss one of them without discussing the other to some extent.  Knowing the factors that caused the inter-Party Government to introduce the Bill here and pass it through this House, I submit one cannot discuss one without discussing the other to a very great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year 1950 £1,900,000 was made available by the inter-Party Government for drainage work under the <Col N="194" /> Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In the following year almost a similar amount was made available.  There was, if I remember correctly, a slight reduction in the figure in 1951 as compared with 1950.  The present Government took office in June, 1951.  They did not send to the county councils the sum we had earmarked for expenditure under the Local Authorities (Works) Act in that year.  Last year it was reduced to £1,650,000 and this year it is reduced to £400,000.  The Minister for Finance tells us that the land rehabilitation scheme is up by £357,000.  It should be up by at least three times that amount were it not for the deliberate brake put on that scheme by the present Government.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Agriculture took over at a time when all the machinery had been procured and staff trained.  The scheme was just getting into its stride when the change came. Now because there is an increase of a miserable £357,000 the Minister for Finance tells us that that is a salve for cutting down work under the Local Authorities (Works) Act by £350,000 this year.</P>
    <P>I believe the Act has been sacrificed for the purchase of Tulyar.  It is more than significant that the amount under this sub-head in the Estimate for the Department of Local Government has been reduced this year by exactly the amount of the purchase price of this racehorse.  The average man will ask himself is it by chance that the two figures are identical.</P>

      <P>That Act was brought into operation as a result of the land rehabilitation scheme.  It was felt that scheme would be held up to some extent and, while excellent work was being done under the Arterial Drainage Act, it was slow in operation.  It was felt that while some areas would benefit, other areas would lose.  The land rehabilitation scheme would have to follow more or less in the wake of the arterial drainage.  We were informed by high officials in quite a few Government Departments that they estimated there were between 4,000,000 and 4,500,000 acres of quite good land which was useless for food production because it was either subjected to periodic flooding or permanently water-logged. It was in order to get the two schemes working simultaneously that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was brought into operation.  When it was under way £1,900,000 was given to 27 county councils for work under that Act.  The following year we gave the same amount.  That has now been cut down deliberately and no amount of bluffing by the Minister for Finance will convince me to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Government has none of the difficulties to contend with that faced the inter-Party Government in the land rehabilitation scheme.  We are not now going around spreading the rumour that the present Government is trying to use that scheme in order to increase the valuation of land all over the country.  That is what the present Government did when it was in opposition during the time the Act was <Col N="197" /> passing through the House and for some time after its passage.</P>

      <P>The Government is getting every assistance now.  Despite that, both these schemes are being cut down.  Tourist roads are getting priority from the Minister.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was deliberately savaged this year in order to divert the money to some other purpose.  I want to bring home to the Minister my view of that transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to stray from the motion.  I find that the grant has been ruthlessly savaged. New grants have been introduced in some cases and others have been increased.  I cannot help but think the Minister for Local Government has deliberately savaged the money under <Col N="198" /> this sub-head in order to increase other sub-heads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) whether the names of subscribers are shown free of charge in the telephone directory, (b) the method of calculating extra charges made for entries appearing in heavy type, (c) the total amount of such charges for 1952, and (d) the percentage of such charges which was deducted by or allowed to the advertising agency.</P>

      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) Every subscriber is entitled to one entry in light-faced type free of charge.  Such entry is restricted to the regulation limits of name and address.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> (b) If entry is required in heavy type a charge of £1 11s. 6d. is made for each year of the directory in which it so appears.</P>
    <P>(c)  The returns in respect of 1952 have not yet been furnished by the contractor and, consequently, the figures required are not yet available.</P>
    <P>(d)  As it is not the practice to disclose details of such contracts I regret that I am not in a position to supply the information requested by the Deputy.</P>
