      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if any recent survey of the mineral deposits in Counties Cavan and Monaghan has been carried out; and, if so, whether it is proposed to initiate any steps to secure the exploitation of such mineral deposits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no recent general survey of the mineral deposits in Counties Monaghan and Cavan, but these areas have been examined by the geological survey on a number of occasions in the past and reports have been published.  In addition more recent information based on inspections is available.</P>
      <P>The exploitation and commercial development of minerals is, of course, a matter for private enterprise, and interested parties will be facilitated in obtaining information from records available for public inspection in the Geological Survey Office.</P>
      <P>There have been, in recent years, special investigations of the gypsum and anhydrite deposits in the Counties Cavan and Monaghan.  Consideration of the results has been proceeding but I am not yet in a position to state what action may be taken.</P>

      <P>Section 15 of the Transport Act 1950 places an obligation on C.I.E. to provide the necessary transport facilities for the needs of the public, agriculture, commerce and industry. I have been informed by the board that it is their intention to provide a bus service between Mountmellick and Portlaoighise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in order to help the Dublin Corporation in their efforts to clear the falling down tenements in Dublin and facilitate the resultant removal of the occupants to new houses three to six miles outside the centre of the city, he will recommend to the transport authorities the immediate need for a reduced fixed fare that will not bear harshly on the people so removed to long distances from their places of employment and the employment exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Transport Act 1950 places on the Board of C.I.E. the obligation of conducting the undertaking so as to secure that, taking one year with another, its revenue shall be not less than sufficient to meet the charges properly chargeable to revenue.  The Act also empowers C.I.E. to fix such charges as the board thinks fit for services provided by it.</P>
      <P>Having regard to these provisions, I cannot undertake to make any recommendation to C.I.E. in the matter of charges for services provided by it.  I have no doubt, however, that the board will give due consideration to any representations which may be made to it by the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of the rules and regulations, will the Minister consider the advisability of making a recommendation himself, in view of the fact that the corporation now have to go five or six miles outside the city to build houses?  The fares to Ballyfermot at present payable by working-class people who have been removed from the centre of the city are 4d. and 5d., and, in view of the addition of these high fares to their rents, will he make a recommendation that there should <Col N="1169" /> be a fare of not more than 3d. to any corporation housing scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Act for which the Deputy voted, I have no function in the matter.  The Deputy and the Dublin Corporation have the same rights to make representations to the board as I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister say he has no function, in view of the amount of money which we make available to C.I.E.?  Surely he has some responsibility, in view of the subsidising of the railways, for explaining to the House why C.I.E. are allowed to get away with these big subsidies, while, at the same time, they fail to charge proper fares to the people who are keeping them.  I ask the Minister again to make a recommendation to the board in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if it is correct that the Allenwood power station has been valued for £8,500 under the Valuation Acts but that it is exempt from rating under the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act, 1945; and, if so, whether he will take steps to introduce proposals for amending legislation so that the Kildare County Council will not lose the revenue therefrom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation to amend the provisions of Section 12 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1930, under which exemption from rates applies to the Allenwood power <Col N="1170" /> station is not at present in contemplation. The station has been valued at £8,500 in respect of buildings and £14 13s. in respect of lands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Cementation, Limited, have now ceased their activities in Ballyshannon and that widespread and growing unemployment exists in that area with no alternative being offered, would the Minister consider it advisable to make representations to his opposite number in the North to see if some of those unemployed could be absorbed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The civil defence officer appointed by the Limerick County Council has, in common with other civil defence officers, been given directions by my Department on civil defence planning and on the compilation of survey reports on which the <Col N="1182" /> local civil defence organisation will be based.  These reports are due in my Department on the 31st March, 1953. To date 96 nominees of the local authorities, including two from County Limerick, have qualified as instructors at the Civil Defence School in Dublin. Courses for civil defence instructors will be continued until I am satisfied that adequate provision has been made for the instruction of the civil population throughout the State.  A formal civil defence organisation has not yet been built up in the County of Limerick or in any other county.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present examining the whole question of civil defence equipment.  Apart from the equipment remaining with local authorities and held in central stores since the last emergency, no new issues of equipment have been made.</P>

    <P>It is unfortunate that the figures previously given by me, based on information obtained from the Government advertising agent, were certainly inaccurate in the cases mentioned above, and I wish to express regret for any inconvenience that may have been caused to the publications concerned.</P>
    <P>The circulation of certain other newspapers who are not members of the Audit Bureau of Circulation is certified by local auditors appointed by the publications concerned.  Information as to the most recent certified figures is obtainable only by application to the individual publications.</P>
    <P>The newspapers for which uncertified figures of circulation were given on the 19th March fall into two categories:-</P>
    <P>(a)  Newspapers which furnish to the Irish Association of Advertising Agencies their uncertified figures of circulation.</P>
    <P>(b)  Newspapers which do not reply to the association's inquiries. In these cases a committee of the association estimates what it believes <Col N="1196" /> to be a reasonable figure for the publication concerned.</P>
    <P>I may add that I have received strong representations from the following newspapers that the figures of estimated circulation quoted by me, as supplied by the Irish Association of Advertising Agencies, were greatly underestimated:&mdash;</P>

      <P>When I was speaking last night, I was drawing a parallel between the conditions that obtain in the British health service and those that are likely to obtain over here. The Minister seemed to take it that I was trying to impress upon the House that we in Ireland should accept the standard of British health services, whereas it was the direct opposite that I was trying to bring to the notice of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated that at times in non-emergency operations&mdash;in fact, at all times under the health services that exist at present in Britain&mdash;it was necessary for patients to wait for at least 12 months to get into a hospital for these operations.  I have since been making inquiries and I find that was a very conservative statement&mdash;that in many instances they have three years to wait in order to have a simple operation of the non-emergency type carried out.  One can see that the loss of employment from anything like that to a country is terrific.  The case I was <Col N="1199" /> stressing was that of rupture.  Any man with a rupture is not a 100 per cent. able-bodied person for work and it means that for long periods the State across the water is robbed of the services of such an individual.  I maintain that if&mdash;as some speakers here have been stressing&mdash;we should have a full, free-for-all medical service in this country we will have a state of affairs exactly parallel to what is in existence in Britain.</P>
    <P>Practising as a doctor, I can perfectly guarantee anybody that the position at the moment is that if you want to get a non-emergency case into an Irish hospital, principally into a voluntary hospital but let it be a rated hospital or anything like that, you wait for a period of about a week&mdash;sometimes less, sometimes a little more. What I want to stress is that in our health services here the different Ministers we have had have been inclined to put the cart before the horse, to try to introduce health services into Ireland, whereas we are not really ready for them.  Of course, I realise that there is an extensive hospital programme this year and, from the Minister's statement, which I had an opportunity of glancing at in the paper this morning, for several years to come.  At the same time, we ought to bear in mind that anything we do ought to be done slowly and conservatively, because otherwise we will inflict a great deal of hardship on the public and the people who suffer when you inflict hardship&mdash;no one knows that better than a doctor&mdash;are the lesser income groups.</P>
    <P>With regard to some of the services in existence in this country, we have, by and large, a pretty good tubercular service at present.  A lot of innovations have been introduced during the last few years.  I must give the last Minister credit for having improved them considerably.  There are some things that I find myself not in full agreement with.  In the first instance, everyone knows that tuberculosis is, unfortunately, a disease that extends over a considerable period.  It is one of those diseases where we can never be sure that the cure is actually there. <Col N="1200" /> It is necessary for those people to have a long period of treatment and a long period of rehabilitation.  One of the essentials to recovery from this dread disease is that the afflicted person must be entirely free from any anxiety of mind whatsoever.  For that purpose allowances have been introduced.  I do not think that anybody could claim that these allowances are generous. It seems to me that the sums paid to the individuals concerned are just enough to give them a bare existence, which means a struggle to make ends meet.  It means that they are in a state of constant anxiety which is very detrimental to their recovery.  I have before me the table of allowances which as far as I know obtain at present: For a husband with dependent wife or a wife with dependent husband, £3 in a county borough and £2 15s. elsewhere.  For each dependent aged 16 years or over, 12/- in a county borough and 10/- elsewhere.</P>

      <P>They are made by Order.  For each dependent aged eight years and under 16, 8/- in a county borough and 6/- elsewhere; aged eight years and under, 5/- and 3/-.  For a married woman whose husband is unable to make proper provision for the care of their family where it is necessary to employ domestic help, in a county borough £1 and elsewhere 15/-. Where the patient is maintained in a health institution by a health authority the allowance is reduced by £1 3s. per week and £1 respectively.  When husband and wife are both in institutions the payment, instead of £3 or £2 15s. is 10/- per week.</P>

      <P>I hope they are improved.  In certain instances special nourishment is allowed to families stricken with tuberculosis, but the State apparently only recognises a person as being entitled to that when actually infected with tuberculosis. Several cases of that kind have been brought to my notice in my constituency. A father or a mother may be tubercular and there may be five or six small children.  We all know that unfortunately tuberculosis is inclined to run in families.  The food allowance that is given in these cases should be extended to the children, but unless the children are infected with tuberculosis they are not entitled to receive these benefits.  From that it appears to me that you are going to watch until they get infected.  Surely from the point of view of the State it would be better to nourish the children where they are liable to have an hereditary tendency towards tuberculosis or run the risk of being infected.  Surely it would be better to give the allowance before they are infected rather than wait until they are infected.  That seems to me to be bad business from the point of view of the State and a bad policy from the point of view of the health of the children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  There is one service which we do not seem to have developed in this country and which I think is a very desirable one.  Of course, it may be more difficult to organise it here than it is across the water, but it may mean the saving of <Col N="1202" /> many lives.  I refer to the provision of an obstetrical emergency squad.  As Deputies know, from time to time, women have lost their lives during childbirth from haemorrhage and other causes.  Miscarriages also are liable to cause very severe and sudden haemorrhages.</P>
      <P>In all big centres in Great Britain and other countries they have an emergency obstetrical squad which consists of a blood transfusion team, nurse and doctor with all the necessary equipment to deal with these acute emergencies in the homes of people.  Many lives have been saved in that way.  Anyone who has experience as a doctor in a country district will realise how very necessary that is.  From time to time we have all been faced with such an emergency and have been unable to deal with it as we had not the equipment at hand and have been forced to get some specialist to come down from a hospital in Dublin.  I may say in passing that they have always been willing to come straight away without worrying about a fee.  If we had such a squad, many valuable lives could be saved and I ask the Minister to consider that in connection with any extended health services which may be under consideration.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of county homes and it has been stated that elderly people should not be segregated in groups as they are at present.  From my experience of these people in all walks of life over a long number of years I think the majority of them have no great objection to being segregated in groups in that way.  A lot of elderly people feel rather lonely if they have no dependents and that is usually the reason they find their way into these institutions.  Provided these institutions are made bright and cheerful, they are probably the most satisfactory places to have them as they have everything they want.  They have religious services close at hand, they have company and, above all, they have the feeling that they will be looked after and maintained in a decent standard of comfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with what other Deputies have stated, however, that <Col N="1203" /> the county homes as they were known &mdash;they are now renamed in some cases and one in Wexford is called St. John's Hospital&mdash;are the most lugubrious and sombre looking buildings imaginable. They were built in a bygone age when the general structure of buildings was different from what it would be if they were built in modern times.  I think a great advance could be made by making these premises more suitable and removing from them the stigma of the workhouse, as they were called in the past.  The buildings themselves are not too bad, the accommodation is not too bad, and the running of them is not too bad, but they should be beautified a little bit more.  Certain advances have been made in recent years in that respect, but I would ask the Minister, where it lies in his power, to have them made more up-to-date.</P>
    <P>The position of midwives is causing that body a good deal of anxiety at the moment.  In towns like Wexford, Enniscorthy and New Ross there are several private midwives who have built up considerable practices in these localities.  They are very apprehensive that under any improved health schemes their livings will be taken away from them.  I would like the Minister to clarify the position in their regard when he is replying.  A lot of them have been practising for many years.  They are not as young as they were and they are apprehensive that under new methods of health administration their living may be taken away from them.</P>
    <P>I might add that State and local authority midwives are concerned because of their salaries.  I have raised this matter on previous occasions but the Minister never seemed to have much to say about it.  Most of these are farmers' daughters who have chosen a very honourable profession as a career.  They have to go away to train and must spend at least a couple of years perfecting themselves in their profession.  When they obtain an appointment here, they are offered a beggarly salary of £120 a year rising by annual increments to £160 a year, plus a small uniform allowance.  I do not believe there is any other State <Col N="1204" /> employee paid at such a beggarly rate.  How could anybody exist on that salary?  These young girls may be appointed to a dispensary district. They may be fortunate enough to secure private patients, but in a profession like this it takes a good deal of time to gain the confidence of people and very often a number of years elapse before they are anything like fully employed.  In the initial years out of the miserable pittance paid them by the State they must pay for their lodgings and arrange for their own transport.  In such circumstances such a salary does not even provide a bare existence.  Unless the Minister can hold out some hope to these people that they will have a proper livelihood in the future he will not get the right type to undertake this work.  This is very important work and it is very essential that we should have the right type of person doing the work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne spoke at length last night about the voluntary hospitals. The voluntary hospital system has been built up here over a number of years.  It is a system which has been responsible for the training of generations of Irish doctors.  I believe the voluntary hospitals are the research institutions of medicine here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne appears to favour State control.  I listened fairly carefully to his statement last night. Were he to become Minister for Health again, he would, I take it, abolish these hospitals or put them under State control.  That brings us back to the question: are we going to hand everything over to the State?  Are we going to say that private enterprise is at an end?</P>
    <P>The voluntary hospitals have given a great deal of good service to the Irish people.  I have been practising here for 20 years and I never heard of such a thing as a pauper bed.  When Deputy Dr. Browne used that expression last night I took the trouble to make inquiries from doctors and others and I was informed by everybody I asked that he had never heard of a pauper bed in any hospital.  I do not know what Deputy Dr. Browne means by a pauper bed.  During the 20 years in which I have practised here <Col N="1205" /> I have never been refused a bed in any voluntary hospital, in Dublin or anywhere else.  There are of course public wards but in these public wards one meets all kinds and classes.  There are farmers.  There are labourers. There are postal officials.  There are small salaried people.  They all go into them and there is no question of one being told he is paying a fee and another being told that he is being put into a pauper bed.  They are all equal. If an operation is necessary it is done and there is no question about it one way or the other.  I have never been asked by any doctor when I asked for an admission to hospital whether or not the patient could pay a fee.  I have often said that he could not pay a fee and the answer I have got is: &ldquo;It is all the same to me whether he can or not.  We take the rough with the smooth.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The voluntary hospitals have given good service to the people and if they are abolished it will be a sorry day for medical education as a whole.  Deputy Dr. Browne said last night that the surgeons and the physicians and the gynaecologists were not really specialists and that we have no specialists here.  He said it was considered generally that doctors here were only of the standard of general practitioners but people were too polite to say that.  If that is so, is it not rather extraordinary that we should have people coming here from all over the world to the Coombe and the Rotunda and the National Maternity Hospital to study midwifery?  In those hospitals we have Europeans, Africans and Asiatics.  They would hardly come here to study in our voluntary hospitals if they could learn their work better elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The same can be said of our general hospitals.  Every year they have their quota of foreigners coming to study medicine here.  It is nonsense to say we have not a good standard of medicine here.  In some things we may not be as advanced as they are in other countries but as far as teaching goes we can hold our own with anybody. Recently when the visiting doctors were here some of them came in to see <Col N="1206" /> Dáil Eireann.  One or two came to me. Probably other Deputies met some of them also.  They were full of praise of our methods of teaching and of the standard of our voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>I would be sorry to see these hospitals abolished.  They have done good work.  Much good work lies ahead.  If they are handed over to the State, that will be the end of everything.  I do not approve of this excessive State control.  I approve of advances being made in health services.  I believe that the individual who is able to afford to pay for his doctor should do so.  I believe that as high as 95 per cent. of the Irish people prefer to go to a doctor privately.  I know that many working-class people prefer to go to a private doctor and to pay him a small fee&mdash;and, as far as possible, the majority of the doctors have always tried to meet the purses of the people.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that something must have gone wrong again in the negotiations between the dentists and the Minister.  I do not know the inside history of these negotiations very well but it looks as if it is the old story of &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo;.  If there is some disagreement between the two parties, surely they can come together and do something to reach agreement for the good of the people who are entitled to dental benefits.  We have had almost six months of these protracted negotiations and we are getting nowhere. Perhaps the Minister, when he is replying, will give us some idea of the position.  I am asked about it daily in my constituency and I say: &ldquo;I do not know.  I understand that negotiations are proceeding but that they are not getting anywhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Everybody will have a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister in respect of the difficult situation which he has to face as regards health services.  A good deal of public disputation has been going on for the past few years in regard to this matter. The trouble is that when these things start, instead of settling down, they tend to become more embittered as time goes on.  It is a very difficult problem to deal with the health services as a whole.  It is a problem on <Col N="1207" /> which expert advice is needed.  With all due respect, I think that the officials in the Custom House have not really sufficient experience of the ordinary domiciliary treatment in medicine to be able to frame and produce extended health services to meet the requirements of the people concerned, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I understand that at one time the Minister was in general practice.  Of course, that is a great many years ago. He has had a long and distinguished career in public life since then.  Conditions have probably changed considerably since the Minister was a dispensary doctor.  It is not in the interests of the country that this public disputation should continue between the Minister and the other bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>There is only one way to end that situation.  I think it would be more satisfactory to the Minister, to the Medical Association, to those who are at issue with him at the moment, and to the officials of his Department if they obtained advice not only from one section but from every section that is interested in providing for the Irish people the best health services that we can provide.  The Minister will not be creating a precedent if he sets up an advisory health council&mdash;and by an &ldquo;advisory health council&rdquo; I do not mean a consultative health council. We have had a consultative health council with the Minister presiding over it and officials, and so forth.</P>
    <P>It is the custom in several countries &mdash;I quote Canada as one&mdash;to have an advisory health council which has wide scope and is representative of a large section of the community.  This council gives advice to the Minister for Health.  He is not bound to accept that advice.  In Canada the position obtains that the council have the right of <i>entrée</i> to the Minister whenever they so desire to enable them to state their case.  Further, they publish a report.  The Minister has to place that report before the Houses of Parliament&mdash;the Oireachtas, as it would be in this country&mdash;at the end of the year. I am not saying that the Minister need accept that advice or that he need <Col N="1208" /> accept all of it.  Surely, however, it would be of some benefit to the Minister to have that advice.</P>
    <P>I will not suggest that this advisory council should consist of doctors alone. I think it should have far wider scope than that.  The matter of the intended health services has got into such a state of confusion in this country that the sooner the Minister decides to set up an advisory health council, and gets some representative advice from all over the country, the better.  I will try to give my idea of the personnel of an advisory health council.  Naturally, it would comprise doctors.  I think it should be a fairly big council comprising at least 12 members.  To start with, I would suggest as chairman a judge of either the Supreme Court or the High Court. They are accustomed to such things and can deal with the many little legal problems that might arise.  Such a person would be very useful as chairman. I would suggest then a dispensary doctor, a private practitioner and a specialist.  I also think that you should have a doctor representative of the local authorities or the Custom House&mdash;a doctor who holds an official position in the country&mdash;possibly a county medical officer of health.  There should be dentists on this council, and the nursing profession should be represented on it, particularly when the question of constructing hospitals arises.  An experienced matron, who has had experience of hospital work, should be a member of the council, so that a state of affairs similar to what arose in my constituency some years ago would not come about.  They built a hospital and, when they had finished the building, they discovered that they had no laundry.  That would not have happened if a matron had been there to advise them.  I think that there should be somebody from the general nursing profession&mdash;such as a matron&mdash;and also a midwife on that advisory council. Then there should be a representative of the chemists.  They will have a lot to do and say in regard to any extended health services we can provide. They constitute a very strong arm in association with any improved health services.  On this advisory health <Col N="1209" /> council I would also have a representative of the business interests of the country&mdash;somebody representative of the chambers of commerce, and so forth, somebody whom the business community themselves could choose.</P>
    <P>Many problems will arise in the relations between employer and employee in big factories and institutions. Lastly, I think that trade unionists should be represented on the council.  That is not a very big council but it is very representative.  It could give advice to the Minister&mdash;advice which, I say, he need not accept. Whatever advice they might give him, however, they certainly would not advise him to continue fighting with everybody about extended health services.</P>
    <P>I am quite sympathetic towards the departmental officials.  They have to try to produce as good a health service as they can looking all right on paper, but what is good on paper is not always good in practice.  I think the Minister will find that in regard to anything he does to improve the health of the community he will have support and co-operation from this side of the House.  I would like to ask the Minister to do what, in my opinion, neither he nor his predecessor has done, to introduce some practical scheme which is workable, which is suitable and which will be of benefit to the Irish people, not only of the working classes but of the struggling, overburdened and overtaxed middle classes who have to fight to make ends meet to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are matters being discussed on this Estimate which are undoubtedly of great importance to every member of the House, and particularly to the people outside. Much has been said about dispensaries in various places and about the question of regional hospitals.  I cannot in the least agree with the approach of Deputy Dr. Browne to the problem of dispensaries.  In so far as these dispensaries are so often found in a crumbling condition I agree that they, at least, must be replaced, because these buildings were so badly constructed originally and so badly <Col N="1210" /> kept perhaps by local authorities that it would be fantastic and hopeless for any local authority to consider the possibility of reconstruction.</P>
      <P>I certainly disagree with Deputy Dr. Browne when he goes so far as to say that all patients under the dispensary system should be treated in the doctor's residence.  That may be all right for patients who are living convenient to the local dispensary doctor's residence but Deputy Dr. Browne knows very well&mdash;he has reason to have reliable knowledge resulting from his term of office as Minister for Health&mdash; that in rural areas many of these patients would have to travel a very long distance if they were to go to the doctor's private residence.</P>
      <P>When we speak of the improvement of health services we must realise that the foundation to a generally good medical service in rural Ireland commences with the dispensary.  We cannot expect our people to go to buildings known as dispensaries where cattle would not be housed.  Because these dispensaries are so bad at the present time and have been for so many years back, we have the glaring fact that there are patients in local authority hospitals who would never have to go there if the medical dispensaries were in a proper condition so that these people could attend there when their illness would not be of a serious nature.</P>
      <P>I have known many instances of people dreading the thought of visiting a local dispensary in the winter time particularly.  As they say, they are almost certain to contract pneumonia out of it while waiting for attendance by the doctor.  There is no waiting accommodation and no facilities of any kind in these places.  That is one of the reasons why people do not attend dispensaries in many areas until their illness is at such a serious stage that they must go to the doctor and their next move is into the local authority hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any money we spend in the improvement of existing dispensaries or in providing decent dispensaries in every locality in the Twenty-Six Counties will be money well spent.  It may seem to <Col N="1211" /> some people inside this House and to people outside that too much money is being allocated for such Government services and that we should not go on with the building of these dispensaries. In their narrow outlook they may have some case to put up but taking the long-term view and considering the result accruing from the existence of these decent dispensaries, I am convinced that this expenditure is very much worth while.  We could then look forward to the time when patients would not have to be drafted continuously into local county hospitals and could be treated in their own immediate neighbourhood.  That is why we should, at the very outset, consider the importance of carrying on the scheme of building dispensaries in every area where they are required.</P>
    <P>It is true that for the last few years money is being provided for the erection of such buildings.  That is a step in the right direction.  We should strain to the limits of our resources to provide for the programme of building local dispensaries.  People may complain of the services available in these dispensaries.  As a member of a local authority I will say that indeed at times they are justified in these complaints.  I have known instances where if a person comes under the heading of a poor law patient with the ordinary dispensary ticket, and goes to the doctor in the local dispensary, he next finds himself in the local authority hospital.  On the other hand, giving credit where it is due, I also know of places where the local dispensary doctor goes out of his way to provide facilities for his patients.  I have even known times when that local dispensary doctor provided out of his own pocket money to procure medicines which were not made available by local authorities.</P>
    <P>In order to augment the service provided in the dispensaries it is vitally important and would be of assistance to the dispensary doctor and of benefit to the patient if a qualified general nurse were attached to every dispensary area.  Mention has been made of midwives.  I do not intend to go into that matter at the present time <Col N="1212" /> but I consider that what is of great importance is a liaison between the dispensary doctor and the patient.</P>
    <P>To-day we have reached the stage when the use of drugs is an everyday practice and day after day injections with drugs of various kinds are recommended for patients. We know that very often in rural Ireland no relation of a patient may be in a position to help that patient by administering drugs or giving injections and it is not always possible to expect the local dispensary doctor to carry out that work.  But if a fully trained nurse is attached to a dispensary, I consider that in her daily rounds such a nurse could attend at the homes of patients and administer these drugs or give necessary injections. While we all know that hospitals are wonderful places, there is always a certain comfort and satisfaction in being able to remain at home during a period of illness and in the knowledge that relatives are within easy call.  I go so far as to say, and I shall stand by the statement if challenged, that there are many patients who have been in local authority hospitals for years who would never enter these hospitals if the services I suggest were provided outside.</P>
    <P>I have known of instances in which dispensary doctors shifted patients into local authority hospitals and while it may not have been the fault of the dispensary doctor always, the main desire was to get these patients cleared away.  Yet we complain of a shortage of beds in many hospitals at present. In the course of the debate, mention has been made of the fact that we have trained nurses in this country as capable and efficient as any nurses in the world.  Many of them are forced to seek employment in other countries and I think a greater effort should be made to retain their services for our sick here at home.  I believe that we should try to utilise their services by having one or more nurses attached to each dispensary district at, of course, a decent salary to enable the nurse to enjoy a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has often been mentioned at meetings of local authorities <Col N="1213" /> is the manner in which medical inspection of dispensaries is carried out.  We have consistently objected to the system at present prevailing.  I object very strongly to the principle under which these medical inspections are carried out.  How often are inspections carried out in dispensary districts?  Roughly from the information I have got as a member of a local authority, I am aware that they are carried out once a year or once every year and a half.  We cannot be blind to the fact&mdash;and every member of a local authority will bear me out in this statement&mdash;that the careless dispensary doctor, and we have some of them, knows when the year is out that he may expect an inspector any day from the Department.  It is quite easy to have everything in order for a short period and then, after the inspection is over, to lapse into the old indifferent method again.  I strongly object to a system which has been in operation, not for the last 12 months but for years back, under which members of a local authority cannot get any information or report on the inspection carried out in certain instances by the local government inspector.  We have had difficulties in this respect and I have mentioned them openly at meetings of the local authority when I considered it my duty to do so.</P>
    <P>As many people know, we have some dispensary doctors who are a credit to themselves, their dispensaries and their profession but if we have such individuals and if we can see the report of the inspector on their dispensaries and their work, why cannot we see the reports in respect to others who are frequently incompetent or indifferent in many ways in regard to their work? Why should members of local authorities not be given a chance of questioning an individual who may be failing in his duties in a particular district?</P>
    <P>We sometimes get complaints from individuals regarding the treatment meted out to them in dispensaries but we are handicapped because of the fact that, for various reasons, these people while willing enough to make their complaint to a member of a local authority, will not put that complaint in writing.  Very often they are afraid <Col N="1214" /> that it may involve some difficulty for them in the future either with the local officials concerned or in some other way.  Therefore, while the county manager may be quite prepared to have the matter investigated, without the necessary information and the necessary witnesses we cannot go on with it.  I believe that if the inspection were carried out more regularly and frequently and if the members of the local authority were supplied through the county managers with a copy of the reports, we would be taking another step forward towards improving medical services in the various dispensaries.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the last few years a great improvement has been noticeable in the treatment of tubercular patients.  I have said previously, and I shall repeat it publicly because I believe no one in this country will want to deny it, that great credit is due to Deputy Dr. Browne for the work which he did as Minister during his term of office for tubercular patients.  While we are making great strides in providing curative treatment for tuberculosis, we are inclined, I think, to be somewhat short-sighted in regard to the treatment of other diseases. It is correct, of course, to say that there are facilities in Dublin to deal with the dread disease of cancer, but what about the rest of the country?  I am not complaining that facilities are available in Dublin which are not to be found in other parts of the country.  After all, we must commence with the capital of the country, but I think we should not be content to concentrate all our efforts on the capital.  I think the system whereby local authorities must send patients from various part of the country to Dublin to have diseases such as cancer dealt with, is a bad one.  I know that we cannot overnight or within a short period provide all the facilities locally to deal with this particular disease.</P>
    <P>There are a few other diseases that I should mention in this connection. One which is so often attended by fatal consequences and comes on its victims so quickly is infantile paralysis.  I wonder are we making the strides <Col N="1215" /> towards a discovery of a remedy for this disease which we should be making.  It has undoubtedly left terrible marks in many parts of the country, and what is more serious for everyone is that the fatal results are increasing each year instead of decreasing.  It is true that other countries cannot say that they have a remedy for it but I wonder are we concentrating sufficiently on trying to find a remedy.  Are we, while doing our utmost with regard to preventive treatment, and so on, for tuberculosis, forgetting the possible dangers which are becoming so noticeable daily in relation to these other diseases?  In the case of heart disease we can see its results daily when friends of our own are suddenly taken away, and I feel that these are all problems on which we should concentrate to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>Because these vicious problems have to be surmounted I believe that Deputy Esmonde is correct when he advised the setting up of a consultative council or some such body.  I do not agree with Deputy Browne, whose view is that we have very few, if any, experts amongst our medical practitioners, but the Minister should do his utmost to secure such experts.  It is strange that the many young Irish doctors who have had to leave their own country because there were no vacancies which they could avail of make such a name for themselves in other countries.  Outside critics may tell us that we are spending a lot of money on various Government Departments but I consider that, no matter what Minister is in office or what Party forms the Government, every effort should be made&mdash;and the question of expense should not enter into it&mdash;to secure the services of experts, whether Irish or foreign, if through their services we can help to prolong the lives of people who have not the benefit of these services at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the mentally deficient.  That is another problem and, from my own experience, I can say that it is a horrifying and lonely experience to go through some of the hospital wards <Col N="1216" /> controlled by our religious orders who are doing such wonderful work in the treatment of these patients.  It is deplorable to realise that even at present we have not sufficient accommodation for such patients.  It is sad to think that the mother of a family with such a child who knows that she can do nothing for the child and who longs to get the child into a home where it will be under the special care, medical and otherwise, of the members of these religious communities, must be told, as she very often has to be told, that there is no accommodation for such a child.</P>
    <P>We should take advantage of the building programme to provide additional accommodation for these cases and, what is more important, we should facilitate to a greater extent than we are doing the provision of such accommodation.  In that connection, I give Deputy Dr. Browne credit for helping during his term of office by providing as much as possible in the way of financial aid in relation to the provision of accommodation for such cases.  The work done by these religious communities is of such a valuable nature to the country that we should be prepared to strain our resources to the utmost to secure for them as much as possible in the way of financial assistance to help them to get on with their very valuable work and to take in more of these patients who are on a waiting list for such a long time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne's reference to the voluntary hospitals struck me as being very surprising.  He may be correct&mdash;I do not know, because my experience of voluntary hospitals is limited&mdash;but, although it is limited, I cannot let this occasion go without telling Deputy Dr. Browne and the House that, from my experience of one voluntary hospital, as a member of the board, it is not correct to say that, in that hospital in Cork City, there are pauper beds, nor is it correct to say that there is special treatment for &ldquo;Mr. Murphy&rdquo; as against &ldquo;Murphy&rdquo;&mdash;the phrase used by Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
    <P>Cases go into that hospital and the staff are never aware&mdash;they never ask <Col N="1217" /> or care&mdash;whether the patient is a paying patient or a free patient.  The staff are not concerned with the financial end of it.  That is dealt with in the secretary's office, but I can say that the same treatment has consistently been given in the South Infirmary in Cork City to the patient who is never able to pay a penny as to the patient in the private ward paying five guineas and six guineas a week.  It is only fair to let the people outside know that, whatever about the other voluntary hospitals mentioned by Deputy Dr. Browne, there is at least one in Cork City which does not come within the category mentioned by him.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his introduction, drew attention to the increased deficits of these voluntary hospitals.  He is quite correct in that, but there is one problem facing the dispensary hospital which the Minister must not forget. The boards of voluntary hospitals have been faced with one very big problem, not for the past year or two, but consistently over the past ten or 11 years. The medical staff at all times, where they considered it necessary, have ordered the provision of most expensive drugs for their patients.  It is true to say that patients got these very expensive drugs whether they were paying patients or not.  The difficulty so far as the hospitals are concerned is the expense of these drugs.  It very often happens that to treat just a few patients the amount of money involved in connection with these drugs is fantastic.  Yet the hospital authorities never question these matters.  Their view at all times is that if they can save a life it is their duty to do so.</P>
    <P>If hospital deficits have increased undoubtedly that is due to the increased price of medicines and particularly up-to-date drugs.  That is responsible for the increased deficits in some of these voluntary hospitals. I am glad that the Minister some while ago considered the necessity of increasing the amount to be paid to the voluntary hospitals for national health patients.  The situation was rather difficult for a period.  The Minister <Col N="1218" /> paid through the national health four guineas and expected the national health patient to pay the other guinea. I am glad that position has been remedied at any rate.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which is of great importance, particularly to the people in the rural areas.  I refer to the schools medical inspection.  This will undoubtedly show excellent results in the future.  I know that many parents, whether through shortsightedness or plain ignorance, consider it humiliating for their children to submit to an inspection in school.  They may prefer to avail of the services of their own private doctor.  As long as the child feels well the parent will never think of bringing a child to the doctor. One of the great factors towards improving the health of the children of the present day&mdash;the men and women of the future&mdash;is a schools medical inspection.  I consider that should be done regularly so that the health of the children can be constantly reported on and the parents made aware in any particular case of the slightest flaw in the health of the children.  If that were done the difficulties could be attended to and a remedy provided in the shortest possible period.</P>
    <P>Side by side with a schools medical inspection, there is another matter which affects the people, particularly in rural areas.  I refer to the system of dental treatment for school children. Cases were reported to me where parents were advised that the children should have their teeth attended to. Because of that, the children were directed to be sent to Cork City or some other large centre.  The parents were then faced with this difficulty.  On account of the number of children who attended on the same day, the dentist, despite his utmost endeavour, was unable to deal with them all.  The Minister may say that is a function of the local authority, but I believe that the Minister in his wisdom should draw attention to the matter and ensure that these programmes are so planned by local authorities that they could be carried out in the spirit in which it was intended to have them carried out <Col N="1219" /> when legislation was introduced in the past and facilities provided.</P>
    <P>I now come to a matter in which every member of this House is interested. That was not always so, because a few years ago there were some who did not agree on the matter.  I refer to the improvement of county homes. When Deputy Dr. Browne was Minister for Health, he sent out a circular to every local authority.  As a member of a local authority, I read with the greatest interest the copy I received of that circular.  Some members considered that the document should not have been sent out.  At the time, some members, perhaps in good faith, believed that it was a fantastic document and that the suggestions in regard to improvement contained in it were fantastic.  Time is proving how right the then Minister for Health was in sending out that document.  We cannot be satisfied with saying that things are all right.  We take pride in the fact that our county homes are vastly different from what they were in the past when they were known as workhouses.  We cannot afford to stop when certain improvements have taken place.  The present Minister is quite correct to ensure that more improvements are carried out in these county homes.  He will have to keep constantly trying to bring them to a state of perfection if that is possible.</P>
    <P>Local authorities with the greatest desire in the world of trying to carry out these improvements are faced with the problem of finance.  While the Minister has given 50 per cent. recoupment on loan charges, I wonder will we get the local authorities in every county to face up to their obligations to have these improvements carried out. Members of all Parties in this House and members of many parties on various local bodies are anxious and eager to throw in their weight behind any suggestion to carry out these important improvements but with the best intentions in the world to do so they are always faced with the problem of finance.  This is not the time although it is the place, perhaps, to go into that problem but, perhaps, I could not go into it very easily either.  However, I say openly for the record that whatever <Col N="1220" /> we may say in regard to other Departments we should be prepared, no matter on what side of the House we may sit, to definitely throw in our weight behind any suggestion to provide money for these important improvements.</P>
    <P>The Minister's suggestion in regard to these improvements is a good and worthy one but from the reaction of members of various local authorities, I am afraid I cannot hope to see these improvements carried out in the time we would wish nor can I hope to see them brought up to the standard we would wish.  I should like to draw attention to one matter in respect of which I would ask the Minister to give me information either when he is replying or at a later date.</P>
    <P>On the 19th May, 1948, I asked a certain question in the House.  The question which I addressed to the then Minister for Health on the 19th May, 1948, dealt with the problem of non-paying patients in local authority institutions.  The question was based on the fact that a decision in our courts went against an applicant who, while being treated in a local authority hospital, suffered some injury which his counsel maintained was caused through the neglect or fault of the staff or servants in the hospital.  The finding of the judge was in favour of the plaintiff, but because he was a non-paying patient he could not get any compensation.  If he had been a paying patient, and if negligence were proved, he could succeed in getting damages.</P>
    <P>The irony of it was that, because he was a non-paying patient in the local authority hospital, he could not recover damages for the injury he had received.  The then Minister, Deputy Dr. Browne, promised to look into the matter.  Owing to the fact that I was not able to attend for a period myself due to illness, I really do not know what has since happened.  I want to ask now whether any alteration has been made which would have the effect of protecting such non-paying patients.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Corry, referred to the question of new hospital plans. We have as many plans for hospitals <Col N="1221" /> in Cork, and we have sent up as many to the Custom House, as would provide plans for the building of hospitals in every capital in Europe.  The whole thing seems to be a joke were it not for the fact that it is such an expensive joke.  The building of hospitals is now going to cost the State and local authorities millions of money.  I suggest that these hospitals could have been built at a time when the cost of doing so would not be a fraction of what it is to-day.  These plans are being sent up and down the country year after year.  Big fees are being paid to architects, engineers and consultants for every alteration that has to be made in them&mdash;even if it is only a new pencil line on the drawing.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that there should be a special staff in the Department of Health to deal with plans for hospitals. We have consultants in the country doing a good practice.  They have their fixed charges and I hold are entitled to receive them.  My point is that we are not entitled to be putting money in the way of various professional men if money could be saved by having a simplified system of planning for hospital buildings through the Department itself.  If we had, hundreds of thousands of pounds could be saved to the ratepayers and to the nation as a whole.  I think we should shake up our ideas in this House as regards the planning and building of hospitals and make a more energetic effort to have all these grand drawings on paper reduced to a practical form for the accommodation of our sick people.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to some of the problems that local authorities are faced with.  To some people these may seem small matters but they are by no means small to the people affected.  I mentioned earlier that it is a common thing now to hear of sudden deaths.  I have had some sad cases concerning widows brought to my notice.  I know of one who was in very bad circumstances when her husband died.  She had the usual funeral expenses to meet. It was only when all her trouble was over that she got the bill from the undertaker.  She found then that she was not in a position to meet it.  That <Col N="1222" /> is an example of cases which come before local authorities.  We are asked to provide some financial assistance, but, under the regulations, we cannot do so.  The local authority could help in a case of that sort if the local home assistance officer were approached before the burial had taken place.  I would be glad if the Minister would do something to have that matter investigated. I think some change in the regulations should be made so that in cases where home assistance officers and county managers are satisfied that widows and others are genuinely in need of some help, they should be in a position to give it.</P>
    <P>I should like to make appeal on somewhat the same lines in the case of people in bad health.  It must be admitted that our health services have been improved year after year, and that the special allowance which is now paid to dependents of people suffering from tuberculosis has been of great advantage in these cases.  You have, however, the cases of other people suffering from different kinds of disease who are in very straitened circumstances and are not entitled to any financial help.  I have in mind the case of a man who served this nation well. The wife and himself are complete cripples, not from tuberculosis but from rheumatoid arthritis.  The wife is not able to do anything at all for herself.  They have a young family. The husband tries to do the best he can about the house but that is very little.  All that they are entitled to is home assistance. Perhaps some arrangement could be made to give some financial assistance to such people after a thorough investigation has been made as to their circumstances.  If that could be done, it would be a godsend to people suffering as this family is suffering.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I should like to deal with.  It has been mentioned by other Deputies and particularly, I think, by Deputy Dr. Browne.  Up to a certain point it shows the amount of agreement that there is between us.  I am hoping that perhaps something further may be done.  I refer to doctors in the country carrying on a private practice. <Col N="1223" /> They are noted for the help they give, very often free, to patients suffering from different ailments.  They are not dispensary doctors.  In some of the areas that I have in mind the people have no faith in the local dispensary doctor.  When they are ill, they go to the doctor who is carrying on a private practice.  These doctors do all they can up to the point where the patient requires hospital treatment.  Then a difficulty arises.  The private doctor cannot send a patient into a local authority hospital and it is not so easy for him to get patients into voluntary hospitals, especially in the South, owing to the limited extent of our hospital accommodation.</P>
    <P>In drawing the Minister's attention to this, I am not asking that the doors of the local authority hospitals should be left open to everyone.  Is it not strange that a patient will go to a private doctor when there is a dispensary doctor available?  When that happens should we not ask whether the local dispensary doctor is giving the service we would wish for?</P>
    <P>That is a matter that is very difficult to prove.  The best proof of the incompetency of a dispensary doctor is the fact that patients avoid him and go to a private doctor.  I have not in mind patients who can afford to pay.  That is completely different.  I am referring to patients in rural Ireland who have no hope of paying but who have to go to a private doctor.  It is a pity that some system could not be adopted whereby returns of cases dealt with by the local dispensary doctor could be investigated.  In any case where the return showed a remarkably small number of poor law patients being attended we would be entitled to have an investigation as to how the medical service had been carried out in the particular area.</P>
    <P>I am not asking the Minister to reply to this matter when he is concluding the debate but I would ask him to bear this problem in mind so that a better medical service may be given to the people in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I do not know why Deputies avoided one problem which should not be avoided, that is, the cost of medicines. <Col N="1224" /> Deputies have referred to patients who may be classified as poor law patients and they have referred to the white collar workers and displayed sympathy towards those people.  Every day I hear middle-class patients complaining of the exorbitant price of medicines.  Has the Minister any control over that matter?  Is there a ring operating that we cannot break? The doctor does his part but then the patient has to provide the medicine. Again, it is a matter of finance.</P>
    <P>I want to avoid bringing into this debate any reference to future legislation in connection with this matter. I am dealing with the present position. Possibly the problems that exist now may not be remedied by future Bills. Medicines are required at a time when people are ill.  They cannot be done without.  The prices charged in many instances are prohibitive.  Then we have discussions on restrictive trade practices and rings.  I am not singling out any particular chemist.  I have no particular chemist in mind.  The matter is one that must be approached by the present Minister or future Ministers. No matter what Bill may be introduced, the problem of ill-health will remain if the people cannot afford to pay the high cost of medicines.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the nursing profession.  The nursing service in every hospital, local authority hospital, voluntary hospital, has proved to be excellent.  As it is excellent we should treat the members of the profession properly.  I should like to group with the nursing community a section that may at times be forgotten, namely, attendants in local authority hospitals.  The worth of the attendant is not at times appreciated. In view of the reply the Minister gave to a parliamentary question last week about proposed increased salaries for attendants, I would ask him also to take into consideration the importance of the work these people do in the hospitals and to realise that they are entitled to what has been recommended for them.  I hope he will say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to a proposal that has been sent up to him in this matter.</P>
    <P>The nursing council should be prepared to co-operate with every local <Col N="1225" /> authority.  They have co-operated with the authorities in Cork as regards a certain number of male nurses in the particular hospital there.  There should be attached to every local authority hospital a number of male nurses, whether it is one, two, three or four. Any difficulties in the way of having fully qualified male nurses attached to these hospitals must be overcome.  In many local authority hospitals, difficulties arise for patients which only a male nurse can solve.  Our nursing service is an excellent service.  When we refer to that service, we usually have in mind female nurses.  There are many instances where the people who should appreciate their services most do not do so.  I refer to the doctors who depend on nurses to carry out their instructions for the care of the patient.  We must be prepared to give nurses what they could get in other countries, not just a meagre living, but a decent living.  If we do that, we can have a contented nursing profession and plenty of recruits for the profession. If we do that, our hospitals, be they new hospitals or dispensaries, will not be short of nurses.</P>
    <P>My final remark is based on one point&mdash;&ldquo;No End to It.&rdquo;  Members may say there is no end to me, and I do not blame them.  The words may not mean so much to people here but to people outside they may seem of great importance. To the editor of a certain newspaper published in Dublin last night, these words &ldquo;No End to It&rdquo; were of great importance, as he was drawing attention to the amount of money being provided for health services and the amount we are in a position to provide. I am not picking out anyone to attack. People who use these words are entitled to use them, but our answer must be, as I said at the start: &ldquo;Are we prepared to barter the health of our people because someone says there is an end to the money?&rdquo; Are we prepared to say we cannot give proper dispensaries, proper hospitalisation and proper help to improve the health of young children?</P>
    <P>Some of us in this House know from our own experience what it means in body and mind to deal with the <Col N="1226" /> problem of ill-health.  We can speak our own minds and we know that there are those who may never have been faced with such a problem and who, if they were in need of medical attention, were lucky enough not to have to worry about financial problems.  Some of us know that it is the problem of finance to the person who is ill, to the father and mother of the child, that very often means serious illness or death because they cannot afford financially to get what would save that life.  Are we prepared to give lip service to Christianity and yet say that some sections must go without medical attention?  Can we allow people who can provide their own medical attention to tell us there must be an end to the provision of money for medical attention for those who cannot provide it for themselves?</P>
    <P>I tell the Minister that where the Labour Party is concerned he will have their backing in any provision of security for the physical well-being of our people, because the members of the Labour Party are fully aware that this is a constant problem facing the people in every part of the country.  Whatever we may say about other services, there is one thing that we will say, as Irishmen and as Christians, that we will never question any Minister for Health who brings in recommendations which in our hearts we know will be of benefit to the people who need them.  Any Minister who is so sincere as to bring in proposals of that kind will get our support, as we know the good end which those proposals are designed to bring about.  Not alone will he get our support but the blessings of the people in rural Ireland who in 1953 are so often not able to provide for themselves and their families the medical attention which at times is so urgently needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad I have not the harrowing experiences of Deputy Desmond to relate regarding the Dublin area.  In particular, on his complaints about dispensary doctors, my experience of Dublin City and county is that dispensary doctors are overworked and underpaid.  I suggest that Deputies who have local com- <Col N="1227" /> plaints should make them, as the Dublin Corporation or Dublin Board of Assistance does, that is, straight to the Minister, when they can get an audience. I suppose this is the time to thank the Minister for his geniality towards any deputation I was associated with in the past year.  If he could not concede what we were looking for, we never came away with an aching heart.</P>
      <P>I rise principally to correct any false impression which may be created by a number of speakers in relation to the voluntary hospital system.  The majority of speakers yesterday quite obviously are unacquainted with the system.  They have no experience and are speaking out of their inexperience, speaking from hearsay.  One must know the history of the voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin and trace it from its growth to the present time, to have a full knowledge of it.  It grew up here principally in the 18th century&mdash;Mercer's, Jervis Street, the Meath, Dun's and the other hospitals, the North Dublin Infirmary and later on the South Dublin Union.  These hospitals started as voluntary institutions. The population of Dublin was very small, whereas to-day it is very big so&mdash;to bridge the gap of the years quickly&mdash;it is sufficient to say that the voluntary hospital system, such as it was, does not exist to-day.  Practically from the inception of the Hospitals' Trust Fund, the voluntary hospital system ceased in one aspect, that is, in the collection of voluntary subscriptions.  Voluntary subscriptions now, save in the case of one particular hospital, have practically ceased to exist in relation to the hospitals' annual budget.</P>
      <P>To-day the hospitals find themselves in the position that their combined deficits this year are in the neighbourhood of £600,000.  The Minister took the year 1951, when the combined deficits of all the hospitals amounted to £588,000.  He compared that with the year 1939.  The Minister said the cost of living had gone up by 120 per cent. and the cost of running the hospital services by 250 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I submit to the Minister that there is no comparison, no yardstick <Col N="1228" /> to compare the two&mdash;the cost of living, the cost of running hospital services? Comparison is impossible by any proposition.  Three words&mdash;streptomycin, aureomycin and terramycin&mdash; one may not know what they mean in cost in the everyday use in every voluntary hospital in the city.  Wages have increased and under every head of expense every single item has shown an increase, an unavoidable increase. The increases would have been avoided if possible by the voluntary board of governors, by the ladies and gentlemen who give their time free to run the hospitals.  That is an aspect which is too often forgotten.  The members of the voluntary boards who give their time and their attention to the everyday working of the hospitals are the people, in my opinion, most competent to run a hospital.  Remote control is all right in its own place but not in the realm of hospitalisation.</P>
    <P>I know what I am talking about when I deal with 1939.  That was the year I came into this House, and I think in the following year the St. Laurence's Hospital Bill was introduced. I was a member of that hospital board from the time the Dublin Corporation was given power to nominate a person to it.  I ceased to be a member, not because of anything I did of which I would be ashamed, but because of a matter that is relevant to the discussion to-day. When I became chairman of the finance committee of the then Richmond Hospital in 1941 there were maids working there at 3/6 per week all found; there were porters working for 15/8 per week.  That shows the difference between 1931 and 1951.</P>
    <P>I have a typical hospital bill here, not for St. Laurence's Hospital but for another hospital with which I am associated. In 1939, the cost of provisions was £4,512; in 1951, £18,175; drugs cost £2,600 in 1939 and in 1951, £8,874.  Here is another item: nurses' salaries, 1939, £2,801; 1951, £11,450; maids' wages, £800 in 1939 and in 1951, £2,626.  If you want to compare the cost of living with the cost of running a hospital, again I say that by any criterion it cannot be done.</P>
    <P>A hospital is quite different from <Col N="1229" /> other institutions.  Things happen from day to day in a hospital that do not happen elsewhere and the hospital management and staff must be prepared for them.  A hospital whose voluntary board is trusted cannot work on a pegged deficit; it must have a blank cheque.  I am not asking for a blank cheque, but I am asking that the deficits should not be fixed and that reasonable deficits should be paid.  The deficits were fixed a few years ago in the middle of the year, in June.  After a half year's working, the hospitals were informed by Deputy Dr. Browne, who was then Minister, that they were pegged to a certain deficit and the combined total for all the hospitals was £400,000.  Hospitals just cannot work on that basis.  The sooner the Minister and his advisers realise that and the sooner full appreciation is given to the work of the voluntary staffs and the voluntary governors the better.</P>
    <P>From porters to nurses, the conditions of the hospital staffs have been improved.  The treatment of patients has undoubtedly improved.  In that connection, I want to say that Deputy Desmond's experience in Cork has been my experience in Dublin, and I got that experience both in the St. Laurence's Hospital and the Meath Hospital.  I should like to rid anybody who has got it of the impression that there is any special treatment meted out to people in these voluntary hospitals because they are paying patients. There is not a scintilla of truth in that. These are two of the biggest hospitals and there is not a private home or private establishment attached to either of them.  All the members of the public who are brought into the wards in these hospitals get exactly the same treatment. If Deputy Kyne, Deputy Desmond, or anybody else knows of any patient, whether adult or child, who cannot get specialised treatment in the country, if that person is brought to Dublin I will bring him to the specialist that he needs and I will guarantee that that specialist will do what he does for the Dublin poor, treat him free no matter how long that treatment may take.</P>
    <P>It is time that somebody said that because the medical profession are too <Col N="1230" /> often libelled.  In my opinion, they are not different from any other section of the community.  They have their faults and their virtues and I would say that those with virtues far outnumber those with faults.  When we consider the work that has to be done in a voluntary hospital and that the physicians and the surgeons, particularly the surgeons, in the great majority of cases get no payments for their services and must be at call for the 24 hours of the day, I do not think too high a tribute can be paid to them.  I say that there is no foundation for any suggestions which have been made here against these gentlemen.  From my experience after 15 years' association with hospitals and individual practitioners I can refute them completely.</P>
    <P>There was a point made here about the system of medical appointments which, again, was a reflection on the boards of governors and the joint committees. The boards of governors or the joint committees make the medical appointments.  I certainly know what paper qualifications mean when I see them.  I know what degrees mean after a man's name and I know what his experience may mean.  But in all cases in the making of such appointments I defer to medical opinion, and why should I not?  The suggestion which was also made that there was one group on one side and another on another side working against each other on these hospital boards is not true.  That is not true in either case that I have mentioned.  It is not true in the case of St. Kevin's or the Meath Hospital.  It is certainly not true in the case of the Rheumatism Clinic.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but I must make some appeal to the Minister on behalf of the nurses. Deputies have spoken about our well-trained nurses and there can be no question of their qualifications.  Our nurses are the best trained that can be found anywhere.  Certainly one will not find their superior.  Too many of them have gone across the water because of the attractions that exist there and that creates a problem here at home.  That problem may be solved in a period of years since a good number of probationers are now coming <Col N="1231" /> in.  Indeed there has been a remarkable increase in the number of probationers recently.</P>
    <P>The particular point I want to make is that the eight-hour day is not being implemented everywhere.  Some of the hospitals simply cannot implement it. I want the Minister to ensure that the eight-hour day is observed everywhere through the medium of whatever inducements he can hold out.  It is not fair to expect a probationer to work a 13½ hour day.  That is too long.  The Minister knows that.  I know he is interested in this matter and I know that he will consider the points I am making.</P>
    <P>In some cases nurses' homes have been built in the belief that the eight-hour day would be implemented. These homes cannot be filled because the nurses are not available.  Some effort should be made to bring back fully trained nurses from across the water.  The sooner that is done the better it will be.</P>
    <P>I appreciate and so do those associated with me on the public health committee of the corporation and in other institutions the way the Minister has met us during the past year and I know that we will have his co-operation again in the coming year.</P>

      <P>Before making my brief speech I would like in all sincerity to congratulate Deputy McCann on a really remarkably honest and courageous speech.  My reason for entering into this debate at this stage is for the purpose of dealing with the scandalous slanders that have been rolled around inside and outside this House in relation to the voluntary hospitals and in relation to the members of the medical profession.  Some of these slanders, by their very reticence, supported by innuendo the Minister's behaviour and conduct.  It is much better, therefore, that the emphatic denial and the clear exposure of the slanders and the complete demolition of the case built up around such slanders should come from a Deputy sitting on the Government Benches, a Deputy who has given years of close attention to the medical services in Dublin and in particular to its hospital institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> No country can ever become great unless it is proud of the things that are good in its own country, and unless its people go forward boasting of the things of which they are entitled to be proud.  No country will ever be anything but a small country and a miserable country if its people are jealous and snarl and spit at the things of which they should be proud in their own country.  When we hear Deputies snarling at and pouring contempt on the grand voluntary hospitals, on the workers inside those hospitals and on the leading specialists who are giving their time, their knowledge and their skill for the benefit of their own people, then we say: &ldquo;God help the country that has such representatives, crawling in by any door into the nation's Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the speech made by Deputy McCann, a man who from his knowledge of the inside workings of such institutions is able to come in here and tell us that inside no voluntary hospital has he ever heard of any differentiation between alleged pauper beds and other beds.  I was glad, too, to hear that denied by Deputy Desmond who, as a public man acting on the boards of voluntary hospitals down in the South, can speak also with inside knowledge.  He told us to-day that he never heard such labels as &ldquo;pauper beds&rdquo; as distinct from other beds in our voluntary hospitals.  Yet we have Deputies here making that assertion, and when it comes from the mouth of a medical Deputy, an ex-Minister for Health, then it is all the more dangerous, all the more damaging, all the more contemptible and all the more unforgivable.  I rely with confidence on the Minister for Health when winding up this debate to deny with all the authority of his office and with the cloak of his profession the slanders that were disseminated here last night, particularly those disseminated by Deputy Dr. Noel Browne.</P>
    <P>We are rightly entitled to enjoy, if not the premier position as a centre of medical teaching, one of the foremost positions in the world.  Because of that, because of our fame as a teaching centre in relation to medicine and because of our standing as an area <Col N="1233" /> wherein specialists and practitioners are so successful in carrying out their work we attract here from all over the world students and even qualified doctors to learn that particular profession. Enjoying that name abroad it is imperative in the national interest that such suggestions as those thrown out here last night&mdash;that appointments to our staffs depend on whether one is a knight or a mason or some kind of a free brother and that appointments having been decided on such lines they are occasionally referred to the medical boards and those boards are careful to select for staff vacancies men of such a calibre that they will not be likely to successfully compete against them-selves&mdash;should be nailed once and for all.  Anything more shocking, anything more untrue, anything more unjust, anything more despicable was never said or heard said against a decent deserving body of men ever before in our history.  The least they deserve is the thanks for the work they have done and are doing.</P>
    <P>People like Deputy McCann know that.  They see the work.  They move about amongst the patients.  They see that in our hospitals there is no differentiation as between the patient in this bed and the patient in the other bed.  They see that there is no differentiation whether one man has money and another man has none. When a patient goes into one of our hospitals, thanks be to God, and we can be proud of it, the patient becomes a case.  It is a case in a bed; it is a case on the table.  It is a problem&mdash; a problem to be cured, a problem to be treated.  The suggestion that the service and the treatment given varies according to the class or the wealth of the patient is a suggestion that should never have been made.  The man who made it should be asked&mdash; if there is really decent feeling and national pride in the Assembly&mdash; to withdraw from the nation's Assembly in disgrace and shame.  I leave it to the Minister to deal further with those remarks.  He may have troubles, he may have his quarrels, he may have his difficulties with the members of the medical profession: that is all in a day's work.  However, it is <Col N="1234" /> up to him, as Minister for Health, to tell the people of this country and the people outside it that the members of the medical profession and the voluntary hospitals of this country do not deserve the things that were said about them here yesterday evening.</P>
    <P>We heard criticism of our voluntary hospitals on the basis of cost.  The case made was that because those hospitals are getting into debt, because their deficits are increasing, public funds have to be devoted to their assistance and if public funds are devoted to their assistance then the State must go into the hospitals after the funds and control the hospitals.  People may have very short memories: when we are talking of voluntary hospitals and talking in these terms, then definitely people have very short memories.  The great hospitals' sweep was started about 22 years ago.  It was started by a group of people outside this House&mdash; doctors and others&mdash;who were interested in the voluntary hospitals.  One or two sweeps were run from abroad&mdash; from Switzerland.  Then the idea arose of coming here and getting an Act passed to legalise sweeps for voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Sweepstakes Bill was passed.  The income was considerably greater than anybody thought it would be.  The voluntary hospitals looked like being made up.  The idea was to extend the hospitals, to build more if necessary and to have a fund that would run the hospitals.  But, when the size of the pool was seen, what happened?  The Government stepped in.  They raided the pool.  They took it over for the rate-aided hospitals. Therefore, that fund which belonged to the voluntary hospitals was scooped by the Government and used by the rate-aided hospitals up and down the country.  That is historically accurate. If those voluntary hospitals now find themselves in such a position that they are short of money and that the Government has got to give them some to keep them going, it is giving them back their own; but it makes no case whatsoever for State control of hospitals.</P>
    <P>We heard criticism of the running of the voluntary hospitals.  We heard <Col N="1235" /> criticism with regard to economy. Plenty of hospitals in this country are run by local authorities under the direction and supervision of the Department of Health.  Is it suggested that any one of those is run better than our voluntary hospitals?  Is there any rate-aided hospital in Ireland that can hold a halfpenny candle to any one of our voluntary hospitals?  I have practised in and out of both for nearly 40 years.  I know what I am talking about.  I know that the voluntary hospitals are run vastly better than our rate-aided hospitals which are supervised and directed by the State.  In the interests of patients, among other things, I should be long sorry to see the day when the State would be entitled to put its nose into these grand voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>We have heard talk about economy. Economy in a hospital! Where will you economise?  Are the wages paid to the workers, to the maids, to the porters, too high?  Are the rations given to the patients too generous?  Where will you economise?  I know that where you will economise is in the operating theatre and in the dressing-room. There you will find what to a civil servant would appear to be waste. &ldquo;Why would that dressing not do a second time?  Why not clip a bit off that and use the rest of it?&rdquo; I hope to God we shall never see that kind of economy in our hospitals.  Cleanliness! Sheets, according to some, are changed too often.  The laundry bill is too big. The more cleanliness we have, the more exaggerated and extravagant cleanliness we have in our hospitals the better.</P>
    <P>The hospitals are well run, competently run, efficiently run.  The professional standards are high.  The work is second to none in the world. All that is wanted inside those hospitals and down through that profession is more assistance and less interference.</P>
    <P>An attempt is made through this Health Bill to reach out and take not small steps but big steps&mdash;long strides &mdash;towards State socialism in medicine in this country.  A new Department <Col N="1236" /> has grown up&mdash;the Department of Health.  Every Department wants more and more power.  They are looking for it there.  The thin edge of the wedge is in the Bill.  The doctors are accused of being unreasonable in their opposition.  They sensed from the beginning that it was a big step towards State control, towards State medicine.  Since this debate began we have heard it announced openly and noisily that that was the intention, that that was the aim, the object, the goal in sight.  If our services were bad, if they were indifferent, if they were even subject for reasonable complaint, then there might be some case for a change.</P>
    <P>What is the case for interfering with a machine that is efficient and that is going well&mdash;a machine that may want only a little more fuel, a little more assistance?  Why break it up in order to replace it by something for the very name of which the members of my profession have nothing but absolute detestation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief on this Estimate.  Since the money is mainly required for the purpose of erecting new hospitals, I think the House will have no hesitation in granting this Estimate.  The amount of money required is very, very large but the need, as we all realise, is also very great.  In every county steps are being taken to complete the hospital programme.  Much good work is being done but much remains to be done and the Government has taken the correct step in supplementing the Hospitals' Trust money with the capital that is necessary in order to complete this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broad general principle of financing public health, I have very great misgivings.  We all agree that a substantial sum of money is required but it does occur to some Deputies to ask how ought this money to be provided. There is a growing feeling amongst local authorities and public representatives on local authorities that too great a burden will be thrown upon them in the future through the provision that they must supply 50 per cent. of the cost of public health.  A <Col N="1237" /> contribution of 50 per cent. from the local authorities is, in my view, excessive. Some people may say, perhaps, that the local authorities have been spoiled to a certain extent inasmuch as over the past four or five years, since the passing of the 1947 Act, they have not been requested to make any contribution to the increases in outlay. Now that the period in which that relief operated has expired as far as most counties are concerned, counties find themselves compelled to bear 50 per cent. of the increased cost of the health services generally and that 50 per cent. will amount to a very serious impost on the rates.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that there is not very much difference whether a citizen pays by way of rates or by way of taxation, whether he pays as a general taxpayer or as a ratepayer, but I think there is a fundamental difference. It ought to be taken into account that the direct levy in the form of rates is perhaps the more severe levy on the citizen.  Therefore, I would ask that relief in some way or other, not perhaps the complete relief that is provided under the 1947 Act, should be provided for the local authorities in regard to health services.  A 50 per cent. contribution is excessive and I do not think it is one that can be borne or will be borne by the local rate-payers.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of consideration given to the question of remodelling and improving our county homes.  On that question I have views of my own and I have given this matter consideration not only as a Deputy but as a member of a local authority and I feel that the time has come to scrap completely the whole system of county homes as we have known them in the past.  The workhouse is an ancient institution in this country.  It was provided by a benevolent British Government as a sort of corrective for the citizens of this State. Those who failed to make good, that is, to make money, were eventually pushed into the county home.  When these substantial and formidable buildings were being erected, instructions were issued that they should not be made too luxurious.  The walls were strongly built and well built but it was <Col N="1238" /> ensured that they would not be of plaster inside lest it would make the building too homelike, and the people who were in there would feel that they did not fail so badly in life; then there would not be the terror of the county home to force people to work longer hours, to work harder and so avoid that humiliation.</P>
    <P>That was the social approach 100 years ago and that was the foundation on which this county home system was built.  Of course, it had other advantages, too, in those days, inasmuch as it pushed away from the sight of the more prosperous section of the community people who were not fit to be seen and people who might shock the good people in the upper classes of society if they were to see this poverty and degradation.  The idea at that time was to hide that degradation from the eyes of the decent people of the community; by &ldquo;decent&rdquo; of course was meant the wealthy section of the community.</P>
    <P>That whole idea must give place to something more Christian and to something more humane.  The people who end their days in the county homes are now generally recognised as being ordinary decent human beings.  They may not have been as fortunate as some of their fellow creatures but they have not committed any crime.  For that reason we did try, on the establishment of this State, to change these county homes into something better than they were.  We changed the name &ldquo;workhouse&rdquo; to &ldquo;county home&rdquo; but that change did not alter the fact that the walls were still built of solid granite on which there was no plaster and there was no effort made to make the building any more homely.  In recent years the local authorities have been trying to remove some of the evils associated with the county home system.  They have been trying to improve these buildings, but I want to ask this question, whether it is wise to go on spending money upon these old institutions?  They are the relics of another age and represent an entirely different approach to social questions.  Unlike the voluntary hospitals to which Deputy O'Higgins referred, they have no proud tradition <Col N="1239" /> to uphold.  In my opinion, the decent thing to do is to get rid of them as quickly as possible.  They could be converted eventually, perhaps, into factories or used for some other utilitarian purpose but as hospitals or as homes for the aged or for the poor they are entirely unfit.</P>
    <P>There is a number of categories into which the patients in the county homes are divided.  There are what the hospital authorities describe as the ambulant patients and the non-ambulant patients, that is, those who can walk and those who are confined to their beds.  In addition to those, you have the mental defectives, unmarried mothers and various other types of people.  However, in planning for the future we should consider one general classification, that is, the aged and infirm.  These are the people for whom some type of accommodation ought to be provided separately from the other sections who are now housed in county homes.</P>
    <P>The aged and the infirm, I would say, may also be divided into two classifications.  You have those who are completely bedridden and those who are not.  In regard to those who are able to be up and about, I think what they require is not so much a home in the ordinary sense, as some kind of colony of the smaller type of house, with a central or communal service provided.  If a person in his old age cannot live with his own family for some reason or another, or if he has not a near relative with whom he can live, the best thing that can be provided for him in decency is a small house, a two-roomed house or a similar type of house, in which there is some kind of common servicing which would give such people the assistance of a certain amount of nursing and attention.</P>
    <P>That, I think, should be the present-day approach to that problem as far as those who are able to be up and about are concerned.  But when you come to aged people who are completely bedridden, I fail to see where there can be very much difference between the treatment of such people <Col N="1240" /> and the treatment of ordinary patients in the ordinary county or voluntary hospitals.  I think that what is required for such people is an annexe to the ordinary county hospital.  They require treatment and nursing just the same as other patients in the hospital and they may require medical and surgical treatment.  That would seem to be the only sensible way of dealing with these people.</P>
    <P>There is not much use in providing a modern county hospital with all the amenities that appertain to it, and then building another hospital, perhaps some miles away from the county hospital, for old people who are bedridden. That does not seem to be a rational approach to this problem.  Let all those who require hospital treatment be housed in the same institution while for the people who are able to be up and about, let there be, perhaps, one big colony in each county or, perhaps, a number of such colonies convenient to some town or village, convenient to churches and chapels, to the post office and all the other amenities that these aged people will require.  In my opinion that is the ideal, in fact I would say the only, solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Dr. Browne in regard to voluntary hospitals and health services generally and I also listened to Deputy Larkin speaking in this House in connection with the same problem a few weeks ago.  I must say, having listened to these two Deputies speak on health services, that I am always rather terrified in regard to their approach to the whole problem. They seem to feel, and feel very sincerely, that the only solution to our difficulties, in regard to public health and the health of our people generally, is the complete nationalisation of all health services.  Deputy Dr. Browne indicated, fairly logically of course, that since voluntary hospitals are receiving certain contributions from the State, it is the duty of the State to take over, in effect, these voluntary hospitals.  That appears to me to be a somewhat extravagant or exaggerated approach.</P>
    <P>All of us who are farmers must admit that farmers receive a number of <Col N="1241" /> grants from the State.  A farmer may receive a grant to improve or drain his land but does it follow that because he received such a grant the State should take over his farm?  Does it follow that he should be deprived of the right of private ownership because he is assisted in some way in the management of his property?  In the same way I do not think it is right completely to argue that because a voluntary hospital receives a contribution from the State, the State is entitled to take over that institution and run it. A case can be made, I suppose if it is thought fit, for the State requiring certain minimum standards or additions consequent upon granting assistance to a hospital.  That I suppose is reasonable enough and I think it would be conceded, if required, but it is not right to suggest that because committees of management in voluntary hospitals are not elected by the people that they are not perhaps the best committees to run these institutions. A committee which may be elected only by a small group of people or which may be selected, if you like, by a small group of people, may not be entirely democratic according to ordinary democratic principles or rules but it may be as efficient and may be as beneficial perhaps to patients as if it were elected.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that professional people or people who had been successful in business and retire, can become governors of such hospitals by reason of making a contribution and the suggestion was made that these people have no right to occupy that position and that the better governors are those elected by the people.  That is democracy if you like but, I think, it is pushing democracy a little bit too far.  When I look around me at the people who are elected to certain bodies in the interests of democracy&mdash;in fact, to take the harm out of it, perhaps I should say that when I look at the mirror in the morning, I am often surprised at the queer type of people who get elected under a democratic franchise.  That type of person in my opinion is not one bit more capable than the average person who by reason of his interest <Col N="1242" /> in hospitalisation manages to become the governor of a voluntary hospital. Very often a retired businessman or professional man who secures election to the board of a voluntary hospital does so because of his deep interest in the welfare of the sick and infirm. Very often a politican who gets elected to the board of a public or State hospital has no interest at all in the sick, or very little interest.  His main interest may be to get a foothold on a particular board or as many boards as he can, with a view to advancing his political career.</P>
    <P>That happens occasionally, and for that reason I do not think we should break away completely from old established traditions and customs.  If a voluntary hospital is being run well&mdash; that is the main thing&mdash;if it is being run efficiently and if the patients are getting good service I do not think we should seek to break with the old tradition and set up a new democratic government in that institution.  It does not always work out for the best.  The whole idea of free-for-all health services does not always work out for the best, either.  It is better that there should be a recognition that the first essential with regard to illness is that the best treatment should be provided, irrespective of a person's means or a person's standing in society.  After that, I do not think there is any harm in asking the person who has means and who has benefited by medical or hospital treatment to make a fair contribution for the services he has received.</P>
    <P>That is much better than taxing everybody to the maximum and then providing a service for which no charge whatever will be made.  People who have benefited by medical hospital treatment are quite glad to make a contribution, if they have the money, and it increases their own self-respect to be able to pay.  On the other hand, where there is completely free medical and institutional treatment, there is always a tendency for people to seek more treatment than they really require.  This is a statement which will be controverted to a certain extent. People will say that nobody seeks medical attention, unless he is seriously <Col N="1243" /> ill, but most medical men will agree that a very large proportion of their income is derived from the imagination of the people who think they are ill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The patient's imagination. In the case of treatment, I should say that a good deal of it is imaginary also, and perhaps it is no harm, because, if a person gets a bottle of some kind of medicine, and is told that it will do him good, he perhaps feels that it will and perhaps it does do him good, although it may be only some kind of coloured water.  In all matters relating to health, the mind and the imagination play a very large part, and for that reason it is wrong to encourage everybody to concentrate too much on thoughts of illness and to compel all people to make substantial contributions by way of rates and taxes to finance themselves when they are ill, with the net result that everybody thinks he has some form of illness so that he may be able to recover a certain amount of the contribution he has made by way of rates and taxes. It would be much better if, in all cases of illness, people were asked to pay some little contribution or make some little payment for the privilege of being ill, or pretending, or thinking they are ill.</P>
      <P>There is always on the outer fringe of a larger number of people who suffer illness quite a number who merely think they are suffering from some illness, and if treatment is completely free, either in a clinic or a hospital, they will crowd into the clinics and hospitals and, perhaps, crowd out the people who are really seriously ill.  That is the danger in all public health schemes.  It was the danger which was encountered in the health scheme in Great Britain and which would be encountered here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While administering his Department as well and as ably as he has been doing, and while taking adequate measures to ensure that the requisite <Col N="1244" /> number of hospital beds are available for those who need them, the Minister should go slow in regard to the policy of State medicine and the policy of socialising the entire health services. One of the dangers of socialising or nationalising public health services is that, once you have taken the step, you cannot retrace it.  Once the State has taken over the provision of treatment by the private physician, once it has taken over all hospital institutions and the entire service of public health, it is very difficult to hand them back to the private practitioner and the voluntary hospital.  For that reason, the Government should move slowly in this matter.</P>
    <P>I must say that the Health Bill going through the Dáil is moderate in that respect and the Minister's approach is one of caution and care. While he has given due consideration to the claims of the various sections of the community who have advanced their views, he has given very long and careful attention to the views of the medical profession, and on that he is to be congratulated.  Some people may have told him that he has been unduly patient, but that is not a crime in this or any other country, and it is certainly not a crime for a Minister dealing with such a delicate and complicated matter as public health.  I hope he will continue to be reasonably patient with everybody who has to advise him on this problem and will endeavour to obtain as much co-operation as possible from the medical profession and from those in charge of the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>In that way he will be advancing more surely towards a better health service than he would be if he were to go out, like some of these ruthless surgeons we hear about who want to operate in all cases, and operate completely on the present system, changing it completely, nationalising it, if you like.  He would then be taking a very dangerous step and one which it might be impossible to repair.</P>
    <P>With regard to the burden imposed on the local rates as a result of the expansion of our health services and the expiry of the period in which they <Col N="1245" /> are completely recouped, I think the Minister will have to reconsider the whole position.  I do not think that the local authorities should be asked to share the burden on a 50-50 basis. I hold they should share the burden to some extent but not to the extent of 50 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that much of the money spent on health services deals with effects rather than causes.  I listened yesterday to the Minister explaining about the economic loss of ill-health. I quite agree with him but I would go further and say that nobody can estimate the social costs of preventable ill-health.  I feel we are not paying sufficient attention to the care of growing children.  We are not paying sufficient attention to the housing problem which is responsible for much ill-health in this country.  If anybody wants to be convinced of that he should look up the infant mortality rate in regard to England and other countries during the last seven, ten or 15 years.</P>
      <P>It is a remarkable fact that the infant mortality rate in England was never lower than it was during the war years.  That was due to the fact that the mothers and children in England were never better treated and never got more nourishing food than they did during the war years.  Children and mothers were the first consideration of the British Government during those years and even to-day.  The result is that the infant mortality rate decreased. I understand that last year the rate was 32 per 1,000.  If we compare that with the infant mortality rate in this country it will give us something to think about.  That is why I say that in spending much of the money on the health services we are dealing with effects rather than causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his introductory speech yesterday, the Minister stated that no man suffering from T.B. could be regarded as being cured until he was able to be re-employed in his former occupation. No later than last month I had to deal with a T.B. case.  It concerned a man with a wife and six children.  The father had T.B.  He spent 20 months in one particular hospital.  He was another <Col N="1246" /> long period in one of the sanatoria. Last June he was certified as being quiescent and the doctor gave him a certificate to that effect.  The man came to me and told me he was not getting allowance to which he was entitled as a person suffering from T.B.  His employer told him he was not fit to take up employment and unless he got a doctor's certificate he could not resume his old occupation.  I told the medical officer of health what the position was.  I asked the man to let me know if he did not get his allowance back.  The man did not let me know and I took it for granted that his allowance was restored.</P>
    <P>Last Monday I happened to pass through the locality where that man lived.  I called in to find out how he was.  I was told by his wife that he had resumed work six weeks ago.  I asked if he had got back the allowance he was receiving up to last June.  She told me he did not.  I got in touch with the doctor who was responsible for cutting off this man's allowance.  I pointed out to him that this man was in receipt of 50/- from the National Health and had to make do on that, plus whatever he received in children's allowances, to provide for himself, his wife and six children.  I pointed out to the doctor that it was a real hardship to cut this man down to 50/- a week.  The reply I got from the doctor was: &ldquo;He is not the only person living on 50/- a week.&rdquo; That man had six of his ribs removed.  His previous employer gave him some job or another.</P>
    <P>Anybody with a sense of imagination can understand the condition of that man trying to go to work for eight hours a day.  There are now eight children in the family.  We have got to tackle the social problems.  We have got to ensure that people in reasonable health will get nourishing food and proper treatment.  Anybody can picture the condition of the children of the unfortunate man to whom I referred. Their resistance to T.B. must be very feeble while they are compelled to live-on the wretched income received by the unfortunate father.  Instead of receiving proper treatment and getting nourishment, this unfortunate man has to try and report for work at 8 <Col N="1247" /> a.m. and continue working until 5 p.m. for the six days of the week.  It is quite obvious what is going to happen him in a very short time.</P>
    <P>I think it unfair to annoy the Minister with repeating what has already been said, but I am more or less compelled to refer to the question of nurses.  I have a good deal of knowledge of hospital life having been on public boards and two hospital boards for a number of years and I must say that the nurses are not treated as they should be.  I know the Minister has no control over nurses in the voluntary hospitals.  I must repudiate, however, any suggestion that the voluntary hospitals are responsible for any discrimination between the poor patient who is unable to pay and the patient who can afford payment.  As well as having been on the boards of management of a number of these hospitals I have had to spend a while in hospital myself.  I must confess that I have never yet received a complaint that there was any different treatment for a patient who was unable to pay and a patient who was.</P>
    <P>In regard to the working hours of the nurses, the least they are entitled to is a 48-hour week.  I understand that the 48-hour week operates in all the hospitals for which the Minister is responsible. Is not that so?</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will make an Order requiring nurses to work not longer than a 48-hour week or 96 hours per fortnight.  A great number of nurses are working unreasonable hours.  Time off is most unsatisfactory. As time goes on we may not have as high a standard amongst our nurses if we do not give them treatment similar to that which they enjoy in hospitals across the water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the building of hospitals, I was a member of this House in 1938 and 1943.  During that period I suggested to the then Minister that we should appoint our own architect and engineers to plan and operate everything pertaining to our hospitals.  I was on a public board in the years 1934, <Col N="1248" /> 1935, 1936 and 1937 when the question of a regional hospital for Cork was under discussion.  I think it was in 1936 that we got word from the Department that we would get £300,000 for building the hospital.  The architects had to produce plans and specifications for a £300,000 hospital.  After a long delay they presented plans for a hospital at an estimated cost of £452,000.</P>
    <P>Now, 14 years after, there is not as much as a sod turned in the plot of ground that was selected as the site for that regional hospital.  Last year we were told that if the hospital were to be built now it would cost well over £1,000,000.  Due to the delays of architects and engineers, I think it is a scandalous state of affairs that people have had to wait all those years for a hospital, particularly when we remember that at the period I speak of a first-class hospital could have been built for less than £500,000.  If built now it is going to cost well over £1,000,000. Is it any wonder, therefore, that we should have a good deal of criticism to offer in regard to architects and engineers and in regard to the Department itself which must be held responsible for subjecting itself to those gentlemen who have been dictating policy during the last 15 or 16 years?</P>
    <P>Then we have talk about the maternity hospital for Cork.  A site for the hospital was selected and an engineer was appointed to prepare plans.  After some years, an official came down from the Department and condemned the site.  The engineer was paid £1,300 in fees for the plans he prepared.  Another site was selected later and another engineer was called in.  The position is that we have neither a maternity hospital nor a regional hospital in Cork.  Anyone can easily imagine what all these delays have cost.  If the first proposals to provide these hospitals had been vigorously pursued at the time they could have been built at less than half what it would cost to build them now.</P>
    <P>We have, too, the position created by the investment of the Hospitals' Trust Funds outside the country and the loss of thousands of pounds on those investments. Is it any wonder that there is <Col N="1249" /> a good deal of criticism in view of the loss of that money as well as the losses in the way of fees to architects and engineers with nothing to show for it at all?  I think that the experts who deal with our money are deserving of a good deal of criticism.</P>
    <P>The present position is that patients in the remotest parts of the County Cork, and from all over Munster, if they require special treatment have to be sent to Dublin.  If we had our hospitals in Cork they could get treatment there. One may well ask, when are we going to get anything effectively done in this matter?  The Minister is well aware of the sums that have been paid in the way of fees to engineers and architects for the planning of hospitals for Cork City, and yet, after all those years, not as much as one sod has been turned on the sites for them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the aged in the county homes, I want to suggest to the Minister that it would be desirable if we could have some place for these old people such as the Nazareth Home which is within Cork City boundary, at Montenotte.  There aged people are cared for by the good Sisters in charge. Their conditions and surroundings are ideal.  I think that rather than have those old people kept in the county homes it would be advisable to have them put into institutions such as those run by the Sisters at Montenotte. I think that the aged people, male and female, in those homes are very happy in so far as they are well cared for, and have every facility to enjoy themselves during the remaining years of their lives.  I suggest to the Minister that he should not be penurious in this matter, and should be prepared to purchase some of the bigger mansions which are available in different parts of the country and which would be suitable for conversion into homes for those aged people.</P>
    <P>I think that much more attention should be paid to people in the lower income groups and to growing children. I believe that, when a parent, say, recovers from T.B., the allowance which had been paid to the family during his illness should not be cut off, no matter what report may come from the doctor.  Sufficient income should be <Col N="1250" /> available to make suitable provision for the man's children.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde, I think, gave a very fair picture of the need there is for the care of those children of T.B. patients. I think the very best argument, in justification of what I say, was the case which I quoted earlier for the Minister.  If these matters do come before the Minister, I hope he will give them serious attention.  When a report comes from a doctor to the effect that a man who had been suffering from T.B. is quiescent the family allowance is cut off.  I think that is a shocking thing.  I have pointed out the injustice of that to medical people. It means that a man, in his state of health, and his family are left with 50/- a week on which to support themselves. I am of opinion that people with a mentality of that kind should not be in charge of our health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points that I want to mention on this Estimate.  The first is the vast difference there is between the sum of money expended on the prevention of disease and that expended on the cure of disease.  The Minister will be able to find out what the difference is.  I am sure, if he goes into the matter, he will find that, as regards the sum of money expended by the Department of Health every year, the percentage expended on the cure of disease and on the after-treatment of patients must be very much greater than the percentage expended on the prevention of disease.  That is a situation which should not be allowed to continue. Greater sums of money should be allocated for the prevention of disease. The Department should not devote all its attention and its main financial resources to the cure of disease.  It is necessary, of course, to spend money on the cure of disease, but it is even more necessary to allocate moneys for the prevention of disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that we make our young people health conscious.  That should be done in the national and secondary schools where they should be made realise the importance of good health. Not enough is being done.  I think, in that direction.  If what I suggest is done we will have in a number of years <Col N="1251" /> a generation of people who will be able to appreciate good health and will be able to take steps to maintain their good health.  If, for example, our people do not realise the importance of good food, that is a serious matter. In working-class homes throughout the country, I have seen fairly expensive food of a certain kind purchased for consumption while cheaper food of better value and quality was not purchased.</P>
    <P>Take porridge, for example.  You will find in some working-class families that children are not given porridge, even though it is an excellent food. Yet they are given other foods which have not the same nutritional value.  I think it is necessary to educate our people on the value of food from the health point of view&mdash;food that will keep the body in a healthy state compared to other foods that are not so good.  That, I suggest, is a work which can be most effectively done in the national and secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Children, and even grown-up people, should be educated on the value of fresh air and of exercise, on the use of vegetables and on the importance of rest.  If we had a population which realised the importance of these things and the contribution which they make to good health, then I think we would have less illness than we have.  I think the Department would be well advised to start a campaign among our young people in the schools and point out to them the importance of these things.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is of more or less local interest.  We have in the peninsula of Inishowen a very large population.  Patients in that area who wish to go for hospital treatment or X-ray have to pass through the City of Derry on their way to the town of Letterkenny.  For patients travelling from Inishowen, Carndonagh, Moville, Buncrana, it involves a two-day journey.  In the City of Derry there is a very fine hospital service.  Good X-ray facilities, excellent extern and intern hospital treatment are available. It is a very good service.  The Minister should consider making some arrangement with the Six-Counties hospital <Col N="1252" /> authorities whereby X-ray facilities and extern and intern hospital treatment would be provided by the Six-Counties hospital authorities for people in the Inishowen peninsula and the border district surrounding the City of Derry.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that if an approach were made an agreement could be reached which would be of immense advantage to those people for whom hospital treatment involves long journeys and in some cases a journey of two days owing to the faulty bus service and to the fact that the bus service passes through the City of Derry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister on introducing this Estimate.  It is an extremely fine Estimate.  It shows that the Minister and his Department have a very extensive hospital building programme in hand, that they are bringing in very rapidly an extension of existing health services and, above all, that the Minister is already planning to follow up the present short-term hospital programme with another hospital programme.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his capacity as Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare must be the grand spender of the present Government because between health and social welfare, he is probably responsible for spending over one-third of the current Estimates.  Very probably the Minister for Finance is watching him out of the corner of his eye wondering how much more he is going to get away with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early part of his speech the Minister dealt with the mortality rates. These mortality rates are something which the public should take note of very carefully because they are the <Col N="1253" /> measure of progress in so far as health services and the health of the public are concerned.  The figures show a tremendous improvement in regard to tuberculosis.  They show a slight improvement in regard to infant mortality but, regrettably, of course, the figures still remain very high.  They show the mortality rate from cancer to be extremely high at present.</P>
    <P>When we have begun to tackle the question of infant mortality, cancer will be our big health problem in this country.  Already, we have a new cancer hospital established in Dublin and there are one or two other centres throughout the country but very shortly we will realise how inadequate existing facilities are for the treatment of cancer.</P>
    <P>Cancer, like tuberculosis, and even more so, rests at the moment entirely on early diagnosis and treatment.  We can make immediate progress with the facilities that are at our disposal at present, if we can get people to come early for treatment.  We cannot get people to come early for treatment unless we have up-to-date clinics and hospitals available for diagnosis and treatment of cancer and unless the people are aware of the necessity of coming early for treatment.</P>
    <P>In connection with the hospital building programme there is one point I would like to draw the Minister's attention to: that is, the question of our hospital standards, the question of the sizes of wards, the sizes of rooms in hospitals, in nurses' homes, the construction of hospitals, and all these factors in relation to costs.</P>
    <P>I believe that some of the hospitals we are building at the moment are unnecessarily luxurious in some of their standards.  I do not want to be misunderstood when I say this but I maintain that we can have first-class health services and provide first-class facilities in adequate but modest conditions and, from our own point of view, in this country, it would be very much better if we succeeded in building two hospital beds for every £5,000 instead of providing one very luxurious bed for the same figure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1254" /> This is a problem something like our housing problem.  We are using, as far as hospital construction is concerned, building standards that were made many years ago, that were made at a time when building costs were a mere fraction of what they are now.  Great advances in design and structure have come about since that time and I personally believe that we could provide hospital facilities as good as they have in progressive countries, like the Scandinavian countries, at a lower cost than we are building them at the moment.  It is a very important thing. We will be spending here £20,000,000, £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 more over the years to come.  Now is the time to look into this question of our standards and our hospital bed costs.</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been put up here&mdash;I think it was first brought forward by Deputy Declan Costello who, as usual, made a very able speech&mdash;that we cannot proceed with health services because the existing facilities are totally inadequate.  I believe that to be absolutely fallacious and I offer the House the question of the tuberculosis service.</P>
    <P>In 1948 we had waiting lists of a thousand and more.  In fact, the facilities were so unsatisfactory that we did not really know how many people needed treatment.  At that time Deputy Dr. Browne, when he was Minister for Health, went ahead.  While he was building hospitals and getting the hospital programme speeded up, he went ahead to provide a comprehensive, free for all service, for everybody. This was done on the most unsuitable foundations.  The facilities were totally inadequate and the facilities were provided and the service was built up at the same time.  To my mind that is a straightforward and direct answer to this point that is being made that we cannot go ahead with health services until we have all the buildings and facilities.  It is really arguing that the effects of legislation should be there before the legislation is brought in.</P>
    <P>It is pointed out how bad the dispensaries are.  I know how bad the dispensaries are and, as a member of the Dublin Board of Assistance, I never go to a meeting that I do not ask what <Col N="1255" /> the progress is in regard to the building of new dispensaries and the improvement of existing ones.  I am particularly ashamed of the fact that there are dispensaries in Dublin where there is not even running water, where there are extremely bad conditions.</P>
    <P>The delay in improving the dispensaries arises largely from the delay in implementing the health services.  Over many years local authorities have not been able to make up their minds as to what they should do about the dispensaries because they did not know whether dispensaries were going to be retained or not.  It looked for some time as if the dispensaries were going to be done away with altogether and it was only when the Minister for Health, about 18 months ago, made grants available for the improvement of dispensaries that local authorities realised that dispensaries were going to play a permanent part in the health services envisaged by local government. My attitude towards this is that the quicker we enact legislation the sooner we can improve the existing facilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Declan Costello accused the Minister for Health of shadow-boxing with the Medical Association.  I think it is the Deputy himself who is shadow-boxing, as he was pointing out the defects in our facilities at the moment and yet he was suggesting that the proposed health services should be put back.  What I would like to know from the Fine Gael Party is what their attitude is towards health services. What sort do they want?  This health legislation has been the subject of discussion here for about seven years and motions to refer Health Estimates back cannot be regarded now as really sincere. We require health services&mdash; everyone agrees on that&mdash;so let every Party or Deputy who wants to put back whatever services are offered, come forward and give his views on the subject.</P>
    <P>It is a very great disadvantage at the moment to newly-qualified doctors here in Ireland that there are really no extensive post-graduate facilities.  If any doctor qualifies from any of our <Col N="1256" /> universities and if he wishes to specialise in a subject, in 75 per cent. of the cases it is impossible for him to do that specialisation here in Ireland: he must always go somewhere else.  It is a great pity we have no post-graduate college or proper post-graduate training facilities.  That is a very great defect in our medical services.  I would like to know from the Minister what the position is about the proposed post-graduate school at St. Kevin's.  Apart from the fact that it would be an advantage to our medical men to have a post-graduate school at St. Kevin's, it would be a great advantage to the very rapid development of St. Kevin's which is taking place at present.  Until we get St. Kevin's recognised as a proper training school, we will not be able to pursue the advancement of St. Kevin's as rapidly as we would like.</P>
    <P>As a member of the corporation, I am on the board of two of the voluntary hospitals here in Dublin.  The present impression I get about the voluntary hospitals is that they represent a system which has done very fine work in the past.  It was a system that worked when you had people who were very rich and people who were very poor and when the cost of medicine and surgery was very different from what it is to-day.  I think the voluntary hospitals to-day are greatly in need of improvement and will require a great deal of money spent on them. Many of the specialised facilities at the voluntary hospitals are very inadequate. Most of them will require new X-ray equipment and very extensive equipment in their pathological laboratories and in many of the other ancillary specialities.</P>
    <P>One of the worst aspects of voluntary hospitals at the moment is the unsatisfactory nurses' accommodation. Many of the Dublin hospitals have appalling nurses' living conditions. Quite a few of them have nurses' homes and the position has been improved, but there are still several Dublin voluntary hospitals where the living conditions of nurses are beyond description; they are absolutely appalling. From what I see, I would not think that there is a great deal of waste expenditure in the voluntary hospitals. <Col N="1257" /> If anything the bed costs are rather lower than they should be, compatible with the first class service which they will have to present in years to come. I think the cost of keeping a patient in the voluntary hospitals per week is probably considerably less than it is in some of the sanatoria that have been built recently.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Estimate and I think the Minister has outlined splendid progress. I hope that we will see the necessary legislation implemented soon, so that we can get down to work and tackle the question of dispensaries and of improvements in the many aspects of our health services which so urgently are in need of attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll mentions that he would like to see legislation brought in for the health services.  He also mentions that dispensaries are in a deplorable condition and new legislation would help.  Do we require new legislation to improve the present health services?  Are there not ample facilities available now and is there not ample room for improvement without any Bill?</P>
      <P>As a local representative, a county councillor, he should know what can be done and what improvement can be brought about without any more legislation. He mentions dispensaries, but I do not think there is any necessity for legislation to deal with them at present.</P>
      <P>There is another point: are there facilities in our hospitals?  We have a modern hospital in Kilkenny but at present it is overcrowded.  People who are brought in after an accident are shifted out, even before their time, to make room for someone else.  If we are going to provide here for increasing the number going into that hospital, where will these people go?  Our county hospital is a very modern one and very good in every way, with wonderful doctors and wonderful nurses and services of every kind.  I have had experience of it myself and can vouch that it is a very good service, but if we increase the number and extent of facilities, where do we stand then? What we need first is to provide accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1258" /> Even in the lesser things, without any legislation something can be done. There have been complaints in our county about doctors not residing in their areas.  Without any legislation the Minister could make a rule or regulation that no doctor could be appointed to any dispensary district, who is not going to reside there and the Appointments Commissioners should not appoint any doctor who will not reside in his district.  In one particular case in Kilkenny the doctor resides in a city outside the county and is doing his dispensary work 20 miles away from that city, apparently with very serious results for some people during the past few years.</P>
    <P>The case is made that the county council have not provided a residence &mdash;which is quite right&mdash;yet I think it is the duty of the Appointments Commissioners to require that the man they appoint should reside in the dispensary district.  If there is not a proper residence there he should not take up the dispensary position.  It is a terrible thing that this man should be residing 20 miles away from the village in which the dispensary is.  If people want that man at night they have to telephone and maybe wait a long time for him.</P>
    <P>Another small but very important point is the necessity to have telephones in the houses of dispensary doctors.  Even at the present time, in 1953, several doctors' houses and dispensaries in the country have no telephone facilities.  People now can go to the Garda barracks or other places where there may be a telephone, but in some cases they cannot even do that.  That is a small matter but if it were attended to it would help out the services.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear quite a number of Deputies advocating the improvement of our county homes because that is a very important matter.  We have in Kilkenny a very modern hospital but when a person has been there for some weeks and shows no possible sign of improvement he is removed to the county home.  Even working-class people resent having any of their relations removed to the county home in <Col N="1259" /> present circumstances.  The county council have done quite a lot in recent times in the way of improving the county home, but what is wanted is an improvement of the status of these institutions.  They should be made a kind of auxiliary hospitals.</P>
    <P>One suggestion I would make is that a resident surgeon should be appointed for each county home.  At present in most county homes it is the local dispensary doctor who attends.  I have no doubt that he does his duty well, but it would raise the status of the county homes if there were a resident surgeon whom the friends of patients could consult to see how the patients are doing.</P>
    <P>At present even working-class people who can ill-afford it are sending their relations to private homes, and I am sure paying a very high sum for their maintenance, in preference to having them sent to county homes.  I think the Minister should make an Order providing for the appointment of a resident surgeon in each county home. The majority of the people in these homes may be chronic cases, but there may be other people in them who are not chronic cases but who would take some time to regain their health.</P>
    <P>We talk about improving the health services, but last Monday night I was present at a meeting of the Kilkenny Corporation when a letter was read from the Minister telling us that the free fuel scheme for old age pensioners was being suspended from March to October.  That will not be helpful to the health of these old people who may be living in flats or rooms.  If these people wish to keep out of the county home they should, at least, be helped out with free fuel.  Possibly that does not come under this Estimate, but the Minister is in charge of both Departments and I think it should be brought to his notice.  When we are spending so much on health schemes, it is a disgrace that we should not give old age pensioners, blind pensioners and those in receipt of widows' pensions the free fuel which they received every year up to this.</P>
    <P>There is only one other matter which <Col N="1260" /> I wish to raise.  When Deputy Dr. Browne was Minister for Health and was doing quite a lot for the treatment of tubercular persons he came to Kilkenny and asked the corporation to allow the fever hospital to be used for the treatment of tubercular patients for the time being.  The corporation at that time were very perturbed about handing over that hospital.  Although there had not been many fever patients for some years, they felt that the fever hospital should be available for such cases in case of an emergency.  But, in deference to the case which Deputy Dr. Browne put up about tubercular people being left in their homes and spreading this unfortunate disease because of the want of hospital accommodation for them, the corporation agreed to the proposal.  Deputy Dr. Browne assured us at that time that the hospital would be given back in two years.  Four years have now passed and we are not any nearer getting that hospital back for the treatment of fever cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>We have always been independent in Kilkenny and we do not co-operate with anyone.  We have to send fever patients to New Ross, Abbeyleix and Waterford.  We always had our own fever hospital however, and we never had to join with any other county.  The result of handing over that hospital is that we have had quite a number of fever cases in Kilkenny for the last 12 months and there is no sign of any abatement.  I believe that that is due to the fact that parents know that when their children are found to be suffering from fever they will be sent to these other hospitals.  No doubt these children get very good treatment in these other hospitals, but that is not the point.  I would not like to see any child of mine sent to a hospital 20 miles away.  I have had children under treatment in the fever hospital and I was very glad to be able to go <Col N="1261" /> up there and inquire about their progress. People resent having their children sent 20 miles away to a hospital and the result is that when their children are suffering from fever they keep them at home and do not disclose it in case they would be sent away.  The Minister therefore should expedite the building of the proposed sanatorium so that our fever hospital can be restored to us.  If that is done, I have no doubt that the fever which has been so prevalent during the last 12 months will be abated.</P>
      <P>I suggest that a lot could be done in the way of providing good health services without bringing in legislation if we only build on the services we have and improve them.  We should not be rushing into new health services for which we have not the facilities at present.  Let us provide the facilities first and then we can have the services.</P>

      <P>While I believe that there is room for legislation to provide new health services in order to improve the general health of the people, I agree that if the legislation now in operation were fully exploited it would go a considerable way towards the improvement of the health of the people and the prevention of different diseases.  Deputy Cogan raised the question as to who should pay for these health services. He is one of many Deputies who believe that if the ratepayers do not have to pay any increased contribution for health services everything is all right. But, if we are to have good health services and fully exploit the legislation at present on the Statute Book, it means that either the ratepayers or the taxpayers will have to pay for them.</P>

    <P>I am in favour of the ratepayer paying but from what I have seen in my short political life I think there is ample evidence of reluctance on the part of the local public representatives here to face up to their responsibilities in relation to health, the provision of houses, water supplies, sewerage and so on.  There is a good deal of truth in the assertion that if our present health legislation were fully exploited we would not be here to-day discussing over a protracted period the best way <Col N="1262" /> in which to improve the health of our people.</P>
    <P>The fundamental drawback to health in so far as the inhabitants of our cities, towns and villages is concerned is the inadequacy of the wages paid to our workers.  Deputy Cunningham spoke very properly of the type of food that our people eat, the different social habits they have and the different social conditions under which they live.  He said that more emphasis should be laid on the prevention of disease as against the attention we now have to pay to the curing of disease.  I think the House will readily agree that a man in receipt of £3 15s. per week, or £3 17 6d., or £4, in a rural area, with a wife and four or five children to maintain, is not in a position to give the minimum requirements in so far as food is concerned to his family.  I think the Minister should seriously consider a campaign to induce people to eat the right food and to cook that food properly.  I believe that if the frying pan was abolished the health of our people would improve to some degree.</P>
    <P>Are we as concerned as we ought to be about the cinemas, the billiard saloons and the dance halls?  It is pathetic to see the long queues waiting for admission to the cinemas in the City of Dublin on fine summer afternoons during the months of June, July, August and September.  I have not quite the same objection to the same queues in the winter months but it is appalling to see young boys and girls waiting in queues on summer afternoons, knowing that they will subsequently spend two and a half to three hours sitting in a stuffy cinema when they should be out-of-doors taking advantage of the fine weather.  I am not suggesting that the Minister should by law or regulation prevent them from attending cinemas but there is a responsibility on him and on all of us here to try to instil into the minds of these young people and their parents the danger in which they are placing themselves.  These young people are literally committing suicide from the point of view of their health.  I think most of the tuberculosis here, quite apart from the vagaries of our climate, <Col N="1263" /> is attributable to the dance halls, the cinemas and the billiard saloons.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also try, with the help of the school authorities throughout the country, to introduce physical culture into the school curriculum. It is not by any means peculiar to our young people at the present time.</P>
    <P>I do not know a great deal about the voluntary hospitals but on three occasions within the last 12 months I was a patient in one of these hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in a public ward, in a semi-private ward and in a private ward.  I can honestly say that as far as those three sections of the hospital were concerned I could see no difference in the treatment or the attention given to the patient.  I do not say that in regard to myself only.  It is equally true of the other patients who were in the public ward and in the semi-private ward with me.</P>
      <P>While I have a certain criticism to make of these voluntary hospitals my remarks are not to be taken as a condemnation of our hospitals, because anybody who has been a patient in them or has had anything to do with them can have nothing but admiration for the people who run them and nothing but admiration especially for those religious orders who take such pains to run their institutions and keep them going properly and who take such pains with their patients, be they private or public, be it Mr. Murphy or Murphy, Mr. O'Brien or O'Brien.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there should be some consideration given in connection with the holding of clinics on patients in public wards.  I do not think that practice is entirely objectionable but there are patients who resent being treated as guinea pigs, so to speak.  There are other patients who would be only too glad to volunteer as guinea pigs.  A particular friend of mine on one occasion, because of his temperament and because of his modesty and self-consciousness, was very much affected <Col N="1264" /> in having a group of nine or ten students gather round him whilst an operation was being performed on him. I do not know whether patients in private wards are subjected to that practice.  I am sure some of the patients in the private wards, if they were asked, would have no objection to having clinics held on them.  I do not think it is fair to hold a clinic on any and every patient in a public ward without at least asking the patient's permission.</P>
    <P>The greatest drawback in so far as the voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin are concerned is not so much their condition as their location.  Many of these buildings were never intended to be hospitals.  They have been converted into hospitals and, apart from the fact that they are clean and the beds are comfortable, in a lot of cases the wards are like disused barrack rooms.  Many of the voluntary hospitals are not, in my opinion, conducive to any improvement in the health of a patient.  A patient walking into some of them for the first time would almost be tempted to take his coat and bag and run back home as quickly as he could, because by no stretch of imagination could he convince himself there would be any improvement in his health in such surroundings.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a plea now on behalf of our nurses.  They are overworked and they have very long hours. They are diligent and conscientious and they give a patient all the care and attention necessary irrespective of disease.  As far as I know nurses are required to do at least one month on night duty in rotation.  We must remember that these nurses are young girls ranging from 17 or 18 to 24 years of age.  They are at that vital stage of their life when they are very susceptible to contracting tuberculosis.  I attribute it to nothing but their night work.</P>
    <P>I know of at least three cases where nurses, after a year or two of training, contracted tuberculosis.  To say the least of it, their careers were ruined apart altogether from the fact that their health was ruined.  I cannot understand why it is necessary to make them do a month's night duty.  It is <Col N="1265" /> difficult to change over to sleeping all day, or portion of the day, and to working during the night and it is equally difficult, when the month is up, to revert to the ordinary habit of sleeping at night and working during the day.  I think that that matter should be examined with a view to shortening the period of time during which nurses have to do night work.</P>
    <P>I should also like to impress on the Minister the necessity for improving the conditions of domestic staffs whether in the voluntary hospitals or in the local authority hospitals.  It is a scandalous thing that these domestic staffs have to work 70 hours per week.  That is quite a long time.  All of us must agree that the work in the public and private wards for these domestic staffs can be very onerous indeed and that their time off is very short.  In most cases, they have a half-day every second Sunday.  I think that neither the Minister nor the local authority should tolerate the 70 hours per week.  Whilst it is not the Minister's function or responsibility, I think that there should be impressed on the local authority the necessity of providing decent quarters for the domestic staffs.  Of late there have been improvements in local authority hospitals but I think that the improvements ought to be speeded up and that these young women should be taken from the barrack-like rooms which are now described as &ldquo;dormitories&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Practically every Deputy who has spoken has mentioned the condition of the dispensaries.  I think the Minister himself has a bigger appreciation of the bad conditions of these dispensaries than most other people in the House.  I have seen some of these dispensaries.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that some of them are in a very bad condition&mdash;panes of glass knocked out, doors falling in, and so forth.  I should say that more colds and cases of pneumonia result from visits by patients to dispensaries than occur in ordinary circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is one very important aspect of the dispensary system which I would like the Minister to consider.  I refer to the attendance by the dispensary doctor at the dispensary&mdash;the <Col N="1266" /> actual time that he is supposed to attend there.  It is scandalous and cruel that people should have to wait for long periods of time outside a dispensary until the doctor comes to open it.  Many of us have seen bicycles lying against the ditch and donkeys and carts or horses and carts pulled up outside a dispensary which is not open and we have seen the same little group of people waiting there not for one or two hours but for four hours, five hours and even six hours until the dispensary doctor can come along.</P>
    <P>It may be unreasonable for any person in his normal health to have to wait outside an office, a place of amusement or some other place for a certain thing to happen or for somebody to come along but consider the plight of the unfortunate people&mdash;especially people from rural districts&mdash;who have to wait outside a dispensary for a period of anything from one to five hours.  That is a matter which the Minister, the Department and local authorities should examine immediately. I am sure that the Minister and every Deputy in this House knows that that has occurred and is still occurring in the case of many dispensaries throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Another matter with regard to dispensary treatment is that of the prescriptions which are made out by dispensary doctors.  If my information is correct, the doctor examines the patient, makes his diagnosis and writes out a prescription.  The unfortunate person goes to the local chemist and then discovers that it is absolutely impossible for him to avail of the prescribed treatment because he has not the money to pay for the medicine.  I am aware, of course, that there is a local authority compounder, but scores of people have come to me with the complaint that they cannot afford the prescription.  In some cases the cost of compounding these prescriptions would come to anything from 10/- to 15/- per week.  To people on home assistance or people in receipt of small incomes the expenditure of such a sum of money would be absolutely impossible.</P>

      <P>The Minister and the Department have received the congratulations of almost every member of this House in relation to mass radiography and the B.C.G. scheme.  In the past year there has been evidence that the people have been availing of these two services more freely than previously.  They were inclined to be shy about them at first but, as a result of example, it seems that these services are being availed of more freely and the good results will be seen maybe not next year or the year after that but in a few short years.</P>
      <P>We have heard many criticisms and comments on the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Allowance.  I cannot understand the cutting off of this allowance from a person on the grounds that the disease is inactive and that he or she is fit to work unless, in fact, the person is deemed to be fit at the employment exchange.  I had a few cases in my constituency of unfortunate people who had this dreadful disease and who, as a consequence, had become slightly deformed.  Whilst the disease was pronounced active in their systems they received the allowance. Then, suddenly, some surgeon or some medical man from the Department comes down from Dublin, examines the patient and announces that the disease is inactive and that the patient can now take up work.  The patient presents himself at the labour exchange and the labour exchange say that the patient is not fit to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unfortunate patient then finds himself between the devil and the deep blue sea.  The medical authority says that he is fit to take up work and the employment exchange say that he is not.  Because he has been pronounced fit by the medical authority he is no longer able to receive the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Allowance or unemployment assistance.  He must therefore, have recourse to the local authority for home assistance, which <Col N="1268" /> as many of us know, is at a very low standard in most county councils in Ireland.  I hope the Minister will take immediate action in regard to those people who have contracted tuberculosis as a bone disease so that the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Allowance will not be cut off until such time as the recipient can find employment or at least until such time as the patient is declared capable of working by the Department of Social Welfare and is accepted on the register at the employment exchange.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to read to the House an extract which appeared in a daily paper on the 24th of this month which relates to the experience of a lady who came in contact with the expanded health services provided in Great Britain:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Three years ago a woman in Manchester packed her bags ready to be taken to hospital, where a specialist told her that she would have to undergo an operation as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>May I say at this stage that in this story there are two morals.</P>
      <P>The woman, Miss Gladys Dearden, aged 41, has just received a top priority telegram from St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester, informing her she can now be admitted.  Miss Dearden told a Press Association reporter yesterday: &lsquo;I was so disgusted after waiting so long that I threw the telegram on the fire.  I am quite healthy now.&rsquo;  Mr. A.R. Wise, superintendent at the hospital, said that it was an extreme case.  &lsquo;We have the heaviest gynaecology waiting list in Britain and the patients are treated in order of medical priority.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to submit to the House that in that confirmed story there are two morals.  One is that when you let the doctors loose, no man is safe.  Miss Dearden was going about her lawful occasions when she was fallen upon by a public health gynaecologist, who told her to rush home, pack her bags and dash into hospital for an urgent operation.  Miss Dearden, full of panic, dashed home, packed her bags and sat down for three and a half <Col N="1269" /> years, as a result of which she is as lively as a cricket.  If she had gone into hospital the poor woman would probably be going around in a bath chair now or else staggering about the grounds of a convalescent hospital with everyone admiring this feeble wreck who had emerged from this frightful operation which she had to undergo three and a half years ago and from the consequences of which she was carefully dragging herself back to health.  In fact, Miss Dearden never had the operation, is as gay as a cricket and never lay down for a day.</P>
    <P>When I hear all my medical friends in this House getting up one after another exhorting the Minister for Health to coddle us still more closely, to X-ray us, to inject us, to examine us, to examine our children and our children's children, to open institutions and to get everybody to harry the whole population at immense expense, I begin to wonder how many Miss Deardens we are going to have in our community.</P>
    <P>The second moral to be drawn from this story is that with the best intentions in the world the British Government introduced and carried through the British House of Commons a comprehensive, free-for-all health scheme in Great Britain.  It was pointed out then in Great Britain that they were aspiring to do great things but that it seemed to a great many level-headed people they had not got the resources to give effect to their pious purpose.  What has happened? Everybody now has free access at the drop of a hat to this public health hospital, St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester. The result is that a patient who was diagnosed by one of the surgeons of the hospital as being in need of an operation as quickly as possible secured access to the operating theatre three-and-a-half years after that diagnosis was made.  It so happened that Miss Dearden triumphantly survived and at the end of three-and-a-half years did not need to go to hospital and was very glad she never went to hospital.  But the next patient to Miss Dearden may have, indeed, depended for her survival as a healthy woman on urgent and immediate access to a hospital.  If she <Col N="1270" /> had Miss Dearden's experience, her health is probably irremediably crippled because there was no hospital into which she could get.</P>
    <P>I want to warn this House that we are cheerfully proclaiming our intention of levying taxes and raising the rates by a further 2/- in the £ for the pious purpose of making a whole lot of new services available to all.  We ought to be mighty careful that we do not create in this country a position in which those who genuinely and urgently require treatment are put on a waiting list for three-and-a-half years because the resources of which we dispose are not sufficient to accommodate the army of people whom we are going to invite to avail of them.</P>
    <P>I notice, and I notice with disgust, that when it came to considering the question of providing the mother and child scheme under the Health Bill for everybody, free-for-all or whether a means test should be imposed, Fianna Fáil has adopted what is to me the disgusting expedient of making it free for two-thirds of the population and providing in respect of the remaining third that on the payment of one pound per annum they shall have access to these benefits.  What is the purpose of that one pound?  I want to ask the Minister again, is this the Fianna Fáil formula for external relations with Catholic morality?  Is this the Fianna Fáil method of purchasing orthodoxy with 20 pieces of silver?  I can understand the mentality of a person who says that a means test is a socially desirable thing.  I can understand the mentality of a man who says that in a mother and child scheme of this character no means test should be imposed&mdash;and I subscribe to the latter view&mdash;but I am wholly unable to understand the creepy crawly mentality of people who have not got the moral courage to say &ldquo;Yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nay&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I was discussing, Sir, the provision of £600,000 under sub-head H. (page 392 of the Book of Estimates) <Col N="1271" /> which is appropriated to the extension of health services &ldquo;not provided for in the foregoing estimates.&rdquo; I think that relates to this despicable provision, to those who blow neither hot nor cold and have qualified to be spewed out of the mouth.</P>
      <P>I want also to advert to the provision of £4,500,000 under sub-head K.  That item is put in for the purpose of inflating the Estimate.  I think it is a very improper item to include in a Supply Services Estimate without an appropriate note attached thereto.  I take it that this money will be advanced to the Hospitals' Fund in order to keep the building programme in progress while the money pours into that fund from the source whence it would normally come.  I do not suppose the Minister proposes that the £4,500,000 should be spent in the course of this financial year on building hospitals. I assume that part of it will be devoted to the payment of the current deficit of the voluntary hospitals and so much as is proper to keep upon the Supply Services of this year.  In regard to the balance, there should be some intelligent programming of what the future will probably reveal and having estimated the proportion of the capital cost of hospital building to be met from the current income of the Hospitals' Trust Fund, a suitable sum should be provided and a programme drawn up.  I understand it is the Government's intention to do that, but I think it was a dishonest and disreputable thing to produce this Book of Estimates with £100,500,000 on the cover, to warn us all that the nation would be staggered by the Estimates for the health services without having the honesty to tell us that so far as two-fifths of the total Estimate was concerned, no charge should properly be made on the Budget in any one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to a specific problem which I raised by way of question with the Minister for Health and to which I think he might with advantage turn his mind.  Very splendid progress was made during the last four or five years in rehabilitating the premises and equipment of St. Kevin's Hospital in this city.  I do not suppose any of us was easy in his mind about the state <Col N="1272" /> of affairs that obtained in that institution five or six years ago.  I think it is something upon which we can all congratulate ourselves that much of what was wrong there, structurally and so far as personnel was concerned, has been put to rights.  Though I have not recently visited the institution myself, I believe it is now in many respects a most modern hospital.  I am told by those best qualified to judge that several administrative reforms to which everybody in the hospital is desirous of giving effect, are made impossible as a result of surviving archaic regulations which are a residue from legislation going back to the early part of the 19th century and which no one has taken the occasion to examine, to coordinate and to bring up-to-date.  That is a very understandable situation because you have, I suppose, about 40 statutes applying to the administration of St. Kevin's Hospital.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has not power under one of the most recent Health Acts to remove all these impediments by appropriate Orders.  I think he has.  I quite agree that it is not a thing that one can do piecemeal or without careful inquiry and examination but I do suggest that it would be a prudent and reasonable thing for him to set up a Departmental Committee to examine the rules and regulations controlling the administration of St. Kevin's Hospital and to submit recommendations for their modernisation and codification, with a view to any reforms that may appear desirable.  I am satisfied if he does that, he will be able without any very revolutionary changes, to achieve some very valuable reforms in an institution, the personnel of which is anxious to undertake these reforms themselves.</P>
    <P>I think we all listened with disgust to Deputy Dr. Browne when he was talking about the voluntary hospitals. It is very easy to make offensive remarks about institutions like the voluntary hospitals.  I think perhaps the basest thing he said was to suggest that in the wards of the voluntary hospitals of Dublin, there were pauper beds side by side with beds for the well-to-do, and to imply that the treatment accorded to the patients <Col N="1273" /> differed according to which variety of bed they occupied.  I wonder does he believe that?  I wonder does he believe that any doctor or consultant going on his rounds in the morning neglects the occupants of what Deputy Dr. Browne called the pauper beds and attends to the occupants of the other beds?</P>
    <P>I wonder does Deputy Dr. Browne believe that the nurses in the hospital wards are contemptuous and careless of the patients in the pauper beds of which he speaks and solicitous and careful for the patients who occupy the other beds?  I wonder does Deputy Dr. Browne seriously believe that the Sister of Mercy, that the Sisters of Charity, the Blue Sisters and the others, who run the voluntary hospitals in this city, distinguish between the occupants of the pauper beds to which he refers and others?  I think the slander is so vile that it is very hard to reject it in moderate language. It is a great pity that Deputy Dr. Browne who had the gift, at least, of zeal, has allowed himself to become a victim of the habit of using language and committing himself to allegations which on mature reflection he would long to withdraw.</P>
    <P>I remember a document circulating in this city once which contained very angry and very outrageous allegations. It was an anonymous document.  It was never officially discovered who was responsible for the document.  It was a document that was repudiated.  I would suggest to Deputy Browne that, when he is next tempted to speak of pauper beds in voluntary hospitals, he ought to think of that document and ask himself who wrote it, who circulated it and who subsequently repudiated it. If he searches his heart and recalls that, even in public life, men are not entitled to expect licence to commit one mistake of that kind, he will place a more restraining bridle on a clacking tongue.</P>
    <P>I gladly associate myself with Deputies on all sides who have spoken the truth as they saw it in regard to the voluntary hospitals.  I think Deputy McCann, in his intervention to-day, made a valuable contribution on that particular question.  He spoke <Col N="1274" /> as somebody who did his share unostentatiously in helping with the voluntary hospital movement in this city, and he paid them no extravagant tribute but spoke frankly of the things he knew of his personal knowledge. The record seemed to be good and to all of us who have contact with voluntary hospitals I think what Deputy McCann had to tell this House was redolent of the truth, whereas the slanders for which Deputy Browne made himself responsible were redolent of a clacking tongue.</P>
    <P>I hear a lot of people now talking about reform of county homes.  I remember when I was contesting the 1943 General Election I issued an election address in County Monaghan, and one of the objectives I declared myself married to was the abolition of the county home.  I want to emphasise &ldquo;the abolition of the county home&rdquo;. It is not the buildings that matter so much; it is not the surroundings that matter so much; it is not the amenities available in these institutions that matter so much.  What, to my mind, is cruel beyond words of telling is the removal of old people from contact with their neighbours.  I do not care how shiny you make the county home; I do not care how elaborate you make the menu there, or the amenities provided there.  None of these things is a substitute for the sight of a neighbour's face and for access to what we in the country call our friends.</P>
    <P>When old people are moved 30 to 35 miles away from the parish where they live to a central institution in the county town they are cut off forevermore from everything that means life to them.  It is not easy to travel to see them and very often when they are old and poor there are very few people left who want to make the journey, and of them a very small minority are physically able to travel so far. Therefore I want to abolish the county home altogether and I want to see established in Ireland the parish home.</P>
    <P>I do not think we want one for every parish, but you could take a group of three parishes and establish a very much less elaborate institution, to which old people, no longer able to look after themselves, could repair, in <Col N="1275" /> the knowledge that, on the market day, they could go into town and meet the neighbours, or if on a summer evening they wanted to walk abroad, they could call at a neighbour's house or a neighbour could call on them and they could share a cup of tea, a smoke of the pipe or whatever else was going and feel that they were amongst their own.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that at least that line of reform is worth a trial.  I suggest to him that, when his attention is directed to a county home which is judged impractical to reconstruct, before he authorises the erection of a new central institution for old people or chronic patients in the county, he should try out experimentally the establishment of parish hostels, homes or almshouses&mdash;call them what you will&mdash;on the model of many existing charities which would provide accommodation for the old people and the destitute poor within reach of those whom they love, and, more especially, within reach of those who love them.  That, in my judgment, would be infinitely more important than improving the structural quality of, or the amenities made available in a central institution.  I should like to add that the less like an institution such a parish home turned out to be, the better it would be.  I would not want tiles; I would not want hospital surroundings in such a place.  The more like home we could arrange to make it and the less formal its administration was required to be, the more serviceable it would be for the purpose we ought to have in mind.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to mention one other matter.  When I hear Deputy Browne talking disparagingly of voluntary hospitals and those who operate them, it makes one think of that kind of mentality which believes itself, perhaps genuinely, to have done full justice to suffering and affliction when it has made pious speeches in public about them.  I often wonder if people so minded have ever followed the blind into a blind asylum, or the dying into a home for incurables, or the destitute poor into a home for old people, because, if they had, their eyes would <Col N="1276" /> be greatly opened to the difference between allowing your heart to bleed in the market place for the sufferings of people so afflicted and the endless round of arduous labour which is involved in looking after these people when they have found refuge in an institution established for their care.</P>
    <P>I see religious in this country tending the blind, the aged and the dying, and I often wonder how even their vocation can sustain them in the arduous tasks which are their daily lot. But what I think is the grievous thing is that, while they are prepared to undertake that labour, given the accommodation wherein to do the job, there are still hundreds of people in this country who are old and have nowhere to go.  There are hundreds of families disrupted by people whose destiny it is to take too long to die. There are homes greatly burdened by members of the family afflicted by blindness who require constant care if they are not to be injured or neglected within the family circle.  I never could understand why it was we were not prepared to provide establishments where these excellent works could be carried on where religious orders were prepared to undertake them.</P>
    <P>Take a case in point.  There is a Nazareth Home in Sligo.  There are many, many old people eager to get into it.  So far as I know the nuns are willing and anxious to take them but one of the difficulties is that there is no place to put them.  I conceive it would be a most admirable thing in those circumstances to say to a body of that kind: &ldquo;Very well.  We will build a place if you undertake to run it.&rdquo; I know those nuns are prepared to go out and beg the money wherewith to keep the establishment in existence and they do it.  They beg all over the country for the poor. Would it not be a very good thing to erect a building for them and say: &ldquo;Far from thanking us, we are beholden to you for undertaking to operate it on our behalf.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is in the City of Dublin the Harold's Cross Hospice for the Dying. There is the slightly different charity of the Hospital for Incurables in Donnybrook but I am told that if <Col N="1277" /> there was accommodation available both of those institutions could be filled three and four times over.  Could two more admirable charities be conceived by the mind of man?  If there are religious or laity prepared to operate them are we not in some sense remiss if we are not prepared to provide the premises wherein to accommodate the people who require that kind of care?</P>
    <P>I do not know how adequate the accommodation is for blind children, but I do know that the accommodation for mentally afflicted children is deplorably inadequate with consequent widespread tragedy throughout the homes of simple people.  I cannot doubt that religious can be found who would undertake that extremely burdensome task of looking after afflicted children and that may mean looking after them from infancy to old age.  I think we are remiss in that we do not seek their collaboration on the understanding that, where it is forthcoming, we will be prepared to provide the premises in which this charitable work will be carried on.  Perhaps the Minister has something of that kind in his mind.  I think the House would be grateful for an assurance from him that in addition to the curative institutions the erection of which is in progress he was in a position to tell us it was his intention to do something along the lines which I adumbrated as well.</P>
    <P>I think it is important to say this much and mean it.  There is no Deputy in this House who would measure the value of a neighbour's child in terms of money.  There is no Deputy in this House who would deliberately say: &ldquo;Let us save £1,000 and let the neighbour's child die.&rdquo; But once that principle is universally accepted there devolves upon us, I think, a very special duty to ensure that we will not dissipate ineffectively the resources of which we dispose.  We have got to remember that there is a physical limit to what we can do.  It was to illustrate that that I read for the information of the House the experience of Miss Gladys Dearden.  It must be our desire to see that all those who are truly in need are provided for without <Col N="1278" /> overtaxing the resources at our disposal.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether this £600,000 to which I have referred is designed to furnish some of the proposals the Minister has submitted to us in the form of a Health Bill.  If it is, I would like him to elaborate for us at some early stage the significance of subsection (4) of the amendment which he has submitted to take the place of Section 18 of the Health Bill in which he proposes to charge the local authority with power to levy the cost of a health service prescribed by it for the day students of every diocesan college out of the funds of the diocesan college.  Inasmuch as every diocesan college in Ireland is struggling with the extra cost imposed on it by the removal of the food subsidies and trying to carry on without substantially increasing the fees of the country boys who attend the colleges, I hope he will give us an assurance that it is not proposed to place on these colleges a further substantial burden of expense whose only results must be that the college fees must be increased.  Certain scholars who would have the advantage of secondary education will suddenly discover that there is no room for them in the colleges under the new dispensation because their parents are no longer able to pay the fees necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I gladly depart from it, Sir, if that is your view.  I am not dismayed by the cost of providing health services.  I think that if this country be well run, we have the resources to provide all that our people require, but I sometimes am dismayed at the thought that our resources, which are ample but not excessive, may be dissipated in follies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the greatest conceivable mistake is to appoint a doctor Minister for Health.  Probably the present Minister agrees with me in that view. I think that once you let a bunch of doctors loose they constitute a menace and become filled with a kind of horrible passion to enslave us all.  It is very significant that 90 per cent. of the discussion on this Estimate has been <Col N="1279" /> conducted by doctors on both sides of the House.  In fact, I can feel in some of the medical bosoms which surround me a sort of resentment that any mere layman should intervene in this matter.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude, then, by saying this: as a potential patient, I represent 95 per cent. of the people of this country.  The doctors are our servants. We pay them, and I would exhort them to wake up to the fact that, if driven to it, we will resist serfdom. We have no desire to be rolled up in aseptic swaddling sheets, locked for evermore in the aseptic conditions in which they believe we ought to be for our own good.  We want to live the way that we like to live.  We do not want to be protected from every disease that is borne on the breeze. We want to get sick occasionally.  I have seen some of the best Deputies go out and take good care that they would have sick heads the morning after.  We want no army of doctors to meet us on our way to our celebrations and tell us to go home and go to bed lest we be sick the morning after.</P>
    <P>We reserve the right to get sick when we want to and to send for the doctor when we want him, and tell him to cure us or foretell what the probable consequences of our actions are likely to be.  We do not surrender these sovereign rights into the hands of the medical association.  We exhort that splendid body of people, our civil servants, to remember that they are our servants and have a duty to be civil.</P>
    <P>We exhort the doctors to remember, admirable citizens though they be, that their degrees and qualifications entitle them to nothing more than to stand upon the hazard to seek the patronage of the downtrodden citizenry of this country who will send for them when they want them, and who want no legislation enacted by this Parliament which gives either to them or to the occupants of the Custom House the right to break into our homes or our families for the purpose of telling us what we ought to do.</P>
    <P>Miss Deardon, if she had panicked and had been blackmailed and frightened into St. Mary's, would have had to undergo an immense operation, but, <Col N="1280" /> through the mercy of God's Providence, she survived that.  We reserve the rights to make these judgments for ourselves.  We appreciate the solicitude of the medical profession for our welfare, but we assert that perhaps one of the most precious liberties which we have so painfully secured is to get sick when we want to, and to get well the way we want to, always provided that we do not prejudice the interests or the legitimate rights of our neighbours. Subject to that reservation, I think that we have the means at our disposal to provide adequate and effective medical services for our people. We spurn the slanders which have been uttered about our voluntary hospitals and the services which our doctors have rendered in them.  We value their services and propose to avail of them and to supplement them by whatever voluntary services in themselves are insufficient to provide.</P>

      <P>So far as my county is concerned, hospital accommodation and hospital treatment are available for that section of the people who are not able to meet out of their own resources the cost of such treatment.  If a person is not feeling well he can go and see his dispensary doctor.  If the doctor thinks it necessary, he sends the patient to hospital.  If the hospital authorities think that the patient should remain in hospital for treatment, then the treatment is provided, and there is no question of payment. While in hospital the patient, even though he is not able to pay for his maintenance, gets the same treatment and facilities as the patient who is in a position to pay the full hospital charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy who has spoken has raised this question of hospital accommodation. As far as my county is concerned, we would need extra hospital accommodation to enable us to meet the ordinary demands of the <Col N="1281" /> community.  So far as the hospitals are concerned, I think that better living accommodation should be provided for the nurses attached to them.</P>
    <P>The present position is that many of them have to live outdoor.  In my opinion, living accommodation should be provided for them in the hospital. That question has been raised many times in my county and has been before the Department for some time. In fact, that is one of the complaints we have in the rural areas&mdash;the long delay that takes place before we can get a decision from the Department.</P>
    <P>The Department should realise that it has the responsibility of making a decent contribution towards the cost of providing these medical facilities and treatment for the people in the rural areas.  The local authorities are no longer able to meet those charges due to the heavy increases in the local rates.  A lot of inconveniences and uncertainty would be removed if local authorities could get more prompt decisions from the Department in relation to a number of the matters which are sent up to it for sanction.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already that the nurses attached to some of the hospitals in my county have to board out. That is a very serious matter, especially for nurses on night duty if they have to travel a long distance in the morning in bad weather to reach the houses in which they are staying. There is the danger that they will get into bad health.</P>
    <P>With regard to sanatorium treatment, we have the hospital at Creagh where 40 patients are accommodated. It is situated some distance from the original building.  For a long time we have been awaiting a departmental grant to build a kitchen and dining-room on to the existing hospital.  The present arrangement is that the food has to be conveyed 50 to 70 yards from where it is cooked to the hospital.  It may be possible to cook some portion of the meals in the existing hospital but the main meal has to be brought over.  In winter time particularly that arrangement is very unsatisfactory.  I raise this matter because I am anxious <Col N="1282" /> that all the necessary facilities should be provided in Creagh.</P>
    <P>School medical inspection is a very important matter.  It is a means of getting at the root of a lot of health problems.  I am afraid that the authorities do not realise the difficulty of having proper medical examination carried out in some rural schools.  In many of them there is no electric light or water.  Some schools have a small cloakroom or hall.  Others have not. It is not possible under these conditions for the doctor to carry out the inspection 100 per cent. perfectly.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that for the purpose of school medical inspection the schools in a parish could be grouped and the pupils could be brought to some convenient centre, a dispensary or otherwise. The children could be brought by station wagon, 15 to 20 at a time. They could be examined properly in a place where there would be accommodation for the doctor.</P>
    <P>Many of us remember the days when walls six to 12 feet high surrounded hospitals throughout the country. People hated the sound of the word &ldquo;hospital.&rdquo; They felt that if they went in behind those walls they would never come out.  The walls were removed, new hospitals were built and now there is no trouble in getting people to enter hospitals for treatment, whereas 20 to 40 years ago they would have to be forced to go into a hospital.</P>
    <P>The same applies in the case of county homes.  The county home in Mayo is surrounded by a high wall and it is only by force that you will get people to go into the county home.  I would suggest that the walls surrounding the county home should be lowered.</P>
    <P>In the case of an old age pensioner or blind pensioner who goes into a county home his pension is retained for the purpose of defraying part of the cost of his maintenance in the home. It is right that these people should be asked to contribute part of the cost of maintenance but, in fairness, the person should be allowed to retain at least half the pension.  If any extra demand is put on local authorities, there is the danger that the most deserving cases may be neglected.  It has been my experience as a member <Col N="1283" /> of a local authority&mdash;and I am sure others have had the same experience&mdash; that when the patient is leaving he is not asked to pay but is given the bill to take home, on the condition that he will discharge the bill then, and in a big number of cases where patients are not able to contribute to the cost of treatment they go to the local county councillor.</P>
    <P>In my experience, where we discuss this question with those people and ask them to make a proportionate contribution if they can, we find that it is the really poor people who are the first to offer even a small contribution, while those who could afford to pay perhaps the full 100 per cent. in five cases out of ten prove the hardest crowd to get to pay any portion of the cost.  In conclusion, as far as benefit to individuals is concerned, I feel that if the accommodation is extended there is always the danger that the section who may suffer are those who require the hospital assistance most.</P>

      <P>The bigger the Estimate we are passing, the calmer the atmosphere.  There is a vast amount of money involved in this Estimate, but I am satisfied it is properly spent and is doing an immense amount of good.  This is a Department which comes close to the lives of the people and these millions of pounds are being spent all over the country.  There is a vast number of big buildings at present and it is time we reviewed the position.  I think we are spending too much on buildings and not enough on labour in them.  Anyone who looks at the country and the big buildings <Col N="1284" /> would think Ireland was a leper colony, that we were an untouchable nation.  Instead of more buildings, I would rather see the money spent on equipping the buildings we have.</P>
      <P>Health is one of the greatest assets a human being can have, and he who loses his health is an unfortunate man. Looking back over a long number of years, I believe there has been a vast amount of abuse of health&mdash;through overfeeding and overdrinking&mdash;and as a result our hospitals are crowded.  In other cases there is ill-health through underfeeding.  These things need to be rectified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>We should concentrate on putting the homes of the people on a better standard.  A vast amount of education of a certain type is needed.  We are a fairly well-educated people; even the poorest man can read and write and think for himself, but there is something lacking. All those homes would be more happy and more healthy if we could give them the finishing touch and get the people to realise how to spend their own money in the best way.  A vast amount of money going into the homes of many of the poorer and middle-class people does not go where it should go, to the needs of the family. A vast amount of it is squandered, with the result that there is undernourishment and ill-health and our hospitals and homes are crowded with underfed, underclad and sickly children. Money is often spent on drink, overfeeding and gambling which, if it were spent on the family and the home, would mean a saving of millions of pounds.  I would ask the Department to concentrate first and foremost on that, before they build any more gigantic buildings.  An attempt should be made to train the people in the way to spend their money to the best advantage.  If the proper things were done in the homes we would not need half the hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see the dispensaries crowded week after week by people with red tickets getting bottles.  In many cases these medicines are very expensive and it <Col N="1285" /> costs a vast amount of money to keep the dispensaries equipped and stocked and up to date.  Many of these &ldquo;bottles&rdquo;, or whatever they go for, are not needed at all.  If the people looked after their own homes, had proper food and sanitary accommodation and minded their business, they would not need to be calling on the taxpayer to provide bottles for them. Even a cough is used as an excuse to keep the children from school&mdash;the poor darlings are in bed, sneezing and coughing and cannot go to school.  This costs tens of thousands of pounds to the taxpayers.  If the children were well fed in the mornings and were well clad and sent to school, they would not need to worry about the cough and colds and sneezes.  These are the things on which the taxpayers' money is being spent and that is why we have to spend millions on health services.</P>
    <P>We should have physical culture exercises in our schools for the benefit of the children.  At present the physical development of our children from the earlier stages is completely neglected with the exception of a few places here and there.  In every national school there should be physical culture exercises to develop our children.  If that were done we would have a healthier race of people.  At present all over the country you see dwarfed young people who should be manly and vigorous. They are puny looking and when you look at the homes they come out of and the parents they have you think they should be vigorous and healthy.  We should concentrate more on the homes and the schools and give our people the things that they need.  Physical culture exercises would bring about an immense improvement in our people. They would develop the chests of our children and then we need not worry about having them tested for T.B. or any other disease.  In the country the children have the pure air, but they never breathe deeply enough to fill their lungs.</P>
    <P>We should also develop the organisation of boy and girl scouts and give our young people a healthy outlook.  We should change the present rotten system. Our young people think of nothing but the dance halls, lounge bars, dog tracks and racecourses.  At <Col N="1286" /> least 50 per cent. of the people in hospital at present are there as a result of these things.  In that way we could save millions of money.</P>
    <P>As far as my county is concerned, we have got a raw deal from the Department.  We got practically none of the hospitals' sweepstakes money in my county, although we were entitled to a good share of it, because we contributed a lot to it.  We have a county hospital in Navan which was formerly a county home.  We have spent thousands of pounds on that hospital, but it has the old county home look still.  I am glad to say that we have a very good staff of nurses and doctors there who are giving splendid service.  We have spent a lot of money on that hospital to make it as good as it could be.  At a future date, when money is available, I hope we shall have a regional hospital for two or three counties and be able to close down these old hospitals.</P>
    <P>We have had to attach a T.B. wing to the county hospital because there is no alternative, as the sanatoria are overcrowded.  It is disgraceful to have a T.B. wing side by side with the county hospital and not ten yards away a county fever hospital.  As I say, my county needs attention in that respect.  For 25 or 30 years, no matter what efforts we made, nothing was done for us.  We did not get any share of what was going, and therefore I think we are entitled to consideration now.  We have a maternity home in Trim which is well equipped, but there are only eight or ten beds in it, with the result that half the people who want to go in there cannot get into it. That should be made into a proper maternity home to serve the needs of the county.</P>
    <P>So far as the medical services in the country are concerned, our doctors are a conscientious, noble body of men who are giving splendid services.  In most cases their services are given without any charge being made.  If they charge what they should charge they would be rich men, but they never do that. There are very few doctors who are out to make big money.  They treat their patients very reasonably at considerable expense to themselves, and <Col N="1287" /> they certainly deserve the greatest praise.  I hope that the Minister will make every effort to bring about co-operation between the doctors and himself so that we can start off on the right foot.</P>
    <P>Our nurses also are amongst the best in the world.  Young girls who go into the nursing profession spend three or four years in training and when they qualify they dedicate their lives to the sick and the poor.  They attend them night and day and they are certainly a credit to the country.  Across the water they are very anxious to get Irish nurses because they are conscientious and stick to their job.  Any doctor in an hospital over there will say, &ldquo;Give me Irish nurses and I know my patients will be safe under their care&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For a long number of years in this country we have had Jubilee nurses who give noble and valuable services. The time has come to review the position of these nurses, who, I must say, gave valuable services in my county.  The Jubilee nurses and the other nurses should be amalgamated. The State should take over these Jubilee nurses and none of them should be dispensed with.  They are doing trojan work, but the finances are running out and in a few years that service will be closed down.  I should like to see these nurses taken into the general nursing profession and fitted into a national scheme, as they are all qualified nurses.  In any case, it is time that anything which was handed over to us by another country should be left on one side.  Britain should be let look after its own interests and this country should have all Irish nurses.</P>
    <P>As far as dispensaries are concerned, a great deal requires to be done.  I am glad to say that in my county during the last few years three or four very good dispensaries have been erected and have been attached to the doctors' residences.  I was speaking to one eminent doctor who spent 25 years in England and he told me that he never saw a better dispensary in Great Britain than the one he had here.  I believe these dispensaries which we are building are more or less of a standard <Col N="1288" /> pattern and I hope such dispensaries will be built all over Ireland.  If money is available, I hope we will go ahead and see that every dispensary is worthy of the Irish people.  The money expended on these dispensaries is being well spent and is providing facilities for our doctors which are badly needed.</P>
    <P>There was not sufficient accommodation in the old dispensaries, and in many cases the patients had to stand outside in the cold and wet during the winter months.  Perhaps the doctor was irked and in bad humour because of the overcrowding.  Perhaps things did not run smoothly.  In the new dispensaries, on the other hand, things run very smoothly.  There are properly upholstered seats for those waiting.  There are fires and all the amenities essential to such a building are provided.  The doctor has every facility to treat his patients as they should be treated.  From that point of view, we are making some advance.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some tightening up in connection with the red ticket. I do not say that anybody should be kept from getting all the treatment that medical science can give him, should that be necessary.  I am satisfied, however, that there is a good deal of abuse in connection with the red ticket.  I know doctors prepare bottles and give them to patients.  Those bottles are brought home, the first spoonful is taken, and if it does not taste as pleasantly as the patient thinks it ought to taste the bottle is put up on a shelf until Monday morning, and when Monday morning comes the bottle is washed out and back the patient goes to the dispensary for another bottle. There is too much waste in that way, and if one could calculate the waste over the entire country it would run into tens of thousands of pounds.  Some tightening up is necessary there.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that generally we are making slow but steady progress.  We are moving in the right direction.  Instead, however, of building sanatoria and hospitals we should start in the people's homes, educate them in proper ideas with regard to their health, teach them how to preserve their health, show them how to be thrifty, <Col N="1289" /> show them how to eat properly and give their children physical training in the schools.  If we do that, we will have no need for big sanatoria and county hospitals, and I hope the Government will make an effort to start now in the homes and in the schools.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with Deputy Giles in congratulating our Irish nurses and our Irish doctors, particularly our dispensary doctors, on the very fine work they are doing.  I represent one of the poorest constituencies in Ireland, West Donegal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>West Donegal is one of the poorest constituencies in Ireland, yet it is one of the constituencies which takes least advantage of the red ticket system.  A patient living in the heart of the mountains has never yet had to depend on a red ticket for the attendance of his medical adviser. That is a proud boast and it is something of which we in Donegal are justifiably proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a dispensary doctor who practised in the Rosses, one of the most rugged and wildest parts of West Donegal.  During his 30 years there he saw only three red tickets.  That is not to say that every patient during those 30 years paid that doctor for his services, but the quantum demanded by the doctor depended entirely on the circumstances of the patient.  That doctor knew the financial circumstances of the patient.  That doctor knew the financial circumstances of all his patients so well that he demanded from them a fee in proportion to those circumstances irrespective of treatment. I think that system where one has the fullest co-operation between the doctor and his patient is the best system.  It is certainly a better system than the system at present in operation in England whereby the doctor is compelled to attend every patient even though he may only suffer from an imaginary stomach ache.  That may be the result here of the new Bill circulated by the Minister.  That Bill cannot be discussed at the moment but the fact remains that we are providing in this Estimate some of the moneys <Col N="1290" /> necessary for the implementation of that measure.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon said, why should we make it compulsory for the doctor to prescribe for us until such time as we are actually ailing?  Why should it be made possible by an enactment of this House to create that kind of atmosphere between a patient and doctor?  The proposed Bill reminds me somewhat of the farmer who went to buy a horse before he had built a stable: we are trying to provide hospital treatment for patients before we have built the hospitals.  That is our main trouble.  We require hospitals and hospital beds.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago in County Donegal we were waiting for a district hospital in the town of Dungloe.  Twenty-two years ago we were promised a county hospital in the town of Letterkenny. When Deputy Dr. Browne was Minister for Health in the inter-Party Government I remember the anxiety he displayed&mdash;I know it was a genuine anxiety&mdash;to have that district hospital erected in Dungloe.  I remember coming with my fellow Deputies from County Donegal to interview Deputy Dr. Browne.  I remember his endeavour to expedite matters and to cut out all the red tape which was holding up the building of that hospital.  I remember reaching a stage in those interviews when we thought we had smoothed out all the difficulties and, as the Minister told us at the time, building could proceed.</P>
    <P>We are as far away to-day from that project as we were ten years ago.  Our nearest residential hospital is 22 miles away.  We are still waiting for that hospital, a hospital in which we were promised a maternity bed for every woman who needed it.  We cannot get beds at the moment for really urgent cases.  Deputy Dillon told us this evening about the case in Manchester where a patient was waiting for three and a half years for a bed and at the end of that period received a top priority telegram informing her that a bed was available.  She was then able to say that she did not want a bed and they could keep it.  I do not know what her ailment was.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1291" /> Would it surprise the Minister to learn that in the townland of Meenmore in the Rosses I made representations three and a half years ago for the admission of an infant to a children's hospital here and we have not yet succeeded in getting a bed for that child?  For three years we have been waiting for admission for that unfortunate child to a Dublin hospital. I have made representations to the ministry and to the Donegal County Council and I have received the usual formal acknowledgement &ldquo;Tá brón orm a rá nach bhfuil aon leaba le fáil go fóill.&rdquo; Is it not a shocking state of affairs to think that, in the heart of the Gaeltacht&mdash;this Gaeltacht that we are all so anxious to preserve&mdash;children suffering from these diseases must remain on a waiting list for three and a half years?  That is quite true.</P>
    <P>Now I come to our dispensaries. They are in a deplorable condition.  In the village of Anagry a new dispensary was required urgently.  What was the solution?  An ex-British Army hut was suggested, a discarded British Army hut without heat and without any proper sanitary accommodation was suggested for a new dispensary.  Fortunately, however, the local county councillors and the people got up in arms and refused to accept the British Army hut with the result that we are now in process of receiving and having erected a proper dispensary in the town of Anagry.  How many other existing dispensaries are in an equally bad condition?  I should like to see the local authority own the residence of every dispensary doctor in the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the local authorities erect dispensary residences for every dispensary doctor in the country and, attaching to such residence, I should like to see a proper dispensary with at least one bed therein for an urgent emergency case.  In that way, we should bring some relief to the unfortunates who are living a considerable distance from hospital and who are dependent upon not too reliable transport to get them there in case of emergency.  These dispensaries would pay for themselves by the saving in rental&mdash;aye, and by the saving <Col N="1292" /> in medicines, medical appliances and equipment, which are actually rotting in some of these dispensaries.  I know dispensaries where the doctor, on a wet dispensary day, has to place a bucket underneath a leakage in the roof.  I know dispensaries were the doctors have had to discard and throw out powdered milk which had become useless in these antiquated buildings.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I asked the present Minister if representations could not be made to his counterpart in the Six Counties whereby patients from Donegal County generally could receive medical treatment in the various hospitals in Derry City.  I was very glad to hear my colleague, Deputy Cunningham, back me up in that matter. There is something wrong with a system under which we see a patient from, say, Malin Head, Gweedore, Bloody Foreland or some of these outlying spots, brought by ambulance through the Six Counties all the way down to Dublin for treatment and back again by ambulance&mdash;and passing through Derry City in which some of the most up-to-date medical services are available.  I should like to see some liasion between the authorities whereby such a person could receive medical treatment in the Six Counties, thus obviating the necessity to travel from Donegal all the way down to Dublin and, at the same time, saving the taxpayer a considerable amount of expense.</P>
    <P>As many Deputies know, it often happens that, having travelled all the way down from Donegal, patients have difficulty in obtaining a bed in a hospital in this city.  That fact will readily be appreciated by Deputies who are continually pestering hospital authorities for beds for patients from the Western seaboard.  I should like to see the Minister make some serious approach to his counterpart in the Six Counties in regard to this matter.  I should also like to see some serious effort made to cut down the waiting list at these hospitals and, particularly, I want to see the speeding-up of the building of hospitals.  I want to see red tape cut&mdash;that red tape which has tied up in knots the erection of the hospital in Dungloe and the county hospital in Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> Another very important and pressing matter is the rehabilitation of tubercular patients.  As we know, the public authorities are responsible for these patients while they are in hospitals. Once they are discharged I think it should be the duty of the public authorities to try and rehabilitate them in some form of employment akin to that which they carried out prior to contracting this awful disease.  I know several cases where tubercular patients who require the usual biannual check-up applied to local authorities for employment&mdash;be it as ambulance drivers or attendants in various institutions or as officials.  It would be beneficial to have these ex-tubercular patients in these places because they would be under the eye, practically speaking, of the medical officers who attended them during their illness.  Unfortunately, their pull &mdash;be it political or otherwise&mdash;has debarred them from obtaining these appointments with the result that they are receiving no opportunity of rehabilitating themselves and they find that they have to emigrate.  When they emigrate they may have to live in the bothy, the hut or the communal camp in Scotland and in a short time their second condition is worse than their first.  Some serious effort should be made to find suitable employment for such ex-patients.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to see some co-operation between the various medical inspectors and inspections in rural Ireland.  I remember that, in one week in a certain dispensary, on the Tuesday we had the local dispensary doctor, on the Wednesday we had the county medical officer of health examining the schoolchildren, on the Thursday we had an optician who had travelled something in the neighbourhood of 70 miles to examine the same schoolchildren, and on the Friday we had a doctor who came down from Dublin to examine&mdash;by way of being a referee&mdash; National Health Insurance applicants. Surely some liasion could be arranged between these various medical officers whereby one doctor could do all this work.  It is ridiculous to say that five medical men should travel considerable distances to the one dispensary&mdash; distances in respect of which the travelling expenses in some cases far <Col N="1294" /> exceeded the amount being paid by way of public assistance to these people. There should be some liasion in these matters between these various concerns and that would bring about a considerable saving to the taxpayer.  It is a matter which should be seriously considered by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about county homes.  We have one in County Donegal.  I am not certain of the number of patients in the county home, but I am certain that there were 25 official employees in it, between chief clerks, clerks, typists and various others.  It is a very fine building, particularly the portion which housed these 25 employees of the Donegal County Council.  I think a lot of these employees could be dispersed.  We have the home assistance officer, the superintendent home assistance officer; then there are the various typists and paymasters.  There is a considerable amount of superfluous expenditure in the running of these county homes.  I think Deputy Dillon is right when he says that something on the lines of the parish home should be established, a small home for two or three parishes, run by, supervised by, and in which patients would be cared for by some of these religious orders.</P>
    <P>We have in the City of Derry the Nazareth House.  I have discussed with some of the patients there the treatment they receive and the circumstances in which they live.  Certainly there is no comparison between the standards of the county home and the standard of living in the Nazareth House in Derry.  The Minister should seriously consider the establishment of small parish homes to which the destitute old people of the parish could go. It would leave the large building free for renovation to be used, possibly in an emergency, as modern hospitals or used as tuberculosis homes.  It has been done for the old fever hospitals and there is no reason why it could not be done with the present county homes if the scheme suggested by Deputy Dillon were proceeded with.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would appeal to the Minister to expedite the appointment of dispensary doctors where vacancies occur.  In the island of Arranmore <Col N="1295" /> during the past 20 years we have had 29 medical officers of health.  It is ridiculous.  The reason is, of course, that no doctor appointed wants to spend any time on the island.  I know of a number of doctors who are most anxious to procure that appointment and who are willing to give a guarantee that they will spend ten years on the island if they are appointed medical officer of health for the island.  Unfortunately these applicants to whom I refer have been unable to secure the permanent appointment on the island but the gentlemen who do receive this permanent appointment only use it as a stepping-stone to better dispensaries in the county and elsewhere.  I would suggest to the Minister that when a vacancy occurs there in future some condition, such as that the successful applicant be required to reside for a period of three, four, five, six or seven years on the island before applying for a transfer or resigning, should be laid down.  If that were done the people of the island would feel satisfied and secure in the knowledge that they are going to have a permanent dispensary doctor for at least some years.</P>
    <P>I would say further that he is not going to attract the right class of applicant for the island until something is done about the erection of a doctor's residence on the island and the establishment of a proper dispensary.  There is no reason why a proper residence with a dispensary attached could not be erected for, say, £2,500 and I know for a fact that many times £2,500 have been spent on paying the fee due to locum tenens who are being sent there when the permanent man was allegedly ill.  I would make that final appeal to the Minister to do something for these unfortunate islanders by guaranteeing them continuity of service from a dispensary doctor and by guaranteeing to the doctor a proper residence and a proper dispensary on the island.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I will commence by giving a little bit of consolation to Deputy O'Donnell.  I can assure him that in regard to the hospitals for Letterkenny and Dungloe, plans and preparations have reached the stage <Col N="1296" /> that it will be possible to start building this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Deputies have drawn attention to the fact that in Great Britain, where they have a different system of medical service from what we have here, people are waiting for three years to get into hospitals.  I do not know what the object of that quotation was.  The only thing I can conclude from it is that a new scheme was necessary in England if people were in such a very bad way that they had to wait three years for hospital treatment.  That is not to say that I am in favour of nationalisation. I am not.  As a matter of fact, a British Government over 100 years ago in the Victorian times, brought in free treatment in this country for certain classes. I am asking the Dáil in a Bill that will come before it soon, to extend that free treatment somewhat but you may as well accuse those who introduced the British improvements in the Victorian times of being in favour of nationalisation as to accuse me.</P>
      <P>Again, we are accused of putting the cart before the horse; in other words that we have not got enough hospitals and, therefore, we should not proceed with our scheme.  As Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll very properly pointed out when he was speaking in this debate, the T.B. scheme was brought along before sanatoria were built and we got quite good results.  We achieved a substantial reduction in the death rate, and if the same can be done in regard to other diseases besides T.B., there is no reason why we should not bring in our scheme for general health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to quote Deputy Dr. Browne more than anyone else because he only said what many other Deputies said, but he pointed to the fact that if we give facilities to too many people to go into hospital we will not have <Col N="1297" /> the beds for them.  That reasoning means this: It is better to leave things as they are; if anybody is going to be excluded from the hospitals let those who cannot pay be excluded and let them put up with the consequences. That is a very callous way to look on the question.  Surely we should give an opportunity to everybody to get hospital treatment as far as we can. At any rate, do not let us make it a case of keeping out the people who cannot pay.  Let us put them all on an equal basis and then it will be up to the hospitals to give priority to the most deserving cases from the medical, not from the financial, point of view.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will think over the question they will come to the conclusion that the scheme we are proposing is a fair one because it puts everybody on the same level.  If we have not enough hospitals the medical authorities in the hospitals will have to do the best they can to admit those that are urgent cases and to try to postpone those that are not too urgent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon made a statement there which Deputy O'Donnell quoted. I was not surprised at Deputy Dillon making the statement because Deputy Dillon allows his tongue to run away with him and he has not much regard for facts and truth but to see a sensible Deputy like Deputy O'Donnell coming along and quoting the statement made by Deputy Dillon is rather disturbing. Has any Deputy in this House the idea that under any scheme we may bring in a doctor will have the right to come to any person and say: &ldquo;You want treatment and I am going to give it to you?&rdquo; That is so far-fetched that I do not think anybody could assert it, but Deputy Dillon did so.  To think that it would be quoted by any sensible Deputy makes one hopeless about getting Deputies here to understand the effects of various schemes.  However I suppose we may take it that Deputies generally will not be deceived by Deputy Dillon's rhetoric.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond asked a question with which I should like to deal now. It was in regard to the position of a non-paying patient in a public assistance hospital who brings a charge of neglect, of malpractice or any other <Col N="1298" /> charge, against the hospital authorities. The law was, I believe, that that person had no case to bring before a court but I just want to say what the law is now.  Section 108 of the Health Act of 1947 gives that person the right to sue the health authority for damage to his property or to his person caused by the negligence of the health authority or their officers or servants in the health institution.</P>
    <P>I thought when I was bringing in the 1947 Act that I made that matter right and that a poor person would have the same right of action against hospital authorities as the person who is paying, but we found, after the Act was passed, that we had covered only health authority institutions and that we had not covered public assistance institutions. Section 7 of the Health Bill, which is before the Dáil at present, provides that every district institution shall become a health institution so that non-paying patients will in future be entitled to sue for damage like paying patients.  The matter will, therefore, be put right as from the date on which the Health Bill that has now been before the Dáil becomes law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to a complaint that people are kept standing outside dispensaries waiting for hours for doctors to turn up.  I must say that I could understand that it might happen occasionally, but very, very seldom, that a doctor might be out on a serious case at the time the dispensary was due to open and that he might therefore be late.  If, as Deputy Corish alleges, that is occurring constantly, these people should complain, and either the county manager or the Minister for Health will have the matter investigated.  Personally, I do not think it occurs very often or in the case of very many dispensary doctors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish also complained that sometimes when the patient comes to a dispensary doctor he is given a prescription that is costly, and for the dispensing of which he is not able to pay.  We all know that a dispensary patient should not have to pay for the compounding of any prescription, that the medicine should be supplied to him free.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke on the <Col N="1299" /> matter of the infectious diseases allowances, which are commonly referred to as the T.B. allowances, and which are payable in the case of a man who has dependents, or, in fact, in the case of a single man, who gets tuberculosis. He gets a certain allowance to maintain himself if he is single, and to keep his family, if he is married.  First of all, it was complained that these allowances were too low, but I should point out that the figures which were read out by Deputy Dr. Esmonde are now out of date.  The allowances are now much more generous than they were at the time the figures which Deputy Dr. Esmonde quoted were in operation. However, that was not the point raised by Deputy Corish.</P>
    <P>The point raised by Deputy Corish was that when a person reaches the stage where the treatment is finished the allowance is stopped although he is not fit for work.  This is a rather difficult problem.  When these allowances were introduced in 1947, we naturally had to make some regulation with regard to the time during which the allowance would be payable.  I think the obvious thing was to prescribe that the allowances should be payable as long as the person was receiving treatment.  Treatment in that case also means treatment to the satisfaction of the medical officer of health. It would be difficult to suggest any other rule.  I do not know how we could justify any other rule so far as these allowances are concerned.</P>
    <P>The best solution, I am quite sure, is to introduce a system of rehabilitation such as that of which Deputy O'Donnell spoke and to have that system extended all over the country so that local authorities, when they reach the stage where they say that the treatment of a person for T.B. is now finished, could add: &ldquo;We hand this person over to the rehabilitation authority or committee.&rdquo; as the case may be.  He is then taken charge of by the rehabilitation centre and they decide whether he should still get the allowance, whether they should get some light work for him or what his future position should be.  Unfortunately, we have not got this rehabilitation organisation <Col N="1300" /> all through the country.  There are voluntary bodies acting, as I pointed out in introducing the Estimate, in Dublin, where they are doing excellent work.  There is also one in Galway doing great work, but they are doing only a small part of the work which could be done.  I am very anxious that this rehabilitation system should be extended.  There is a clause in the Bill now before the Dáil which will give more power to local authorities to attend to the rehabilitation of patients.  I am afraid we must wait for that before we can get over the difficulty to which Deputy Corish referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish spoke of employment exchanges pronouncing men as unfit for work.  I must say I cannot understand that.  Of course it is a question that does not exactly arise on this Estimate, but I should like to get more information from the Deputy to see what exactly he has in mind.  Another Deputy&mdash;I think it was Deputy Hickey in fact&mdash;deplored the fact that the allowances payable in the case of T.B. patients are not payable in the case of other diseases and he mentioned rheumatoid arthritis.  I agree with him. I think that where you have a person suffering from chronic disease which is apparently incurable and where the man or woman concerned is not likely ever to be able to earn a living again and is without means, something should be done.  In the Health Bill at present before the Dáil, there is provision for that also and that matter will, I hope, be looked after as soon as that Bill goes through.</P>
    <P>I gave a fair outline of what has been done with regard to dispensaries in a recent speech in the Dáil and when I was introducing this Estimate, I referred to that speech.  I said that I did not want to cover the ground again, but I am afraid that Deputies have short memories, because practically every Deputy who spoke complained of the state of the dispensaries. I want to repeat, therefore, that, having considered the position with regard to these dispensaries, I came to the conclusion that, so long as we were insisting on the local authorities building rather elaborate dispensaries and building them at their own expense, <Col N="1301" /> we were not likely to make very much progress.  I therefore introduced a scheme some time ago under which I sent out plans for a very simple type of building, a four-roomed house, much on the style of a labourer's cottage of the bungalow type, which would probably cost £1,100 or £1,200 to build.  I undertook to give a grant of half the cost, up to a maximum of £600.  That circular was sent out last May and I am glad to say that, since then, we have got proposals in from the various local authorities and they have undertaken to erect 294 new dispensaries or dispensary depots.  Some of these are in process of being built and they will replace the old and condemned dispensaries which have existed up to now.</P>
    <P>We previously had come to the conclusion that about 330 of the dispensaries and about 158 of the dispensary depots should be replaced, and, even in the 12 months since the circular was sent out last May, the local authorities have made proposals which would cover more than half the condemned dispensaries and I hope that within a year or two all the bad and condemned dispensaries will be rebuilt.  I want to repeat that the building of dispensaries is a matter for the local authorities and I ask Deputies, especially those who are members of local authorities, to turn their guns on the local authorities and not on me, and to try to get them to proceed with this matter.  So far as I am concerned, I am only too willing to help by giving the necessary grant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked me to give more particulars about this sum of £4,500,000.  It is estimated that the total expenditure from the Hospitals' Trust Fund, into which this sum of £4,500,000 has been paid, will amount to £5,824,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for the coming year. This total is made up of (1) building grants, £4,799,000&mdash;I will analyse that in a moment; (2) contingencies (works and miscellaneous grants not specifically provided for in the building programme), <Col N="1302" /> £245,000; and (3) miscellaneous grants, including deficits of voluntary hospitals, Medical Research Council, Hospitals' Commission expenses, B.C.G. vaccination, Hospital Library Council, etc., £780,000.  This gives a total of £5,824,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost £700,000.  The sum of £4,799,000 which is estimated will be spent on building grants is divided in this way: general hospitals will take £1,119,000 and, of that, the local authority hospitals will get £926,000 and the voluntary hospitals £267,000; maternity and children's hospitals, £530,000, of which the local authorities will get £105,000 and the voluntary hospitals, £424,000; fever hospitals, £193,000; mental hospitals, £128,000; institutions for mental defectives, £359,800; clinics and dispensaries, £252,000; and T.B. schemes £2,141,000. To meet these charges amounting to £5,824,000, the Exchequer is providing £4,500,000 by means of the Grant-in-Aid shown in the Estimate and the balance of about £1,300,000 represents the anticipated income of the fund from sweepstakes.</P>
      <P>As to the future, in the year 1954-55 the position, so far as we can see at the moment, will be approximately the same as it is expected to be during 1953-54, so that in that year again, we shall probably have to ask for a subvention of £4,500,000 from the Exchequer.  After that year, however, expenditure on the building programme, which will be nearing completion, will begin to diminish and the Exchequer contribution will accordingly fall from that year onwards.  The position is that of the £15,000,000 I mentioned which the Exchequer will have to subscribe to the fund, £9,000,000 will come in the coming year starting on 1st April and the year after, and the other £6,000,000 will tail off in the following three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke of school medical examination, and I quite agree that it is the first and most important matter to which we should attend in our extended health <Col N="1303" /> services.  It is my intention to urge the local authorities, in so far as I can, to get that part of the scheme going with the greatest urgency.</P>
    <P>A Deputy asked about the position of anaesthetists for county hospitals. That is a matter to which we have given a great deal of consideration.  It is not an easy matter to find a qualified anaesthetist and to find work enough for him in all the hospitals we have because some are rather small and we, therefore, cannot have a general scheme applying to all hospitals. We are, however, trying to work out three or four different alternatives which could be applied to a hospital according to its size and its proximity to a city or large centre.  I can assure the house that it is a matter which is receiving very careful attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to mental defectives, we are restricted to three orders who have undertaken the care of mental defectives in this country.  On the male side, we have two orders and, on the female side, only one.  The Department, however, I can assure Deputies, has not put any limit on the amount of funds that will be made available.  I can tell the House that, when I put my programme before the Government of what I needed, I said there was one condition I had to make and that was that if more was needed for mental defectives I would have to come to the Dáil for a Supplementary Estimate.  I feel the thing is so necessary and urgent that we should make the money available.  I can assure everybody here that it is not a matter of money but the orders, as I say, are few that will undertake this work.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies will agree that men and women who are joining religious orders must have a real avocation for that work because it is certainly a work of charity and love.  Therefore, we must depend on these orders.  When they find suitable houses, it takes some time to convert them.  Building new hospitals takes time but that, again, is not the big hold up.  The hold up is for personnel.  That personnel must, in turn, train other personnel.  They <Col N="1304" /> are doing that as rapidly as they can in the existing institutions and they will be available to take charge of the new institutions whenever they can be found.</P>
    <P>We have made fairly good progress. We expect to have a few thousand new beds ready by the end of the coming year.  I think it was estimated at one time that we might eventually require 6,000.  I am not sure whether that figure was correct but we will have a fair idea, I suppose, as time goes on. I think it was Deputy Paddy Burke, when talking about the mental defectives, who said that any Christian Government would be expected to look after all the people.  I am not sure whether that is good theology but we will have to leave it at that.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies talked about the treatment of nurses.  We should not exaggerate the position of the nurses.  They enjoy much better terms than they did but I am not in a position to say whether they are absolutely satisfied but I think they are more satisfied now than they were five or six years ago.  They are certainly very much nearer the conditions that apply elsewhere outside this country than they were some years ago.  Their terms were reviewed last August and the cost of living was taken into account. A settlement was reached.  When there is a vacancy in a hospital for a number of nurses, there is now no great difficulty in filling the vacancies.  Nurses are available here and those who emigrated for some reason some few years ago are definitely coming back so it does look as if nurses are more content with their conditions here now than they were.  I think we should not exaggerate the position in the Dáil by trying to persuade the nurses that they are badly treated.</P>
    <P>Their conditions are bad in some cases.  We have, as everybody knows, opened palatial nurses' homes in many places throughout the country.  Where-ever these are everything is good but some of the nurses are living in old quarters in the old hospitals and are certainly living under very poor conditions. These things will be made right as soon as possible.  I want to tell the Dáil about the difficulty in regard to <Col N="1305" /> some of these cases.  Not long ago, a proposition came before me where a local authority had the choice of improving the hospital from the point of view of the patients or improving it first from the point of view of the nurses.  The local authority, I think very properly, took the view that the patients should be their first consideration. I think they were quite right.</P>
    <P>We must all remember that in regard to hospitals we are aiming at getting good conditions for the patients.  The other matters are only secondary.  If it is necessary to give good conditions to nurses to get them to stay such conditions must be provided.  If it is necessary to give good conditions to the doctors that, of course, must be done, but the whole object is to see that the patients are treated properly.  Deputy Martin Corry gave us some figures which were supported by Deputy Hickey, but that did not make them any more truthful. I was one time asked by Deputy Corry what was the total cost of all the hospitals that were contemplated in Cork. I think I told him that it would be about £4,000,000.  He asked what the architects got, and I said about £200,000.  Now he has come to believe that we have spent the £200,000, although we have not spent the £4,000,000 at all.  He quoted those figures for the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it is a lesson for everybody to be more careful in regard to the truth.  Deputies tell me that health has become a political question.  Why do Deputies say that? I must say that I find it hard to believe that health is a political question in this country because no country could claim to be more united on a health policy than we are.  In 1947, the Fianna Fáil Government brought in the 1947 Act to enable the Government to extend and improve the health services. As a matter of fact, that Bill got through the Dáil with a large measure of agreement from all Parties. Whether it did or not, in 1948, a Government, composed of all the other <Col N="1306" /> Parties, came into office and they agreed to a health scheme.  There is no doubt about that.  Some of them may have gone back on it afterwards.</P>
      <P>We came back again and we brought in a scheme.  The point is that we have a scheme before the Dáil now with which the leaders of every Party agreed when in Government.  That is a very important matter because you will often have an Opposition Party agreeing with a thing with which they might not agree when they are a Government. In this case, the leaders of every Party in the Dáil, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan, Labour, Clann na Poblachta&mdash;now absent&mdash; agreed to the health scheme that is now before the Dáil.  How could you have a more united country on a health scheme than that?  Yet we are told by Deputies that we are making this a political question.  We are not.</P>
      <P>There is another organisation in this country, the Irish Medical Association, which opposed this scheme.  There is a slight attempt, not very much I admit, by Fine Gael, to justify the Irish Medical Association on that.  It was a slight attempt on the part of Fine Gael to get the sympathy of the Irish Medical Association.  To that extent, if you like, it is made a political question but that is not very important. Fine Gael may play these little political tricks from time to time but they do not amount to very much and it is not going to make this a political question at all.  When we talk about making health a political question, we should try to find where the responsibility lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride and other Deputies, including Deputy Hickey, made the point that the building of hospitals is a costly matter now and that it would have been much better if they were built ten years ago.  That is to say, in 1942 or 1943.  Naturally, I do not want to pin the Deputy to 1942 or 1943 because he probably meant pre-war. There were very many hospitals built pre-war.  I think any fairminded Deputy would admit that the momentum we were gathering in those years in the building of hospitals was quite creditable.  Were it not for the war, <Col N="1307" /> hospitalisation in this country would probably have been very well catered for six or seven years ago but the war interrupted matters and there are still hospitals to be built.  Maybe there is no great harm in saying that they are going to cost more but now that the local authorities are completing their housing schemes, the building of hospitals may be very welcome to those engaged in the building trade. If we go on with them, I think it will do a certain amount of good in the way of employment as well as improving the health services in the country.</P>
    <P>I was asked about geriatrics.  Since there was a lot of talk about the treatment of old people in this country, I would like to give my views on the matter.  Those old people are now in the county homes.  Everyone knows that, in addition to them, we have in the county homes other classes of people.  We have unmarried mothers; in some of them we have imbeciles; in some of them we have vagrants because the local authority is bound to admit any vagrant who claims admittance at night.  In addition, we have able-bodied vagrants in them.  If we want to treat these old people well we should try, if possible, to get homes where they alone would be accommodated, and where they would not have to see the distressing side of imbeciles or be bothered with the able-bodied vagrants who come in.  Our first effort, therefore, should be to see that the old people are placed in more congenial surroundings, and placed there alone.</P>
    <P>My idea, I must say, is that the county home should become a chronic hospital, and that it should be used only for the chronic sick, including, of course, old people who will, I suppose, nearly drift there in the end.  A considerable period, however, may elapse between the time the old person leaves his home and the time when he must be accommodated by the local authority.  That is the time in which the old person is ambulant&mdash;able to move around.  In regard to that, I would like to tell Deputies that through the local authorities we have <Col N="1308" /> been doing quite a lot in making old people ambulant.  These were old people who were not able to move around at all, but we got some very good expert advice and, since some medical men started working on them, it is extraordinary how some of those old people have been able to leave their beds and walk around&mdash;not, of course, as well as they were able to walk years ago.  At any rate, they are able to get around from one place to another&mdash;that is people who had been in bed maybe for some years, and who thought that they could never walk again.  That work is going on now in some of our bigger county homes, especially in St. Kevin's.  I would like to see that ambulant class put in special homes.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned to certain county managers and to certain local authorities&mdash;we have had conferences with the county managers and the local authorities on this matter and will again in the very near future&mdash;that I would like to see them try the ideas that were given out here in this debate.  In the first place, I would like to see them try the idea of the big house in the country, that is taking it over and making it a home for either men or women, and in which there would not be more than 16 or 20 old people.  I do not like that as well as the second alternative, which is the building of a special colony, not a very costly one, for the old people, if you like on the lines of a labourer's cottage, with, say, three or four rooms, where each old person would have his own room and where there would be a common room as well.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the running of that would cost the local authority any more than the county home is costing at the moment.  The capital required would not be very high.  I have undertaken, on behalf of the Government, to pay half the capital cost if any local authority likes to produce a scheme of this kind.  I am very anxious to see it tried, and I am very hopeful that some counties will try it and see how it will work out.  Deputy Dr. Browne spoke of the system in Sweden.  I saw it some years ago, and I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne that these old people&mdash;well, I am afraid they were <Col N="1309" /> really too well looked after, because, as he said, they are as well looked after there as a person would be in a first-class hotel in Dublin.  I am not saying that the treatment was too good, but the treatment was such that I am afraid it is beyond our reach for the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride mentioned the Lansbury colony in London.  I saw it within the last week.  I think it is the sort of thing that we should aim at here.  There each old person has a room to himself, and there is a common room and a sitting room.  I think that the capital cost of running such a scheme would not be very big. I do not think we should run it on the Lansbury style.  I think we could make economies without taking in any way from the comfort of the old people.  I think that the running of such a colony could be kept within reasonable limits.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper which we issued on county homes we had all that in view&mdash;that they should be broken up. We had in view, first of all, that the unmarried mothers should be sent to special homes, that the imbeciles should eventually reach the homes for mental defectives, that there should be some special place for able-bodied vagrants or tramps, and that then the county homes should be made chronic hospitals.  I have already pointed out that special homes should be provided for ambulant old people.</P>
    <P>The estimate that we made of the cost of doing all that was about £5,000,000.  Maybe that estimate is too low&mdash;I do not know.  I think we could do a lot on £5,000,000.  In our circular to the local authorities we undertook to bear half the interest charges on the loan which they would raise for the purpose.  If we take the figure of £5,000,000, and if that is distributed over all the counties in proportion to the population, and if half the cost of the interest charges is paid, it will only cost the local authority somewhere about 2½d. in the pound to look after the old people in the way that I have described.  I think every Deputy will agree with me that if we could do all that for an extra 2½d. in the pound&mdash; that is to meet the capital cost over the next 40 years&mdash;there is no member <Col N="1310" /> of this House who would oppose a scheme of that kind.</P>
    <P>We had some discussion about the voluntary hospitals.  They have played a great part in the development of medicine in this country.  As a matter of fact, we knew no other hospitals when I was a student.  If we go back 40 years, there was no such thing as a local authority hospital.  There was the workhouse hospital.  It was of a type which could hardly be described as a hospital, and, in addition, we had at that time small infirmaries throughout the country.  Therefore, one could hardly claim that we had anything in this country except the voluntary hospitals at that period, so that it is not an exaggeration to say that the history of medicine here is bound up with the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>The voluntary hospitals have changed very much in character since that time. I am speaking now of 40 years ago when the voluntary hospitals depended entirely on subscriptions and on what they charged their patients.  If they did charge them anything, it was only a few shillings.  Now the position is quite different.  The voluntary hospitals get very few subscriptions, but the local authorities now pay capitation fees for the patients they send into them.  The local authorities, in that way, are making a very big contribution to the upkeep of voluntary hospitals generally.  The State organisation&mdash;that is, the Hospitals' Sweep Fund&mdash;pays the hospital deficits, so between the two&mdash;the local authority capitation fees and the State organisation paying the deficits&mdash;the voluntary hospitals are depending on these two sources practically for their total income.</P>
    <P>There is quite a change in that way. The voluntary hospitals first got their names as voluntary, I take it, from the fact that they got voluntary subscriptions for running them and voluntary labour for working them.  The doctors were voluntary and, of course, the religious who were in them were voluntary and there were very few paid people in the hospitals at that time.  Now the staffs, except the doctors, are paid, and many of the patients pay, subscriptions have practically <Col N="1311" /> gone and the State, through its organisation, is making up the deficit.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Dr. Browne pointed out, that there is no democratic control.  They are run in various ways.  Some of them have members of local authorities on their boards. Some of them have not.  Some of them have life governors.  Others have a large circle of subscribers who elect a board.  They all have a different system.  But it is true to say that there is no democratic control, and it is true also, as Deputy Dr. Browne pointed out, that there is no way in which the State can interfere with them.  The Minister has no power to investigate any charge of incompetence or negligence.  He has no power, as a matter of fact, to enter a voluntary hospital at all on a matter of that kind.</P>
    <P>I do not mind these things.  The one thing in respect of which I do feel the voluntary hospitals might have been more co-operative is the matter of economies.  Some Deputy put it to me, what economies can they make. I think it was Deputy O'Higgins who said: &ldquo;You do not want to pay the nurses less; you do not want to pay the domestic staff less; you do not want to give the patients less food.&rdquo; Certainly not.  Even so, is not it a strange thing that, taking A and B hospitals in this city, A, as far as I can find out, is paying its nurses the same as B, paying its domestic staff the same as B, giving as good food to the patients as B, giving as good drugs and treatment as B, and yet the cost of the bed per week in A is only half what it is in B?</P>
    <P>The deficit is becoming a very serious problem.  It is going to run up to £700,000 practically this year. I do not think that any Government can afford to let this thing go without question.  Without finding any fault with the voluntary hospitals, I do not think a Minister would be doing his duty if he were to say: &ldquo;Whatever you incur by way of deficit I will pay it.&rdquo; He is bound to ask questions and to suggest that they might be able to cut these deficits in some way or other.</P>
    <P>One suggestion we made was that <Col N="1312" /> they might make their purchases through the combined purchasing scheme.  As Deputies know, you have there experts, if you like, in the examining of tenders, to advise anybody where they should buy.  I do not think we could be accused of interfering with a voluntary hospital in the management of its own affairs by advising them to adopt this system.  Yet, what was the result?&mdash;23 agreed and 12 refused. We have to go on paying the deficits.  I suppose we will have to try some other way of getting them to cut their losses in order to reduce this huge bill for deficits.</P>
    <P>I agree also with Deputy Dr. Browne on the question of appointments.  I think that in the question of appointments to local authority hospitals we have as perfect a system as human beings could devise.  In every way it is designed to get the best person for the particular job, whatever it may be. The people who are considered to be the best to advise on the particular position are put on the selection board.  They are not interested; they can take an objective view of the candidates put before them and they can show us the best person for the particular position.  We have all had experience enough now of that system to be able to say that over the years it has been successful.  I admit that I did not like the system when I came in first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not like it at first. I did not think it was necessary because, as far as I could see in my own part of the country, the local authorities were making good appointments. Experience has shown that it is a very good system and has given very good results.  We may have had a wrong one appointed now and again but, on the whole, it gave great results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going any more of the road with those who want to change the system of the voluntary hospitals.  I am a great believer in voluntary effort. I think we have very little of that voluntary effort left in this country.  I would be very sorry indeed to do anything that would destroy voluntary <Col N="1313" /> effort such as it is.  Therefore, I would do everything to help the voluntary hospitals to carry on.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact&mdash;I am sure Deputies will not believe this but it is true&mdash;I insisted on a voluntary hospital remaining a voluntary hospital when they tried their utmost, with threats and everything else, to get themselves handed over to the local authority.  I succeeded in the end in getting them to reconsider their position and to remain a voluntary hospital because, as I say, I am so interested in voluntary effort. I think voluntary effort is disappearing too rapidly out of this country and I am not going to do anything to destroy the voluntary hospitals.  I would like them to be more co-operative in making economies and to reduce these deficits.</P>

      <P>I do not think the voluntary hospitals themselves could have any doubt from any conversation I had with them.  The reason the first couple of speakers in the debate gave for wanting to have the Estimate referred back was that I had not maintained the relations I should have maintained with the Irish Medical Association, that they were dissatisfied with me as Minister for Health for that reason. I am glad to say that, after the first two speakers on the Fine Gael side, they forgot about that.  Evidently, the men who came on to speak afterwards were not reminded of why they were referring the Vote back.  As a matter of fact, by the time we reached Deputy Dillon, he told me to have nothing to do with these doctors, to throw them aside and remember that they are our servants and so on.  I am not going to go as far as that.  However, I am glad to see that Fine Gael are not altogether united in thinking that I am altogether in the wrong and that they are altogether in the right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A consultative council was spoken of.  In the first place, I think Deputies will agree that it must be a consultative or advisory council. That was the first dispute.  It must be a consultative council.  The Minister for Health must have the last word. Under our organisation of Government, Deputies know that the Minister of any Department is the administrator and executive for that Department and he cannot have any council coming in and telling him he must do such and such a thing, irrespective of what the Dáil may wish or of what the Government may wish or of what the Minister himself may wish.  Eventually I got that point fairly clear, that it will be an advisory council and not an executive council.</P>
      <P>That consultative council, such as it is, had two meetings.  We discussed the Health Bill and I told the council &mdash;being a good constitutionalist and a good democrat&mdash;that the Dáil had unanimously approved of the Bill, so there was no use in their saying they would not have it.  I told them the only thing they could discuss, therefore, was the amendment of the Bill.  I am sure the Dáil will applaud me for that, that I did not let them down, after giving that unanimous decision.  They put up certain amendments and we discussed them.  I said that I could agree to some of them and not to others.  I do not see what other attitude anyone could take with a consultative or advisory council.  I am sure Fine Gael would not expect me to agree with everything the Irish Medical Association put up, because if I did I would be no longer Minister for Health but an agent or spokesman in this House for the Irish Medical Association.  My immediate predecessor, Deputy Costello, played that role for a while, but if he had remained long enough in that office he would not have stuck to that role&mdash;probably he would have changed his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also told the council that this Bill, when it goes through and becomes an Act, will be followed by regulations and that I would discuss all these regulations with the council.  They appeared to think that was all right. They asked about other things.  They <Col N="1315" /> wanted to have regular meetings and I said I agreed to that.  They wanted to have the right to call meetings on their own initiative and I said I agreed to that, that if a certain number, to be decided on, signed a requisition, a meeting would be called.  They wanted to issue an annual report and I said I would have to consider that.  I think we were getting on fairly well.</P>
    <P>On that consultative council there are many doctors&mdash;a majority of doctors, as a matter of fact, and there is a good representation of the Irish Medical Association.  I want Deputies to be very clear that there is a great distinction between doctors and the Irish Medical Association.  As some Deputy reminded me here to-day, there are probably too many doctors on it.  One Deputy to-day gave his opinion of a consultative council when he said there should be doctors on it, dentists, chemists, nurses, and then representatives of employers and labour, and I think he said consumers and the local authorities.  I think that is quite right, they should all be represented&mdash;a lot of them are&mdash;and I mean to broaden the representation to bring in those not already represented on that council.  Employers and labour are not directly represented and I mean to have them included.  Then I think we will have a good representative council and can discuss these health matters as they arise.</P>
    <P>At any rate, while we were discussing these matters, when this consultative council was meeting and discussing various amendments to the Bill and when I thought the doctors on the council appeared to be getting more reasonable in their attitude&mdash;probably they say that I was getting more reasonable&mdash;it came as a bombshell to me to know that the Irish Medical Association had met and said they rejected the Bill entirely.  It is rather hard to know what I should do next. Members of the Medical Association were meeting me and discussing amendments, but the full Medical Association meets and says they will have no more to do with the Bill.  I do not know what to do with them. We are going to meet early in May and <Col N="1316" /> by that time I might see some light as to what is the best thing to do.</P>

      <P>The consultative council. I do not want anyone to think I am up against the medical profession.  Any time I met them we got on very well. I find them reasonably easy to get on with, but a strange thing is that when they meet as an association they seem to neutralise one another's common sense and one another's reasonableness and they become unreasonable and condemn anything in the way of a Health Bill or anything else.  It is a very serious thing to do.  I do not think Deputies have looked at this as they should.  Remember that the Dáil unanimously passed the Bill on Second Reading, yet this association comes along and says: &ldquo;We will fight it to the end&rdquo;.  If an ordinary trade union of manual workers did that, if they met and passed a resolution like that, that they would sabotage any Bill passed through the Dáil, you would have the doctors throughout the country saying &ldquo;Socialism&rdquo; and calling them Socialists. But these men, we are not to call them Socialists, we are to think that it is ethics in their case, not Socialism. If that were not so funny I would say it was serious, when they talk about ethics.</P>
      <P>I think that responsible Parties in the House&mdash;like Fine Gael, which is very responsible&mdash;should take a serious view and not take the side of these people.  They should say to these people that if the Dáil passes a Bill unanimously it is a very serious matter for a body of men to come along and say they will not have it.  If they were in certain countries, it would be called sabotage and they would not be seen any more.  We do not want the same thing done here, but it is a thing we should not have here, that sort of flouting of a Dáil decision by any body of responsible men; and I do not think a Party here should support them in that effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not too worried about the decision of the Irish Medical Association. It is a rather annoying thing <Col N="1317" /> when you have friends&mdash;and I have a lot of friends there&mdash;coming to you and trying to persuade you to put certain amendments in.  I hate refusing people.  I would be inclined to give in rather than refuse; but now I am under no obligation, we can go on with the Bill and see how we stand, as the Irish Medical Association is out of it and will not bother about this Bill any more.</P>
    <P>When I came back into this office early last year, the Irish Medical Association before very long boycotted some position which had been advertised and had been approved by me.  I was rather surprised, as I thought I was on good terms with them.  At a public gathering afterwards, I appealed to them and said: &ldquo;Do not do anything like that again, do not go boycotting but come and talk before you do anything drastic like that.&rdquo; They did not, they went on with the boycott; but, even so, men were appointed to the boycotted position.  They were good men, the best we could get&mdash;but what did the boycott amount to?  It amounted to this, that no responsible or eminent man in the profession would go on the selection board.  The local authority and the Department of Health had to try to supply men to these selection boards.  Maybe they were not as good or as eminent in the particular line that was being filled as you would find here in this city; so the only result we are going to get from the boycott is that we may sometimes not get as good a man because we have not the selection board for it; but we will get a man to fill the post and if they want to take responsibility for that, let them carry on the boycott.</P>
    <P>Is it not strange, as someone has said here, that Dr. Ward came along and brought in certain proposals and he was opposed by the Medical Association; Dr. Browne came along and he was opposed by the Medical Association; and now I come along and I am opposed also.  Well, we are not very similar types, the three of us are very different types, yet we meet with the same hostility from the Medical Association.  That is something the people should consider, that every <Col N="1318" /> single Minister, whatever his ideas may be, whatever his proposals may be, to whatever Party he belongs and whatever sort of fellow he is himself personally, meets with that hostility.</P>
    <P>I was over in London last week and I met some of my friends over there. Thinking I might get some indication as to why they were against the scheme over there, I asked: &ldquo;Why did you oppose your scheme?&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;We did not like it.&rdquo; One of them told me: &ldquo;88 per cent. voted against it, but we accepted it in the end because we had to.&rdquo; I asked: &ldquo;How is it working now?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;It is working fine.  We are making more money, but we have to pay more income-tax and that is the only difference.&rdquo; I do not know whether the doctors here are afraid of income-tax or not, but, at any rate, that is as far as they have gone on the other side.</P>
    <P>I have tried to deal with this matter by stating my position with regard to the Irish Medical Association.  I have no hostility to them, none whatever. I have never refused to meet them at any time.  They asked me to meet them.  As a matter of fact, as I told the House, I appealed to them often to come to see me to discuss the problems which were there so that there would be no such thing as boycotting. I am prepared to meet them if they want to discuss the matter, but if they say: &ldquo;We will oppose the Bill tooth and nail,&rdquo; and if they ask Deputies to oppose the Bill, there is no great hope that they will come to see me about the Bill.  But, if they change their minds, I am prepared to meet them and discuss whatever difficulties there may be.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have asked to have this Vote referred back.  I think that was on the point that I had not dealt as diplomatically as I should with the Irish Medical Association.  They have heard the whole story now.  If they vote against this Estimate, you all know why they did it.  They cannot do it because I have been unreasonable or because I have been wrong.  They can only do it because they want to get the support of the Irish Medical Association.</P>

      <P>I should like to add my voice to the appeal that has been made by other Deputies on behalf of the foresters concerned.  I should like to ask that these officers should have their date of establishment take effect as from the date they were appointed. This Bill provides that these foresters will be permanently established as from the date of the passing of the Bill. That, of course, is a measure of justice which is long overdue, but as these men have been serving the State faithfully for a long period and have given very useful and distinguished services it is only right that they should be regarded as permanent officials as from the date they were appointed.  Some of these men have now given long service.  Some of them, I understand, have passed 50 years of age and have not a very long time to serve in order to qualify for a pension.  In view of that, it would seem unfair not to permit them to have the advantages of this Bill over the entire period of their service.  Perhaps the Minister or the Minister for Finance may think it is unfair for Deputies to ask for additional concessions of this kind.  I know that the Bill itself is a concession to these officers.  Nevertheless, it will be appreciated that the additional cost <Col N="1321" /> involved will not take effect for a number of years, perhaps ten or 12 years.  We do not know whether the Minister will remain in office until then. Perhaps by that time a more responsible Opposition will have arisen which will enable him to hand over the responsibility.  In view of the injustice which these men have suffered, perhaps it is only an apparent injustice, inasmuch as the benefit of establishment will not come to them until they retire, it is only right that they should enjoy the status and the benefits of established officers for the period which they have served.</P>

      <P>These men are supposed to have a benefit conferred on them by being made established civil servants under Section 4.  What troubles me in regard to the senior men, men who have 20 or 30 years' service, is that I cannot see what benefit is conferred upon them because in a few years they will retire from the service and the superannuation they will get will be merely nominal.  I wonder does the Minister propose to make any special provision for the men who have 30, 25 or 20 years' service? Probably these men retire at a comparatively early age from the service and therefore they may have very few years to go.</P>
      <P>I cannot see that any benefit will be conferred on them by making them civil servants because in fact we are limiting their freedom to some extent. The moment they become civil servants they will be tied down by Civil Service regulations.  Some provision should be made for the older men in order to give them more superannuation or a bigger gratuity than that to which they will be entitled if they retire ten years hence. I take it the number affected is small but I would like the Minister to say something about these particular men when he is replying.</P>

      <P>I support the appeal made for retrospection in this matter. Three years ago the late Deputy Byrne who at the time represented Dublin North-West interviewed the then Minister with some of the foresters and one of the points he made was that if <Col N="1322" /> these men were established the date of such establishment should be made retrospective.  The present measure will only confer a benefit on new entrants if the Minister does not make the date of establishment retrospective in the case of the older men.  If they retire in 15 years these older men will have a very small pension.  When this State was first established, we had several unestablished teachers but our Government confirmed these in their posts and added some years of their unestablished service for pension purposes. I appeal to the Minister to do likewise in this instance.</P>

      <P>It is the intention that foresters who become established under the machinery provided by this Bill and whose establishment will date under the terms of the Bill from the date of enactment will be allowed to reckon half their previous unestablished service for pension purposes subject to the fulfilment of the various standard conditions that service must have been continuous, health satisfactory, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point made about foresters over 50 years of age, I do not know whether Deputies are aware that the age limit in the case of the establishment of unestablished public servants is now 55.  The intention is that half the previous service, together with whatever future service the officers will give, will be pensionable, but the total years of service must be at least ten. I do not think any case will arise in which existing officers will have less than ten years' service.  According to the statement I have here, most of these officers have fairly long service: 14 officers have service of at least 40 years; 59 have service of between 35 and 40 years; 30 have between 30 and 35 years; 26 have between 25 and 30 years; six have between 20 and 25 years; two have between 15 and 20 years, and 4 have between 10 and 15 years.  The great majority have fairly <Col N="1323" /> substantial service and quite a number will be getting practically the full pension.</P>
    <P>From the figures I have given the House will see that only a very small number have comparatively short service. I would have liked to give effect to the full service for all foresters, but that is not possible because there have been other cases in which established status has been granted to unestablished public servants and the practice has been to give not more than half the unestablished service.  If we were to go further than that in the present instance a precedent would be created and that would have repercussions in other branches of the service. I am afraid it is not possible to achieve more than has been secured. I think the position is fairly satisfactory because all the officers, as far as I am aware, will be eligible to become pensionable, and in calculating that pension half their previous unestablished service will be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cunningham raised a question about trainees.  The age limits of trainees are from 18 to 22.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill modifies and extends existing provisions of the Land Purchase Acts without introducing any new basic principles.  Its main purpose is to authorise the creation of land bonds bearing a higher rate of interest than 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Land Bond Act, 1934, which authorised the Minister for Finance to create series of land bonds, required him to have regard to Stock Exchange quotations with a view to fixing a rate of interest which would secure that the market price of the bonds of each series would be at or near par for a reasonable time after creation of the series; at the same time it prescribed a maximum rate of 4 per cent. interest. The Bill proposes to delete that interest limitation and thus permit land bonds to be created which will bear a higher rate of interest than 4 per cent. whenever that course is necessary to maintain their market price at or near par for a reasonable time after their creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the first questions that arise is what rate of interest will newly created land bonds bear after the Bill becomes law.  The answer is that the rate will be fixed by the Minister for <Col N="1326" /> Finance in the Order creating the bonds.  However, the Minister will not be in a position to come to a final decision on the rate until the Bill is enacted and he is about to make the Order, which will then be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Land Bond Act, 1934, also placed a limit on the total amount of land bonds to be created under that Act. The limit of £10,000,000 was adopted when the price of land was very much lower than it is to-day.  Of that amount there is a balance of more than £3,000,000 still available which would enable land purchase to be financed for some years to come, but it is clear that the balance will not be sufficient to complete the acquisition of land for the relief of congestion.  The present opportunity is, therefore, taken to raise the limit by a further £5,000,000.  It would, of course, be possible to delete the limit altogether and give, so to speak, a blank cheque for this important work.  It seems preferable, however, that the House should have another opportunity of reviewing the position before the figure of £15,000,000 is exceeded.  To avoid any possibility of confusion perhaps I should say that all the figures I have mentioned relate to land bonds created under the Land Bond Act, 1934.  In addition, 4½ per cent. land bonds issued since 1923 total approximately £26,000,000 of which less than £1,000,000 are 4½ per cent. new land bonds issued under the Land Bond Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>Since 1923 the rate of annuity for repayment of advances has been 4¾ per cent.  The interest element has varied &mdash;according to the particular issue of land bonds&mdash;from 4½ per cent. to 3 per cent and the balance of ¼ per cent. to 1¾ per cent. has represented sinking fund in repayment of principal.  To cover interest and sinking fund for future land bonds it is necessary to provide for the possibility of a higher rate of annuity; this entails adaptation of existing statutory references to the rate of 4¾ per cent.  The Bill effects the required adaptation and other consequential amendments.  The annuity rate will continue to be fixed by the Land Bond Order creating each series of land bonds and will apply to lands <Col N="1327" /> purchased by means of bonds of that series; the halving of new annuities under the Land Act, 1933, will also continue.  The provisions of the Bill do not in any way affect annuities already set up.</P>
    <P>The House will recollect a Land Bill introduced by Deputy Blowick last year and withdrawn on my undertaking to provide for the matter in a Government Bill.  The necessary provision is in Section 7 of the present Bill.  The Land Act, 1950, which was introduced on 19th July, 1949, laid down market value as the basis of the price of untenanted land, and it was amended on Committee Stage to provide for redetermination of prices fixed before the passing of that Act in cases where the Land Commission had not taken possession of the land before the 1st December, 1949.  The period of six months allowed for lodgment of applications for redetermination expired on 19th December, 1950.  It is felt that this period was rather short and may have caused hardship in some cases.  The Bill therefore proposes to give eligible persons a further opportunity of making applications which, for one reason or another, they failed to make within the time originally allowed.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are matters of detail and consist largely of amendments to remedy drafting imperfections in previous Land Acts. I do not think that there is any general comment I can usefully make on them at this stage beyond saying that experience has shown them to be desirable.  If necessary we can go into them more fully on the Committee Stage; they are explained in some detail in the White Paper which was circulated with the Bill.  Four of these sections (Nos. 8, 10, 11 and 18) relate to holdings resumed from tenants&mdash;as distinct from untenanted land acquired from owners-and are designed to secure uniformity of procedure. Another section (No. 13) proposes to facilitate the completion of legal formalities after rearrangement of holdings.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Bill is difficult to follow because of the many references <Col N="1328" /> to provisions of existing Acts but it is no different unfortunately from its predecessors in this respect.  I hope that the explanatory memorandum has been of some assistance to Deputies.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to stress the urgency of the land bond provisions of the Bill.  Since the 1st January last there have been no land bonds available to enable prices to be agreed upon or fixed for lands which the Land Commission propose to acquire.  I am sure most Deputies share my desire that the land settlement programme should not be retarded, and I confidently urge that the Bill be enacted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with a Bill like this it is pleasant to be able to thank the Minister for the courtesy he has shown us not merely in circulating a White Paper with the Bill but also circulating a copy of the speech he has delivered in introducing it.  It is a courtesy which would be appreciated from other Ministers on other Bills.</P>
      <P>In spite of the Minister's courtesy and his desire to be helpful, I think he realises himself that this Bill is extremely difficult to understand. Without meaning in any way insultingly, it could easily be described as a Bill of shreds and patches because it deals with all sorts of different things without any really coherent line running through them.  For that reason it is a Bill that can be discussed in a more full and ample way on the Committee Stage rather than on the Second Reading.  There are, however, some points which arise and which might perhaps be considered as Committee points, but which I would mention for the purpose of having them on the record and for the purpose of giving the Minister an opportunity during the Recess of looking into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of his speech the Minister refers to the fact that since 1st January last there have been no land bonds available.  I do not quite understand that statement, in view of the fact that in the beginning of his speech he says there is still a margin of £3,000,000, unless it means that prior to the 31st December last the bonds <Col N="1329" /> that were already issued when the last Order was made by the Minister for Finance have become exhausted and that pending the enactment of this measure the Minister for Finance does not want to make any new Order creating bonds.  If that is the explanation then, of course, I can quite understand it.  But I do not quite understand how, if there have been no bonds available since 1st January last there have been provisional prices fixed since 1st January last.  The Minister is aware that I am interested in a case in which the appointed day was fixed as 29th January and, as I pointed out in a memorandum I sent to him dealing with that case, the purchase price was provisionally fixed as of the 29th January in 4 per cent. bonds.  I cannot understand how it was so fixed on the 29th January if, as the Minister states in the concluding paragraph of his speech, there were no bonds available since 1st January last.</P>
    <P>The main point of the beginning of this measure is to bring the price of land bonds more into keeping with par value.  Consequent upon the monetary policy of the Government, the price of national loans has been fixed more or less on a 5 per cent.  basis, and the effect of that has been that the price of 4 per cent. land bonds is at present in or around 87 per cent.  That means, in fact, that any person from whom land is acquired and who is allocated these bonds by the Land Commission, if he is forced to sell through stress of financial circumstances when he gets the bonds, he loses £13 for every £100 of the price that had been paid to him for his land.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious loss, indeed, and the Minister is perfectly right in bringing in now a Bill, one of the functions of which is to eliminate a large portion, at any rate, of that loss and one of the functions of which will be to ensure that, in the future, when people are being paid in land bonds, they will be paid in bonds which will have a value more or less equivalent to the nominal price at which those bonds were granted by the judicial commissioners in exchange for the market value of the land fixed by the Land Commission Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> There is very great difficulty in respect of the date of the operation of the Act.  I might say, in passing, that one of the things that is indispensable about this Bill is that it refers back so much, that it has so many retrospective and retroactive provisions.  In the last sub-section of Section 4, it is deemed to have come into operation on the passing of the Land Bond Act, 1934.  In the last sub-section of Section 5 it is deemed to have come into operation on the passing of the Land Act, 1933.  There are other similar provisions such as in Section 16, where it is deemed to have come into operation on the passing of the Land Act, 1931, and again in Section 18, where it is deemed to have come into operation on the passing of the Land Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree with me that it is bad to be put into the position of having to come into this House and to bring in legislation which incorporates on its face retrospective provisions of that sort.  It means that the drafting of these earlier Acts left a little to be desired inasmuch as it is clear that the draftsmen then and this House-because we must also accept responsibility for the Act that went through-did not carry into words the intentions of the particular time.</P>
    <P>I want to put to the Minister another specific point in respect to Section 14.  This Bill by Section 1 has to be construed as one with the Land Purchase Acts and to be cited with those Acts.  The title of the Bill is &ldquo;an Act to amend and extend the Land Purchase Acts&rdquo;, but Section 14 does not do that.  Section 14 extends, interprets or amends-whatever word you like to use&mdash;the Registration of Titles Acts, 1891 and 1942.  I want to point out to the Minister that at least there is a case to be argued that Section 14 is outside the scope of the title of this Bill and outside the construction of the Bill, as set out in Section 1.  I should like to refer the Minister to Section 79 of the Land Act of 1923 in which it was stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the Land Act, 1923, and shall be construed as one with the Land Law <Col N="1331" /> Acts, the Land Purchase Acts and the Congested Districts Board (Ireland) Acts, and may be cited with those Acts."</P>
    <P>There was an Act which was to amend the Land Purchase Acts primarily, but it was appreciated that that, in addition to amending the Land Purchase Acts primarily it was also amending other Acts and that it was in consequence proper to ensure that there would be a reference in the citation to these other Acts.  Here we have in Section 14 an amendment in effect of the Registration of Titles Acts of 1891 and 1942.  I appreciate fully that the wording of Section 14 sets out that the powers of a limited administrator are for the purpose of proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts but I think the Minister will find, if he goes into the matter more fully, that proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts, if it were not for this section, would be deemed to end with the vesting under the Land Purchase Acts which transfers the land in question under the provisions of the Registration of Title Acts of 1891 and 1942.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear to the Minister that I am not arguing at all on the merits or demerits of whether it is wise to give these powers to a limited administrator.  My own view is that it is a wise thing to give these powers and that a limited administrator is appointed in 99 cases out of 100 to save a small farmer the very great expense of probably not one, but two or three grants of administration. Probably it is given in cases in which there would be more than one grant to be taken out.  I know of one case in which, if a limited administrator had not been appointed, there would have been four different deaths in respect of which the person in occupation would have to administer and the cost involved would have been very considerable.</P>
    <P>Power to appoint a limited administrator is, therefore, a wise power from the point of view of saving expense but I do not think that the way in which it is done here is quite the correct way.  I think we should consider the whole scope of this Bill as <Col N="1332" /> being one which is analogous to the Registration of Title Acts, 1891, and 1942 and construe it with them or make some reference to it at any rate in the citation in Section 1 or perhaps deal with the matter under a section of the Registration of Title Acts.  I have considerable doubt as to whether the power contained in Section 14 of this Bill, as drafted at present, is not one that might not be upset at a later stage if somebody desired to test it.  I think the Minister would be well advised to ensure between this and the Committee Stage that it is not a question that will be left open to any query in future.</P>
    <P>The Minister when he was introducing the Bill made the apology-usual, I think, for all Ministers for Lands when bringing in a Land Bill-that it is extremely difficult to follow, and that it is legislating by reference to a very large degree.  It is, of course.  I think if one were to go through all the sections of this Bill and to understand what they are about, one would have to look up also the Land Act of 1903, the Land Act of 1909, the Land Act of 1923, the Land Act of 1927, the Land Act of 1929, the Land Act of 1931, the Land Act of 1933, the Land Bond Act of 1934, the Land Act of 1936, the Land Act of 1939 and the Land Act of 1950.  I think there is another Land Bond Act, that of 1929 also mentioned in it.  There are certainly references as well to the Registration of Title Act, 1891, and the Registration of Title Act, 1942.</P>
    <P>I should not mind making a small wager with the Minister that when we had looked at the number of sections in these Acts to which reference is made by this Bill, we would find that they referred it back to the Land Acts of 1881 and 1895 and many other Acts.  That only emphasises that the position in relation to land purchase legislation becomes more and more chaotic every year.  Every Bill is another little bit added on to the patchwork quilt.  The argument always has been, before adding an extra patch, that it was not worth while doing anything to this patchwork quilt in the way of consolidation or codification because the Land Commission was <Col N="1333" /> reaching almost the end of its tether, and that by the time codification could be completed it would have ceased to exist or ceased to function.</P>

      <P>The Minister has blown that argument skyhigh by advancing the limit for the issue of land bonds from £10,000,000 by another 50 per cent. to £15,000,000.  In the 19 years that have passed since 1934 land bonds to the tune of approximately £7,000,000 have been issued.</P>
      <P>He is asking now for permission to issue bonds up to £15,000,000, so that, taking it on the same basis, the Land Commission is going to be in existence for at least another 20 years, even on the Minister's own computation.  We all know, of course, that it will be there for a considerably longer period, and that it will be necessary for a long time to come to refer to the Land Purchase Acts.  Because the Minister has himself swept away the argument that many of his predecessors, who came from different political Parties, put forward that it was not worth while consolidating the Land Acts, I hope he will, in the future, use with the parliamentary draftsman and the section of the Attorney-General's office which deals with the consolidation of law, his best endeavours and his most persuasive influence to ensure that, by the time the next Land Act comes in, it will be one which will simplify the mass of law which, quite frankly, would befog anyone who tried to disentangle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is one which we will consider in greater detail on the Committee Stage, because it is one which deals with a very great number of different matters, rather than with one overriding principle, as is normally the case.  We will then have an opportunity of going into these highly technical matters.  I do not want to weary the House by repeating the details of the hardships and injustices of the cases set out in the memorandum I submitted to the Minister, but I hope that, by the time the Committee Stage comes, I shall be able to add to the compliment I paid to him to-day for <Col N="1334" /> his courtesy in giving us a copy of his speech, a compliment for his courtesy in giving me the amendment for which I have asked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Sweetman, I compliment the Minister on providing us with a copy of his speech.  I wish the practice were more widespread amongst other Ministers.  The Bill brings home to Deputies the absolute necessity for a codification of the Land Acts.  It was one of the things I had hoped to reach, but it is a pretty stiff undertaking.  Nevertheless, down through the years, many sections of these Land Acts have become unnecessary. They have fallen into disuse and should be cut out, and, while I have no doubt that the new Bill which would emerge would be a fairly stupendous document, it would be well worth the time and expense involved in bringing the whole thing up to date.  It will take some time, but I ask the Minister, in view of the references in this Bill, which, of necessity, must appear in every Land Bill, to start this work of codification as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see two features in this Bill.  The first is the amendment of the position with regard to the discrepancy which existed, a discrepancy which caused a good deal of heart-burning amongst those whose lands were acquired, untenanted lands, by the Land Commission, between the apparent face value of the land bonds issued and their market value, if the former land owner proceeded to convert them into cash.  Deputy Sweetman quoted the figure of 87, which means that the vendor of land to the Land Commission lost approximately £13 per £100. That is a matter for which the Minister cannot be blamed and he is to be congratulated on setting the position right now. When the Committee Stage comes along, we shall be asking him to push back the operation of this provision to include some of those whose lands have been acquired for some time past.  I hope the Minister will not object to some little retrospective effect in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It probably would not be in order for any member of the House, other than a Minister, to table such an amendment, <Col N="1335" /> and, if that be the case, I ask the Minister to consider it.  In the case of the 1950 Act, where there was a similar basic departure from practice in the case of Section 5, it was made retrospective, and with very beneficial effects.  It was a matter which contributed in great measure to bringing the Land Commission into disrepute amongst the people whose lands were likely to be acquired and it was a cause of the hostility that people felt towards the Land Commission&mdash;the fact that the market value of the land bonds was below the face value at which they were issued.  I am glad that that matter is being set right.</P>
    <P>I want to say also that I am deeply grateful for Section 7 of this Bill, which gives people a further period of six months in which to have the price of their lands redetermined-those people who, through their own fault or through the fault of their solicitors or advisers, failed to take advantage of Section 5.  In reply to a question of mine this time last year, the Minister revealed that, whereas about 93 people would benefit by sub-section (2) of Section 5, only 23 were sufficiently wide awake to their own interests to have the price of their land redetermined, and it is astonishing to me, in view of all the publicity the Act got while it was passing through the House-it got sufficient publicity to bring home to people the advantages of the section&mdash; how anybody could have failed to realise the advantages that lay in the section.  I hope they will not go to sleep for the extended period of six months which this Bill gives them.</P>
    <P>A good deal of the Bill consists of necessary amendments.  Some Deputies may take the view that draftsmen and civil servants generally should turn out the perfect Bill on all occasions, but that is not humanly possible, because, even with the most scrupulous attention and the greatest care and thought in regard to the framing and wording of a Bill, legal men will discover loopholes when the Bill comes to be administered.  No Bill has yet been found watertight, and I think it was Daniel O'Connell who said on one occasion that there was no Act of Parliament ever drafted that he could not <Col N="1336" /> drive a coach-and-four through.  That holds good to-day, and it will hold good while human nature is what it is.</P>
    <P>Some of the amendments in the Bill go back quite a while, and I would go so far as to say that some of them should have been embodied in the Land Act of 1950.  For the fact that they were not, I accept a certain amount of blame, for the reason that, when the Bill was being drafted.  I admit to having been a little impatient to get on with the basic changes the 1950 Act brought about.  I am afraid that some of the numerous amendments proposed in this Bill were known to the officials of the Land Commission prior to the drafting of the 1950 Act.  Some of the amendments in the Bill now before the House would have been inserted in the 1950 Act were it not that in my impatience to go on with the 1950 Bill I told the officials not to draft the amendments but to proceed with the basic principles I desired to see enshrined in the Bill at that time.</P>
    <P>Let us examine some of the changes proposed in this Bill.  In the first place, I fail to understand why the Minister in one part of his opening speech refers to the fact that no land bonds were available since last January while in another part he states that £3,000,000 is still available of the £10,000,000.  Candidly, I do not understand that and I would like the Minister when he is replying, to tell me how he can reconcile those statements.</P>
    <P>Sub-sections (3), (4) and (5) of Section 2 puzzle me.  The White Paper says that Section 2 envisages the fixation of higher rate of annuity.  In that section also the Minister for Finance is given a certain power.  An examination of Section 12 of the 1950 Act will reveal that the excepted matters therein mentioned are the same as those in the 1933 Act.  Paragraph (h) sub-section (1) of Section 12 of the 1950 Act says: &ldquo;the determination of the amount of any standard purchase annuity&rdquo; is an excepted matter.  Paragraph (e) of the same sub-section says: &ldquo;The determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme) of the persons to be selected as allottees of any land&rdquo; is an excepted matter. Section 2 of this Bill, strange to relate, <Col N="1337" /> gives powers to the Minister for Finance to increase the annuity on lands that will be purchased under this particular Act.</P>
    <P>Sub-section 5 of Section 2 of the 1952 Bill states:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where any land which is not subject to a purchase annuity or annual sum equivalent to a purchase annuity is vested in the Land Commission under Section 28 or Section 30 of the Land Act, 1950, any advance made by the Land Commission to a purchaser of such land or any part thereof shall be repaid by means of a purchase annuity calculated at such a rate as the Minister for Finance directs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Regardless of the mention of Sections 28 and 30 of the Land Act, 1950, under these sections the Minister for Finance had no power or authority to interfere, good, bad or indifferent, with the fixation of the annuity on any land.  Sub-section (6) of Section 2 of this Bill states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where after the passing of this Act additional land bonds are issued in consequence of an increase in any standard purchase annuity or land bonds are lodged pursuant to paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) of Section 15 of the Land Act, 1931, such land bonds shall bear the same rate of interest as the land bonds originally issued to the credit of the relevant estate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The White Paper says that Section 10 of the Land Act, 1950 gives similar power to the Minister for Finance not the Minister for Lands.  I submit that is not so.  Section 10 of the 1950 Act gives power to the Minister for Finance to dispose of the annuity as he thinks fit but it does not empower him to fix it.  It will be remembered that Section (6) of the 1933 Act became Section 12 of the 1950 Act and an additional number of excepted matters was added.  The fixation of the annuity and the fixing of the price at which land should be resold to any allottee are absolutely excepted matters under Section 12 of the 1950 Act.  While Section 12 of the Bill proposes to give powers to the Minister for Finance to encroach upon these excepted matters, <Col N="1338" /> there is not one single word about the repeal of Section 12 of the 1950 Act.</P>
    <P>With regard to increasing the annuity, if we are going to give the market value to those whose lands are acquired and if we are going to say now that those who received land bonds for their land will not have to sell them at a lower price and thus realise a lower price in cash than the Land Commission or Appeal Tribunal fixed the price of the land at, the argument of the Department of Finance will be that it is necessary to increase the annuity.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Minister what happened prior to 1933.  At that time a vast amount of arrears began to build up in the Land Commission. That was due to the fact that annuities, even before we got our freedom, had been fixed at too high a rate with the result that many vested owners and tenants found themselves unable to meet the annuity.  For that reason, it became necessary to revise the whole system.  The annuities were halved and this saved what in my opinion would otherwise have been a very serious situation as all the annuities might have become uncollectable.  There was a vast amount of arrears and £4,000,000 was funded on to existing annuities all over the country under the 1933 Act. If we depart from that it will be a step in the wrong direction.  It would have the effect of discouraging migrants in particular who would take holdings purchased under the bonds created under this Act.  Migration is the key to the solution by the Land Commission of one of our remaining outstanding problems-the relieving of congestion.</P>
    <P>During my term of office the migrants grumbled at the stiff annuity they were asked to pay and when this Bill becomes law there will be much more grumbling.  There is a certain amount of prosperity among the members of the agricultural community at the moment.  Hence, we hear very few grumbles.  The lesson that was learned from the period prior to 1933 was that the amount of the annuity should be fixed at such a figure that the tenant or annuitant would be able to pay it.</P>
    <P>We can all pay our debts when things <Col N="1339" /> are going well with us, but we should see to it that the Land Commission is left with the power and authority to ensure that the annuities are at such a figure that the landholder or the landowner as the case may be is able to meet the payment of the annuity together with his other costs, such as the payment of rates, purchase of seeds, to meet losses that he may incur and other charges.  He should be left in the position that he will be able to pay it in a bad year.  If he is, he will surely be able pay it in a good year. I suggest that there is no other safe basis on which to fix the annuity.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this problem is so pressing in the case of additions to holdings for the reason that the land is always resold to allottees at a reasonable price.  Very often, most of it lies in areas where the price of land is not very high.  I have never heard any complaints from those who have received enlargements to uneconomic holdings or from those who have got a rearranged holding.  The danger, in this department, in my opinion, is to migrants, because if we discourage or damp down on the migrant question then the Land Commission can fold up its tents and silently steal away like the Arabs in the night.  If there is any close down on the migrant question, the work of the Land Commission comes to an end.</P>
    <P>I would like to impress on the Minister that this question of increasing the annuity is fraught with danger.  I have no hesitation in saying that it will contribute largely to putting an end to the work of the Land Commission. I want to say that during my period in office, and since, the Land Commission have made great strides in relieving congestion.  They have cleared up area after area in a splendid way, in a way that I feel proud of.</P>
    <P>I well remember the occasion when I first came to the House to move an Estimate for the Land Commission. The present Minister was then sitting on this side, and he was, I think, inclined to have a good laugh at me when, in the course of my speech introducing the Estimate, I held out the hope of finality to the work of the <Col N="1340" /> Land Commission.  I expressed the hope that it would end some day.  I imagine that the Minister would be prepared to change his mind now and admit that in what I said then I was nearer the mark than he was when he derided me for holding out any hope that the work of the Land Commission would come to an end.  The sooner it does come to an end the better the tenants in the congested areas will like it.</P>
    <P>We must admit that there are many estates, particularly in the congested areas, still awaiting division.  I know of one myself.  It was purchased 43 years ago from the landlord and very little has been done on it since.  The conditions of the tenants living on it are almost as bad as they were when their predecessors lived under the rule of the landlord.  I am glad, however, to say that the work of the Land Commission is progressing rapidly.  At the same time, you have people such as those who live on that estate who have long been expecting relief and are still waiting for it.</P>
    <P>A certain type of land would appear to be envisaged under Section 5.  Does the Minister expect that a lot of it will be handled by the Land Commission? I myself would not think so.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 8, it would appear to me that here the Land Commission are seeking powers which they have got already.  In fact, it might not be good for the commissioners to have these powers.  I can visualise cases arising under this section of which we have an example at the present time in my county.  This is a case in which the commissioners have made an order to resume possession of a small holding in a rundale townland from a person whom I will describe as &ldquo;X.&rdquo; That person purported to be the owner and occupier.  The Land Commission refused an objection which was lodged in that particular case.  It later transpired that &ldquo;X&rdquo; was not the owner at all.</P>
    <P>I mention that case for the purpose of supporting my view that the giving of the powers set out in this section could lead to injustice.  The Land Commission could perpetrate an injust ice, but in very few cases I will admit. <Col N="1341" /> The point I am making is that a miscarriage of justice could easily take place-that is to say, that a person's property could be taken from him without that person ever getting the chance of lodging a petition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>What was done by the commissioners in the case you refer to was illegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It was and it was not; because the commissioners proceeded against &ldquo;X.&rdquo;&ldquo;X&rdquo; claimed to be the full owner.  The position was that the commissioners at the time did not know of the existence of a third party who was the real owner.  I think I am safe in saying that, in that case, evidence was deliberately concealed from the commissioners, and for that reason they were not to blame.  There was a person who refused to tender certain evidence which was in his possession so that there were more than the commissioners to blame for the decision in that case.</P>
      <P>Section 17 deals with certain types of cases very few of which we have at the present time in the country.  The section reads:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 19 of the Land Act, 1933, is hereby amended by the deletion in sub-section (2) of &lsquo;to an owner of land for the repurchase of such land otherwise than under Section 11 of the Land Act, 1927&rsquo; and the substitution therefor of &lsquo;consequent upon an application for an advance for the repurchase of land otherwise than under Section 11 of the Land Act, 1927, and whether made to the applicant therefor or' to any other person&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Could not the circumstances change in cases of this kind?  Is it not possible that such land would change hands and pass to a direct descendant, let us say, of the owner who was not entitled to revision or to another person if it were sold on the open market?  Could not circumstances so change that it would not be wise for the commissioners to find themselves copper-fastened by the powers they are seeking here?  I do not think they require those powers.  They have ample powers already under previous Acts to deal with all these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1342" /> I admit that certain people, only a few, took a mean advantage of the provisions of the 1933 Act to benefit by the halving of annuities who were definitely not entitled to do so.  There is the other side of the picture&mdash;where circumstances may change to such an extent that it would be wise for the commissioners to have discretion and to use that discretion to the best advantage. I put that point of view to the Minister for consideration.  If Section 17 of this Bill goes through, the commissioners would have no option but to exclude all cases.  While I sympathise to a great extent with the object of the section, we may be just getting rid of one evil and creating one just as bad.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister when replying to tell us if Section 17 is really needed, and if any cases have been brought to the notice of the Land Commission where the circumstances changed in regard to the owner or the nature or user of the land, the locality in which the land is situated.  If the section becomes law the commissioners might be prevented from giving an advantage to some person who would definitely be entitled to it.</P>
    <P>I would impress on the Minister the necessity to think twice about increasing the annuity.  I do not like to see the Minister for Finance having power to determine the rate of annuity.  I would consider it bad enough if the Minister for Lands had the power.  That is a very serious departure.  It is in direct conflict with Section 12 of the 1950 Act and, if the 1950 Act had never been brought into this House, it would have been in conflict with Section 6 of the 1933 Act.  The Minister for Finance should not have this power.  That is a matter that should be left absolutely to the discretion of the commissioners. Many times we blame the commissioners for not doing something they should do or for doing something they should not do but the fixation of the annuity should be left to them.  The commissioners have learned many bitter lessons by experience and from the collection of annuities.  Having spent three and a half years in the Land Commission, studying the matter from the bottom up, I came to the conclusion that the fixation of the annuity <Col N="1343" /> was perfectly safe in the commissioners' hands and would not be safe in any other hands, no matter how well intentioned the person might be.  I ask the Minister to consider the whole matter.</P>
    <P>Section 15 gives greater power for the collection of arrears and costs. There again I was under the impression that the commissioners had ample powers under existing legislation to deal with any cases that might arise. I do not know of any cases where evasion could occur, even evasion of payment of costs.  At present the arrears of annuities are infinitesimal. People have always honoured their obligations in that matter.  They have paid their annuities to the Land Commission and their rates to the local authority.  It is almost a religion with them.  It does not help in cases like this to put on the screws.  They accept their obligations cheerfully at the moment but if the screws are put on they may begin to regard them as irksome and as a yoke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with considerable difficulty that I am trying to follow the implications of some sections of this particular Bill.  That is nothing new in connection with the land code.  There is one matter that is giving a considerable amount of worry to some of my colleagues throughout the country.  It is the question as to whether and how the higher interest bearing bonds concerned in this Bill will come to operate in the case of people whose lands have been taken over for some considerable time.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough when he is replying to indicate whether people whose lands have been taken by the Land Commission and have been in the hands of the Land Commission for some years and who have not yet got compensation will be entitled under this Bill to the higher rate of interest and whether that will be retrospective to the time when the Land Commission took possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is quite a number of people concerned.  There are many people whose lands have been acquired by the Land Commission for a considerable time and who, perhaps because of some difficulties in connection with the title. <Col N="1344" /> have not yet received compensation or payment.  The lands have been in the use of the Land Commission.  They have been sublet by the Land Commission or have been rearranged.  Yet, the people concerned are without their money.  In justice and fair play these people should be entitled to the higher rate of interest on whatever purchase money has been fixed either by the Land Court or by agreement, where it has not yet been paid.</P>
    <P>I would refer the House and the Minister to Section 10 of the Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where the resumption price of a holding or part of a holding has been or is lodged (whether before or after the passing of this Act) in cash to the credit of the relevant matter before the Land Commission have got or get possession of the holding or part, the Land Commission shall be entitled to be paid out of the resumption price (including any interest thereon) on the allocation thereof-</P>
    <P>(a)  all costs and expenses incurred by the Land Commission in getting possession (whether before or after the date of the lodgment) of the holding or part, and</P>
    <P>(b) interest, at such rate, not exceeding 6 per cent. per annum, as the Minister for Finance directs, on the resumption price from the date of the lodgment to the date on which the Land Commission got or get possession of the holding or part.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an indication in sub-section (b) that the Land Commission will be looking for and will be deducting from the resumption price a rate of 6 per cent.  If the Land Commission will do that on the allocation of any of these moneys, there is no reason why the people from whom the land was taken should not be entitled to an equal rate for their money since the date on which their lands were taken by the Land Commission.  What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  If the Land Commission are entitled to 6 per cent, so also are the people from whom the land was taken in respect of the purchase money for their land.</P>
    <P>Possibly the Minister may be able to clarify the position under this Bill <Col N="1345" /> and indicate whether it is his intention, in respect of people whose lands have been acquired for some time and who have not yet been paid, to make the Bill retrospective to the time the Land Commission got possession of the lands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not it only in the case where the owner of the land puts the Land Commission to expense?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  Under this particular section, as I read it, they are entitled to deduct any costs or expenses that the owner of the land puts them to.  They are also entitled under this sub-section (b) to interest at such a rate not exceeding 6 per cent per annum as the Minister for Finance directs, on the resumption price from the date of the lodgment to the date on which the Land Commission got or get possession of the land.  They lay down their pound of flesh under this section and that is an indication of what the owner of land will get.  There is no trouble when the price is fixed and if it has not been paid he should collect interest from that time to whenever that money is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have the optimism expressed by Deputy Blowick to-night as to when the Land Commission's work might finish.  I entirely disagree with him, unfortunately, in the view he expressed as to there being finality or as to our being within sight of finality in the Land Commission's work in dealing with the congested areas.  I think, rightly or wrongly, that until the responsibility is placed by this House four-square on the shoulders of the Minister for Lands, and not on the Land Commission, until we have someone here in the House responsible for the operations of the back-room boys in that Department, we will never be in sight of finality in the work of the Land Commission.  We are fooling nobody but ourselves if we think that. Under the law as it is, we have a Minister here in the House simply as a buffer between this House and the officials of the Land Commission, to whom statutory powers have been given, though we have no control over them. Until we reach the day when we place final responsibility on a Minister in this <Col N="1346" /> House, we are wasting our time talking about the finality of the work.</P>
    <P>There is another point, and I have the opportunity of dealing with it to-night because there is an amendment in this Bill to the 1950 Act, as to what treatment we can expect under land legislation in this House.  The House may be misled when certain sections of Land Commission legislation go through.  I have a very distinct recollection of the time when, during 1950, Deputy Blowick was introducing the 1950 Bill and certain powers were taken under it that were not formerly given to the Land Commission, in respect of people who had worked on estates that were being acquired by the Land Commission.  The former practice was that these people were given farms or compensation.  They were people who had worked as herds or labourers on land which was acquired and who lost their livelihood as a result of the Land Commission's operations.  This House, in its wisdom, gave to Deputy Blowick, who moved that Bill, power to insert a section saying that for the future the Land Commission would be empowered to pay these people rather than give them land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>That section says, I am sure-the Deputy has it there-that the Land Commission may in their discretion make payments to those people. It was my very sad lot recently to come across a case under that particular section in respect of an estate which Deputy Blowick knows very well, an estate in the village of Ballyheane outside Castlebar, where there was an unfortunate deaf mute working as a herd.  He was 60 years of age when that estate was acquired by the Land Commission.  That man of 60 enjoyed an income of £30 a year as a herd but the Land Commission offered him £12 as compensation for disturbance of his employment.  This man, a deaf mute, has to go into the county home in Castlebar with his lump sum of £12 under that particular section of the 1950 Act.</P>

      <P>I think that was the case.  The then Minister, in all good faith, said that a situation like this would never arise.  We are discussing the amendment here of the 1950 Act and I am pointing out how far one can trust the backroom boys of the Land Commission, who when it pleases them&mdash;as in the unfortunate case of this man&mdash; may use this power.  This man is of no use for the labour market and is shifted into the county home, with the munificent sum of £12 as his entire compensation for his work as a herd all his life.  So, when we come to give any other powers to the backroom boys of the Land Commission, I for one will think twice before I vote here for it and I will think twice before I let some of these sections go through this House when it comes to the Committee Stage of this Bill, or before I give any discretion to the backroom boys of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>There is one matter to which I wish to refer before I sit down.  If a lot of these people over here in Merrion Street were operating from some other part of the State, we would have much more effective work done.  I see no reason in the world why the A. and R. (F) branch, or the section dealing with resettlement of congested areas, or the division of land down the country, should not be located in the place where the job is to be done. They should not be sitting in Merrion Street, waiting for schemes to come from the West of Ireland from the congested areas, allowing them to gather dust and cobwebs for a couple of years and then sending them down again.</P>
      <P>Section 13 (2) says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of any land which has, whether before or after the passing <Col N="1348" /> of this Act, been rearranged by the Land Commission or of which the Land Commission have, whether before or after such passing, become the registered owners, the Land Commission shall be entitled to publish a vesting order under Section 28 of the Land Act, 1931, in respect of such land or any part thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before the Land Commission up here discovers that such lands are down there it takes a couple of years.  They do not know that.  You have the absurd position of some of these sections of the Irish Land Commission, vitally affecting the economies of the congested areas, up here in Dublin, as far as possible from the centre of operations.  I think that system is all wrong.  The sooner this House takes power to rectify that, the sooner will we make more progress&mdash;if we are ever going to make any progress in solving the problems of the congested areas.</P>
    <P>Instead of these gentlemen being up here they should be down there.  If that were done many years ago we would not be discussing this matter to-night; we would not be still in the position that we cannot see any question of finally solving the problems of the congested areas.  That is due to the way the administration of the Land Commission is being worked, for which this House must take ultimate responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is a number of matters in this particular Bill which I hope to deal with on the Committee Stage.  I do not intend to take up the time of the House to-night except, in particular, to ask the Minister to tell us when he is replying as to what his attitude is going to be about the people still waiting to be paid from the Land Commission and as to what they are going to get on their money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the 1930 Land Act was being defeated by reason of the fact that the land bonds were quoted at 86 and the former owners of the land did not get 100 per cent. payment. That Act was designed to enable the Land Commission to pay the market value of the land acquired. Many people who wanted cash only got <Col N="1349" /> bonds and instead of bonds at par they got bonds at 86, and on these interest payable was 4 per cent.  I feel that this Bill will remedy that position, that it will carry out what the Land Act of 1950 was designed for.</P>
      <P>This Bill will help to put an end to the unjust and unscrupulous confiscation of land which took place under the Land Acts of 1933 and 1934 at a sacrifice price.  The market value of the land will be properly interpreted now in consequence of the arrangements to increase the interest to be paid on these bonds.</P>
      <P>It is a natural adjustment and I am glad that the Minister has decided to do it, especially when we remember that the National Loan was floated at 5 per cent.  interest.  It is only fair to the owners whose land is acquired that they should be placed in the same position as the people who were able to invest money at 5 per cent.  I was wondering if the Minister would be able to give a definite figure with regard to the interest which is to be paid.  Is it to be 5 per cent.?  I think it should be at least 5 per cent. so as to be in line with the interest paid on the National Loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what the previous speaker said with regard to the acquisition of land.  Landowners have been treated very unfairly by the Land Commission in the acquisition of land. When the land is taken over it is rented on the conacre system for perhaps two or three years and the result is that the Land Commission gets back almost the price of the land, but the man who is deprived of his land gets no return from it and is left waiting for his payment. That is happening in the County Dublin.  I am aware of some cases where houses have been built on the land and roads constructed while those from whom the land was taken have not yet got one penny. They were dispossessed of the land which was then let.  They have not even yet got the bonds at their present value of 86.  As a result of this Bill they will probably be given bonds at their par value instead of at the present market value.  That would enable the market value of the land to be paid to them.  The 1st December, 1949, was <Col N="1350" /> mentioned as the date and I hope the Minister will assure us that all adjustments will be made back to that date. Many persons who were dispossessed of their land since that time have not yet got their bonds and I expect this Bill will apply to them.</P>
    <P>I should also like to know if people who were given bonds since 1949 will have the adjustment made for them.  I got the impression from the Minister's speech that he will carry out that adjustment.  I would impress on the Minister that the 1950 Land Act was designed to pay market value for the land and that that was defeated because the land bonds could not be sold at par by the people who received them.</P>
    <P>It would be a new principle, but people from whom land is taken often ask why they should not be paid in cash.  If they sell the land in the open market they get paid in cash.  I think that cash should be paid to these people and that an adjustment over the years should be carried out by the Land Commission.  They felt that they had a grievance when they were being paid by way of bonds which represented only 86 per cent. of the value of the land taken from them.</P>

      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Blowick does not appreciate that the Minister for Finance has an important function as custodian of the State's finances.  He is the guardian of the issue of land bonds, without which of course, land acquisition and resettlement cannot proceed.  It is hardly possible that Deputy Blowick is not familiar with the Land Bond Act of 1934 under which the responsibility and obligations regarding the creation of land bonds by Order rests on the Minister for Finance.  He is required by the Act to fix a rate of interest which will keep the bonds at or near par for a reasonable time.  But under that Act also there is a statutory maximum rate of interest, 4 per cent. which we are now deleting under this Bill. Since the last Order expired on 31st December, 1952, it has not been possible, under the existing legislation, with the statutory maximum, to create land bonds which would remain at or <Col N="1351" /> near par.  Each land bond Order made by the Minister for Finance, usually in December of a particular year, restricts the issue of bonds to prices agreed upon or fixed during a specified period, normally the following calender year.  The last period was 1952.  In the case to which Deputy Sweetman referred, by the way, the price was first fixed by the lay commissioners before the end of last year, although it does not seem to have been published in 1952.</P>

      <P>As regards the £3,000,000, that £3,000,000 is, of course, the amount which is still available subject to the making of the necessary Orders by the Minister for Finance, who has these statutory obligations.  We can still proceed provided he makes these Orders to the extent of issues up to £3,000,000.  There is nothing inconsistent between that, which is the global figure, and the duty which also rests on the Minister for Finance of making an Order creating a new series of bonds for a particular period so as to fulfil the condition that these bonds will be at or near par for a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman also mentioned that in relation to Section 14, we will be amending the Registration of Title Acts.  As a layman, it seems to me that we are only confirming a certain interpretation with regard to the position of limited administrators who are appointed by the Land Commission pursuant to the Land Acts and that, therefore, it can justly be claimed by the draftsman that the title of the Bill covers the particular class.  I think that the draftsman generally goes into these nice points of symmetry and position with regard to title with great care <Col N="1352" /> and that we are safe in leaving it in his capable hands.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 8, Deputy Blowick seemed to question the wisdom of the Land Commission in seeking this power which, in fact, is only placing the position in regard to the resumption of holdings on the same basis as the law already provides in the case of untenanted land.  It simply means that in future resumed tenanted holdings will be placed on the same basis as untenanted land.  It brings both types of land into line and makes the position, I am informed, legally water-tight.</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy Moran's point about the interest that is charged by the Land Commission on moneys lodged to cover the period between lodgment, which I understand has to be made, and the date on which possession can be taken, the lodgment precedes the taking of possession and the land vests in the Land Commission and it is a matter for the owner and his advisers to seek allocation of the funds.  There sometimes may be a delay by reason of the owner not having proved title to the funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general point raised by Deputy Moran, as well as by speakers on the other side of the <Col N="1353" /> House, that the effect of Section 2 of the Act will be to enable the Order to be made by the Minister for Finance fixing the rate of annuity and also, presumably, the total amount of bonds to be issued for the coming period, I do not know what point Deputies are endeavouring to make with regard to making this particular clause retrospective. In my view, it cannot be made retrospective and can only come into operation from whatever date most nearly falls into line with the enactment of this measure.  The reason I say that is because it is only, as provided by the Land Bond Act, 1934, for a certain period after the issue of a particular series of bonds that we can hope to have the position where par will almost be reached.</P>
    <P>Looking at some of the figures I have here, I see that in 1947 the quotation of 3 per cent. land bonds was a minimum of 99 and a maximum of 101¼; in 1948 there was a maximum of 99 and a minimum of 97; in 1949, when land bonds were 3½ per cent., the maximum was 100½ and the minimum was 97; in 1950 the maximum was 97 and the minimum was 91, which, although not as low as the present figure, was certainly very low indeed.  Bearing in mind the fact that these 3½ per cent. bonds did not bear the present maximum statutory rate of interest of 4 per cent., the present quotation of 87½ would have to be related to a somewhat higher figure, I think, to get the exact relationship between the two series, having regard to the difference in the rate of interest on the bonds.</P>
    <P>In 1951 the 4 per cent. bonds then current ran from 99¼ minimum to 103¼ maximum; in 1952 from 86 to 96, and in 1953 from 86¾ to 89.  It will be seen, therefore, that, while the quotations have frequently run into figures like 97 and 99, even so far back as 1950 bonds had fallen to 91.  I only mention that to show that, in fact, there are these fluctuations in the market.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister for Finance and the Government are assuming full legal and moral responsibility in taking steps to see that the provisions of the 1934 Land Bond Act are effectively carried out and that under the Order <Col N="1354" /> to be made by the Minister for Finance all that is possible will be done to ensure that the new issue will, for a reasonable time, be at or near par.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy Blowick means by the increase of annuities. There is no increase of annuities. Rather than have a grievance against the Minister for Finance, I think it is the Minister for Finance who ought to have a grievance against Deputy Blowick and myself.</P>
    <P>In the first place, the Minister has to issue these bonds and the taxpayer has to find the necessary moneys for the service of them.  Secondly, to the extent that these moneys will not be provided for by an increased annuity, since the persons who will be getting allotments of land will still be paying the same amount of annuity and only half that annuity under the 1933 Act, the Minister for Finance will have to call on the taxpayer to make up the balance, not alone the halved annuity plus the loss on resale of the land to the allottee but the additional loss that will now result, because the gap between the cost of the charge of the bonds upon the State on the one side and the income from the halved annuity on the other side will become greater.  The Minister for Finance will have to make provision to secure additional moneys from the taxpayer to raise the funds.  May I remind Deputy Blowick&mdash;as I have reminded a good many people throughout the country&mdash;that while people are paying up to £30 per acre in parts of this country for conacre, the Land Commission, through its operations and with the backing of the Minister for Finance, aided by the strong arm of the taxpayer, is giving land to allottees at an annual charge of something like 15/- an acre or thereabouts.</P>
    <P>If it is suggested that it is too much of a burden, Deputy Blowick must have been living in a fool's paradise if he did not realise that, all the time, apart from the increased cost to the State of buying land at market value without asking the allottee to pay any more by way of annuity, the cost of land is going up, the gap is increasing all the time.  The resale price and the cost of land settlement has become almost <Col N="1355" /> prohibitive.  There are certain areas in the country where, if we buy land and add the cost of making holdings, building houses and enabling the tenants to carry on their work as we would like, it is almost prohibitive to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we can congratulate ourselves and the Minister for Finance that, this year, he has enabled the Land Commission to carry out a very good programme of work particularly with regard to the migration of tenants from the West of Ireland to the midlands.  I do not know what Deputy Blowick's grouse may be but I suppose that it is grousing that has him where he is.</P>
      <P>As regards the codification of the Land Acts, I dare say we can deal with that matter on another occasion.  Steps are being taken from time to time to codify different sections of the legislation of the State.  If it were possible to get the personnel who are dealing with these matters to devote their attention to land legislation in the same way as to fishing legislation, for instance, I should be very glad.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Moran, or anybody else who has a grouse about particular cases, more especially in respect of those who claim that they have been deprived of their land bonds or deprived of payment for their land due to some negligence or remissness on the part of the Land Commission, if I can get particulars of the cases I shall be very glad to go into them.  It would be impossible for me to answer Deputy Moran or anybody else unless I got some more details of the cases he has in mind.</P>
      <P>I now come to the question of decentralisation. If the Government decided that they could send the Land Commission down to Castlebar, I would have no objection in the world.  I am immediately faced, however, with the question of where accommodation is to be provided in Castlebar, Galway or anywhere else.</P>

      <P>I assure Deputy Sweetman that they would be quite safe in my native county.  If Deputy Moran is interested in what is known as land settlement or the relief of congestion he must be satisfied that the West of Ireland has more than its share of the outdoor staff.  These are the men who determine the actual schemes. Upon their recommendation the commissioners decide to take land, the persons to whom to give it and what schemes of turbary, road-building and house making are to be undertaken.  It is upon their estimates that the commissioners decide to go ahead with particular schemes.  It will be seen, therefore, that there is no loss in that respect. No body of civil servants in this country is more familiar with rural conditions or the needs of the people in the West of Ireland&mdash;and that is only natural&mdash;than the Land Commission inspectors who have spent a long time working amongst those people : nobody knows their circumstances better.  If it is suggested that there may be people in the Land Commission in Dublin who have not the opportunity of visiting these areas, as they would like, I think that the excellent staff of inspectors and surveyors that we have in the West means that we can get every possible information by way of report and interview, if necessary, as to the conditions down there and the best steps to take to improve the situation.</P>

      <P>Having studied the position in relation to this Bill, I do not think anybody is anxious to discuss it at 11.45 p.m.  Moreover, there is this position, if the Dáil were to pass it to-night, the Seanad would probably have to be recalled, perhaps the day before the 15th April, to reconsider it. Therefore, I would not propose to take the Report Stage now, and that would give Deputies who may wish to speak on this amendment an opportunity of doing so on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In regard to the subject-matter of this question, the method of the investigation or the extent of the investigation by the Milk Costings Committee is not relevant for discussion.  The only matter that is relevant is the question of the changes in organisation, staffing and otherwise, of the costings inquiry and when the next meeting will be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to delay the House later but it is not very often I raise a matter on the Adjournment. The reason I have raised this question is that I found it impossible to get satisfactory replies from the Minister in relation to the working and the administration of this costings committee.  To-day I asked the Minister:-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If he will state when the next meeting of the Milk Costings Committee <Col N="1360" /> will be held and what changes have taken place in the organisation, staffing and otherwise, of the costings inquiry since the last regular meeting of the costings committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister has already informed me that the last meeting of the costings committee was on the 19th November, but on the 20th November, on an adjournment debate dealing with a similar matter the Minister said:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The committee met again yesterday and were unable to agree&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Again on the 20th November, at column 2082, Volume 134, No. 14 of the Official Debates, the Minister said:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...I have taken the further liberty of asking the farmers who have already consented to participate in the work to continue to do so. I am circulating every one of them and if a majority declare that they wish to have the costings carried out, my Department will do it...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the day after the last meeting of the costings committee.  The Minister told me to-day that certain changes have taken place as far as the administration of this costings committee is concerned.  The technical adviser, who is an independent person, has ceased to act since the 19th November and no meeting of the committee has been held since that date.  Again, on the 20th November the Minister as reported in column 2079 stated that he had received a letter from the chairman of the costings committee in which it was stated that the committee found themselves unable to continue their work because of disagreement about the question of including provision for interest on capital and reward for managerial services in costings.  That was the Minister's statement on 20th November.</P>
    <P>In reply to my question to-day the Minister stated that certain changes have taken place, that the technical director has ceased to take charge of this investigation.  On 20th November last the Minister said that he had circularised the farmers stating that if the farmers wished the Department would continue the investigation.  Now from 20th November until to-day there <Col N="1361" /> has been no meeting of that committee. The technical adviser or the technical director of the committee has resigned. The members of the committee have not been called together and I wonder whether we are to take it from the Minister's statement that the Department will carry on the work themselves, irrespective of the committee and irrespective of the technical director? Which view is correct?  The Minister told me on 26th February, that the committee was in existence and was carrying on while on the 20th November the Minister quoted a letter from the chairman of the committee to say that the committee had been dissolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked when the next meeting would be held.  The second part of the question is directed to ascertaining what changes have taken place in the organisation, staffing and otherwise of the costings inquiry, since that last regular meeting of the costings committee.  I am endeavouring to relate my remarks to the question of the changes that have taken place in the organisation, staffing and otherwise. The Minister speaking here on the 26th February said: &ldquo;As far as I am aware, all the necessary principles have been agreed to&rdquo;.  I asked the Minister whether the costings committee had agreed to include the question of interest on capital among the other charges and the Minister said: &ldquo;I understand they have agreed on all the principles&rdquo;, when in fact from the letter the Minister quoted on 20th November last, it appeared that the costings committee had dropped out because they could not agree on principles. <Col N="1362" /> No meeting of the costings committee has been held since it dropped out because the members could not agree on costings principles.</P>
      <P>I want to know what is the exact position.  Is the Department carrying on this inquiry on their own?  Have they told the farmers who agreed to keep records for them and who were told that the inquiry was being carried out under the control of an impartial costings committee with an impartial technical director in charge, that the committee broke down on the 19th November last because they could not agree on costings principles?  Yet the Minister could tell me on 26th February that they had agreed to all the necessary principles when in fact they had not met from 19th November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to extract the information which I asked for in the question.  I do not want to delay the House any longer.  The information I sought in the question was what changes have taken place in the organisation, staffing and otherwise of the costings inquiry since the last regular meeting.  The last regular meeting according to the reply given to me by the Minister on 26th February was 19th November.  I thought I would be entitled to quote what the Minister said on 20th November.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>On 20th November the Minister quoted the chairman as having stated that the costings committee had broken down because they could not agree on the question of costings principles.  Yet on the 26th February the Minister informed me that they had agreed on necessary principles.  I do not know what the position is at the moment and I want the Minister to give me some more information than he gave in reply to my question to-day.  I want him to tell me and the House what is the present position.  Is this costings committee in existence or is it not?  If the technical adviser has had to withdraw <Col N="1363" /> from the inquiry, who is in charge of the inquiry?  Is it an officer of the Department?  If it is an officer of the Department who is in charge of the inquiry, am I to take it, as stated by the Minister on 26th February, that the inquiry is being carried on by the Department and that is being done as a result of a circular which the Minister stated he sent to the farmers concerned? The Minister told us on the 20th November:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have taken the further liberty of asking the farmers who have already consented to participate in the work to continue to do so.  I am circularising every one of them and if a majority declare that they wish to have the costings carried out, my Department will do it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is that the inquiry that is going on at the moment?  If it is, have the people been told that the costings committee met since they broke down and disagreed on 19th November, or is this just a purely private inquiry that is being carried on by the Department? Would the Minister also tell us whether the issue on which the inquiry broke down on 19th November was the question of including interest on capital and reward for managerial services in the costings, and whether any decision has been arrived at on that score?  I should also like to know whether the Minister is now satisfied that he was directly informed when he told me on 26th February that the costings committee had agreed upon all the necessary principles.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane seems to have forgotten that this is an independent body set up by me, a costings committee, to investigate the cost of producing milk. That committee met under the chairmanship of Professor Smiddy and continued their deliberations at several meetings during the months of September, October and November of last year.  Some time prior to 20th November, they had a disagreement regarding managerial costs and interest on capital, and I was informed that they were unable to come to an agreement. I came to the House, here, and, when <Col N="1364" /> the question was raised on the Adjournment, I stated the position.  I was asked by the House to make an effort to bring them together again.  This I did on 26th November, and, after a lengthy discussion with them, the following decision was come to: All the members of the committee indicated that they would be agreeable to proceeding on the basis of a formula by which the costing principles to be followed in the report are to be decided by the committee as a whole, or, failing that, by a majority of the members of the committee, each member being, of course, free to make such comments on the report as he thinks fit.  That was the final agreement made in my presence.</P>

      <P>That was 26th November. I could not say when their last regular meeting was held, because, as I have stated, I have no function whatever in the matter.  This was a meeting the committee had with me in my office, and, as a result of the discussion we had, this was agreed to.  I understood that that finished the question of principles, that all the other matters regarding the principles in connection with costings had been agreed to and it has not been necessary since to hold a meeting of the committee.</P>

      <P>I am telling the Deputy what happened in my office.  I cannot say when they had a meeting.  I remind the House that I do not get the <Col N="1365" /> minutes of their meetings and I have no connection whatever with them. They have their own arrangements, have their own secretary and so forth, so that I have nothing whatever to do with that costings committee.  With regard to the other matter which has been raised, the circular to which the Deputy referred, I mentioned that circular in the House on that occasion. In view of the breakdown that has taken place, I issued a circular to the farmers then carrying out the investigation, setting out that, if the committee broke down, I was prepared to carry on with it, but there was no necessity for that because the committee had agreed on the formula I quoted and there was no necessity for any interference on my part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no responsibility for the staffing of the committee.  We did recruit graduates for the committee early on and there are a number of graduates, field men, to the number of about 26, under the control of the technical director.  The technical director, as the House knows, was Professor Murphy.  Some time ago, Professor Murphy notified me that he was unable to continue, owing to ill-health. I have conveyed that infornation to the chairman and it is for the chairman and the committee to decide what technical director they may put in his place.  At the moment, his assistant, who is an official of the Department, is carrying on until such time as the director is appointed.  The investigation is being carried on by the assistant director and the committee is still functioning, as far as I know.  There will not be any necessity for the committee to meet again for possibly another month or two.  I see no reason for it myself&mdash;they have decided on all the principles, so far as I know, and I cannot see any necessity for a meeting.  They may come together later on around that time&mdash;for instance, they have to make an agreement regarding the value of calves and so forth&mdash;but until such time as that, it will not be necessary for them to meet.  Later on, when the report is being prepared, they may have very frequent meetings, but at the moment there is no necessity for it.  There is <Col N="1366" /> no more I have to add, beyond pointing out these matters to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not broken on any issue at all.  They disagreed, and, as a result of representations made to me by Deputies on all sides of the House, I called them together and told them that they should compose their differences, and they did so. After a lengthy discussion lasting two or three hours, this formula was agreed on and there was nothing more to be said or added.  The investigation proceeded in the ordinary way after that. I told the Deputy in February last that the principles had been agreed on and that there was no further answer I could give.  So far as I know, all the principles have been agreed on.</P>
