    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor) Oscar Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That it is expedient to authorise such payments out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present session to amend the <Col N="2432" /> Military Service Pensions Acts, 1924 to 1949.</P>
    <P>In moving this Resolution, I would like to inform the House that the Government examined the debate which took place in regard to military service pensions on the Second Stage of the Bill.  They are satisfied that the Bill represents the limits to which they can go in respect of payments.  They are satisfied that the method of assessing the pensions based on service is a fair method; that similarly circumstanced applicants are provided with the same opportunities for presenting their case to the Referee and Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>Arising out of some of the statements made on the Second Stage of the Bill, I got in contact with the Referee who assured me that, while he is the deciding factor and has to accept responsibility, every decision taken is one arrived at by a majority consisting of himself and the members of his board.  Service is based on the evidence tendered by the applicant and by any witnesses whom he wishes to bring forward.</P>
    <P>There is one point which the Government considered favourably.  It was a matter raised by Deputy Cowan, I think, in regard to pensions to individuals who were notionally discharged in order to secure a permanent commission. While they are satisfied that the decision was based on the terms of the 1924 Act and that there was nothing unjust in the decision taken by the officials, in their opinion it was unfair inasmuch as it could hardly have been in the minds of the framers of the particular Act to have notional discharge deemed permanent.  From that point of view I was given permission to bring in an amendment which is down here in my name.  This amendment will restore these men to the position enjoyed by their ordinary retired colleagues of the permanent Army.</P>
    <P>There is only one other point I should like to raise.  I would like to make an appeal to the House to deal with this Bill as expeditiously as possible. The end of the first quarter of the year comes, as Deputies are aware, on the 31st of this month.  If it is <Col N="2433" /> possible to get the Bill dealt with speedily in this House and in the other House my officials, in reply to a question of mine, assured me that, given some little time, it would be possible to make these payments, including the retrospective payments, available by the end of the month.  On that aspect alone I would appeal to the House to deal with this particular matter as expeditiously as it can do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Bill will get a speedy passage.  Neither I nor my colleagues intend doing anything that would hold it up.  I am glad to hear from the Minister that the decision upon all applications by the Referee is a majority decision, because there is still a feeling that, no matter how fair the Referee may be, he is deciding appeals from his own previous decisions.  If, as the Minister now says, the decisions are majority decisions, while that would satisfy me, it may not satisfy a number of the applicants.  It is important that not only should justice be done in these cases, but that it also should appear to be done.  I have heard of cases being turned down by the Referee reporting to the Minister that there was not a <i>prima facie</i> case to be heard.  I do not think the Referee should do that.  In every case brought before the Referee, the applicant should be given an opportunity of coming up to make it.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is meeting the wishes of the House when he sends out this notice that the Referee has reported to him that <i>prima facie</i> the person is a person to whom the Act does not apply, and therefore no award should be made.  That is not good, as the person has been condemned or refused unheard.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider that aspect of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should have adverted to the fact that in the decisions of the Referee there was no discrimination between one area and another, that the Referee was concerned only with whether the applicant had continuous active service or not over the period named in the Acts to qualify him for a military service certificate, regardless of what his service was.  The allegation was made during the Second Reading that there was discrimination between one area and another.  As far as my experience goes, I have not found any discrimination whatever exercised by the Referee and his committee or by the Board of Assessors&mdash;and I think the Minister should have made that point quite clear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate very much the action of the Minister and the Government in making the amendment to Section 4 of the Act of 1924. It clears up the point which was debated here on the Second Reading and enables a soldier who is promoted from non-commissioned rank to commissioned rank to get his military service pension at the rate applicable to the highest rank he reaches when his services as an officer are finally ending.  It applies to a number of people and certainly is an act of justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an excellent improvement and the Minister and the Government are to be congratulated. I had some recent experience of appearing before the Pensions Board in regard to applications and the feeling I have is that everything that could possibly be done to aid an applicant is done by the board.  The Referee goes out of his way to assist applicants in making their cases.  It is only right that that should be stated.  There is no question of applicants being taken sharply.  The previous documents, sent in as far back as 25 years ago, are brought to the notice of the applicant, with the purpose of assisting him in making his case.  The Referee takes occasion to draw attention to the vital aspects it is necessary to cover, so as to give the applicant and his witnesses an opportunity of giving evidence on those vital points.  The Military Service Pensions Board as it is operating at present is certainly a court of justice in the real sense of the word. The announcement by the Minister, that the decisions taken by the Referee are majority decisions of the board, will be welcomed by everybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have a considerable amount of sympathy for the point mentioned <Col N="2436" /> by Deputy MacEoin that an applicant should have the right, whether he has a good case or a bad one, of making it himself to the board, I can see some difficulties, but it is a question whether the difficulties are more important than the fact that the man would like an opportunity of making his own case.  Take a man who makes application for a pension and whose application shows clearly that he is not a person to whom the Acts apply.  It seems a waste of time to call him up and bring witnesses before the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the Deputy's side in a general way but I am pointing out this difficulty.  If his application shows clearly that he is not a person to whom the Acts apply and he is notified so by the Referee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by the Minister, on the report of the Referee, I am not sure that that is the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if he is still able to produce evidence, that would be considered.  At the moment there are very few people who apply for a pension who have not the benefit of the assistance of men who are very experienced in the operation of the Military Service Pensions Acts.  In the early days, when applications were being made under the 1924 Act, people did not worry very much about the precise wording of the Acts and quite a number of people who should have received certificates did not receive them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1934 Act, the system was operated differently.  Brigade and battalion councils and committees came together and studied the Acts. They were advised as to the vital parts of the Acts and they were able to make their cases much better than the people who made them under the original 1924 Act.  Under the recent Act again, applicants, in the main, have <Col N="2437" /> the assistance of brigade and battalion advisers and generally their cases are put forward to the board in a very good way; but I do agree, in the main, that even if these applications which are sent in do not on their face seem to be applications that could possibly be successful, and even if they are deferred, the man feels that it is like going to court in the ordinary way.  If he gets a chance of going into the witness box and telling his story, he does not mind whether he wins or loses the case.</P>
    <P>If a sensible applicant goes before the board and offers evidence to the Referee and the board and if it is then explained to him that he should have this, that and the other to comply with the Act he feels that at least he has gone to the last court of appeal and is quite satisfied.  To that extent, I would support the suggestion that persons should have a right and an opportunity of going before the board, if they want to go, having been informed by the Minister, as a result of the Referee's report, that it is extremely unlikely that they could possibly qualify for a pension on the evidence they have submitted in writing.  Many of them will be sensible enough not to go to any expense with regard to it but those who want to go to the expense of travelling would get the opportunity.  I hope the Bill will get a speedy passage so that it will be in operation before the end of the month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that we ought to be paying tributes to arbitrators or people of that kind at all on an occasion of this kind, but it may be relevant to say what I have often wanted to say, that, as an ordinary Deputy dealing with the Department of Defence, I have always found the officers of the pensions branch to be as careful of the interests of persons entitled to military pensions as their own best advocate would be.  It is right that that should be so, and it is a good thing that we have managed to establish in the pensions branch the principle that one should bring the name of a person who believes himself entitled to a pension to their notice. <Col N="2438" /> One has the feeling before the transaction is finished that every conceivable precaution will be taken to see that he will get a pension, if he is entitled to it, and, furthermore, that he will not get a pension, if he is not entitled to it.  Many a man, in my experience, has been helped to get his legal rights by the Department when all other sources have failed him.</P>
      <P>I am told, since the foundation of this State, about 181 serving members of the Army have been injured in the course of their employment.  These include the cases of men who have suffered injury in air crashes and other work involving active service in the Army not necessarily in emergency times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am asking is whether provision is made under the pensions code&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being dealt with in an Army Pensions Bill which follows this Bill and which is related to it.  It is not relevant to this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very information I wanted.  If no provision is made in this, there is a scheme afoot to deal with that somewhat anachronistic situation in a subsequent Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not correct that, when the Minister sends out notice saying that the Referee has reported that a person is a person to whom the Act does not apply, that is final and conclusive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the remarks made by Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Hilliard, I went to the Referee, although I was satisfied from past experience that the position was not as suggested by Deputy MacEoin, and I was assured that the question of major engagements does not arise at all. Active service, in the view of the Referee, and, I understand, of all those who have acted as such consists of continuous general volunteer service. and if a genuine volunteer can prove <Col N="2439" /> continuous active service of that type, his case can be proved to the satisfaction of the Referee and the board. There is no question, and never has been any question, of a demand for a particular type of major engagement which was referred to here and I think exists only in the minds of the Deputies who coined that particular phrase.</P>
      <P>In regard to <i>prima facie</i> evidence, that again is decided by the Referee and the board and it is decided by a majority of the board.  In fact, this is what the Referee has informed me: if there is one person dissenting in regard to whether a case is <i>prima facie</i> or not, the benefit of the doubt is given to the applicant, and, if it is necessary to bring him along, that can be done. As has been mentioned, the cost to the applicant, with practically no possibility of proving his case, would be such that it would be very unfair to put him to the expense of coming from some distant part to where the board was meeting, and therefore when the case of the individual is examined by the board and the Referee and the majority decision is that he has no case, the application is dismissed.  If every case &mdash;this is the point which I think is being made&mdash;whether <i>prima facie</i> or not, is to be heard orally, the board would be sitting on these cases for the next ten or 12 years.  There is no necessity for delay to that extent when the Referee is satisfied that these individuals cannot produce any further evidence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would advise you strongly to afford them some chance, sometime, somehow&mdash;even at the end of the list&mdash;to make their own case. The countryman in this country likes to make his own case.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Take, for instance, the hearing of cases in Longford. <Col N="2440" /> The Referee was in Longford town.  Applicants from around the neighbouring parish of Killoe, five miles out, got no opportunity although they have as good service as that given by men who were heard.  Therefore, there is the argument that they did not get fair play.  You will have this thing all over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I got a long memorandum on this matter.  It represents the views of the Referee and the board. The Referee adverted to the statement that of two particular individuals with identical service, one got the pension while the other did not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to tell the House something now&mdash;and it is something that I would not know, I suppose, except as a result of my inquiries.  I more or less induced the Referee to give me this information.  I knew, to some extent, how the applicant is represented on the board.  He is represented on the board, in the first instance, by two senior Old I.R.A. officers.  These men are there to look after the interests of the applicant.  I know that they do that effectively. But, in addition to that, there is a representative of the Department of Defence and a representative of the Department of Finance.  I took the opportunity, when I resumed office, of appointing a representative of the Department of Defence&mdash;and the man that was appointed was a pre-Truce Volunteer.  That was done deliberately, in order to ensure that the weight of sympathy on the side of the applicant would be to his benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have now discovered that there are four pre-Truce Volunteers.  The Referee is a pre-Truce Volunteer.  Surely, with that weight of four pre-Truce Volunteers on a board representing the Minister for Defence, the Minister for <Col N="2441" /> Finance and the applicants, justice is bound to be done.  The sympathy will always be on the side of the applicant. I think it would be foolish to provide a hearing for every man even if he has not the faintest hope&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The position is that the 1949 Act provides a rehearing for all those who failed to secure pensions under the 1924 and 1934 Acts.  It must be presumed that these particular individuals applied, were heard, and failed to secure a pension or a certificate under either of these Acts.</P>

When Deputy Dr. O'Higgins was introducing the 1949 Bill he assumed&mdash;not, perhaps, accurately&mdash;that the people who would apply under it would be those who were heard and who failed, and that people who were turned down completely and entirely because they had no case would not be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Would the Minister go so far as to say that any person who had never been heard himself in any earlier proceedings would be allowed an opportunity of being heard before being finally rejected under this Act?  It is a great hardship on the average countryman to feel that his case is irrevocably rejected when, at the same time, he has never been heard by any of the <Col N="2442" /> various tribunals who have looked into such matters.</P>

A great many Volunteers who gave service may not be sufficiently qualified for a pension but the fruits of all their efforts, as far as officialdom is concerned, are that they get a notice to the effect that the Act does not apply to them.  Even though they would not get a priority, or anything, in consideration of their case, I think that at some time or another&mdash; perhaps when the load lightens&mdash;their cases should get some consideration.</P>

We all know that &ldquo;hope springs eternal,&rdquo; so that there must be quite a number of people living in the hope that they will be able to convince the Referee that they are entitled to a pension.  On the evidence, however, which they submit to the board&mdash;it is on that the board makes its decision&mdash;there is not the slighest possible hope that they can succeed in their claim.  It would, therefore, seem to me unreasonable of the House to demand, seeing that the board had come to a unanimous decision, that these people must be heard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is possible, but I am not able to say so definitely.</P>
      <P>As there is not an amendment dealing with Section 4, to which Deputy Hickey referred, and as it is a very difficult section for the ordinary Deputy to understand, I think I should make it clear what the position actually is.  As regards Section 8 (2) of the 1924 Act and Section 20 (2) of the 1934 Act, the proposal that the same period of service should count for military service pension and for superannuation cannot be accepted.  It is a cardinal principle of superannuation that the same period of time may not reckon as service for two pensions. This principle has been accepted in relation to military service pensions since the outset and it cannot very well be changed now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons concerned have, however, a very valuable option.  If they wish to retain their military service pension, <Col N="2445" /> only the actual period of military service is deducted from service for superannuation. If, on the other hand, they are prepared to forgo military service pensions the notional military service can be added for superannuation purposes. Thus for instance, in the case of a person who had full military service from 1916 to 1923&mdash;if he keeps his military service pension, only the actual period, approximately seven and a half years, is deducted from his service for superannuation.  If, on the other hand, he surrenders his military service pension, the full notional period, 14 years, is added for superannuation. Thus, he exercises the choice as he thinks best.  Only 14 or 15 persons&mdash;I understand the number is now only 12 because two or three have since died&mdash;who had small military service pensions found it better to surrender these pensions, and they are now being given an opportunity, by Section 4 of the Bill, of reversing their original option in the light of the increases in military service pensions and the removal of abatement.  That appears to provide better for these individuals, and even though they did exercise an option, they are now being given the opportunity under Section 4 of reconsidering their position.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Military Service Pensions Acts in this matter apply only to persons who were in the public service and resigned and dismissed R.I.C.  There are similar provisions affecting teachers, members of the Garda and Army personnel in the pensions codes governing the superannuation of these classes, so that it is not something new or something that has been introduced specially in respect of the I.R.A. and civil servants. The provisions do not, as I mentioned to Deputy Hickey, apply to local authorities, which are apparently completely free in that respect.  I think that the other matters which were mentioned can be dealt with when we come to consider the Bill proper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to a <i>prima facie</i> case where one member of the board dissents as regards an award.  Does not that apply to cases coming under the 1924 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2446" /> The Referee on the present board has a different approach altogether from that of the Referee who preceded him on this whole matter.  The present Referee took the view that he was dealing with the dregs and the cast-off applicants from the earlier period.  I think that is the kernel of the whole thing.  His approach is to the detriment of the man anxious to make his own case by relying on his own evidence. I think that if the Minister would examine that aspect of the question we could deal with the points which were raised by Deputy Dillon and Deputy MacCarthy.  We would then get an approach quite different from that which is there at present.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The reference to discharge contained in sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Act of 1924 and the same reference contained in sub-section (3) of that section shall each be construed as not including a reference to discharge for the purpose of being appointed to commissioned rank.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a person was, before the passing of this Act, granted under Section 4 of the Act of 1924 a pension under that Act commencing as from the day of his discharge for the purpose of being appointed to commissioned rank, the pension shall stand revoked as from the day from which it became payable.</P>
      <P>(3)  Where&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  a pension granted under Section 4 of the Act of 1924 to a person stands revoked by virtue <Col N="2447" /> of sub-section (2) of this section, and</P>
    <P>(b)  such person is granted after the passing of this Act under Section 4 of the Act of 1924 a new pension under that Act commencing as from a day before the passing of this Act,</P>
    <P>the following provisions shall have effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if the aggregate of the payments made in respect of the revoked pension exceeds the aggregate of the arrears of the new pension, the arrears shall not be paid and the excess shall be recovered by non-payment of the new pension to an extent equivalent to the excess,</P>
    <P>(ii)  if the aggregate of the payments made in respect of the revoked pension equals the aggregate of the arrears of the new pension, the arrears shall not be paid,</P>
    <P>(iii)  if the aggregate of the payments made in respect of the revoked pension is less than the aggregate of the arrears of the new pension, so much only of the arrears shall be paid as is equal to the amount by which the aggregate of the payments made in respect of the revoked pension is less than the aggregate of the arrears of the new pension.</P>
    <P>This amendment arises from certain cases, referred to by Deputy Cowan in the course of the Second Reading debate, in which non-commissioned officers were notionally discharged, without any break in service, for the purpose of being appointed to commissioned rank.  On a legal interpretation, they were held to be entitled to military service pensions based on their non-commissioned ranks and were paid such pensions on that basis while serving as officers.  They have all now retired but continue to receive their pensions at the non-commissioned rate. I am satisfied that it can never have been the intention that a notional discharge of the nature I have mentioned <Col N="2448" /> should be covered by Section 4 of the Act of 1924, and by this amendment I propose that the persons concerned should have their previous awards revoked and be awarded fresh pensions, commencing in each case from the date of retirement as an officer and based on the commissioned rank held on retirement.  The amendment provides for the necessary financial adjustments as between the two pensions. In effect, the amounts paid on foot of the revoked pensions, including the amounts paid during service as officers, will be recovered to such extent as they are not met by the arrears of the new increased pensions based on commissioned rank.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder could I raise two particular matters, as this section appears to provide for a reopening to a certain extent of the claims for pensions by different applicants. I would like to refer the Minister to the claims of certain 1916 men in Offaly and Cork.  In and around Tullamore on the 20th March, 1916, an armed engagement took place with members of the R.I.C.  Certain persons were charged and were eventually imprisoned.  These men were in prison until June, 1916.  They were in prison when the 1916 Rebellion took place.  I would urge that, with regard to men of that kind, who obviously might have been available to take part in the Rebellion and who certainly would have had the intention, as proven by the fact that they did engage in an armed combat with the police at the time, should at least be entitled to some certificate recognising their service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2449" /> The other case that I would like to mention is a case which has been mentioned here from time to time of the Corkmen who were out, mobilised and ready for the 1916 Rebellion and whose participation in that Rebellion and became unnecessary and could not take place by reason of the countermanding of the instructions.  Again, if those men are not entitled to a military service pension, the minimum they should get from the State is a recognition of their service. Certainly, they should get under these Acts a certificate that they were available to play a part in the national movement and gave that service.</P>
    <P>I know that possibly it is not strictly correct to raise this matter on this section&mdash;I suppose I could raise it on the last stage of the Bill&mdash;but I do urge on the Minister that some investigation should be made.</P>
    <P>I mention two groups of men, one group in my own constituency, the other in Cork.  I am quite certain that there are similar groups all over the country who were available, who had been trained, who were members, who were keyed up to play their part in the 1916 Rebellion and who would have gone out had the Rebellion followed the pattern of the original plan.  Those men did not see active service, through no fault of their own. They may not be entitled, in the accepted view with regard to military service pensions, to pensions but they certainly should get a certificate of service and they certainly should get a 1916 medal.</P>
    <P>It is recognised in any army in the world that, when the war is over, when medals are issued for service during the war, each member of the army gets his medal although he may have been a cook peeling potatoes hundreds of miles from the actual firing or warfare. He is a member of an army.  As such, he is under orders and must do nothing or engage in actual combat, according to orders.  For that reason, all members of the Volunteers, who were trained, should get recognition of their service. By giving them such recognition the Minister will help to undo what has been a grievance nursed by a lot of people for a great number of years.  I <Col N="2450" /> would like to suggest&mdash;I do not suppose it would be proper on this Bill&mdash; that all these people should be treated very much the same but it would be a grand thing that these men, in the winter of their days, should get from the State recognition that they were available at a time when it was not popular to be a member of the Volunteers, to give service under arms if the need arose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Cork Volunteers are concerned, there is a genuine grievance.  I am sure the same applies elsewhere.  Roughly 250 Volunteers actually left Cork Volunteer Hall in Sheares Street under arms and were about to entrain for Macroom when the cancellation order was brought to Cork by a Volunteer.  Notwithstanding that, the men proceeded to Macroom, according to the original instructions, and started out individually and collectively to do their duty on that occasion.  It was not their fault that matters did not turn out as anticipated.  I agree that, although it may not be practicable or perhaps would not come within the scope of the Bill to give them a pension, at least they ought to get a medal in recognition of their service at that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister can cover that without an amendment to the Bill.  Cannot he cover that point, if he so desires, by an alteration in the statutory regulation as distinct from an amendment to the Bill?  I would urge upon the Minister that where people were available in any way and where circumstances outside their control prevented their being actual participants at the time, he would consider favourably the possibility of giving them recognition on the basis suggested by Deputy O'Higgins or by Deputy MacCarthy, that they were Volunteers available for active service and, as such, would come within the category of 1916 men but possibly not within the category of pensionable 1916 men.</P>

      <P>This section deals only with the extension of time for making petitions under the Act of 1949 and the subject of Deputy O'Higgins's speech covered a much wider scope.  So far as I know, the position would be this. If the persons to whom Deputy O'Higgins refers are in receipt of pensions they have had their cases heard and examined and they are therefore outside the scope of the Bill and we can do nothing about them. I may have a great deal of sympathy with the views expressed, especially in the case of the Cork Brigade, because I do know that they were, to all intents and purposes, in action inasmuch as they were in position and so on.  But we can do nothing about that through the medium of this Bill. I do not know how it can be dealt with now, because the 1949 Act did not deal with any persons who had already received a favourable decision and they are quite outside the scope of the Bill and therefore it would require some other method to achieve the result that Deputy O'Higgins has in mind.</P>

      <P>There was <Col N="2453" /> one point to which I think it is only fair for me to refer.  Deputy Sweetman asked me to examine a matter in relation to Section 11, which is the licensing section by which the Minister may license the company proposed to be set up to engage in the production of some product other than that which it is permitted under the Bill to produce.  In that event there are already, in the Minister's opinion and in my opinion, sufficient safeguards to ensure that any person who is producing that commodity already or who is interested in the production of that commodity in any other way will have ample notice of the Minister's intention to grant such a licence. Under the provisions of Section 11, the Minister must publish notice of his intention to grant such a licence in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i>  Deputy Sweetman suggested that perhaps the Minister's intention might be brought to the notice of the Oireachtas or of the Dáil, I forget which, by having the notice laid on the Table.  I have discussed the matter with the Minister as I promised Deputy Sweetman and we both agree that the provisions of the section as they stand, which provide for publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, are sufficient to bring to the notice of anybody affected, that the granting of such a licence is contemplated by the Minister.</P>

      <P>This State Guarantees Bill is for the purpose of dealing with certain companies that were originally formed in what I might describe as emergency times.  The fact that the form of guarantee is now being included in a permanent Bill on the Statute Book implies, perhaps, that the Government and the Minister consider that they will permanently deal with purchases from outside in respect of certain items by a system of bulk buying.  I think it would be very desirable that we should have an expression of opinion from the Minister on this occasion and I think the Money Resolution is a suitable medium for that expression of opinion as to whether it is the Government's considered viewpoint that in future bulk buying will be the method in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I shall postpone my remarks until we reach the amendment. I would like to put this point on the Money Resolution.  This Resolution is for the purpose of meeting the charges which may come in course of payment on foot of any guarantees given under the Bill.  Quite apart from the larger issues of credit which were raised on the Second Stage, I want to put it to the Minister that the method employed here of financing these transactions by bank overdrafts seems to me to be singularly inappropriate. Take Grain Importers, Limited. As to a large part of the moneys there involved the procedure is that a cargo of grain is purchased, Shipping documents are forwarded here, the cargo puts to sea and on its arrival here it is distributed to millers who promptly recoup Grain Importers for it.  That was the universal practice for the last century and a half in the City of London and to meet that practice there grew up a system of bills, ordinary trading bills.  Now superimposed on the system of trading bills there developed the system of Treasury bills which became a very economic method for a Government of borrowing from the money market. Why does not the Minister employ the trade bill procedure fortified by a Government guarantee for the kind of transaction in which Grain Importers engage where purely temporary accommodation is required?  It may be that a part of the accommodation required by Grain Importers takes the shape of protracted overdrafts but a large part of it should be and could be transacted by bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the average rate of the equivalent of a trade bill carrying a Government guarantee would be equivalent to a Treasury bill and is something <Col N="2456" /> in the order of 1¾ or 1? per cent., While the rate on the overdraft is, I think, at present in the order of 4 or 4½ per cent.  Surely common sense requires that there should be that flexibility in the financing practices contemplated so as to secure for the Exchequer the advantage of the superior rate of interest that would be available if the bill procedure were adopted in lieu of the overdraft device.</P>

We have dealt with Army pensions, with Financial Resolutions, with the Gaeltacht Housing Bill and with a variety of other legislation without a ripple appearing on the surface. with the Ministers in charge of these Bills anxious to meet representations and expressing appreciation of the representations submitted.  The Minister for Finance comes into the House and in seven minutes the House threatens to dissolve into a beargarden, because he says he will not be bound by Standing Orders and if he is bound by Standing Orders he will not play, he will not act and he will not tell the House what they want to know.

In the last analysis, if you fail to meet you commitments I will carry the baby.  I want you to borrow money on the basis that if you are forced by circumstances to fall back on my guarantee my liability will be no more than 1¼ per cent.&rdquo;  Surely that is a matter intimately relevant to the Financial Resolution we are discussing? Surely it is nothing to get cross about or to lose your temper about?  The Minister could examine the question and explain his views. He could say that the plan would not work and that it cannot be done. There would be the same reaction in regard to such an attitude as every other Minister got in this House this morning.  Deputy Traynor, Minister for Defence, had a number of complicated matters to deal with.

So fantastic is the situation that we now find that the real value of the £1 note is something less than 9/- compared with its pre-war value. That unfortunate situation is largely due to the ineffective steps taken by the present Administration in relation to price control for the last 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could understand some fall or decrease in the value of money due to circumstances outside the fiscal control of this country and due to major financial problems.  One could condone <Col N="2463" /> this situation in such circumstances, but what concerns the people is that in the last 18 months, not by any act of omission but by positive Government action, by positive Government policy, prices have been substantially increased.  That is why I say it is important that we should avail of this opportunity to put this Government's record against the background of the propaganda, the policies and the promises they used to get where they now are.</P>
    <P>I had in mind in particular the debate initiated in this House in the autumn of 1950 by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think it is well that people should remember that particular debate because it supplies the touchstone for what I describe as the fraudulent policy of the present Government in relation to price control.  In the autumn of 1950 this country, in common with every other country in Western Europe, was beginning to be affected by the ripples set off by rearmament and the Korean war.  There is no doubt that in the autumn of 1950 an incipient rise in prices, caused by international rearmament, was beginning to be felt in this country.  It was not a serious situation.  It did not call for panic; it did not call for sensational action.  It was a factor that had to be considered by a responsible Government, considered calmly and carefully, but the existence of that particular factor, that slight incipient rise in prices that occurred in August, 1950, and continued up to Christmas of that year, was used deliberately by the Fianna Fáil Party, each and every one of them, to endeavour to charge the inter-Party Government with an ineffective price control and with having no policy in relation to stabilising living costs. Indeed, when the present Tánaiste started the hullabaloo others were ready to follow his lead.</P>
    <P>I recollect that when the Autumn Session of Dáil Éireann commenced in October of 1950 a motion of no confidence in the inter-Party Government was tabled by Deputy Cowan because, he charged, the inter-Party Government had failed effectively to <Col N="2464" /> control prices.  He made that charge following the lead of the present Minister, following the hullabaloo of the Fianna Fáil Party, and following the specious nonsense that had been uttered by Deputies such as Deputy Major de Valera and other Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>What was the situation then?  For two and a half years, from February, 1948, until the late autumn of 1950, the policy of the inter-Party Government and the action of Ministers like the present Deputy Morrissey had effectively stabilised the prices in this country.  There is no one who can now have any doubt about that fact. From February, 1948, to the late autumn of 1950 a pretty sound stabilised price level was maintained here. Agitations with regard to certain commodities had been sponsored, but were fought by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In the spring of each year, butchers had consistently demanded an increase in the price of meat.  That demand was resisted by the Government, and meat was still available at controlled prices to our people.</P>
    <P>With regard to a variety of other commodities, a case had been made to the Government by those engaged in their production for increases in prices.  Nevertheless, following a cohesive, sound, clear policy, the inter-Party Government were able to maintain stabilisation of prices.  That meant for our people and for workers who had got during that period two increases in pay a substantial increase in living standards and an assurance that their pay packet, once it went into their pockets, would not be depreciated in value by rising prices.</P>
    <P>It was with that background that in the autumn of 1950 we had this famous debate on the occasion of the Second Reading of the Supplies and Services Bill.  The present Minister had this to say at column 1291, Volume 123, of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As this Supplies and Services Act is the main legal foundation for the ineffective efforts at price control that the Government is making, it was to have been expected that <Col N="2465" /> the Parliamentary Secretary would devote his remarks almost entirely to the problems of price control and not to other Government activities which are carried on under the authority of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on elsewhere to refer in detail and in his own decisive manner to what he repeatedly described as the ineffective efforts of the inter-Party Government to control prices.  I have no doubt that this particular charge was made knowing it to be groundless. I have no doubt that the then Deputy Lemass in charging the inter-Party Government with ineffective price control knew well that whatever increases in price had taken place were due entirely to international rearmament and circumstances outside the control of the Government. But why did he then, with his tongue in his cheek, seek to make these charges at that time except that he wanted to fish in troubled waters not caring what he caught or the bait he used?</P>
    <P>It is only right that now, some two and a half years later, we on this side of the House should arraign him and every member of his Party and charge them to render an account of their efforts since they have been there to control prices.  In the last 18 months what has happened to the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce?  In the last 18 months what single step has been taken by the present Government to control the price of any commodity?</P>
    <P>Meat has been decontrolled and the announcement of the decontrol of meat was appended to a pious aspiration by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the decontrol of meat would mean a reduction in the price to the consumer.  Does the Minister now think that that pious hope has been justified?  Is he not aware that the decontrol of meat has meant that less meat can be purchased by poorer people because the price has substantially increased?  The present Minister also decontrolled bacon and again the people were assured that the decontrol of bacon would mean a substantial fall in prices.  In fact, the <Col N="2466" /> decontrol of bacon was followed by two extraordinary occurrences&mdash;an increase in the price the consumer had to pay for bacon and a reduction in the price the farmer got for pigs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce decontrolled fish.  Again, we were told that the decontrol of fish would mean that one's Friday and Lenten repast would cost less.  Again, the result has been quite a considerable increases in the price the people have to pay for fish and the virtual disappearance from fish shops of the more popular kinds of fish.  I could go on, as the Minister himself did in the autumn of 1950, and refer to commodity after commodity that has in the last 18 months, under the administration of the present Government, substantially increased in price.  I do not think it is useful or beneficial to the people to continue reciting this long list of wrongs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, as the people outside certainly are satisfied, that in relation to the propaganda with regard to prices each and every member of the present Fianna Fáil Party is equally guilty of a fraudulent political hoax played on the people of this country and that charge, of course, would also apply to at least one of the Independent Deputies who helped to put the present Government where it is.  Whatever may have happened in the past, whatever injurious propaganda may have been used, whatever false promises may have been made and whatever omissions may have occurred, the time has now come when we are entitled to expect from the Government and from the Minister a lead with regard to prices.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister in this House in recent months in effect saying with regard to prices: &ldquo;We must conserve our resources.  We must struggle on and we must hope for the best.&rdquo;  That is, in my opinion, not good enough.  It is not good enough to expect an Irish Minister for Industry and Commerce to hope that import prices in coming months may drop and that if they do drop subject to the supply situation here the reduction in price may be carried over to the consumer.  That kind of thumb twirling and waiting <Col N="2467" /> around hoping for the best is not good enough in the present situation.</P>
    <P>We are now living in a country that is bearing an awful burden of taxation pressing down on every section and each class.  That burden of taxation has to be considered also in conjunction with the burden of rising prices.  We have Government Ministers parading around as a policy an assurance that no one in this country, civil servants and other large sections, can expect any increase in pay or salary.  There is now looming out of the background the shadows of a new standstill in relation to wages and incomes.  That is a matter we may discuss on another occasion but whatever the Government's policy is with regard to wages, salaries and incomes surely it must be coupled with an effective effort to stabilise prices?</P>
    <P>There can be no sense in the complacent outlook of the present Government when real values of money are dropping substantially each week. There can be no sense in a Government outlook that permits workers' wages to be halved before even the unfortunate worker has the opportunity of spending his pay packet.  It is in that situation that now, after 18 months or almost two years of the present Government, the people make the demand that if they are going to stay there and want to stay there or keep the present set up and the present Dáil in existence, at least they must come together and produce a policy.  If they do not want to produce a policy, let them take the other step, dissolve the Dáil and get out&mdash; because we on this side have a policy, a policy that was in operation for three and a half years, that effectively stabilised prices, that effectively guaranteed to workers and all persons dependent on salaries a pretty uniform real money value.  We have a policy now.  It can go into operation and have a fair opportunity of being effective. We at least make the demand that if the Government want to stay there they must produce something.</P>
    <P>I cannot for the life of me see what the Government's policy is regarding <Col N="2468" /> prices.  No evidence has been given since they came into office that they are concerned with anything but shelving responsibility, decontrolling commodity after commodity, letting prices be fixed by someone else and generally letting matters drift.  As a result, we have had in the last 18 months, unfortunately, a very vicious competition between different producers, between different sections, which in their turn have been faced by rising costs, due to faulty control by the Government and who legitimately must make a demand from the Government for a rise in the price of commodities on account of those rising costs.  That vicious circle has been continuing and the consumer has been paying all the time.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for one moment that even the major portion of the increases that have taken place is the direct responsibility of Government policy.  I do not make the kind of case that the Minister himself made in the debate I referred to, in the autumn of 1950.  Sufficient for the charge I make is this, that much of the price increases that have occurred is due to direct positive action by the present Government and that that action has taken place at a time when there has been no policy, disclosed anyway, to control or deal with prices.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I welcome the opportunity given by this debate to discuss this serious problem and to assure the Minister, If assurance is required, that this problem is now as real as ever it was in the worst years of the emergency, that people are being driven to desperation by rising prices and that the harassed housewife who appeared in Fianna Fáil advertisements in the last election with grey hair now has white hair and that the situation is far more serious than it was at any time in the past.  That is due not merely to the problem itself but also to the fact that the people can see no redress coming from the Government, no policy being made available except assurances such as we have had from the Minister in the past: &ldquo;Hold on, hold tight; there will be something turning up around the corner.&rdquo;  I hope that, as a result of this debate, we will <Col N="2469" /> get a statement of policy that will give the people some assurance that in coming months some efforts will be made to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Alfred Byrne moved his motion, he had the frankness, or the astuteness, to say that while he deplored the increase in prices he did not know what could be done about it and that he had no proposals to make regarding it.  As a feat of oratory, Deputy O'Higgins's effort was far more pretentious than Deputy Alfred Byrne's, but it disclosed that he had not got either the frankness or the astuteness which Deputy Byrne displayed. He attempted to suggest that there was something which the Govern-could do now which would bring down prices, although he did not say what it was, and that he or his Party had a policy which could be applied and would have that effect, although he did not reveal it.</P>
      <P>He has described the Government's attitude to prices as fraudulent.  Whatever adjective the Deputy might have used in relation to that policy, that is the one which is least appropriate. Our attitude towards this problem of prices might have been described as impolitically frank or crudely honest, but certainly it could not be described as fraudulent.  We never at any time attempted to conceal facts from the people or induce them to believe that there was any process capable of being applied by the Government which, at a time when material costs and wages were increasing, would enable prices to be brought down.</P>
      <P>There is one thing I will undertake to the Dáil and to the public, that in my administration of the functions of the Department of Industry and Commerce in relation to price control I will not engage in pretence or fraud of any kind.  I will be more specific. in that I will give a precise indication of the type of thing I will not do. Deputy O'Higgins was indiscreet in referring to meat, because the illustration I am going to give relates to meat.</P>

      <P>I will tell the facts as I know them.  In the spring of 1950 the Prices Advisory Body investigated the prices permitted to be charged for meat by butchers in Dublin.  At that time the price of meat was subject to control by official regulation.  The price of cattle had risen in the market and the butchers claimed that in consequence they should be allowed an increased retail price for meat.  The Prices Advisory Body recommended that they were entitled to the increase and made their report to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, a report which proposed that he should make an amended Order permitting increased prices for meat.  The then Minister, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, brought into his office the representatives of the butchers' organisations. He told them he had got this report from the Prices Advisory Body, he told them that he recognised that they were entitled to be allowed to charge increased prices for meat.  He told them, however, that it was politically inconvenient for him to make an Order sanctioning higher prices and therefore he was not going to make the Order, but that they could charge whatever prices they thought proper; and he gave them an undertaking that inspectors of the Department would be instructed not to interfere with them and that no prosecution would follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter of price control is of considerable importance in its relationship to the general level of economic activity.  It is quite easy for a Government to decide that under no circumstances will they sanction an increase in price for anything.  They can maintain that decision and even enforce it, and if trade costs are rising &mdash;either the cost of materials or the labour cost of production&mdash;then the effect of maintaining and enforcing an unrealistic price by Government Order is to kill production and to reduce employment.  Any system of intelligent price control must be designed solely to ensure that there is no unnecessary element in the price, that the price is fairly related to the costs and is kept related to the costs so that the public are protected against exploitation but trade allowed to proceed at the same time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said that prices began to rise in 1950 following the outbreak of the Korean war which started an inflationary movement over the whole world.  That is correct.  He said also that I then criticised in a debate here the ineffective measures of price control in operation.  Why does he now query the accuracy of that criticism of mine, because, within a few weeks, the then Government admitted the ineffectiveness of the price control arrangements in operation?  The Deputy said that the rise in prices caused no panic.  It appeared to us that it caused very considerable panic in the Coalition Government because, before the end of that debate, as the Deputy may remember, a Minister who had no public responsibility for price control, the Minister for Social Welfare, came to the Dáil and announced what looked like panic measures to deal with the situation, measures which included the establishment of the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The origin of that body is shrouded in mystery, so far as I am aware. <Col N="2472" /> There is nothing in the records of the Department to suggest that the Minister for Industry and Commerce or any of his officials knew of the intention to set it up, or of the intention to enact the standstill prices Order which coincided with its establishment before the announcements were made in the Dáil.  Nevertheless, the Prices Advisory Body was set up and that body has functioned ever since.  I want the Deputy to remember, and the House to know, that the same Prices Advisory Body, with its membership virtually unchanged, is still functioning and still exercising the powers given to it under the Order which created it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No Order was made by me decontrolling the price of any commodity or increasing any price except on the recommendation of that body or where the increase in price was the direct consequence of a Government decision, such as the announcement in relation to butter of last week.  Every other Order made by me sanctioning such an increase was made upon the recommendation of that body.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the Order I made decontrolling the price of fish. He should know that the desirability of decontrolling the prices of fish was investigated at a public inquiry held by the Prices Advisory Body, and the Order I made was on its recommendation, following its examination of all the information obtained at that public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister misunderstands my criticism in that regard. That was followed by an announcement from the Minister's Department that the result would be a reduction in price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was followed by an announcement of the view expressed to me by the Prices Advisory Body. Their advice was that, as in Great Britain, where a similar course had been followed a short time previously, there was likely to be some dislocation of the trade for a period, but that, in a short time, the trade would settle <Col N="2473" /> down into the new conditions and that the result would be not merely a reduction in the price of some classes of fish but a very considerable improvement in the supply.  May I say that an investigation which I caused to be made by officers of my Department in the past month confirmed that conditions in the trade had developed as the Prices Advisory Body had forecast?</P>
      <P>The cost of living has not risen merely in this country.  If we are to have any intelligent debate here upon practical means of keeping prices down, we must at least advert to the fact that whatever is causing them to rise is operating throughout the world. In fact, the cost of living has increased in this country by less than in most other countries.  The country with which it is easiest for us to make comparisons is Great Britain, and, since the upward movement in prices began in 1950, the cost of living has risen less here than in Great Britain, so far as is shown by the official cost-of-living index numbers of both countries.</P>
      <P>There is another fact which is interesting. Deputy O'Higgins suggested that there was some movement by the Government to restrict wage increases. There has been no such movement.  The fact which I want him to know, however, is that, although the cost of living, as shown by the British index number, rose by a higher percentage in Britain than here, wage rates rose by a greater percentage in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to refer to them in a moment because I am anxious to get the position of the Dáil in relation to them clear.  The only positive measure the Government could take that would bring prices down is to subsidise them.  We are opposed to subsidies in principle.  May I say that my experience as a Minister over 20 years is that the introduction of subsidy into any trade leads to inefficiency and higher costs, that, in the long run, the public pay more through taxation and prices than they would have to pay if the element of subsidy had never appeared, and that our aim should be to get back to a situation when, in every trade and in relation to every commodity, State subsidies will disappear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to try to bring back into operation this year, however, the price subsidies which were terminated in last year's Budget, it would mean that we would have to face this year an additional £10,000,000 in taxation.  It is foolish for people to talk about reintroducing subsidies without facing up to the practical difficulty of doing it. In my belief, it would not be possible to raise an additional £10,000,000 in taxation from the Irish people, that you could not devise a system of taxes which would bring in that amount.  In any event, is there any reason to think that the people will be better off by <Col N="2475" /> having some prices reduced by subsidies, if other prices are increased at the same time by higher taxes? There is no sense in it, because, in the process of paying out subsidies and collecting taxes, higher administrative expense will arise and clearly the people will get back in benefits through subsidies less than they pay in taxes to make the subsidies possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary thing that Point 15 crept into your programme.  You promised to maintain subsidies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So we are.  The Book of Estimates circulated to-day shows under the Vote for Industry and Commerce a provision for food subsidies in excess of the total cost of these subsidies in the year 1947 when the then Fianna Fáil Government introduced them.</P>
      <P>It is true that food prices have risen. The agricultural index number published in this country shows that, for the past three years, there has been a steady rise in agricultural prices.  That rise was accentuated last week by the Government's decision to increase the price of butter so that farmers supplying milk to creameries would get a higher price for that milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are getting it now. There has been some misunderstanding and a little misrepresentation in regard to the cost of butter.  I do not know if any Deputy in this Dáil thinks the farmers are getting too much for anything. It is an arguable point of view but no Deputy in this Dáil has ever argued that the farmers are getting too much for their produce.  Does any Deputy in this House think that the milk producers should not have got the increase in the price of milk which they are now obtaining as a result of the increase in the retail price of butter? There is no sense in denouncing the Government for sanctioning that increase and at the same time arguing in favour of increased prices for milk to milk producers.  You cannot possibly do that without increasing the price of butter.  The margins allowed for the <Col N="2476" /> manufacture of butter by creameries or for the retail distribution of butter are very small&mdash;perhaps they are even too small.  Certainly, there is nothing in these margins which would permit of a higher price for milk to the producers without a corresponding increase in the price of butter.  If, therefore, anybody argues that the price of butter should not be increased he is arguing that the price paid to milk producers for their milk should not be increased.  He is arguing that the milk producers should not be allowed to pay the higher wages to their workers which have been sanctioned by the Agricultural Wages Board this year.  Deputy O'Leary referred to these wages.  They have been increased in each of the last three years and this year the minimum rate which is enforceable by law has been raised so that the farmer has no option but to pay it.  Therefore, any Deputy is arguing against that increased wage to agricultural workers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The only way by which that higher wage can be paid to farm workers and a higher price paid to creamery milk suppliers for their milk is to sanction a higher retail price for butter.  The only thing the Government controls in the whole industry is the retail price of butter and that is the only way we could allow the farmers to get the higher price for their milk and the workers to get the increased wage.</P>

      <P>Personally, I am satisfied that there is nothing in the margin allowed either for the manufacture of milk into butter or for the distribution of butter by retail shops which could meet that situation.  These margins have been pared so low that it is far more likely that they will be the subject of protest by those receiving them than that any opportunity will arise for considering their reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that when the Government <Col N="2477" /> decided to sanction the increase in the price of butter from the 1st March it recognised that the higher price would have to apply not merely to imported New Zealand butter, but also to Irish creamery butter in cold store.  An attempt is made to suggest that, in some way, an increase in the price of that butter in store is benefiting the Exchequer.  The Exchequer does not benefit one halfpenny as a result of that transaction.  The full amount of any profit made upon the sale of New Zealand butter and the full amount of any higher margin secured on the Irish butter in cold store is paid into what is called the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund.  The purpose of that fund, as its name implies, is to stabilise the price of butter.  Every Deputy here knows that, before the war, it was normal for the price of butter to be much lower in the summer than in the winter.  The price of butter fluctuated with the seasons.  It reached its lowest point about July or August, and it reached its highest point about January or February.  Because of the regulations which were in force during the war years, the public have now become accustomed to a situation in which the price of butter remains uniform throughout the whole year.</P>

      <P>The uniformity of price is secured through the operation of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund.  As a result of the adjustment in price from 1st March, there will now accumulate in that fund something less than £200,000 which will be paid over to cover the cost of cold storing butter for next winter.  It will thereby ensure that the price of butter will not have to be increased next winter.  That fund keeps the price uniform during the whole year.  There is no benefit to the Exchequer.  If the actual cost for cold storing butter for next winter's consumption proves to be less than the amount in the fund, the balance will be accumulated <Col N="2478" /> until next year to serve the same purpose in 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of some misstatements which have appeared in the Press, I think it is desirable that that position should clearly be understood.  If the price of butter had not been increased on the 1st March&mdash;if the increase had been postponed to the 1st May&mdash;then, of course, the cost of cold storing next winter's butter would have to be recovered from the creameries and the increase in milk prices which the producers are getting would have been fractionally less.</P>
      <P>I want to express considerable doubt as to whether the maintenance of price control by the Government in relation to a number of commodities is keeping these prices up or down.  I have frequently referred before to that doubt in my mind.  There is a possibility that, in respect of some commodities, the fixing of a maximum price by the Government gives, by implication, approval to a price which might not be secured if normal trade competition alone determined it.  It is a fact that bread and flour are being sold by a number of firms and in many parts of the country at less than the maximum prices fixed by Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, when that fact was reported to me I had a re-examination made of the information upon which the Order was based, and I have up to the present been unable to find any good grounds for altering the maximum prices fixed.  But, apparently, some bakeries, by various methods, can produce and sell bread cheaper than others.  There is at least one bakery in Dublin which can do so. If price control was removed, it is possible that that one bakery would reduce its prices, but it is clear to me from the information available to me that other bakeries could not follow suit without working at a loss.  Now, what would the result of that situation be?  It would mean that trade would become concentrated in a smaller number of firms and that other firms would go out of business.  That might <Col N="2479" /> be a good result, but it is a result that we should recognise may arise if we were to adopt a course of decontrolling and fixing a price which was reasonable in relation to the costs of a single bakery, but unreasonably low in relation to the costs of others.</P>
    <P>The fact is that, in operating price control, the Orders have to be based on average costs, and average costs are what the term implies&mdash;not the actual costs of any concern, but the average for all concerns.  The average may be higher than the actual costs in some businesses and lower than the actual costs in others, and if price control is abolished it is reasonable to assume that those firms whose costs are lower than the average will take advantage of that position to attract more business by reducing prices, and other firms will be forced to follow suit either by operating at a loss or by adjusting their manufacturing processes to enable them to carry on.</P>
    <P>I recognise, as well as any Deputy here, the political problems involved in this.  It is far better for a Government to come in here with an announcement that it is going to control all prices, that it is going to establish a special body under a judge of the Supreme Court to investigate all applications for price increases than to propose that the Government should disappear out of the picture altogether, that price control of an emergency kind should cease, and that normal competitive factors alone should be allowed to operate.  Yet, I am certain that, notwithstanding the political difficulty of following that course, if it were followed, after an initial period of possible dislocation and upset, the general level of prices would be lower than that which appears to be sanctioned by the maximum price Orders made on Government authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that he did not suggest that the major part of the increase in prices which took place in the past couple of years was the direct result of Government policy.  Some part of it was.  We do not deny that. When the Budget problem of 1952 was under consideration by the Government <Col N="2480" /> we decided, as a matter of policy, that it was better, in the interests of the people, that the gap between revenue and expenditure should be in part closed by the withdrawal of the food subsidies than by imposing higher taxes on other commodities.  We did that, recognising that it would also be necessary to make consequential changes in social welfare services which would increase the cost.  Let me remind the Dáil that, simultaneously with the withdrawal of these subsidies, children's allowances, widows' and orphans' pensions, blind pensions, old age pensions, unemployment assistance payments and unemployment insurance payments were all increased, and increased by an amount which was adequate to compensate the recipients for the effect of the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be any suggestion that these food subsidies should be reintroduced, and that the Government should take the responsibility of raising, by higher taxes, an additional £10,000,000 to restore them, is it also intended that these additional benefits should be withdrawn?  I doubt if any Deputy will in fact propose that, and that is another reason why we should face this position realistically. There is a problem there, the problem of rising prices, a problem which, as Deputy O'Higgins has admitted, cannot, in its major part, be affected by any action of the Government except such action involves the provision of direct subsidies which is impracticable in present circumstances and is undesirable in any circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What then is the future prospect? We know that the factor which set off this increase in prices was the international rise in the cost of materials which followed the outbreak of the Korean war.  That rise in import prices continued unabated until about August, 1951.  Then the rise tapered off. Since then the general tendency in international prices has been downward, and our import price index so reveals. The full effect of the rise in the cost of imported materials did not reappear in <Col N="2481" /> our retail prices until 1952, and by then, because of the rise in the cost of living which had begun with the outbreak of the Korean war and continued right through 1950 and 1951, wage rates were being increased also.</P>
    <P>Now, the position, as I see it, is that the effect of the lower prices of imported materials is being nullified by the increasing labour costs and other internal costs in the meantime, but this process of wage adjustments to meet the higher cost of living is now coming to an end.  Most trades have already carried through their adjustments, and it is reasonable to assume that, by the spring or summer of this year, the general process of adjustment will have been completed.  If, therefore, the present trend in the cost of imported materials continues, we can hope, with some confidence, that by then a position of price stability will have been achieved.  That is the desirable position. It is far more important, in relation to their effect on economic and social conditions, that prices should remain stable than that they should fall.</P>
    <P>I want again to ask Deputies to remember that there never was a time in the world's history in any country in which the general price movement was persistently downward that there was not at the same time pronounced unemployment and a trade slump.  It is when prices are rising that trade is good, and when prices are falling that trade is bad.  When prices are rising, people are disposed to buy in advance, to accumulate stocks, and get whatever profit increasing price may bring to them.  When prices are falling people are always disposed to put off buying in the hope of getting better value later.  Traders, wholesalers and manufacturers tend to keep stocks to the minimum for fear they may be involved in loss.  From many points of view the social consequences of a downward movement in prices are more severe than the consequences of an upward movement. The ideal situation is one in which prices remain stable, where people can reckon with confidence for a reasonable period ahead that money will retain its value.  That is something which cannot be done by Government <Col N="2482" /> action alone.  It can be done only by the combined efforts of all sections of the community, working to get the same result.  If we all decide that we are not going to incur higher expenditure on new Government services that may mean higher taxes, if we are to try to keep the tax structure more or less unchanged, if we are to try to keep the price structure uniform, then we all must agree&mdash;farmers, workers, manufacturers, and traders&mdash; that stability is the desirable end and that we will work together to secure it.  If any one section decides to break the line, then the line cannot be maintained because the competitive race to get sectional advantage will be resumed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that the £1 has been devalued, that it is now worth 9/- as compared with pre-war and some larger number of shillings as compared with an intermediate date. That is true.  But Deputies opposite must not forget that they took a decision to devalue the £1 in 1949.</P>

      <P>The effect is to reduce the incomes of the people by making the money they have buy less.  I am not criticising the decision to devalue the £1.  I think that, in the circumstances of 1949, following the decision of the British Government, there was little option open to the Government <Col N="2483" /> here but to take that step but it was thoroughly dishonest for the then Minister for Finance to do down to Radio Éireann and broadcast an announcement that the devaluation of the £1 would not cause prices to rise. Of course, it was bound to cause prices to rise and did cause prices to rise.  It started this process of adjustment which was accelerated by the post-Korean inflation, which has continued ever since and is only now coming to an end.  It is equally true to say that, if there was revaluation of the £1, prices would fall.  Whether that would be to our advantage or not is another question.</P>

      <P>Nobody is denying that the cost of living has gone up, that prices have risen.  What has happened is, in my view, permanent.  We are not going to get back again to pre-war prices.  There never was a world war where the price level after the war was not permanently higher than it was before the war.  Saying that the £1 now is worth 9/-, as compared with 1939, is just as sensible as saying that the £1 to-day will buy as much as 1/- would buy 100 years ago.  All economic progress requires a steady inflationary trend.  It is only when the inflationary trend gets out of hand that economic and social difficulties result.  The whole history of the world has shown that money tends gradually to lose its buying value, and, in my view, whenever in the history of the world that trend was reversed, as in the major slump that we had ten years after the last war, there was a period when things went bad.  We do not look back on the 1929-31 period with any desire to see it restored here.</P>

      <P>My expectation is that, <Col N="2484" /> as a result of the present movement in international prices and the completion of the process of adjusting internal wages and other costs to the higher level of prices, a position of stability is in sight.  I am not claiming that that position will be brought about by any action of the Government. It will be the product of economic forces which the Government can only influence in a very slight degree.</P>
      <P>We are maintaining the Prices Advisory Body in operation.  It investigates every application for either an increase in prices or the decontrol of prices.  There are few applications coming before it now.  Its work also appears to me to be coming to an end.  We are reaching a situation where it will be possible for the Government to relinquish its emergency powers, to get back to the measures of price control which were deemed adequate in pre-war conditions, measures which will have less relationship to emergency problems than to the long-term problems of a protected economy.</P>
      <P>I am putting forward that view as a forecast based upon my reading of the facts, not as an attempt to indicate a position which the Government has decided to reach because the Governments decisions in this matter will be far less influential in producing that situation than the general attitude of the community as a whole.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste has given us a highly technical address on the problems which surround the subject matter of Deputy Alfred Byrne's motion.  It is regrettable that in the whole course of his speech we find no ray of hope whatsoever held out to the people, no definite assurance that they will be eased of the burdens which have fallen upon their shoulders in the shape of the high cost of living.  There was, rather, the customary prophecy of the Fianna Fáil Party of gloom, doom, and still further gloom and doom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed, and I am sure everybody has noticed, that when questions relating to the cost of living come to be discussed at chambers of commerce, at meetings of employers' <Col N="2485" /> organisations throughout the country and in places where one would expect a more enlightened view of the problems surrounding the high cost of living, there has been a definite campaign to place the responsibility for the high cost of living upon the workers and principally upon the trade unions.  A common fallacy which has even found credence amongst a small section of workers is that if the trade union movement did not seek to improve wages there would be some chance of stabilisation of prices.  That idea has been propagated very extensively through the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is so.  One comes up against it every day of the week.  It has been hinted at on occasion by the Tánaiste in speeches here as Minister and previously, as a Deputy in opposition. It has been hinted at and has been stated by Deputies belonging to other Parties in the House.  There has been a very definite campaign to try to convince ordinary people that if it were not for the demands for increased wages or the increased wages secured our problem in relation to the high cost of living would be solved.  It is, of course, completely dishonest to try to instil that into the minds of the people and it does not serve the purpose of those who have real control over the destinies of the country, those who are in control of industry and business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How little do we hear in this House of the profit element in relation to prices?  We hear of labour costs, the costs of raw material, the effects of wars, and a great deal of technical jargon which it is difficult for any but those who have made a thorough study of economics to follow.  How little do we hear of the effect which profits have on prices?  In common with the rest of my Party, and I believe in common with a lot of people in other Parties also, I believe that a great deal of the responsibility for high prices and the high cost of living, as we know it, must be laid on the shoulders of those who are in a position to put on the market of this country and indeed the markets of other countries throughout the <Col N="2486" /> world, goods which must be bought by the people if the people are to live. because these individuals, whether they are industrialists, financiers or businessmen, to a great extent, at any rate. have a free hand in relation to profits.</P>
    <P>I do not think there has ever been in the history of our native Governments any determined attempt made to control or bring within reasonable bounds the activities and the desires of the profit-makers in industry and in business generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister has admitted that there have been increases in the cost of living which resulted directly from Government action.  These increases are the ones which press most seriously on the people.  If you take the period between February, 1951, shortly before the general election, and the middle of 1952, looking at the index figure, taking into account the reflection in the index figure of the reduction in the food subsidies, assessing roughly the increases in the Budget in relation to beer and tobacco and the prices of other commodities not affected by the Budget in that period but which were increased nevertheless by reason of other forces and influences, I think it is correct to say that the cost of living over that period increased by approximately 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>As a result of a parliamentary question to the Taoiseach in June or July, it can be deduced that the purchasing power of wages during that period in the City and County of Dublin as compared with 1939 was 93 per cent. of what it had been in 1939, showing a very considerable reduction in the standard of living of the workers in the Dublin area.  If we cast our minds back to 1939, it cannot be argued that the standard of living of the people, particularly of the workers in the rural and urban areas, was by any means satisfactory.  Yet, statistically at least, it can be shown that that standard of living has been substantially reduced inasmuch as the purchasing power of wages has been reduced.</P>
    <P>The present Government came into office because they claimed that they could give the people a more prosperous existence than they enjoyed <Col N="2487" /> during the three years of the inter-Party Government régime.  Will the Tánaiste or any member of the Fianna Fáil Party argue that the past two years of Fianna Fáil administration have compared in prosperity with those three years?  I think it is beyond question and accepted even by the most convinced members of the Fianna Fáil Party that the economic history of the country since the advent of the Fianna Fáil Government has been one of disaster.  Whatever excuse may be offered by the Tánaiste or the Government for that development, the fact is that the Government sought and achieved power on the promise that they would bring about for the people a better condition of affairs than previously existed, but the result has been quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>We have the dual evils of the ever-increasing cost of living and unemployment increasing by approximately 1,000 per week.  The Tánaiste stated that these were problems for which there does not seem to be any easy solution.  I do not think it will be denied that the Prices Advisory Body, which was the subject of criticism and attack by the Fianna Fáil Party when it was established by the previous Administration, has performed a very useful function.  But of course it did not and it does not represent the final step that can or should be taken in so far as the control of prices is concerned. It represented the first step, and I think it was a fairly good beginning, because it has established the principle that the people have the right to know what way businesses are run and what margin of profit is being enjoyed by the producers of goods essential to the life of the nation.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Prices Advisory Body was met by many industrialists with cries of outrage because they apparently thought that, no matter what they were producing, and no matter how essential that production was to the life of the nation, they had some prescriptive right to the production of those goods and some divine right to conceal their profits while making what profits they liked at <Col N="2488" /> the expense of the people.  To some extent at least, and without infringing rights, because nobody wants to infringe the rights of individuals, the Prices Advisory Body was a step in the right direction so far as that reactionary mentality is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am principally concerned with the fact that last year the Government imposed on the people and on the working classes in Dublin City and County in particular a burden which they have been unable to bear by reducing food subsidies and by increasing taxation at the same time upon the minor luxuries of drink and tobacco.  The Government thereby definitely imposed a hardship on the people to which the people have been unable to acclimatise themselves.</P>
    <P>As recently as last week we were startled by the news that butter would be increased in price by 5d. or 4d. per lb., to a maximum of 4/2.  I believe the Government has made no serious effort to restrain those who are making demands upon the people in seeking increased prices for the goods they produce.  Neither has it made any serious effort to restrain itself.  Has the Government given any thought whatsoever to the difficulties that beset a householder in Ballyfermot for instance? Has the Government considered the position of the casual worker employed in the building industry? During a full week such a worker may earn £6 14s.  We all know that building is practically at a standstill now.  That casual worker may, and probably has, a family of the order of five or six children.  Under the renting system adopted by the Dublin Corporation such a householder will pay not less than £1 per week in rent.  That leaves him with something over £5 to provide for his family.  How, in the name of Providence, can such a worker be expected to do that?</P>
    <P>How can the Government justify increasing the price of butter to 4/2 per lb.  when there are thousands of workers in the City of Dublin living at that level, not to speak of all the thousands who are living below that level and who are dependent upon unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance?  Such action on the part of the Government betrays a complete <Col N="2489" /> lack of appreciation of the sufferings of our people.  I do not hope for any spectacular results from this motion, but it does provide us with an opportunity at any rate of stating our views so far as the cost of living is concerned. The leopard does not change his spots and Fianna Fáil will not change its attitude towards the people or its policy simply because we raise our voices here.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us now&mdash;this is something my constituents would like to know&mdash; if it is proposed to place still further imposts on the people in the forthcoming Budget.</P>

The people have lost confidence in the Government. Were they given an opportunity I am convinced they would vote for a change of administration.  It is not right for a Government which has lost the confidence of the people to hold on in the fashion in which the present Government is holding on.  I register a very emphatic protest against the action of the Government in increasing the price of butter.

      <P>Having listened to the Minister's speech, I think it is a fair description of it to say that the net result of it is that the whole position is hopeless, that prices are rising due to a variety of causes for which the Minister adduced a number of arguments, but that the Government and the Department of Industry and Commerce can do nothing about it. The Minister, in opening, referred to the fact that the remarks of Deputy O'Higgins in describing the Government's <Col N="2490" /> policy as fraudulent or dishonest were inappropriately applied; he claimed that, whatever else might be said of the Government's policy, it was honest.  He used the phrase that &ldquo;it might be described as impolitically frank or crudely honest&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister, however, omitted to explain to the House and to the country the causes for the departure from the published policy of the Fianna Fáil Party as announced after the General Election of May, 1951.  After that general election, when Fianna Fáil had failed to secure a majority of the elected Deputies and when they were seeking to convince some Deputies who at that time described themselves as &ldquo;independent&rdquo;, they published a 17-point programme.  Point 15 of that programme laid down the Fianna Fáil approach to subsidies and to price control, and explained that it was intended to maintain subsidies and a system of price control.</P>
      <P>In the Budget of last year subsidies were either abolished or substantially reduced.  For some commodities they were abolished; for all commodities I think they were reduced.  Now the Minister argued here this morning that because the total sum voted for subsidies as shown in the Book of Estimates is higher than the sum included in the Supplementary Budget of 1947 they are still maintaining subsidies.  He went on to express the view that subsidies were bad and that it would be impossible now to reintroduce subsidies at the required level if prices were to be maintained at the level which existed prior to the Budget of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My real complaint against the Government is that, in the light of the circumstances which the Minister described here, the Government decided in the Budget of last year to reduce subsidies.  The Minister has referred here to the fact that the world trend in regard to a number of prices was downward and he hopes&mdash;although this view has often been expressed&mdash; for a period of price stability.  I remember some time last autumn he expressed a similar view.  He now expresses a view that we may reach that desirable situation next autumn. <Col N="2491" /> This hoped-for drop in price levels or hoped-for period of stability has not been reached.  Although a variety of commodities have shown a tendency to drop in price, it was in those circumstances, when price stability might have been reached, that the Government decided to reduce or eliminate the food subsidies.  The result of that decision has been that a wages and prices spiral was started after the Budget of last year.  The present cost-of-living index figure shows that the cost of living has risen 12 or 13 points over what it was immediately after the Government came into office.</P>
    <P>It has been argued here that the social welfare benefits that were given compensated for the deterioration which occurred due to the elimination or reduction of subsidies in last year's Budget.  Even if we admit for a moment that it went some way towards it&mdash;and I do not believe anyone could say that 1/6 a week for the old age pensioner compensated for the substantial increase in the price of foodstuffs occasioned by the removal of subsidies last year&mdash;the position has deteriorated since then.  Only last week there was this rise in the price of butter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has argued, on the one hand, that if we imported foreign butter it would be possible to sell it here at 3/9 a lb.  I think that was the price mentioned by him during a discussion in University College recently.  On the other hand, it has been stated that if price control was abandoned a reduction might take place.  We must stand on either one foot or the other.  We cannot suggest that because it was possible to import some commodity from some part of the world that we are not doing it because it would jeopardise our own interests or the interests of the farmer; that, on the other hand, we would allow particular prices to find their own level if it would not effect the interests of some workers or the interests of the smaller concerns.  We should either abandon price control or apply it effectively.</P>
    <P>The Minister's case is that the Prices Advisory Body recommended a number <Col N="2492" /> of these increases.  I do not believe that the Government should shelter behind the Prices Advisory Body and, at the same time, make the case that price control is keeping prices up. Either drop the Prices Advisory Body and let prices find their own level over the whole range of prices or let the Prices Advisory Body function for all commodities rather than for some and not for others.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that in almost every case&mdash;certainly in every case of an essential foodstuff&mdash;where decontrol has been allowed to operate, there has been a rise in prices.  There has been a rise in the price of meat and the price of fish.  Almost every other commodity that was the subject of a recent investigation and in respect of which decontrol followed, has increased in price.  The real weakness, however, is the fact that the Government reduced or eliminated subsidies last year.  That began a wages demand due to the increase in the cost of living, and that wages demand, in turn, affected the prices of other commodities.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it was reasonable to expect price stabilisation last year if that increase had not been allowed to take place.  However serious some price rises might have been, the result of the Government's decision in last year's Budget was to unleash the full effect of a substantial rise in the price of many essential commodities.  That was followed by these wage demands.  It is a matter of satisfaction that it was possible to reach agreement on a number of these wage applications without any serious dislocation and I think that the public servants who have been affected by the Government's decision not to honour in the current year the award of the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal, have legitimate grounds for serious complaint.  If any other employer had so acted in face of an award of the Labour Court, in face of an award, say, for E.S.B. workers, or C.I.E. workers, it does not require much imagination to realise what the result would have been.  The same is true in the case of the Government, which should set an example.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2493" /> I have sympathy with the viewpoint expressed by the Minister when he asks: &ldquo;Can we get agreement not to press for increased demands or for increased sums of money for particular types of expenditure or for particular schemes or services?&rdquo; That is all right provided it goes for the whole field, but if certain sections get an increase, if increased expenditure is sanctioned for particular schemes, if proposals are approved for increased expenditure or for the granting of increased prices for certain commodities, then it is unreasonable to suggest that other sections should withhold making their demands or that other sections who have already made their demands should not be granted the same consideration, and the same percentage increase from the public purse, as is granted in particular cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech, referred to the fact that in a period when prices are falling trade is bad, slump conditions follow and generally conditions are worse for the community as a whole.  At the present time prices in general are not falling, and I do not think anyone can claim that conditions are good.  It is common knowledge that in many trades and businesses slump conditions exist.  In other cases there has been a trade recession and although prices are rising there has been a substantial rise in the number of unemployed.  The latest figure is over 89,000 for the last date in February.  The condition which the Minister has mentioned in which prices are not falling, has been followed here by slump conditions although prices are continuing at a high level.</P>
    <P>We have had recently discussions on some economic factors which have contributed to the present trade recession. It was suggested here in the course of a debate that some of the unemployment which resulted was due to the heavy imports during the end of 1950 and early in 1951.  Allowing that that may be true in respect of certain commodities, does anyone suggest that houses were imported or that any effort was made to import commodities of that type?  Yet we see from the most recently published figures that there has been a substantial increase in <Col N="2494" /> the numbers of unemployed workers formerly employed in housing and construction work.  I noticed recently references by the Minister for Local Government, and, I think, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to the fact that professional charges contributed to high building costs.  If professional charges are the only charges contributing to high building costs&mdash; and I do not claim to be in a position to evaluate the services rendered&mdash; does anyone suggest that professional charges in the aggregate have increased building costs by anything like the figure due to increased interest charges for small dwellings loans and housing loans generally?  I do not believe that that case can be seriously made.  The Taoiseach recently said that if the situation were analysed, the Government would do something about it.  It is common knowledge amongst workers in this city, and I think amongst skilled tradesmen in most cities throughout the country, that there has been a serious drop in building operations and that if it were not for local authority schemes the situation would be much worse.  In many counties the situation has deteriorated because many of the local authority schemes have either come to an end or are nearing completion.</P>
    <P>If the case is to be made that certain factors are contributing to high building costs, then let us have it analysed, but do not make a bad case in an effort to gloss over the real cause of it.  If professional fees are responsible then let that aspect be examined. If the cost of materials is responsible, if wages are responsible, if interest charges are responsible, or to whatever extent all these in the aggregate affect the cost of building, let the question be analysed, and let us have a clear picture presented to us.  The serious situation that now exists in the country is that, although there appears to be a world-wide downward trend in the price of some commodities, we have reached a position here in which we have become a high-price country. A variety of factors are contributing to that.  We have, on the whole, reached a stage in which the cost of living here is high compared with that existing in any similar country while <Col N="2495" /> the employment position shows tendencies of serious deterioration.</P>
    <P>I saw recently a statement in which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach referred to the fact that there were more people in employment. It may be true that there are more people in certain types of employment, but it is equally true that there are more people unemployed now than at any time in the last ten years.  There is now no accurate check on the numbers emigrating.  I do not believe I am exaggerating when I say that Deputies are besieged by persons seeking work, persons genuinely anxious to get employment and who find it difficult or impossible to do so. I do not suggest that all this has been caused by the present Government. Some of the factors which have contributed to the prevailing rise in prices would be outside the control of any Government, but the Government initiated last year a departure from the economic policy that had previously been operated in respect to food subsidies. That began a spiral of prices and wages, the consequences of which have not yet been fully realised or the repercussions of which may not have been fully felt yet.</P>
    <P>The position that now exists is that it is difficult to see what immediate remedy can be applied.  The suggestion of the Minister that it would require substantially increased taxation in order to reintroduce the subsidies is undoubtedly true but the Government while speaking with one voice has been acting with another.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and other Ministers have stated that the limit has been reached, that taxation is imposing a staggering liability on the country and that additional demands for increased expenditure must be resisted. While we have all these sentiments couched in the most eloquent phrases by Ministers, the Book of Estimates presented to us this morning shows a rise of about £6,000,000 on that presented last year and that without any allowance in respect of the food subsidies because of the changes that were made in last year's Budget.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the country were <Col N="2496" /> genuinely convinced that the limit of expenditure in certain spheres had been reached or that a limit was imposed by a possible reduction in the revenue returns, there would be general acceptance of a limitation of expenditure in certain directions but if we continue to incur expenditure on non-essentials while some essentials clamour for attention, it is unreasonable to ask the country, or unreasonable to expect the public, to support the campaign to impose an overall limit.  I do not think that the Government has made a serious attempt to grapple with the problem.  I do not deny that there are difficulties, that there are many problems that require close and serious attention, that some decisions which may have to be taken will be unpopular but if the situation were tackled in a courageous manner, if the Government were frank with the country and said: &ldquo;We initiated a campaign when we were elected in June 1951 which was dishonest when we alleged that there had been extravagance and we found on examination that there was no extravagance; we have since had to provide for far more increases than we expected&rdquo;, there might be a recognition that the Government was making a real contribution towards the solution of the problems which now confront the people.</P>
    <P>In regard to many items of taxation a limit has been reached and additional taxes would result in a decrease rather than an increase in revenue. The prices of almost every essential commodity have shown a substantial rise and it is not even clear that the limit has been reached.  At the same time we see a drop in employment, a reduction in some cases in output and a slump over many spheres of activity.</P>
    <P>We have made it quite clear that we do not believe there is an easy solution to this problem.  We believe that if the country was satisfied that an effort was being made, if the Dáil had confidence in the Government and if the country had confidence in the Government, we could tackle these problems in the same courageous manner as we attacked and surmounted them in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2497" /> This Government has clearly no confidence in its own policy.  Its own policy bears no relation to the published policy which it laid down after the general election two years ago.  Its own programme bears no relation to it.  It has continued to expend more money and impose higher taxes.  It has allowed in some cases by direct Government action a substantial increase in prices.  If it had maintained the undertaking which was given in the 15-point programme but found that, because of price variations, it was necessary to approach the Dáil for more money to meet the increased subsidies, then the country would recognise that the problem had become aggravated but that the Government was making an effort to deal with it.</P>
    <P>We have now reached a position in which the country has almost no confidence in the possibility of reaching a solution of the difficulties that confront us.  It is time for the Government to decide either to deal with the problem or allow the electorate to express the opinion which we on this side of the House believe they would express that they have no confidence in the ability if the Government to surmount the difficulties or to provide a sound, economic policy that will achieve the aims which we believe are possible of achievement.  They are aims which Ministers express to be desirable but they are also aims which the Government have not even tried to realise by any action on their part.</P>
    <P>I believe that the position which developed because of the Government's decision in last year's Budget has greatly worsened the prospects of any immediate improvement.  The limits have been reached in regard to the possibility of increased revenue, in fact, the indications are that there should be a policy of financial easement, a reduction in certain taxes rather than an increase.</P>
    <P>We believe that, if the Government stated it did not intend to add additional burdens, to ask for additional expenditure or impose additional liabilities because the limits had been reached and was prepared to stand on that, a case could be made for definite <Col N="2498" /> action and for a stand on a particular line.  While we have had these sentiments and views expressed, we have seen no action which would follow the sentiments expressed or the views propounded.</P>
    <P>I believe the country wants an immediate election.  I believe the country wants an opportunity of electing an alternative Government wherever it comes from.  The people want an opportunity of giving the country a Government that will be entitled to speak and to act in the name of the people.  If this debate achieves the purpose for which it was initiated, if it achieves the purpose for which it was moved, it will have achieved some success by making the Government realise that present conditions cannot be allowed to continue and that some effective action, either by way of a dissolution or by the proper policies being put into operation, must be adopted. I believe that the motion which is before the House deserves support, because it is moved in the hope that effective action will follow its adoption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite common in this House for some Deputies to accuse the Minister for Industry and Commerce of making gloomy speeches.  Deputy Dunne to-day described the Minister's speech as &ldquo;gloom, gloom and still more gloom&rdquo;. I listened attentively to the speech of the Minister and also to the speech of his opposite number, and I would say that there was more confidence and optimism in the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce than could be found in the speech made by Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not condemning Deputy Cosgrave for that.  He made a serious contribution to this debate, but, running through it all, there was a note of despair.  He asked for an election and an opportunity for the people to return an alternative Government. Running through that demand there was no indication that that would offer the country any hope.  He knew perfectly well, while he was speaking, that an election, if it did result in an alternative Government, would be worse for the country. <Col N="2499" /> Nobody knows that better than Deputy Cosgrave.  He knows that a Government, composed of Deputy Dunne and the people who performed here last night, would have much less hope of solving our economic problems than the present Government have.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about the rising cost of living.  Everybody acknowledges that the cost of living has risen.  The figures show that. The figures show that since 1950 the cost of living has risen from 100 to 123 points but half that rise occurred before the change of Government.  In the middle of 1951, when the change of Government occurred, the cost of living had risen by 11 points.  It has risen by a further 11 points since that so that if there is to be any accusation against anybody for a rise in the cost of living half of the blame must be taken by the <Col N="2500" /> inter-Party Government.  I do not think there is any sense or meaning in making accusations of this kind against either the inter-Party Government or the present Government.  The rise in the cost of living was inevitable because the cost of raw materials had increased and the wages had gone up. There was a rise in wages long before there was any question of a reduction of the subsidies.</P>
    <P>There is one point I want to make within the few minutes available to me. There have been sharp attacks from Deputies O'Higgins and Dunne and other members of the Opposition on the Government for having increased the price of butter.  That is an attack on the farmers.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Wednesday, 11th March, 1953.</P>
