      <P>At the census of population, particulars are obtained of the number of houses (defined as structurally separate buildings with resident premises) and dwellings (a dwelling is defined as a room or set of rooms designed for the habitation of a single family).  These statistics are not, however, classified by year of building, so that the particulars which the Deputy asks for are not available.  As bearing generally on the subject, certain statistics of houses and dwellings have been assembled which, with the permission of An Ceann Comhairle, will be circulated in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following are the particulars:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The information which the Deputy requires is not available for the building trade proper, but it is considered that the particulars of the numbers of wet-time books exchanged under the Insurance (Intermittent Unemployment) Act, 1942, provide relevant information as to numbers of persons in building occupations. I propose, with the permission of An Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving such particulars for the years 1947-48 to 1951-52, inclusive.  Corresponding information for the year 1939 is not available.</P>

The departmental examination of the Ringasciddy proposal has been completed and on 11th March the county council were requested to give public notice of the application, thus affording any parties who may be interested an opportunity of making representations to me within a period of three weeks.  As soon as this period has expired, the further consideration of the applications will be pursued immediately.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the examination of the Crosshaven proposal will be completed shortly, and in this case also the county council will be asked to give public notice in the local Press.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether in view of the great damage being caused to lands surrounding Lough Carra, and the consequent hardships on the 130 farmers concerned by the maintenance of a weir in the Keel river between Lough Carra and Lough Mask, he will take the necessary steps by introducing proposals for legislation or requesting the Commissioners of Public Works to take action to (1) have cancelled that portion of the final award of the Commissioners of Public Works of 1858 which provides for the maintenance of this weir, and (2) have the necessary statutory provision made for the removal of the weir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan) Patrick Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not proposed to introduce legislation to promote piecemeal drainage of the <Col N="656" /> nature suggested by the Deputy in this or any other catchment.  The removal or alteration of the weir on the Keel river will be considered by the Commissioners of Public Works when a scheme under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, for the Corrib-Mask catchment is being formulated.  There is no statutory authority to vary the award made by the Commissioners of Public Works on the 14th January, 1858.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary ask the commissioners to alter the portion of the final award mentioned in the question in relation to this particular weir and have the weir removed, in view of the fact that it was blown away around during the years 1921, '22 or '23?  That weir was completely wiped out since then, until it was rebuilt this year under the terms of the final award. They can do that without new legislation, so far as I understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several other rivers as well as the Keel river in which there are obstructions of this nature.  Even if the introduction of legislation was not necessary in this case, if anything of the kind were done, there would be a very strong demand for the introduction of legislation to undertake that type of work all over the country.  If such legislation were introduced and passed, it would interfere very considerably with the progress of work under the Arterial Drainage Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No complaints have been received by any Deputy in all that area about any other weir that exists &mdash;at least, to the same extent as in respect of this particular one.  I want to repeat that this weir has been nonexistent since 1922 or 1923.  It was rebuilt last November, but for what purpose I do not know.  Surely the final award of the Commissioners of Public Works of 1858 could be altered so as to deal with this particular weir and have it removed.  Approximately 130 farmers suffer loss because of it, but almost twice that number would be nearer the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy <Col N="657" /> for farmers who suffer from flooding, whether of a temporary or permanent nature, but I certainly have not the same degree of sympathy with the farmers concerned in the Deputy's question because in 1934, when the drainage of the River Robe was being carried out, by a majority they refused the offer that this question of the weir and sluicing would be taken into consideration and dealt with at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, further to his reply to a question on 12th February, 1953, regarding the repair of a bog road in Bogtown and Ballyshear, Cloneygowan, County Offaly, which is now in progress, he will consider making a further grant available to deepen the drains on each side of the new road in order to save the road from damage in the event of flooding and to ensure that the job now being carried out will have a lasting effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the effective drainage of a bog road is a technical detail within the province of the engineer in charge of the repair work.  No report has been received from the engineer in this case that the amount of the grant already sanctioned is insufficient for the satisfactory repair of the road.  I am not satisfied, therefore, that any further action on my part is called for at this stage.</P>

The Estimate for my Department, in respect of that item, includes an amount of £285,000, being 95 per cent. of half that sum.  The remaining 5 per cent. will, in accordance with normal practice, be paid after the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I have received proposals from the public assistance authority to grant wage increases of 12/6 and 9/6 weekly to certain of the board's male and female employees.  I have informed the board that, pending further consideration, increases of 9/-per week in respect of adult male employees and 6/- per week in respect of adult female employees might be paid, retrospective to 1st October last.  I am not prepared to authorise any greater increase at present but, as I have told the local authority, the matter is under consideration.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that this request from the manager of the Cork County Council has the unanimous backing of all the members of that board who in their wisdom provided the necessary moneys to meet the increase, is the Minister still satisfied to say that he is not prepared to give the wage increases of 12/6 and 9/6 per week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit to persons resident on islands is mainly made by means of postal orders, but when the claimant resides six miles or less from a post office payment is made by an order payable only at a special post office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The producers of ground limestone are making every effort to meet the back-log of orders by working their plants to maximum capacity and by giving preference to lime required for tillage lands.  There are at present 26 plants working with a maximum potential output of 900,000 tons per annum.  Six additional plants are under consideration at present.  Delays in deliveries at this season cannot be avoided unless farmers co-operate with the producers by placing orders and taking delivery before the peak period of demand.</P>

      <P>Last night I was complaining about the high rate of interest charged to public bodies on loans from the Local Loans Fund for the erection of houses.  Deputy Briscoe and the Minister interjected that they gave a grant to compensate for that increased rate of interest on public loans.  I regret that I contradicted the Deputy and disagreed with him.  I stated there were no such grants.  I apologise for that because I recognise that a grant is being given under the Labourers Acts to compensate public bodies for the rate of interest charged for the last few months on these loans.  There is no grant, however, being given for the erection of houses for tenant purchasers or no grant given to meet the <Col N="680" /> high rate of interest on loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  I hope the Deputy will accept my apologies for contradicting him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan brought us to task and said that when he wanted inspiration he went to James Connolly's book. He brought it in here and displayed it and said he always took inspiration from it to guide him as to the proper way to work under a social régime.  I am very perturbed about Deputy Cowan's reading of Connolly's <i>Reconquest of Ireland.</i>  I am afraid that while the name on the cover of the book may have been that of Connolly, the inside pages were written by a gentleman named John Francis MacEntee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that the theme of the book mentioned by Deputy Cowan, the book of John Francis MacEntee, must have been how he could create more unemployment in this country.  What has James Connolly got to say about the contrasts which anybody will see if he takes a walk through the city?  On the one hand we see the fleet of motor cars, the queueing up for the pictures to see some great film star whose name it might be unworthy to mention in this House and then, on the other hand, if you cut across O'Connell Street into Gardiner Street you will see queues of men registering at the employment exchange to get a few shillings a week to help them to keep body and soul together.  Who is the man who would support that policy? I do not want to refer to him as Deputy Cowan.  James Connolly spoke his mind on the type of man <Col N="681" /> who would give lip sympathy but who would vote in a different direction.  The Minister may now be composing other ballads which will become famous.</P>
      <P>I have still in my possession a book of his earlier poems&mdash;poems in which we see the initials of various heroes. I cannot help wondering if John Francis MacEntee will soon compose a poem on his three great new Independent admirers&mdash;the three C's.  Will the Minister compose a song about the old boys who have supported him in attacking the plain people of this country by&mdash;as he says&mdash;balancing his Budget? The Minister may smile but I sympathise with him.  Sometimes I pity him when I sit here and listen to the poor case some of those Deputies make in this House.  The Minister knows that they are not sincere.  These very same boys could say much more unpleasant things about the Minister than any member of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>My name was mentioned yesterday by Deputy Cogan, the man who misrepresented Wicklow.  He was speaking about the price of milk.  The milk producers' complaint about the Deputy is that he did nothing for them. Deputy Cogan has a say in the balance of power in this House.  They could not help contrasting the way in which he acted and the way in which the Labour Party tried to settle a very serious dispute in Dublin at one particular time.  My only regret about Deputy Cogan is that he got 904 of my surplus votes which enabled him to defeat a decent Irishman.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention has been made of the high rates of interest and of the difficulties <Col N="682" /> experienced by public bodies.  A large sum-up to £100,000 a year&mdash;comes to the Wicklow County Council by way of grants.  Unfortunately, half of that sum is paid in June and the other half is paid in December.  I believe that it would help to lighten the burden of interest that must be borne by the county council in respect of our overdraft if that sum of money were payable in four quarters per annum.  In that way we should not have to pay interest on large sums such as £40,000 or £50,000.</P>

They cannot but be aware of the general dissatisfaction which is felt by the people throughout the country, and no excuse such as that of trying to balance the Budget will be accepted by the person who is looking for work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan wants to take a long-term view.  He is out against capitalism and all &ldquo;isms&rdquo;, so that a time will come when our people will be so disheartened by politicians and their schemes that they will take an extreme course and say: &ldquo;A plague upon all your houses.  We are prepared to support another Party that has promised to abolish everything that we have suffered and to give us in return. full and plenty.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Vote on Account this year is bigger than it has ever been before.  We have now reached the £100,000,000 mark and it is time we reviewed the position before it gets completely out of hand.  I heard the speeches made by the three wise men who have control of the destiny of this country at the present moment. I heard the Taoiseach.  Certainly he disillusioned the House.  He had nothing to offer.  He asked us what we would do if we were in his position and he asked us if we would hit him while he had the child in his arms.  I heard Deputy Cowan's speech&mdash;Deputy Cowan, the Tito of this country, who <Col N="683" /> can keep a Government in office and who swaggers because he has that great power.  What had he to say? Nothing more than you would hear if you were east of the Iron Curtain. He has said that he is an avowed Socialist.  Thirdly, I heard Deputy Dr. Browne.  I am glad to say that I noted a change of attitude in his speech.  With the exception of an attack on the farmers he contributed a reasonable and decent speech to this debate.  I hope that the change of attitude on his part will continue.  I know that there is something in that man.  I hope that he has forgotten the vindictiveness that has been the curse of this House for the past 12 years.  I wish Deputy Cowan would follow the same line as Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
      <P>I should prefer if this Vote on Account were introduced by itself and without any red herring.  I respect Deputy Sheldon and I am sorry that he allowed himself to become a red herring for this Government by moving this motion.  I think it would have been much more to the point if he had repudiated the speech he made two months ago on the other side of the Border in which he accused the Republicans of this country of using every insidious means to wipe out Protestantism here.  He should repudiate that statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sheldon, I think, would be far better off if he had not allowed himself to be used as a red herring by this Government or any other Government.  Viewing the situation as I see it over a long number of years&mdash;I have been 17 years in this House and 35 years in public life&mdash;I am satisfied that we cannot regard it as being a happy one.  It has gone out of hand.  A change of Government is of no use to this country unless we have a change of heart.  There must be that change of heart on all sides of <Col N="684" /> the House and we must face things in a realistic way.</P>
      <P>I am a loyal member of a party, but at the same time I am more loyal to the Old Republican Army ideals which we stood for when fighting for the freedom of this country.  I am a loyal member of the Party, and I vote loyally with it.  I am proud of the fact that the leader of my Party allows the members to speak their minds openly and above board.  I have always done that, and whether my time in public life be long or short, I will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>This country is overtaxed, and the reasons for that are the political bribes and sops offered to the people over the last 30 years.  At every election new bribes and sops are offered to them and they fall for the carrot that is held in front of them.  The people should never have got these bribes and sops.</P>
      <P>We have before us the Book of Estimates which proposes to make provision for the expenditure of well over £100,000,000.  I am of opinion that this sum could be reduced immediately by at least £25,000,000, and that if it were we would do no harm to anyone.  We would not displace one man from his job.  I see what is going on.  I see State institutions giving out money all over the country.  That money is absolutely wasted.  Deputy Dr. Browne said that the farmers were getting their share of the sops.  Plenty of them are getting them, but I am satisfied that they do not want them and that they should never look for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the Board of Works blown sky-high because I believe it is the biggest waster of public money that we have.  There should be a complete review of its activities.  In my part of the country, I see vast amounts of money being wasted.  I see men with 1,500 or 2,000 acres of land getting a grant of perhaps £2,000 when they put up a glasshouse. When I see an Irish Government do that, I say it is damnable.  I agree that money should be given to those who need it, but not to those who do not need it.  Some of those people who are getting these grants use their own money to finance enterprises in other <Col N="685" /> countries such as Canada, Britain and Australia.  They are the people who would not spend one penny in this country.  That is a waste of public money.</P>
    <P>In my own locality, I see the Board of Works, giving out loans under the rural improvement scheme to people to do small drainage jobs&mdash;to drain their little drains or to put a wall around a piggery or a concrete flooring in it.  If our farmers are not able to put up a pigsty or a henhouse without getting loans to do little jobs of that kind, then, in my opinion, they had better get out of farming and let somebody else take their place.  These are some of the things which have happened during the Fianna Fáil administration. These schemes were introduced purely and simply for the purpose of getting votes.  Some of these farmers around me have got £5, £10, £15, or £20 for the purpose of carrying out these little jobs.  Would they not be far better off if, instead of looking for loans, they got a few bags of cement and a few loads of sand and did the job for themselves?  Instead of deriving any benefit from these loans, they have to pay higher taxes on the commodities they really need, because the cost of operating these schemes comes out of taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that we have reached the culminating point in Irish history and that something must happen.  There is no use in having a change of Government unless we get things kept within their proper balance.  There can be no question but that we have failed, especially when we have to admit that at the moment we have 90,000 unemployed and that people are getting out of the country as fast as they can.  I am not saying that because Fianna Fáil are in.  If we had a change of Government I think they would still continue to go.  The reason why we have failed is because we have no definite plan on fundamentals. All of us, whether we are Fianna Fáil, <Col N="686" /> Fine Gael or Labour, must accept the fact that we have failed on the great fundamental, which is agriculture.  In my opinion, there should be a definite policy on agriculture.  That policy should be laid down and a change of Government should not mean that it would be altered.  Agriculture should be put on a stable basis, because, as far as making any Irish advance is concerned, it is the beginning and end of all things.</P>
      <P>We have industrial development of a kind.  I am satisfied that its success is nothing compared to the success that could be made of agriculture if it were properly harnessed to its task. Agriculture should be pulling three times as much as it is, and, if organised on a proper basis, would be able to take the country out of its present rut. The reason why agriculture is not doing that is because politics are allowed to interfere with it too much.</P>
      <P>Agriculture will never be the success that it is capable of until there is a settled policy which will continue to be followed despite any change of Government. The curse of this country is that petty politics play too big a part in its affairs.  There must be something wrong and seriously wrong with agriculture when, as we know, it has made no progress in the last 50 years.  That indicates that there is something wrong and that Irish freedom brought us nothing in return-nothing commensurate with the efforts that were made to win it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in industrial development within reasonable limits.  The industrial development that we have had has changed the country from top to bottom, and not for its good.  I am not against industrial development, but I see what is going on.  Our boys and girls are being siphoned away from the land.  They are going to the towns and to the large centres to take employment in factories.  Previously, those boys and girls got a good education and were able to obtain a decent living in the country, many of the girls as domestic servants.  They got good food and were paid reasonable wages and were able to prepare themselves to become later the housewives of our <Col N="687" /> labourers.  Now they have all gone to the big cities and towns.  They are quite taken with the new way of life. I am satisfied that they just provide cheap labour for many of these industrial concerns which have operated behind high tariff walls, and that they are not getting the returns they are entitled to.  I believe they were far happier and far better off when they were in their own areas.  The fact is that in the country to-day no woman can get a maid.  Those girls are paid 50/- or £3 per week in the factories, but before Saturday they have not 10/in their pockets.  Many of them have to go back to their parents, who may be old age pensioners, and ask for the loan of a few shillings to go to a dance.</P>
    <P>If we had in this country industrial development of a proper kind it would not interfere with agriculture.  We would then be making progress.  We read in the papers the speeches made at big dinners by those who have done well for themselves out of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The industrial advance, as I see it, that has been made has been the curse of the country.  Many of those people who set up industries here were people who had jumped the tariff walls and came in here.  I think we would be far better off if we had never seen them.  If we built Irish industry with Irish brains, Irish initiative, Irish money, we would be far better off. We would be far better off if half the industries were blown sky-high.  The country would be better balanced. We have a lop-sided country at the moment.  Dublin is spreading over County Dublin.  They cannot build it big enough.  Deputy Briscoe wants thousands of houses built.  He wants Dublin Castle mowed down and thousands of houses put in its place.</P>

      <P>I want Dublin Castle blown sky-high and nothing put in its place.  I want to see the Houses of Parliament here closed down and to have Houses of Parliament built in the country.  I have a site for them&mdash;that is, the Hill of Tara.  There is a great deal of talk about tradition and the <Col N="688" /> ancient laws of Irish kings.  You have a chance now of reducing Dublin to its normal size.  Take the Houses of Parliament out of here.  The Taoiseach earmarked £5,000 for that a few years ago.  Put the Houses of Parliament in Tara and carry on the Irish tradition. Bring the Civil Service and staffs of all types out of Dublin and then there will be plenty of room for the poor and those who need houses in Dublin.  The Government keep building up huge staffs at huge expense and then they bring in the Vote on Account.  What does it represent?  Millions of pounds to build up Dublin.  As you build up Dublin you are destroying Ireland. Take a hint and do what I ask you. Decentralise.  Bring the Houses of Parliament to the place where they should be&mdash;to the place occupied by the ancient kings of Ireland.  That place was chosen by the ancient kings because it was the cream of Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has a lot to do with it.  As far as I see, the curse of this country is the industrial development as we have seen it, with the growth of Dublin to its present size, no effort being made to prevent Dublin growing into a monster that will eat up the whole country.  There are left in the country to-day only a few old farmers here and there and they can hardly get a workman for their land.  The men work on the country roads and in the factories for less money so as to get away from the land.  It should be the aim of an Irish Government to get people back on the land.  Meath County Council makes every effort to give higher wages to its workers than the farmers can give. Who would work for a farmer when he can work on a public road where he will not have to wet a foot from Monday to Saturday and get more money?  That happened under Fianna Fáil, under the inter-Party Government and under all Governments.  A change of Government means nothing. We must have a change of spirit.  We must go the hard road.  We have been blundering along the soft road for years and now we find ourselves in a bog of misery and despair.  We must <Col N="689" /> take the road back and start again where we made the mistake 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that a change of Government is needed immediately but I would be twice as happy in that change of Government if Fianna Fáil lost about 15 or 20 seats, if the public would give them the rap on the knuckles that they need.  They are too damn proud, too damn haughty.  The Taoiseach seems to believe that he and he alone has the destiny of this country in his hands.</P>
      <P>I want to see the best of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and other Parties joining together as comrades to make this country a decent place, away from the mad politics of the last 30 years.  Give our country a chance.  It needs a chance. I hope the electorate will do that.  Until Fianna Fáil get a rap on the knuckles from the electorate we will get nowhere. There is no use in Fine Gael or the inter-Party Government getting into power in the morning by a majority of one, two or three votes, in the position that Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne and a few others in the Opposition could throw you in or out.  I would like to see a fusion of those on both sides of the House who have national ideals at heart.  I do not say that any Party has a monopoly of patriotism.  I am satisfied that on the Fianna Fáil side there are good loyal men whom I would be proud to work with as there are on the Fine Gael, Labour and Independent Benches.</P>
      <P>I see no reason why we should carry on for another ten or 15 years as we have been carrying on, until we will have no Ireland left, until we will have generally what I see in my own county, a whole herd of foreigners coming in and buying up the land at three times the price, so as to get in and root there.</P>

      <P>I am not against those people, but I want to see a normal situation.  There is crushing taxation. The people are absolutely in despair. We are taking the butter off their daily bread.  They can hardly get dripping <Col N="690" /> for their bread.  It is a sad state of affairs.  Then there are the 90,000 people who cannot get work.  Nobody need try to convince me that we are down and out.  This country is bulging with money but it is in the wrong place.  Even if there was not a penny in the country we could right ourselves. Better countries went down to the last dregs and came up again.  What about Finland a few short years ago?  Russia gobbled her up and she has been rebuilt. Japan was crushed and broken four or five years ago and to-day Japan is pouring her stuff into this country and is able to compete and to beat us on any market they like.  Germany has been beaten three times in our lifetime, crushed to the dust, and in every 20 or 25 years Germany challenges the world.  That is because of the spirit of the people.  It is not money that does it.  They start off broke and yet they can rise again.</P>
      <P>All that is wrong in this country is that we have the wrong spirit, a rotten spirit of hatefulness towards each other.  If we on this side of the House put up a good proposition Fianna Fáil say that it is wrong, that it is rotten. that it should not be carried out.  We do the same to Fianna Fáil if they put up a good proposition.  Would not it be far better for a man on this side to say: &ldquo;There is a scheme proposed by Fianna Fáil, it is a good scheme; I will support it,&rdquo; and for a man on the opposite side to say: &ldquo;There is a scheme put forward by the inter-Party Government, it is a good scheme, we will work it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inter-Party Government did one important thing.  They introduced a scheme that gave work at good wages in rural areas, the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I believe I am right in saying that that was the greatest Act and the greatest achievement of three Governments in 30 years.  That Act should have been continued by Fianna Fáil in a manly generous spirit.  It was an Act introduced by the late Mr. Timothy Murphy, a man who had Ireland at heart, who bled himself to death on behalf of the country, who did not give two hoots about politics. He set himself to the task of improving the lot of the lower element.  He introduced <Col N="691" /> housing schemes to be carried out north, south, east and west.  Every man could get work at good honest wages.  He brought back the builders and tradesmen of all types and harnessed them to work for this country.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act gave employment to every man who was able and willing to work, at his own doorstep, not five miles away. He could walk out of his own door to the job.</P>
    <P>We drained the lands and the rivers and that was worth doing.  What is the present position?  All we hear is that the Minister for Local Government wants to spend millions and millions of pounds on the roads to make them bigger and better.  It would be better if we had bigger and better drains to drain the people's land.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach intends to weather the storm and to stick where he is he has a tough task before him.  I would not like the job of being in control. He must take the road back.  I am not making little of him.  He has gained the respect perhaps of the majority of the people over a long number of years.  Perhaps he is entitled to that.  I am not a follower of his and I always vote against him. He should not be so stiff-necked, however. Some of us served with him some years ago and we would do the same to-morrow if he would realise that the country must be built up and to build it up would require the help of the noblest and best of its sons. I do not think that the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party will build it up.</P>
    <P>At present we have a national debt of over £100,000,000, 90,000 unemployed and tens of thousands getting out of the country as fast as they can.  The farmer is up to his neck in trouble for want of finance.  Deputy Dr. Browne said last night that the farmer should be taxed more severely.  The farmer is carrying the burden in this country. We were told last year that we were down and out.  What saved you during the last 12 months?  It was not the industrial concerns, but the farmer with his cattle, sheep and horses, eggs, poultry and butter.  He is carrying on <Col N="692" /> year after year and is not treated properly.  If he was given the finance and the co-operation he is entitled to from the Government this country could treble or double its output and would be able to weather any storm. If you do not put agriculture in its proper place there is not the slightest hope for the country.</P>
    <P>I would not give two hoots for some of the other industries we have.  I would be glad to see many of them closed.  We are told that there are 90,000 or 100,000 employed in industry, but while you were employing them you were taking 200,000 off the land. Our boys and girls have gone from the land and now there are mostly elderly people left on the land who will not hand it over to their sons or daughters or nephews.</P>
    <P>Looking over the past 30 years I think we should do our best to try and unite the country.  This country cannot carry two sets of Governments, two sets of civil servants, and three Armies. It could do without a whole lot of the officials it has.  This is a country divided against itself and is bound to fail.  There should be a bigger effort made by those in control to unite the country.  I may be asked how can you do it?  It can be done.  Other countries in Europe are uniting and it is time that we made some effort.  Why not make a peaceful effort and see how far you can go?  If you are spurned, you have the alternative.  But we cannot go on drifting from year to year with the country bleeding to death.  I am not happy about it and neither are my colleagues and it is time that we did something.</P>
    <P>I ask Fianna Fáil either to get out or to rule the country in a Christian and proper way.  That is not being done.  There is no use giving sops to the people.  The people do not want sops.  The farmer wants nothing but the right to live.  The Government should stop interfering in the affairs of the people.  The Government has almost made this a State-controlled country.  I want to see the control given back to the people.  The people should be allowed to do their own work. Instead of that we have officials of all kinds brought in.  From the time the <Col N="693" /> Board of Works initiates any scheme until it is completed there are hundreds and hundreds of officials sent down the country, getting from £8 to £10 a week with travelling expenses, all at the taxpayers' expense.  We do not want one-eighth of these officials in the country.  We should go back to the families and build them up and then build up the parishes, give them control of their own destinies and get shut of the hundreds and hundreds of officials who are employed.  The people should be well able to do their own work.</P>
    <P>We had county managers brought in to manage the affairs of the people. They will drive the people off the land. When the managerial system was brought in it was thought that it would be a great system.  I supported that at the time but the county managers have put this country in debt since they came into power.  All they want is more money, and half the money is squandered.  This is not the first time I said that.  I said it at my own county council.  Tens of thousands of pounds are being squandered without any return.  There is no initiative being shown and no supervision on the part of the higher officials to see that the work is done.  The men employed get reasonably big wages but it is not their fault that they are not giving a return for it.  They are not kept constantly in their job.  Tens of thousands of pounds are being wasted in every county.</P>
    <P>If we face things in a realistic way we could save one-third of the sum now proposed to be expended and this country could be run on £50,000,000 or £60,000,000.  We should give our people back the right to look after their own interests.  The Government have no right to interfere with anyone's business.  We should start in the parishes on proper lines and get the right type of men who would give their services without remuneration.  To-day every man wants money for doing nothing.  If there is a job to be done you are asked what is it worth?  Thirty years ago we did all kinds of hard and dangerous work and wanted nothing for it.  A few years ago a Ministerial Pensions Bill was passed in this House <Col N="694" /> and after three years' service a Minister can get a pension for life.</P>

      <P>Sometimes it is worth straying.  The sum provided for in this Book of Estimates is too big and we must reduce it.  But the Government wants the easy way out. They want to keep on giving sops and bribes, watching the opportune moment for an election and winning if they can.  What do they win?  They win the same old problem.  The amount grows bigger year by year and no one does anything about it.</P>
      <P>Is it not true that Fianna Fáil has been living a lie for the past 30 years? If they were honest enough and admitted that we would get somewhere.  We have had three Governments here over the last 30 years.  We had the Cumann na nGaedheal Government that came in in the throes of the Civil War and ruled for the first ten years.  That Government did good work.  It could have done more.  We had Fianna Fáil from 1932 to 1948.  That Government did a fair amount of good work and an immense amount of harm also.  They had the opportunity of giving the country a proper balance but they failed to do that.  We had the inter-Party Government for three years. That Government did more in three years to enrich the country and stabilise her economy than the other two Governments did in the previous 25 years.  That cannot be disputed.  The inter-Party Government changed the country overnight.  They gave employment at good wages to every man worth his salt.  They almost stopped emigration and they brought back our people from the ends of the earth to build up our own country.  That was done by Irish unity and initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil should go back and examine what was done during those three years.  Could they not do the <Col N="695" /> same?  The inter-Party Government came into office openly.  They asked the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party to join them in their work.  What did he do?  He spurned the invitation and said: &ldquo;I want to stand as the leader of the Government myself&rdquo;.  Where does he stand to-day?  Does he stand as the leader of the Government?  He certainly does not.  He stands as the leader of a minority Government kept in control by four Independents, who will keep him in control so long as it suits them and throw him to the wolves when it suits them to do so.</P>

      <P>The country is in a horrible plight.  The spirit has gone out of our people.  If we could only imbue them with the spirit of those who went before them we would get the money back into the country.  We hear a great deal about security.  I think the word security should be abolished.  We heard it from Roosevelt. We hear it from Churchill.  Stalin used it.  Tito used it in London the other day.  Here we have the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health using it.  The word security should not be mentioned. Security comes from on high and, if we put our trust in Him, He will secure us.  What do we do?  The worldly &ldquo;lords&rdquo; spurn God and we follow the pagans across the water.  We are proposing to spend millions of pounds on social security.  What are we securing? A whole horde of officials and nothing more.  They will be secure.  They will have their pension rights.  I believe in decent sanatoria and decent health services. I do not believe in nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> Leave well enough alone.  Give the people work.  Give them decent homes. Give them good wages and let them fend for themselves.  Bring back the spirit of their fathers before them. Many of us were reared 40 years ago with eight and ten in family&mdash;possibly 12 and 14&mdash;on meagre enough fare, but we were reared honestly and dcently.  We had no sops from the British Government.  Our fathers and mothers would have starved rather than take them.  We have had 30 years of native Government giving doles and sops and bribes.  Parents must now get children's allowances.  They must get a ticket for a bottle from the doctor.  Sometimes the child is sick and needs a tonic but not always.  The bottle goes home filled with cod liver oil.  The father has a greyhound and decides a little cod liver oil would do the dog good.  Thousands of pounds are being wasted.  Tighten up all these things and we will be far better off. What is the good of giving sops to farmers to build up a little piggery, a small back yard or a cow tie?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care whether an election comes or whether it does not.  I am not afraid of an election.  I might get in. I might be thrown out but I would like to see Fianna Fáil bowed down a little.  I would not like them wiped out. I am not saying they are a bad Party but they certainly are too stiff-necked. I would like to see them lose ten or <Col N="697" /> 15 seats in the interests of Irish nationalism.  If that happened some good would come from it.  I do not want an inter-Party Government crowing over a Fianna Fáil defeat.  I want to see the best on both sides giving the country a ten years' break, forgetting the past and thinking only of the present and the future.  We have the traditions of those who secured our independence for us.  We should try to build a country worthy of their efforts.  I would like to see the Taoiseach and Deputy Mulcahy, the major men in politics to-day, sitting down together for the next ten years building an Irish foundation so as to preserve peace and unity and concord.</P>
    <P>I want our farmers to work as they should work.  I want them to get a decent price for their produce.  I want granaries for their surplus cereals.  I want markets opened up here and elsewhere. I want their workers to get decent wages.  I want the rivers drained.  For the past 30 years we have been having a neck and neck race between Parties seeking power.  That is the curse of the country.  Let as have an election.  Let Fianna Fáil get a rap on the knuckles.  In that way the country will be saved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the Vote on Account on 11th March, the Minister said, at column 171:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not think I should sit down without repeating that the Volume of Estimates which has been presented within the past few days to the Dáil and to the public must give us all food for thought.  We must ask ourselves are we going to be able to continue to raise the necessary revenue to maintain these services at their existing levels.  I think we can do that but we can do it only on one condition.  We can do it only on the condition that there is increased production in this country, that we produce from our soil ... a sufficient income.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very seldom I agree with the Minister for Finance but never has he made a truer statement than that.  In discussing this Vote on Account, therefore, we should take up the Book of Estimates and see what attempt is <Col N="698" /> being made by the Government to implement the statement made by the Minister.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We can do it only on the condition, that there is increased production in this country, that we produce from our soil a sufficient income.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is with that aspect of the statement that I intend to deal, but before dealing with it I am compelled to deal with some statements by Deputies in this House last night, that have been made, or are supposed to have been made, to help out in that direction.</P>
    <P>First and foremost I take the statement made by Deputy Peadar Cowan. I went to the trouble of reading his speech.  I take from it, Sir, the following statement in which he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If the State has not the power to compel farmers to grow more or to compel workers to work more, then it has lost very vital powers it ought to have.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is something like the statements made by a man named Lenin in a certain country in the year 1921.  It is a statement that should not be let pass in this House.  It is outrageous that any Deputy representing any constituency in Ireland should stand up in this House and say that the time has come when the Government must take over control of the workers of this country and say: &ldquo;You must work harder.  You must work at this type of work.  You must work these hours and you must accept this rate of wages&rdquo;; or that any Government could say to any farmer: &ldquo;You must till this land here; put what crops I tell you on this land; till it in the way I tell you and sell the produce at the prices I tell you also.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not think the present Fianna Fáil Government or any other Government that ever will come in this country will act or be allowed to act in that way.  If Deputy Peadar Cowan thinks that this is the way to increase production in this country or that that falls into line with the suggestions of the Minister for Finance in the statement to which I have referred, I do not think so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> Deputy Dr. Browne made what I consider a very good speech in this House and if I disagree with the opinions he has expressed as regards agriculture I can forgive him because he says he knows nothing about it.  It is a fair admission.  He gave his views but admitted he knew nothing about the subject.  Why, then, should he talk about it?  As a Deputy who stands up here to speak on it, I am one who was born and reared among the farming community of this country and one whose forebears for many generations back lived on the land.  I never earned a penny from any other source whatsoever.  When I hear Deputy Dr. Browne stating his views, although saying he knows nothing about it, I can forgive him for his statements because of his admission.</P>
    <P>We have too many quacks in this country and too many people in this House telling us about the ills from which the agricultural industry suffers, telling us how it could be improved and how we could have increased production. I listened last night to Deputy Flanagan, Mayo South, another quack who had a few cures, of course.  From start to finish he said: &ldquo;I hope I will not be misrepresented.&rdquo; I took notes of his statements for fear I would misrepresent Deputy Flanagan.  I come from the Border area outside Ballyhaunis in South Mayo and in this House I cannot let go the statements he has made and the charges he has made against the small tenant farmers of Mayo South.  He made the statement in this House that he knew small tenant farmers in South Mayo who are drawing the dole but had no right to it.  The statement &ldquo;liar&rdquo; is not a parliamentary expression.  Were it not for that, that is the statement I would make in regard to Deputy Seán Flanagan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not make the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said were it not for the fact that it is not parliamentary I would make it.  He also said he knew small tenant farmers in South Mayo who had money put aside in the stocking <Col N="700" /> and would not use it to develop their little holdings of land.  He said that such should not be the case.  Rather than misrepresent him I would point out that he used the words many times. &ldquo;Such,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;should not be the case.&rdquo; They should be made use that money to develop their land.  I suppose he knows people in South Mayo who are drawing old age pensions and considers that because they have money put aside they should not get old age pensions.  If there are widows drawing widows' pensions and if they have some of this money put aside, they should not be drawing the widows' pension. I think the statement made by Deputy Seán Flanagan last night was the most disgraceful that ever was made about the people of South Mayo.</P>
      <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan is a solicitor by profession.  He must realise that one of the hardest things that ever could be said to a father or a mother &mdash;at least that is the way in the province of Connacht and the Parliamentary Secretary will bear me out&mdash; is that they did not make any provision for their children.  I have no doubt that any of the tenant farmers in South Mayo who may have £100 or £200 put aside, have saved it for one purpose and one purpose alone, to provide for their children.  I am quite sure Deputy Flanagan, as a solicitor, has drawn up many marriage agreements in his time.  If so he will realise the great necessity for the father and mother to have a few hundred pounds put aside for their children so that they can get married and establish homes in the nearby villages or in the immediate vicinity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I come to deal with the question of increased production and the Minister's statement in reference to it, I want to refer to one other statement made by the Minister, as reported in columns 168-170 in introducing the Vote on Account on Wednesday, March 11th. I am more than delighted that a county man of mine, the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, is here in the House to hear the statement, and I would invite him to stand up before this debate closes and tell his Minister whether the statement is correct or otherwise.  As <Col N="701" /> reported in column 168&mdash;I was not in the House at the time but I suppose my shadow loomed before the eyes of the Minister&mdash;he made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We know how much money was spent in a certain constituency in Galway during the period when Deputy Donnellan was Parliamentary Secretary.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that my successor is an honest man, and I challenge Deputy Beegan, the present Parliamentary Secretary, who is now in the House, to stand up and state whether it is a fact that during my three and a half years as Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;he himself will be two years in the position next June&mdash;one penny halfpenny was allocated to North Galway area during my term of office more than that area was entitled to.  Was three halfpence spent during my time of office that had not been decided on and sanctioned by the officials of that Department?  I challenge Deputy Beegan, the present Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;I know he did not make the statement himself but I challenge the Minister also&mdash;to prove such to be the case.</P>
    <P>Further on, in column 170, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am perfectly certain that the majority of the officers who are concerned with the direction and administration of these Departments are as zealous and as anxious as any member of Dáil Éireann to ensure that waste will not occur and that extravagance will not prevail.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The previous statement of the Minister which I have quoted was not a charge against me; it was a charge against the officials of the Department over which the present Parliamentary Secretary rules.  Anything I did during my term of office for that famous constituency of North Galway was nothing more than the people deserved, just the same as was done in every other constituency in Ireland.  They just got what they were entitled to and no more but, of course, when an election came on and when it was found out that the Minister had lost one of his hoboes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>When they found out that, as well as the mopping up operations already carried out, there was danger of another representative being wiped out, it meant trouble for North Galway.</P>
      <P>When the members of the present Government were on this side of the House we heard a great deal about butter, especially from Deputy Corry. We were told that butter had to be imported, that it was a terrible yellow in colour, that there was a smell from it and that nobody could use it.  Yet the self-same type of butter is being imported to-day.  Apparently the yellow colour and the smell left it as soon as it increased in price from 2/10 to 4/2.  The increase in price apparently has had the effect of making it more acceptable although it is the self-same stuff.</P>

      <P>On the question of increased production and the provision made for it in the Book of Estimates, it was always my view that the improvement of land would be a great help towards increased production.  No matter what Deputies of any Party or profession may say in this House I want to make it clear that one section of people alone make any new money that is made in this country, and that is the section comprising the farmers and workers of this country.  All other classes, doctors, lawyers, solicitors, professional politicians, journalists or anybody else, only draw on the new money that is made.  The new money comes from the soil of this country. Therefore, for once I agree with the Minister when he stated that it is from the soil all wealth must come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What provision has been made in the Book of Estimates to indicate that we intend to bring about that increased production?  The one nightmare that constantly occurred to me when I was Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I am sure it frequently occurs to the present Parliamentary Secretary too&mdash;was the <Col N="703" /> fact that such a big proportion of the land of this country is subject to flooding.  There are over 1,000,000 acres of land subject to flooding.  The sooner something is done to relieve that land from flooding and bring it back into cultivation and useful production, whether in the form of crops, grass or anything else, the sooner production can be increased.  What is being done in this Book of Estimates to help towards that end?  I remember when I was in charge of the Board of Works, for the three and a half years I was there I was constantly taunted with the cry, from this side of the House: &ldquo;You started drainage?  You blew a whistle&rdquo;.  I had the proud privilege during the three and a half years that I held office under the inter-Party Government of asking the Taoiseach on three occasions, once every year, to start drainage schemes.  In June, 1948, I first asked the then Taoiseach to blow the whistle and start the first arterial drainage scheme in this country.  Twelve months afterwards, I had the honour to ask him to come again to start a second scheme.  Twelve months later I had the honour to call him to start a third scheme but since last June 12 months, nearly two years ago, damn the whistle has been blown.</P>

      <P>Surely the House is aware of the difference between now and the time that the inter-Party Government were in office.  While we were in office, an arterial drainage scheme could be started each year.  One of them&mdash;the Brosna drainage scheme&mdash;is now at the point of being finished.  Not a scheme has been started for the past two years nor a whistle blown.  We remember all the fun there was about the whistle.  Devil a much a whistle costs&mdash;about 5/-: it was just a method of starting a scheme.  But whether schemes will be started in the future <Col N="704" /> by whistles or bugles or I do not know what, there has not been a new scheme for the past two years.</P>
      <P>It was alleged here that the Corrib catchment scheme was taken out of the priority list and put fourth.  We remember all the talk there was about that.  I find in the Book of Estimates this year that the magnificent sum of £25,000 has been provided to start that scheme.  I would compare that sum to a flea bite so far as that scheme is concerned.  I think it is more than useless.  We could spend more than that in one month on the job.  At any rate I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the fact that it has appeared at all in the Book of Estimates. With all the economy and the use of the axe by the Minister for Finance, I suppose that it is not possible to go all out on the job.  At any rate, we shall be happy to see the scheme start, even with the small little sum of £25,000, before another year goes by.</P>
      <P>At column 160, in the same statement, the Minister is reported as follows:-</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The sub-head, Grants to Local Authorities under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, is reduced by £250,000.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just consider that statement in the light of the appeal for increased production.  Good work was being done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In Williamstown, County Galway, under the guidance of that very able county engineer, Mr. Lee, a great drainage scheme known as the Islands River drainage scheme, was carried out in the early days of the inter-Party Government under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That scheme has done a lot of good.  To cut down the grants under that scheme by £250,000 proves again, like the neglect of arterial drainage, that increased production will not be helped.  The Parliamentary Secretary will say that arterial drainage is not necessary.  There is a decrease in respect of machinery alone for arterial drainage of over £200,000.  That will not help to clear flooding.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say that we already have enough <Col N="705" /> machinery but I would point out that we remember a time when we had not enough of it.  We do not know when war may break out again. My view is that we could not have too much of such machinery.</P>
    <P>I am more than surprised that the Parliamentary Secretary allowed another item in the Book of Estimates to be cut but I suppose he could not help it, considering the individual he has as his Minister.  Bog development work has been cut down by £20,000.</P>

      <P>I do not think that, to judge by the extracts which I have quoted from the Minister's speech, this Book of Estimates works in the direction of increased production.  The land is all you have to depend on.  Your industries depend on the land.  Your workers depend on the land.  Every section of the community depends on the land.  For the food you eat you are dependent on the land, on the farmers and the farm workers.  Deputy Dr. Browne said yesterday that something must be done to remedy the serious position which the country is now facing.  He said that when he travels through the country he sees huge ranches which are still undivided.  I agree that, in certain cases, the speeding up of land division would help to increase production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the fact that the Minister has referred to the great necessity for increased production from the soil of this country, I find that there is cheeseparing where many important sub-heads are concerned.  There is cheeseparing of items which would help the farmer and the worker to produce more from the land.  I have no doubt that when the people get an opportunity in the near future they will indicate their disapproval of such action by the Government and, if we get a new Government, I hope they will revise this Book of Estimates so that expenditure under certain sub-heads will be increased to enable very necessary and essential work to be done with all possible speed.  I hope that more money will be provided for the draining <Col N="706" /> of the land of this country and the increasing of production in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion which stands in the name of Deputy Sheldon.  At the outset, I should like to express my appreciation of the action of the Government in accepting the principle of the motion.  I should like to say, without repeating what has already been very ably said by Deputy Sheldon, that I think that if the House adopts the motion, the Committee will help to bring back some of the power that at present lies in the hands of civil servants with regard to the manner in which the moneys voted by this House are spent.  I understand that since 1946 the Estimates Committee has functioned with reasonable success in the British House of Commons.  I see no reason why this Parliament should not learn from whatever is good that comes into operation in the British House of Commons.</P>
      <P>We have not a definite guarantee that this Committee, when set up, will be able to reduce expenditure.  First of all, we will have to get the Committee working.  It is only as time goes on that we will be able to see the various aspects of our Departments which can be tackled with a view to bringing about a certain amount of economy in the expenditure of money. For many years, all the Departments have been working the machinery in them.  That has been going on for 40 or 50 years.  I am sure that many of the higher officials have felt that this machinery had reached the stage when it should be scrapped or when certain improvements should be made in it. The trouble, of course, is that civil servants, like everybody else, are human, and they put off the day when the improvements should be carried out.  This Committee will be there as a watch dog in the interests of the people.  It will ensure, if it is possible to make changes in administration and so reduce expenditure, that these changes will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not too sure of the reasons as to why the Government has changed the title of this Committee.  I observe on the Order Paper to-day that the word &ldquo;Estimates&rdquo; is used.  I should like to <Col N="707" /> know whether or not it will be possible for a Committee of this nature to summon before it the representatives of various State or semi-State organisations. It is essential that the members of this Committee should have power to summon before it, for example, those responsible for the administration of Bord na Móna, the E.S.B., etc., and discuss thoroughly with them the manner in which they were expending the money which they received from this House.  It may, perhaps, be premature at this stage to hope that that can be achieved by the Committee.</P>
    <P>I hope, however, that by degrees we shall reach the stage when the State bodies will have to show to this House that they are spending in a wise and prudent manner the money which they receive from it.  I am afraid the position at the moment is that this House just acts as a rubber stamp for these companies by providing them with the necessary money.  After that we have no say in the world as to whether the money is spent wisely or otherwise.  If this Committee, when it is set up, can do anything to ensure that the people on those boards are using the money they get from this House in a prudent manner, then the Committee will have been a success.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Vote on Account, I believe, speaking here always as an Independent in this House, that politics have now reached a new low level.  I listened very carefully to the Minister for Finance outlining his statement on the Vote on Acount, and also to the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, outlining what he felt a new Government would do to remedy the situation that faces us.  There can be no doubt in my mind, or in the mind of any person, that the situation at the moment with regard to unemployment and emigration is very serious.  It is also very serious with regard to trade. Other Deputies who are more familiar than I am with trade matters will, I am sure, outline some of the difficulties which business people have to contend with to-day.</P>
    <P>I am more concerned with matters of a general nature, and I want to repeat again that I believe politics <Col N="708" /> have reached a new low level.  I believe there is great truth in the old saying that &ldquo;the more things change the more they remain the same.&rdquo; I was very interested in some of the remarks that were made by Deputy Giles.  He is one of the older members of the House and, as he said, had at one time as comrades men who now sit on the opposite side of the House.</P>
    <P>As a young member of the House, I have at all times made the plea that the bitterness which has divided the two major Parties in this House for so many years should be forgotten in the interests of the nation.  It is that bitterness which has bedevilled the economic situation in this country over the last 30 years.  Now, that most of those men, who took one side or the other in the past, have now reached the autumn of their lives, a mellowing influence should, I suggest, make itself manifest even at this late stage.  There should be a regrouping, a rejoining and a reuniting of those men on one side of the House.  I have no doubt whatever that there is very little difference to-day between them in their outlook on economic matters.  I hope in the course of my speech to prove that because I do not believe there is any use in making a statement here unless you are prepared to follow it up.</P>
    <P>I recollect quite distinctly what happened in this House in 1951 when Fianna Fáil resumed office.  They made it clear then that from that time forward&mdash;during the next 12 months&mdash;they would be up against it, that the country was facing a serious situation, and that that was mainly due to the activities of the inter-Party Government. In other words, that it would take many a day or year for Fianna Fáil to pull the country out of the mess to which it had been brought by the inter-Party Government.  I do not think that statement of mine can be denied by anyone on any side of the House.</P>
    <P>Here, the other night, in 1953, I listened to the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, who had Government responsibility for three and a half years.  In the course of his remarks he said that the damage done by the Fianna Fáil Government in the last two years was colossal, and <Col N="709" /> that it would take whatever Government replaced it years to bring the country back to a decent state after those two years in office of Fianna Fáil. Is not that plainly playing politics? Are the people going to be made the pawns in this political game between the two major Parties in this House? If the opportunity were given to the electorate to-morrow, I have no doubt whatever that Fianna Fáil would get a rap on the knuckles, as Deputy Giles described it, but what use is there in rapping Fianna Fáil on the knuckles? What alternative have we if this present Government is removed?</P>
    <P>Have we got in this House the nucleus of a Government that is prepared to take the very harsh steps that will be necessary to put this country on the right road?  No, I do not believe we have.  We had Fianna Fáil saying in 1951 that it would take them years to bring this country into a decent state, and in 1953 we have the ex-Taoiseach telling us that if they got back it would take years to undo the damage created by Fianna Fáil.  And so the vicious merry-go-round goes on while unemployment and emigration continue.  I challenge any member of a political Party here to go outside this House, meet an ordinary citizen, either in the streets of Dublin or down the country, and ask him what he thinks of political Parties to-day.  If that citizen is not a Party worshipper, I wonder will he say that Fine Gael is a great Party or that Fianna Fáil is a great Party.  I believe that the normal citizen to-day, who is not tied up in knots with some political Party, will tell you that they are all the same, that there is no difference between them.</P>
    <P>When we have reached that stage in political life, there is a danger signal; there is an air of apathy; people are beginning to lose hope in political Parties.  I need not tell the House what the results may be in years to come if the people begin to lose faith in democratic institutions and in democratic forms of Government.  If we pursue the line that has been adopted for many years past, the people will finally lose confidence in democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, to my belief, since 1932, <Col N="710" /> have marched forward.  They have done a considerable amount of good in this country.  They started off with an excellent programme.  When I was a member of the Clann na Poblachta Party, the programme we had in 1948 was a copy of what Fianna Fáil had in 1932.  I make a present of that to anybody in this House.  We had the hope, as a young Party, that we would be able to achieve those things that Fianna Fáil felt were so desirable from 1932 onwards.  Circumstances proved differently.  However, I have no intention of prolonging, with the small influence that I have, the death agony of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Likewise, I have no great desire to see them replaced by a major Party in this House who have not put before the House a progressive policy that will remedy the situation that faces us to-day.</P>
    <P>If one looked at it in a cynical manner one could say that if Fianna Fáil go to the country to-morrow they will lose heavily and that the people who will replace them are sitting on my left, the major Opposition Party, who are smacking their lips waiting to get back into office, saying: &ldquo;They are down and out and we will be back before long&rdquo;.  Perhaps it would be no harm if they were let back until they too can reach that downward stage that is about to face Fianna Fáil, so that the country in a short space of time could reduce both of them to the same common denominator and get rid of them once and for all.</P>
    <P>Everybody in the House realises that the country is in a bad state.  We have economists here like Deputy Hickey and financial experts of the old school like the present Minister for Finance and they all talk in this House about the dangers of inflation and the dangers of a deflationary tendency.  I have no intention of suggesting for a moment that I have the slightest knowledge of economics.  I do not propose to set myself up as an expert on any of these things but I do propose to say a few words from the ordinary man's point of view.</P>
    <P>This cry about inflation and deflation has appeared in magazines and books that deal with the situation in <Col N="711" /> certain European countries and in Britain to-day and it must have some bearing on the conditions that obtain in those countries.  For this House and for people in this country to suggest that conditions in Ireland are in any way similar as regards development or otherwise to conditions in Britain or European countries is complete nonsense. There are certain dangers in other countries in pursuing lines of policy that could cause inflation.  In Ireland we have a country that is crying out for money for development. We are completely undeveloped.  We are nearly as far back, with regard to the development of our natural resources, as they are in certain parts of Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>My view with regard to this is that we should cut out all that type of discussion in this House because once we enter into it we forget the fundamental, that this country is in a very bad state from the point of view of development and that what we need is less chat about the theoretical points of finance and more attention to the manner in which money can be raised to pour into useful development works.  The things that count are, as other speakers have said, agriculture, the development of our fuel resources, the development of our power through the E.S.B., the intensification of the forestry programme. These are the fundamental things, the development of which creates real wealth.  I am afraid that the policy pursued so far by various Governments has been very lacking so far as the development of these matters is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no good in the Minister or any other person in this House telling me that we must pay for development out of savings or out of taxation.  We can throw our hats at developing the country if we have to depend on savings alone and on raising money from taxation.  The country is too undeveloped altogether.  If we are to make a success of development, <Col N="712" /> money must be created by the State. That is the real solution to this problem.  If we are going to pump money into afforestation, which is a long term project, that money must be made available at the very lowest possible rate of interest.  The only rate of interest that should be in it is that allowed for the purpose of administration. The same applies with regard to Bord na Móna and the development of hydro-electric schemes.  The same applies to agriculture.  That is fundamental.  No matter how we try to work with the machinery at our disposal at the present time, all the things that Deputies on both sides want to see done cannot be accomplished until the power to create wealth lies in the hands of the State.</P>
    <P>I hate to remind the Minister for Finance or other men in this House of what they said years ago.  I do not think it is a nice habit.  I do say that when Fianna Fáil came into office in 1932, and prior to their coming into office, they were advocates of a policy that would give full control to this country of its finances, that would give power to the State to raise the money necessary for development purposes. To a great extent they achieved success in the political field by getting people to back their policy with regard to finance.  There were no greater critics of the previous Cumann na nGaedheal Administration on the question of banking and finance than the Fianna Fáil Party of 1932.</P>
    <P>What has happened since?  To-day, to my mind, they have become even more reactionary than the Cumann na nGaedheal Government which they displaced. It is a sorry business that when they got into office, from 1932 on, they failed to take this necessary power.  We are tied as tightly to the British system as we were in 1932, in spite of all the suggestions that were made at that time that a complete overhaul of our financial system should be made.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any hope until that type of machinery is scrapped. All the tinkering and patching that can be done on the machinery at the disposal of the Government will not <Col N="713" /> change the situation.  The Taoiseach has said on many occasions that they would try to work with the financial machinery at their disposal and, if that did not do the job, they would scrap it.  The time is overdue for scrapping it.  Whether Fianna Fáil will have the courage to put a new machine into operation and whether their opposite numbers will agree is a question I cannot answer, but that is my view.</P>
    <P>Under the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce I should like to deal with the question of turf. The Minister for Finance, as reported in column 1630 of the Official Report for Wednesday, 8th March, stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I regret that I have to say that turf production by semi-automatic processes has not justified itself, as the costs are very high and it is difficult to dispose of the finished product.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a story in connection with the question of turf production which is one of the means I have chosen to prove the difference there is on financial or development matters on either side of this House.  In 1948 this House had to undergo the agony of listening to speeches from the Fianna Fáil Benches bemoaning the fact that a decision had been taken by the inter-Party Government to scrap the hand-won turf scheme and certain of the semi-automatic operations.  Who took that decision I cannot tell.  I felt, however, at the time that whoever took the decision, be it Fianna Fáil or the inter-Party Government, it was a wrong decision that these bogs should not be kept in full production.  I have gone on record for saying that many times. That was in 1948.  Suppose we blame the inter-Party Government for that decision to scrap hand-won turf schemes in 1948, let us see what happened in 1953.  In 1948, the hand-won turf scheme was dropped.  In 1953, 50 per cent. of the semi-automatic machine scheme has been dropped.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the House realise that thousands of pounds of the taxpayer's money has been poured into these bogs for development purposes, that first-class roads have been built, that for <Col N="714" /> years we have been draining these bogs in the West, South, and in the North of the country and making them a first-class economic proposition by which we could obtain fuel second to none for utilisation in the country?  Now the decision come to by a State company, in the words of the Minister, is: &ldquo;That turf production by semi-automatic processes has not justified itself as the costs are very high and it is difficult to dispose of the finished product.&rdquo; That is a misrepresentation of the facts.  I only wish that the Committee on Estimates which the Minister now proposes to set up was in operation so that the House would have the opportunity of bringing before it those persons in Bord na Móna who were responsible for giving that advice to the Minister for Finance so that their actions could be questioned and the position cleared up.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the details with regard to Bord na Móna, but on the question of policy it seems to me that the attitude of the former Government and the present Government is to provide for as many workers as possible in the coal mines of England and Wales so that they can dig down deep into the coal mines for coal and have it sent to Galway.  That is the policy that is being pursued to-day.  We have in this country vast undeveloped areas of fuel resources and all we are doing is allowing Bord na Móna to drop some of these schemes.  The position is such that in the last fortnight or three weeks I asked for special time in this House to discuss this question of turf production, but parliamentary procedure is such that private Deputies can be tied up when it comes to looking for our rights in raising such matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go into the details of administration. Last September, 590,000 dollars were made available for the purchase of American coal.  Last month the State Guarantee Bill was passed in this House under which Fuel Importers, Limited, were covered to the extent of £4,000,000 for the importation of fuel <Col N="715" /> into this country.  In addition to that, last year we paid £128,000 interest on overdraft accommodation for fuel imported by Fuel Importers Limited. That is the picture on one side.  On the other, we have to-day Bord na Móna with a surplus of 300,000 tons of machine-won turf on hands for which they can get no market.  Last year, we gave Bord na Móna a sum of £20,000 for a publicity drive in order to get the ordinary producer of turf to produce all the turf possible.  That turf is now available and the Bord na Móna turf is there and there is no sale for it.</P>
      <P>In my own constituency Bord na Móna had the cheek to offer the county council 5,000 tons of machine-won turf at 24/- per ton less than it cost to produce. That money has to be provided by this House.  These are the facts. There is no exaggeration in regard to the figures I am giving to the Minister. Bord na Móna are offering the best machine-won turf at 24/- per ton less than it cost to produce and this House is asked to pay for the losses of Bord na Móna.  At the same time we spend 590,000 dollars on the importation of American coal and we give £4,000,000 to Fuel Importers Limited to buy coal in Great Britain and abroad.  Bord na Móna last year asked for more turf production and the turf is lying on the bogs down the country stacked and ricked and there is no sale for it.  Bord na Móna panicked and told the Minister that it is not an economic proposition to cut turf in these bogs and they closed down these bogs on which thousands of pounds have been spent on development work and which gave first-class employment to our youth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point which the Minister may try to come back with. Bord na Móna have suggested that on their major bogs where the bagging machines are in operation in the midlands and elsewhere they will increase turf production.  I have no objection to that, but I fail to see what justification there is for a State body to call on the people to produce this fuel and guarantee a market for it and then turn round and shelve the responsibility, thus leaving that turf on the <Col N="716" /> hands of those who produced it because there is no sale for it.  Not alone have they damaged the sale of the machine-won turf, but they have destroyed the market for the private producer by offering this machine-won turf at a cutthroat rate in the bog areas.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a State company like this should only be allowed to sell turf in the non-turf areas.  It should not be permitted to compete with the small producer of hand-won turf in his own area.  The power now given to Fuel Importers should be transferred to Bord na Móna and Bord na Móna should clamp down on the admission of coal.  Fuel depots should be established in every city and town from which first-class fuel could be procured in reasonable quantities.  One of the great difficulties in regard to turf is that buyers are compelled to take it in bulk.  A lorry load is the least quantity a merchant will provide. People living in cities and towns have not got the storage accommodation for so much fuel.  If fuel depots were established the consumer could order a ton of turf at a time.  The Minister need not worry that that would be an uneconomic proposition.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of turf during the emergency is now almost forgotten.  I do not want to reopen old wounds but terrible damage was done to the turf industry during those years because of a particular type of individual who engaged in the haulage and marketing of turf.  I know of one individual who parked his lorry on the side of the road and went in on the bog to a producer and asked him if he had any turf for sale.  The producer, who was at the time cutting turf, said that he had a considerable quantity but that it would not be fit for three weeks. The man from the lorry asked to have a look at it and he said it would suit him fine.  That turf was only half saved.  The turf producer did not want to sell it.</P>
    <P>The blame should not be laid on the producer.  The blame should be laid on those who failed to supervise here in Dublin and who failed to keep out the bad turf.  Thousands of tons of much reached the City of Dublin and the <Col N="717" /> Minister can take it from me that on many occasions a pound of butter helped to increase the weight of that truck-load of turf when it was put on the scales, to the benefit of course of the haulier concerned.  That is the type of thing that has done harm to turf production.</P>
    <P>We have at our disposal an admirable means of reducing unemployment and giving a first-class wage to men in the western and midland areas by the major development of turf.  I discussed this matter on one occasion with the Minister for Industry and Commerce. He made it quite clear to me that the terms of the 1938 Coal-Cattle Pact, renewed in 1948, prevented the Government from taking drastic steps to curtail the importation of coal.  I suggested to him there should be a levy on every ton of coal imported; if people wanted to burn coal, there should be no opposition and no difficulty should be put in their way remembering that for every ton of coal they burned they were helping to increase the production of turf and the levy on every ton of coal could go to subsidise turf.  The Minister's answer was that we could not do that under the Coal-Cattle Pact.</P>
    <P>Things have changed considerably not only since 1938 but since 1948 too. The British are no longer in a position to sell us the quantity of coal they hoped we would purchase from them under that Agreement.  They have on several occasions welshed on the Agreement.  For many years we have had to purchase coal in America.  I think it is in our own power now to get over this difficulty and let Britain do what she likes about it.  Every industry set up here and every factory that goes to the Government seeking a grant or a loan should be told that it will get the grant or the loan on condition it uses native fuel.  Every institution under State or semi-State control should be given strict instructions to install fuel burners dependent upon native fuel.</P>
    <P>I am sick and tired talking about this.  We have an excellent example of native fuel being used in Athlone for industrial purposes.  Deputy Dr. Browne mentioned the Gentex factory which has three semi-automatic <Col N="718" /> machines working on its own bog near Athlone.  That factory has found it more economic to use native fuel than to import oil.  It is an extraordinary situation that we here should be using oil burners for the heating of our Parliament.  If we were serious, we would scrap these oil burners and utilise turf-fired boilers.  No engineer can tell me that turf is a dearer proposition than coal.  I have given the Minister the example of Athlone.  I have gone to a good deal of trouble to get comparative figures with regard to the two types of burners.  Bord na Móna has perfected a new type of heater for central heating purposes. The new vocational school in Athlone is getting rid of the oil burners.</P>

      <P>We should set up in Bord na Móna a marketing section to ensure that the turf on hands is sold at an economic price.  We should transfer the power that now lies in Fuel Importers to Bord na Móna to ensure that only the very minimum requirements of coal are allowed in here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are opponents to the use of turf.  Some of its greatest opponents are the engineers and we have to fight against the technical advice of men placed in positions where they can do damage to the development of our own native resources on our bogs.  I have met engineers who have told me they do not regard turf as the correct means of heating such and such a place, or that they do not think turf is as satisfactory as coal.  Let us depend for a change on the advice of the type of engineer who is anxious to see our fuel resources fully developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to fight, too, against the type of opponent who tells us that we have only a limited quantity of turf and that if we continue to develop the bogs they will be cut out in 20 or 30 <Col N="719" /> years' time.  I welcome the day when the bogs will be cut out.  From the moment at which we embark on large-scale development of our peat resources we should start an intensive reafforestation programme everywhere turf has been cut.  Thirty years hence there will be good fuel available there in the form of quick-growing timber to provide yet another source of native fuel in the years ahead.  Let us, therefore, not worry at all about cutting out the bogs.</P>
    <P>I will be very brief in dealing with agriculture.  In spite of what Deputy Dillon and others like him may say in this House I believe that agriculture is stagnant to-day.  Little or no work has been done for the last 30 years with regard to production.  Again I must agree with Deputy Giles that agriculture has been to a great extent bedevilled by political Parties, not all Parties.  I hope I will not be taken as criticising individuals or the Parties too much in this regard, but I feel there has been no continuity in the programme pursued for agricultural development due to the fact that you have changes of Government every three or four years.  What you want in regard to agriculture is a policy of continuity and security so that a farmer can look forward for years ahead and say to himself: &ldquo;It does not matter to me if the Government changed ten times over in the next five years.  This policy will be pursued and I will receive suitable recompense for my labours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not a farmer but I think I am entitled to speak in spite of the type of individual like Deputy Donnellan who states in this House that nobody but a farmer should speak here on agriculture.  I say: goodness help this country if we have to depend on the like of Deputy Donnellan to solve the problems that face us.</P>
    <P>One of the main things necessary if we want to increase production is to give a guaranteed price to the producer. There are men in my constituency whose land is not good enough for the growing of wheat but whose land is excellent for the growing of barley, malting and feeding.  The acreage for malting barley has been reduced <Col N="720" /> and there is no guaranteed price for the feeding barley which these men produce.  One of the most essential things for a farmer is a guaranteed price and a guarantee that the foreign foodstuffs will not be allowed in.  Our motto in this regard should be: not an ounce from abroad of what we can produce at home.</P>
    <P>There is no question of compulsion in this matter but there is a question of zoning.  We have areas that are ideally suited for certain types of crops.  Let us utilise those areas for such crops but give a guaranteed price to the producers.  We have a system in operation to-day whereby the maltsters give a guaranteed price in certain areas for the production of barley.  Why cannot the State give a guaranteed price in other areas for the production of feeding barley?  Other areas have proved themselves ideal for the production of potatoes and oats. Why should not those farmers whose tradition it has been for generations to produce oats get a guaranteed price?  As Deputy Dr. Esmonde suggested, why should not storage accommodation be made available if there is a surplus produced?</P>
    <P>These are some ways in which we can increase output on the land but until we give a guaranteed price to the farmer for his products, all the talk in this House is pure hot air.  The farmer has plenty of sense and if he asks me, as a public representative: &ldquo;What price will I get for the coming year for the production of feeding barley?&rdquo; and I tell him I do not know, that man feels that he should not grow that crop this year.</P>
    <P>Tied up with agriculture we have the Land Commission and I will restrain myself with regard to what I have to say about that particular body.  I have spoken time and again here about the sins of the Land Commission and I am sure some of them will fall on my own soul because of all I have said about them.  I am in thorough agreement with Deputy Dr. Browne in regard to what he said last night about the small congested holders.  We had the Land League started in this country and men like Michael Davitt and others were willing to suffer the greatest torture in <Col N="721" /> order to give security and justice to the farming community, but I do not believe for one moment that the aims of those men were to see the small farmers living in slums as they are to-day. The extraordinary situation has developed that if you suggest that the small farmer or the congest be removed from the locality, you are a traitor or a Communist; you are not fit to be allowed into this House.</P>
    <P>If we have slums in the cities, the State has power to raze those slums to the ground and provide good housing instead.  If we have rural slums the State should have power to remove them.  I represent a constituency in which there are rural slums as bad as any in Mayo or in County Galway, and I feel that the power should be there to wipe them out.  Instead of that we have entire areas which, as I mentioned in this House before, require demolition.  In one area alone there are 348 holdings under £5 valuation.</P>
    <P>What solution is there for the like of that?  Is there any hope for the young people born into those houses of getting a living out of the land?  Is it not time we stopped &ldquo;kidding&rdquo; the Irish people and the small farmer by giving doles, and so forth, as a means of eking out an existence, not a livelihood?</P>
    <P>We hear every day from the Land Commission that there is land available to relieve congestion.  It is very hard for the land to be made available to relieve congestion when we have, in the words of Commissioner Mansfield himself, in a few years 100,000 acres of the finest land of Ireland passing into the hands of the aliens in the midlands. There is not a day we have not a sale of a new farm in Kildare, Meath or Westmeath which is bought by Colonel So-and-so and Major So-and-so, while, as I have often said, the natives must go to work for these people who come over here to buy big holdings. I maintain that while there is a farm of land available for the foreigner to purchase there is land available for the Land Commission to relieve congestion. We must be ruthless in these things and if necessary, in regard to the Land Commission, those men who <Col N="722" /> are at the top of the Department of Lands must be retired.  Give them a good pension; God speed them and put in others that will do the work.</P>
    <P>In relation to afforestation we have had a lot of squeaking from Deputy Blowick about what he did for afforestation. I do not want to be too hard on Deputy Blowick.  I feel that he is sincere about it, believe it or not. However, I am afraid the Deputy did not know the Department of Forestry from the Department of Lands.  The only way he would know one from the other would be if there were different numbers on the doors.  Perhaps he was sincere but if we are going to tackle the question of afforestation in the manner in which it should be approached, then the puny efforts of Deputy Blowick appear to me to be completely pathetic in connection with this vast scheme of development.  I am trying to be fair to Deputy Blowick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I not entitled to discuss the financial policy or the lack of financial policy of the Government in regard to afforestation?  The Minister for Finance himself stated on the Vote on Account that he was very glad to see that as a result of the work done by Fianna Fáil for so many years in the field of afforestation money was now coming into the Exchequer. Money is coming into the Exchequer on the sale of thinnings and on the sale of timber that was planted 25 or 30 years ago.  The amount involved is not very much but I would say that in two or three years' time the State will be getting a return of around £200,000 per annum for the afforestation work that was carried out 25 to 30 years ago.  I ask the Minister, seeing <Col N="723" /> that he appreciates now the value of the afforestation carried on so long ago, would it not have been a better proposition if that afforestation programme of ten years ago had been on a ten times bigger scale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be too critical on this matter but if we go back for a 30 years period, I think both sides of the House will have to accept portion of the blame for the slowness of the programme and I suggest to the Minister that if he is able now to secure an income of £200,000 from an afforestation programme carried out 20 years ago, if that afforestation programme had been on a scale ten times bigger than it was, he would now be in receipt of £2,000,000 per annum as a result of it.  In addition there would have been established in areas in the West and other parts of the country factories for the production of paper, factories that would turn out a complete supply of paper for all the books and papers produced in this country and many other factories that would be in a position to make the various articles that are produced from timber.  It may be felt that it is perhaps too late to talk in this strain now but if afforestation on an extensive scale were now embarked upon, coming generations, from 30 years' time onwards, would be able to secure the benefits which we feel we have been deprived of by the failure to undertake extensive afforestation years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to score any political points in this matter, but I think the time is ripe to secure all the land that is available, particularly in the West of Ireland, for afforestation purposes. I would not worry about hurting an individual here and there if it merely means removing him from a miserable holding on the side of a mountain, if we can assure him that he will afterwards be provided with a good house and secure constant work on afforestation. He will not mind being shifted if he is assured of these conditions.  I think we are too faint-hearted about <Col N="724" /> this matter, or perhaps it is that we use these people as an excuse for not carrying out a full programme and that we shelter behind the fact that there may be a certain limited amount of opposition to taking over land for this purpose.  I shall say nothing more on this subject but I hope that the present Government will have the sense to tackle the problem resolutely.</P>
    <P>We have heard nothing in regard to Foras Tionscail except the Minister's statement that he was reducing the amount provided in the Book of Estimates as compared with that provided last year.  The sum provided last year was £250,000, and that is now being reduced to £100,000.  The Minister quite reasonably suggested that this is a more practicable figure.  When the Undeveloped Areas Bill was brought into the House, it was welcomed by all sides.  Some Deputies were inclined to be critical on the ground that some of the areas which it was proposed to benefit were areas where Fianna Fáil had lost seats.  That, of course, was not serious opposition and the measure received encouragement from all political Parties.  At the time, I said to the Minister that I personally welcomed it for one reason, and that was as a challenge to private enterprise.  I felt it was the last chance that private enterprise should get to prove whether industrialists were fit to tackle the problems in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Act has now been on the Statute Book for two years and if we go down to the West of Ireland or down to Cork to Deputy Collins's constituency I think we shall see few signs of that industrial development which we desired under this Act.  Possibly something may be done in the future but the point I want to make is that that Act was brought in with a great flourish of trumpets.  It was brought in in the hope that the people of those areas, and the Deputies who represent them would be gagged for another few years and that if we ventured to open our mouths we would be told that we must have patience. The Tánaiste himself said that the aim of the measure was to encourage industrialists to come to the West of Ireland and it was on that understanding <Col N="725" /> that the House gave him the Bill.  I can assure the Minister that even though this House had it in no uncertain terms that the aim was to encourage industrialists to move to the West of Ireland, the manner in which civil servants have attempted to interpret the Act has been directly the opposite.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience of the manner in which they interpreted that measure.  They have suggested to the industrialist that he must prove a loss by coming to the West of Ireland. There is no encouragement or inducement whatever held out to people to go to the West.  I mention that to the Minister because I feel sure that the Government, like the Opposition, want to see developments carried out in the West and I am sure when it is pointed out that that development is being held up by the action of a Civil Service Department, the officials of which I suppose are anxious to reduce expenditure, some action will be taken to remedy that state of affairs.  We hope that the West will not suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the question of tourism.  At this stage when we have An Tóstal coming on very shortly it would perhaps be wrong to refer to it at any great length, and it might be as well to defer any remarks we have to make on it until the celebrations are over this year.  I suggest however to the Minister that when we are all asked to help in the development of seaside resorts, to encourage Irish industrial development and to use An Tóstal as a means by which we can display some of the products of our industries to foreigners, it is only right that all the articles that are displayed for sale in this country under the auspices of An Tóstal should be made in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have recently gone to a railway station in this country at which there was a display by a firm of An Tóstal souvenirs&mdash;badges, harps, ladies' powder puffs and some other very excellent souvenirs.  The description was &ldquo;made in Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;An Tóstal&rdquo; written over it, but in big black print at the bottom of some of <Col N="726" /> the articles were the words &ldquo;made in England&rdquo;.  That display took place at a railway station and the site on which it took place was leased presumably by C.I.E. to the company in question.  I felt that it was rather discouraging that we should have to face that type of display.</P>

      <P>It is too bad when so many people put an effort into the development of tourism in this country that much of that effort is nullified by displays of the type to which I have referred.  To conclude, I should like to join with Deputy Giles in the sentiments which he expressed.  I feel, having listened carefully to speakers on the Government side and on the Opposition side, that what is most needed in politics to-day is a change of outlook&mdash;not so much a change of heart as of outlook&mdash;in a political Party.  If that change of outlook does not come about in the major political Parties, I can see no hope for the future of democratic institutions in this country.  It would be a bad day for Ireland if the people lost that confidence which they have had up to the present in those democratic institutions for which so many people have fought and suffered in the past.  To my mind, the time is ripe and has never been more opportune for a Party &mdash;be it on the Government side of the House or in opposition&mdash;to say clearly to the people that they stand for a change of policy with regard to finance. Quibbling with regard to the setting-up of a money market, and so forth, will not hoodwink anybody.  I want to see some Party state in their programme that they stand ruthlessly for a complete change from what has been the custom in the past 30 years and they should be prepared to forgo, if <Col N="727" /> necessary, the fruits of office for many a year until the people have faith enough in them to see that aim accomplished.</P>

      <P>In the course of his speech last evening the Taoiseach told the House and the country that the Government's policy is not only a wise policy but is, in his view, the only policy which the Government could adopt in present circumstances.  If we take that premise of the Taoiseach that the Government's policy is not only the wisest policy but is the only policy capable of operation in present circumstances, I think it is not unfair to apply to that policy a test of the results which it is showing so far as the people of this country are concerned. What are the results of the Government's policy to-day?  We can refer to those in a few minutes.  It must be clear to everybody&mdash;to the distressed housewife, to the unemployed man or woman, to the emigrant who is driven overseas &mdash; that this Government's policy is having a catastrophic effect on the domestic life of tens of thousands of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The speeches which have been made in this debate from the Government side of the House, the speeches which have preceded this debate, the speeches which have been made by the Government in the past few months all help to create still more gloom and despair and bring in their wake the same deterioration in our economic position as is to be witnessed on all sides to-day.  I charge the Government with being responsible for the deteriorating economic situation as a result of the gloomy and miserable speeches which they have been making for the past 18 months or so.  Whether or not the purpose of these speeches was to stimulate the economic deterioration, I cannot say, but, accompanying all the gloomy and despairing speeches, there has been a policy of restriction of credit&mdash;though the Taoiseach is the one man in the country who is not aware of it&mdash;and there has been a policy of dear money.  In addition, a general feeling of instability has been created by the Government's attack on the very <Col N="728" /> economic fabric of the State and on the financial foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the last general election the Government made a declaration of its policy in regard to prices.  We were told then that it was the policy of the Government to maintain the food subsidies, to control the prices of essential foodstuffs and to operate an efficient system of price regulation for all necessary and scarce commodities. That was the covenant of the Government to the people.  That was the assurance they gave to the country. That was the promise they made in return for political support from Deputies outside their own Party. Yet, in the first Budget for which they were responsible, not only did they tear that promise to shreds but, by slashing the food subsidies, the Government crippled the purchasing power of the people.  As a result, the Government have created a situation in which the people are so driven to find the wherewithal to purchase the bare necessaries of life that they have virtually no money left to buy other articles, the purchase of which helps to sustain trade and industry in many fields.</P>
    <P>Look at the situation into which we have been driven as a result of the Government's high prices policy. When they assumed office about 20 months ago tea was 2/8 a lb.: when they had finished manipulating tea prices, it had increased to 5/2 per lb. They found that the cost of the 2-lb. loaf was 6½d. and they increased it to 9¼d.  They found butter at 2/10 per lb. and they increased it to 4/2 per lb. They found flour at 2/8 a stone and they increased the price to 4/6.  Sugar cost 4½d. per lb. and they increased it to 6½d.  The effect of these colossal increases in prices&mdash;particularly in the homes of persons who are unable to buy the bare necessaries of life at the best of times&mdash;has been so crushing as to cause a serious deterioration in their standard of living.</P>
    <P>There is one economic wizard in all this business&mdash;Deputy Cogan.  Although the prices of tea, bread, sugar, butter and flour have increased substantially in the past 12 months, he has discovered that the agricultural worker&mdash;<Col N="729" /> a member of our depressed classes, in the economic sense&mdash;is much better off to-day than he was when he could buy tea at 2/8 a lb. instead of the present price of 5/2, and butter at 2/10 a lb. instead of the present price of 4/2. According to Deputy Cogan, the solution for the agricultural worker's economic ills is to drive up the prices of the main articles of foodstuffs on which he lives.  If that happens, then it will not be long&mdash;according to Deputy Cogan's concepts&mdash;until we shall arrive at a kind of economic El Dorado.</P>
    <P>Bad and all as were the effects of these increases, a worse feature is the fact that workers have not secured increases in their wages, or any other form of compensation, adequate to meet that substantial rise in prices. To judge by the movement of prices every day in the week, and by the recent notorious increase in the price of butter, we are by no means at the end of the high price policy pursued by this Government.  Lowly-paid civil servants are seriously affected by the rise in prices.  Although virtually every other class of worker in the community has received increases in wages to compensate in some measure for the rise in prices, the Government have steadfastly refused to grant any increase whatever to lowly-paid civil servants who are feeling very seriously indeed the critical impact on their domestic economy of the substantial rise in prices.</P>
    <P>I addressed a question to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to-day asking him to give me a statement of the wages of the manipulative grades in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs whose wages vary from under £2 a week to a figure not exceeding £10 a week.  I got this illuminating information from the Minister.  It shows that, of 6,220 full-time officers in these particular grades in the Post Office, no less than 4,857 have less than £6 a week to-day.  Six pound a week in 1953! To get a pre-war assessment of that, let us remember that our pre-war pound is now down from 20/- to 8/- in terms of 1939 purchasing power.  The Minister furnished information showing that there were 4,298 part-time officers, and <Col N="730" /> that of that number 3,495 have less than £3 a week on which they have to sustain themselves to-day.</P>
    <P>We see in the newspapers day after day awards by the Labour Court granting increases in wages to workers with higher remunerations than those which I have quoted. Nobody begrudges these increases to such workers because they realise that an increase in the cost of living has made these increases imperative. Nobody begrudges the increases in wages which have been granted to C.I.E. workers, to Aer Lingus workers, Bord na Móna and E.S.B. workers, or to any other class of workers, but what can the Government say in justification of its attitude and its action in refusing to give any increase in pay whatever to thousands of lowly paid workers whose remuneration does not exceed, as to 3,500 of them, £3 a week and whose remuneration in respect of 4,800 is below £6 a week to-day?  The Government has an easy, indeed an elastic conscience, if it imagines that it can find any justification on moral grounds for its hard hearted attitude in declining to grant an increase in wages to these underpaid State employees to whom an increase in wages is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government were, freely, partners to the establishment of the arbitration court.  They agreed that the claim for an increase in wages presented by the lower paid civil servants should be heard by the court.  They sent their heaviest artillery into the court to argue against the claim for an increase in pay.  The Government appointed the chairman of the court, and, notwithstanding the heavy artillery which was used by the Government to try and persuade the chairman to give no increase or to make the increase a very modest one, the chairman made an award granting the lower paid civil servants an increase which is comparable only with the increases which have been granted in private employment and in semi-State undertakings.  Yet, the Government refuses to honour the moral obligation which rests upon it to grant an increase in wages to those for whose remuneration the Government is morally responsible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="731" /> After the last election, or, rather, during the last election, we had a declaration from the present Tánaiste that the Fianna Fáil Party accepted the principle of arbitration as a method of adjusting disputes between Civil Service organisations on the one hand and the Government of the day on the other hand.  The only doubt the Tánaiste then expressed was whether the machinery would work quickly enough for his satisfaction, and he went on to add that, in so far as Civil Service organisations wanted arbitration machinery, they could have it and could use it.  His only doubt was that it would not give results quickly enough, but if they were prepared to have it they could have it and the Fianna Fáil Government would accept the awards made by the arbitration court.</P>
    <P>That was the promise then made by the Tánaiste: that, in brief, Fianna Fáil would accept the principle of arbitration, and that Fianna Fáil would accept the award of the arbitration board.  Although the Minister for Finance and the Government have had the report of the arbitration board now for four months, there is no indication from them that they will honour its report, or that they will fulfil the promise which the Tánaiste made on behalf of the Government to civil servants and the people generally.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Finance, when replying to this debate, to state on what grounds does he purport to justify his action in withholding these small increases from the grossly underpaid staffs of the Post Office, from the thousands of people who are earning less than £6 a week and from the thousands who are earning even less than £3 a week?  We are entitled to know what set of circumstances in this country justify the Minister in withholding such modest awards from persons who serve the public faithfully in a round-the-clock service, and yet who are not able to meet their liabilities on the miserably low rate of pay which they receive from the State as their employer.</P>
    <P>The Government in this matter is responsible to those whom it employs. <Col N="732" /> It cannot ride away from that responsibility, having taken part in the arbitration proceedings and having agreed to refer the claim for an increase in pay to the arbitration board.  There is one course, and one course only, that an honourable Government can adopt and that is to declare that it will accept the award of the arbitration board by which it is morally bound.  If there never was an arbitration board, and if there never had been a formal hearing by the board to decide the claim, the Government is still, surely, bound to adjust the wages of those it employs to meet the impact of increased prices, especially here, when the Government is deliberately responsible for raising prices.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Minister for Industry and Commerce declared that the Government accepted the position that when prices rise there should be an adjustment of pay to meet the impact of higher prices, and he congratulated the commercial community on the ease and smoothness with which adjustments in pay had been made, realising, as he did, that such an adjustment was inevitable once the cost of living had been increased so steeply and so positively by Government action.</P>
    <P>Is it unfair to ask the Tánaiste to take steps to ensure that the promise he made to the people and to the civil servants will be implemented by his Government with the ease and smoothness which was a source of admiration to him when the adjustment took place in respect of the employees in private industry?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance knows that there is no moral justification for the present attitude of the Government in withholding an increase from underpaid State servants, and in all decency the Minister ought even now indicate that the Government will accept the award and pay the award, modest as it is, in full.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the Taoiseach said the Government's policy was not only a wise policy but the best policy in present circumstances.  Let us put that wise and best policy against the background of unemployment.  On the last Saturday of February, 1951, there were 63,000 unemployed persons.  In <Col N="733" /> February, 1952, that figure had increased by 10,000, bringing it to 73,000.  By February, 1953, it had increased to 89,000.  In other words, the figure has increased by 26,000 since February, 1951, a jump of 10,000 in the first year of Fianna Fáil's period of office and a jump of 16,000 in the last 12 months.  Yet, we are told by the Taoiseach that the Government's policy is not only a wise policy but the best policy in all the circumstances.  Is it not a good job that we have not an unwise policy seeing that this Fianna Fáil wisdom has given us an increase of 26,000 in the number of unemployed over the past two years?</P>
    <P>These are ghastly figures.  No member of this House, no matter what his political view may be, would attempt to play down the human tragedy and suffering that is wrapped up in this figure of 89,000 unemployed men and women.  Bad as the figures are, the worst aspect of them is that they are increasing from week to week and there is no indication that we have yet reached the high watermark of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I have here a trade union publication for March, 1953.  It takes four classes of building trade workers: carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers, painters.  It gives the figure of unemployed in each of these crafts in Dublin at 1st July, 1951, 6th July, 1952 and 4th January, 1953.  Here are the totals: Among these four groups of craftsmen there were 221 unemployed workers in July, 1951.  By July, 1952, the number had increased to 351.  Between July, 1952 and January 1953, the number had increased to 1,112.</P>
    <P>Commenting on what it describes as the serious position in the building trade, this trade union publication says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is safe to state that if to-day there are five craftsmen idle for each one who was idle in 1951, there are at least ten labourers out of work at present for each one without a job two years ago and, because of the general fall in employment, especially in factories and along the docks, they have less chance of picking up a job outside the building trade to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, in these four occupations, <Col N="734" /> carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers and painters, there are five times more workers unemployed in the City of Dublin to-day than there were on 1st July, 1951.  That only provides supporting evidence for a document which has been issued as from a current date by the Central Statistics Office.  This document shows in its opening page an analysis of the live register of unemployed at mid-February, 1953, and it declares that between 17th January and 14th February, 1953, the live register increased by 3,485 to 88,095; that there was an increase of 3,296 in the male and 189 in the female register.  It goes on to add:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Compared with February, 1952, the live register showed an increase of 13,250.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On page two there is a breakdown of the industrial classification of the additional 13,000 unemployed.  It shows that there were 4,745 more unemployed in agriculture; 4,444 in building and constructional work; 1,452 in the distributive trades; 1,408 in transport and communications; 1,116 in food production; 960 in personal services and almost 1,000 in metal manufacturing, engineering and the construction of vehicles.</P>
    <P>There is a notion of unemployment which is growing rapidly, notwithstanding the fact that, according to the Taoiseach, the Government has a wise policy and the best policy in the circumstances.  All this comes from the Taoiseach who some years ago told us that he had the easiest solution in the world for the problem of unemployment. He declared in this House as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have time after time said that in my belief the solution of unemployment is easier to find in this country at this moment than in any other country facing that problem. If we make up our minds to apply the remedy, we have the remedy.  It is a question of organisation and of a proper lead from the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have had two speeches from the Taoiseach, one on his own Estimate about a month ago, another on the Vote on Account last night, and the surprising thing is that, so far, we have had no indication from the <Col N="735" /> Taoiseach as to how he proposes to solve the unemployment problem, the solution of which appeared so easy to him in his salad days.  We have had no declaration from the Taoiseach as to the steps which the Government propose to take to deal with the problem represented by 89,000 unemployed men and women; no plans, no proposals, although we were told on previous occasions by the Taoiseach that the remedy was a proper lead from the Government.  When will we get that lead?  Who will give it? When will it start?  What does it promise?  When will the 89,000 be provided with some relief from the morass of poverty and privation in which they are being steeped to-day as a result of the implementation of the wisest and best policy this Government can find?</P>
    <P>Let us pass from unemployment to emigration, again to test the wisdom of the Government's policy.  The Taoiseach was asked recently to give us figures as to the number of persons who are emigrating.  The Taoiseach has discovered that there are no reliable figures available.  That does not conceal the fact that tens of thousands of our people are emigrating, some of them forever, some of them settling down overseas, never to return to this country.  I think it was Deputy Briscoe who said that a goodly number of them were coming back.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Mr. Kennedy, could have told him that that is grossly untrue.  I addressed a question to the Minister for Social Welfare recently in order to ascertain how many persons claiming unemployment insurance benefit at a current date were showing their last place of employment as Great Britain. That is the test of whether they are coming back or not because, when they come back now, there are certain credits, 26 stamps, transferred by the British Government to our administration, and they draw benefit on those stamps.  When they go to the employment exchange, they are asked where they last worked and they say: &ldquo;In Great Britain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If you take those figures for this year and compare them with any other year you get a fair indication of the number <Col N="736" /> coming back and the number in one year as compared with another.  The figures furnished by the Parliamentary Secretary on that occasion show that there are fewer and fewer people stating that their last place of employment was Britain, which means that there are fewer and fewer people coming back from Britain to claim unemployment benefit here.</P>
    <P>The reply to a further question which I addressed to him shows that of the number coming back half of them are regular western and north-western migrant workers who follow a pattern of life in which they go across the Channel for a few months and then come back and claim benefit if there is no work available for them.</P>
    <P>In any event, we do not need figures in order to know the serious migration problem which confronts the nation.  It is a problem which represents a haemorrhage of the best blood of the nation.  We are exporting young men and women on a scale that would be alarming for any country and is particularly alarming for a country with an ageing population such as we have.  We do not need figures to know that emigration is serious.  Every port in this country and the land frontier show the number of people who are leaving the country every week in order to get employment in Britain because, with 89,000 persons unemployed here, there is no employment available for them. We could not but have emigration with so much employment available close to our shores and such a bleak outlook in the economic field revealed before the eyes of those of our people who are searching for work.</P>
    <P>Recently a census was published by the British Government which contained some of the most striking and revealing figures so far as this country is concerned.  It shows that there are living in Britain to-day, in British cities named in the report, more Irish-born persons than at any time since Britain first started to take a census.  The Irish-born population in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Coventry and Bristol is greater to-day than it has ever been in the memory of the oldest man or woman living.  Could it be <Col N="737" /> otherwise when we remember that over the past 21 years we have exported no less than 500,000 of our people overseas? Then we are told that we have a policy which is not only a wise one but the best policy available to our people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach some months ago delivered a speech in the West of Ireland in which he deplored the mass emigration to Britain and sympathised with the conditions in which they lived there and said our task must be to keep them at home by providing them with work at home.  Are we not entitled to ask what has been done in that field and what is being done to provide our people with employment?  What is being done to keep our people from living under the intolerable conditions which excited so much lip-sympathy from the Taoiseach, but, apparently, without any effective remedy so far as the unemployed are concerned, because they continue to grow from week to week?</P>
    <P>If we test it against the background of three vital factors, unemployment, emigration and prices higher than at any time in living memory, we can see the results of the Taoiseach's wise and best policy.  If these three factors are taken as an indication of the prosperity and the stability of the nation, we find a rapidly deteriorating situation, a situation which would call for emergency measures even if the problem were not as serious as it is to-day.  But we get no proposals from the Government.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance gaze in the crystal to see what the future of the country will be like.  Meantime the unemployed queue at the employment exchanges and their only relief from that is the emigrant ship to find the employment overseas which the Taoiseach was to provide them with here when he discovered that we had an easier solution than any other country.</P>
    <P>If I am any judge of the speech of the Minister for Finance on this Vote on Account, I venture to prophesy that we will see pursued during the next 12 months a policy of restriction, a policy of curtailment and a policy which will cut back development to the very bone. What we need to-day is not a policy of <Col N="738" /> financial restriction, a policy of contraction of development, a policy of dear money, but an expansion in every single field of national endeavour.  It is only by pursuing a bold and courageous policy of expansion that we can hope to take up the serious lag in employment and, at the same time, stop the emigration of our people to other lands.</P>
    <P>There is scope for development in almost every field of national activity. In the industrial field it is a matter for gratification that over the last 30 years a great deal has been done to give us a healthy secondary arm, to give our people opportunities for employment in the production of goods formerly imported. Nobody concerned with the well-being of the country can fail to applaud the remarkable strides made in that particular field.  But, although much has been done, much more still remains to be done if we are to provide ourselves here with a really healthy industrial arm.  We still import far too much goods, many of which ought to be manufactured here.</P>
    <P>I agree that we suffer from certain limitations in the matter of developing a heavy metal industry.  But, in the light metal and other alloy industries, I believe there is still scope for substantial development and, if it does not come through the medium of private enterprise, I see no reason why it should not come through the activities of a State organisation which would do in the field of the light metal industry what the E.S.B. has been able to do in the electrical field and Bord na Móna has been able to do in the turf field.  But, unless we are satisfied with the present stage of our industrial development, steps must be taken to provide for the manufacture here of as many as possible of the commodities which we import to-day.</P>
    <P>If we were to attempt the solution of that problem in a comprehensive and courageous way, I believe we would find in that new activity a wealth of employment for many of those who are forced to-day to leave this country to manufacture abroad the things we import when our own policy ought to be to keep these people at home producing <Col N="739" /> the commodities we are at present compelled to import.  In my view the opportunities for employment in the industrial field will best be attained by manufacturing here as much as possible of the commodities we are now importing.  It is along that road the greatest opportunity for expansion of our industrial activities lies.  I fear the opportunities for industrial exports are not good, having regard to the field in which we must compete, having regard to the highly capitalised countries we must meet in the foreign market and having regard to the long tradition of technical know-how with which these countries are served in the industrial sphere.</P>
    <P>A large number of our industries here are in the nature of assembly industries.  They depend on imported raw materials and in many cases they depend on the importation of the fabricated article which is ultimately assembled and sold here.  I think that there is a market for exports of that kind in no other country having regard to the cost of assembly and to the ultimate price of the finished product. I think, therefore, that our industrial expansion will come more by producing goods for our own requirements rather than from any effort, no matter how great or heroic it may be, to find a market overseas in saturated industrial fields.</P>
    <P>When I hear people say that the remedy for this country's economic difficulties is more work and harder work and contrast that statement with the hard fact that there are almost 90,000 people craving for an opportunity to work and yet denied it in their own land it always seems to me that there is a somewhat hollow ring about the exhortation to produce more and work harder when so many thousands are deprived of that opportunity at home.</P>
    <P>Our agricultural potentialities&mdash;and to this extent I share very substantially in the views expressed by Deputy McQuillan&mdash;provide the best opportunity available to us for an expansion of our national wealth.  Our whole agricultural policy is a vicious contradiction. No matter what side of the <Col N="740" /> House we may sit on, no matter what political parties we embrace, no matter what political causes we espouse, let us be clear that our agricultural policy is to-day a very unsatisfactory one and is giving us appallingly unsatisfactory results.</P>
    <P>We have here a fertile soil.  We have a climate and a soil which are the envy of many other countries in Europe.  Despite a fertile land, a suitable climate and excellent soil we nevertheless find that this is the most sparsely cultivated land in Western Europe to-day.  Notwithstanding the fertility of the soil and the obvious advantages of our climate we have an appallingly low rate of agricultural production.  We have a low standard of living associated with that agricultural production.  We have reached the position in which our agricultural production has been stagnant, not for two years or five years but for the past 50 years.  It may be that there is more of one crop grown to-day than there was 20, 30, 40 or 50 years ago but, if there is, there is less of another crop grown.</P>
    <P>We are producing to-day in relation to the productivity of other countries less than any other country in Western Europe.  Out of 12,000,000 acres of arable land we do not cultivate even 3,000,000 acres.  That is an appallingly low standard of productivity for a country so advantageously placed as we are in the matter of agricultural production. Not only has our agricultural production been stagnant for the past 50 years but agriculture is starved for want of capital.  An examination of European textbooks will show that there is less money per acre in the land here than there is in any other country in Europe.</P>
    <P>We have beside us a very valuable market which would take from us an enormously greater quantity of our agricultural and dairy produce.  We have still available to us markets on the Continent of Europe but we cannot secure a substantial foothold in any of these markets although these countries are clamouring for agricultural produce and for dairy produce and although the indications are that there will be a sustained demand for agricultural and <Col N="741" /> dairy produce for the next quarter of a century.  We do not seem to be doing anything here which indicates a sensible recognition of the markets available to us and the wealth that can be created at home by producing for export to these markets.</P>
    <P>We have now reached a situation which caps in a rather comic way our indifference to our agricultural productivity. Thanks to her majesty, the 300-gallon cow, we are now not only unable to provide ourselves with butter all the year round but we will find ourselves in future pressed out of the export market in relation to butter production.  Can anybody pretend to be satisfied with that situation?  Can anybody pretend to believe we have a healthy agricultural economy when we advert to the facts surrounding that economy?</P>
    <P>Can anybody presume to say that there is not room to-day for a substantial reorganisation and a complete reorientation of the agricultural policy we have pursued over the last thirty years, a policy that has given us such appalling results?  We have a low standard of living.  We have a low standard of production.  We have mass emigration from the rural areas and there is no indication whatever that we appreciate the valuable markets virtually on our doorstep if we would only gear up our agricultural production in an effort to collar those markets. To-day we have open access to these markets if only we are prepared to alter our agricultural methods and our agricultural economy.</P>
    <P>Consider what agriculture means to us.  Out of every person employed in Great Britain, five per cent. are employed on agriculture.  In the United States the figure is 12½ per cent. Here we employ in agriculture 45 per cent. out of the total number of persons employed, showing clearly the possibilities for employment that agriculture holds.  Unfortunately, while agricultural employment in Britain and the United States is of a highly rationalised and mechanised character, our agriculture is, to a great extent, merely subsistence agriculture, providing a low standard of living for those <Col N="742" /> engaged in it and not giving the nation the agricultural wealth it should be possible to create.</P>
    <P>We carry on that policy year after year.  If Wilkins Micawber had drafted our agricultural policy, he could not have framed a more leisurely one or an easier one.  We are satisfied to import commodities that we could easily grow at home.  We continue to follow a policy which makes that necessary. No other country in Europe in our circumstances would tolerate a situation in which fertile land was going a-begging while at the same time trying to borrow money and borrow hard currency in order to buy in a foreign market the commodities we could and should produce at home.</P>
    <P>If we are going to create here the wealth which agriculture is capable of giving and which probably agriculture is capable of giving more than any other facet of our national activities, then there must be an entirely new approach to the whole question of our agricultural production.  I agree with Deputy McQuillan that we must have some stable agricultural policy, an agricultural policy with which all parties will in the main agree, so that the country will know to what agricultural policy it will be committed for the next five, ten or 20 years.  The farmer is entitled to know what is the line of our agricultural policy, to what level our agricultural policy is to be geared and on what crops he may rely for a remunerative market with all the assistance that whatever Government is in power will give him from time to time.</P>
    <P>In the past this House has been torn in dissension between the question as to whether a live-stock policy or a tillage policy was the best for the country.  A great deal of the acrimony has gone out of the old-time discussion on that question.  There is now a sensible recognition of the fact that tillage is complementary to live stock and live stock is complementary to tillage.  In the face of what we have gone through during the last war there is now recognition of the fact that grass, instead of being an enemy of the Irish people, can be a very valuable crop for them, if we will only produce first-class grass <Col N="743" /> for our live stock.  What we ought to agree upon as a nation, irrespective of the political complexion of the Government that is in power, is that it is the aim of our people to produce a balanced agricultural economy, engaging in tillage, producing live stock, intensifying grass production, because grass is a valuable crop and could be the basis of some agricultural industries which could be started on a policy of rich grass.</P>
    <P>Not only must we decide upon the agricultural policy to be pursued but we must also insist on remedying the appalling consequences which flow from under capitalised land.  That can be done by making loans available to credit-worthy farmers at the lowest possible rate of interest, giving them loans to stock their land, to fertilise it and to modernise their methods of production and cultivation.  What we have to do, probably more than anything else&mdash;and it is a psychological approach to the problem&mdash;is to teach the farmer that the best place for whatever money he has is not in a bank, not even in an industry but in his own land and in the stomachs of his own stock.  If he can do that I think we will show some signs of bringing to agriculture a prosperity which it has not had up to now.  In that way we will embark on a policy which will lead to an ever-increasing output of agricultural and dairy produce and an ever-rising standard of living for those engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is by beaming our propaganda on new methods, new forms of assistance, a recognition of the potentialities that are in agriculture and of the markets that are available, that we can increase our national wealth and therefore spread the burden of taxation more evenly and more equitably over the entire community.  If we bring prosperity to agriculture, happily we need not contain it there.  If you bring prosperity into the rural areas where the farmer lives and works, where his employees live and work, then not only do you confer a benefit on those engaged in agriculture but immediately you set up a demand by those living in the rural areas for the goods and <Col N="744" /> services which are provided by industries and through other agencies in the cities and towns.  If you have got stagnation and recession in agriculture then that inevitably leads to inadequate industrial development. There will be a poor demand for goods and an inadequate return to the farmer, to the industrialist, and to the agricultural and industrial workers for their labour in their respective occupations.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate both the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach made reference to our balance of payments and our sterling position.  When we discuss our sterling assets we must remember that we practice a financial policy which has no parallel in any other country in the world to-day with the exception perhaps of the United States.  The mammoth size of that country prevents a reasonable comparison between our policy and the policy pursued by the United States Government.</P>
    <P>We have overseas and in London very substantial sterling assets which have been built up in two ways, firstly, by short fall in imports as compared with our exports, which happened during two world wars; and secondly, by the conservative policy of our banks in pursuing to almost insane limits this passion for what they call liquidity. The banks here are beset with the ever-present fear created only by themselves and in their own minds that some morning the depositors will all arrive and ask for their money back and the banks' view is that they must have the money on tap so that they can be paid out immediately.</P>
    <P>That is a short-sighted policy but the degree to which the banks followed the notion that liquidity is essential has again no parallel in any other country in Europe.  It is completely unnecessary in the light of the facts. Because of the conservative policy pursued by the banks they continue to invest substantial sums in Britain in the belief that they can get liquidity there and only there.  As a result of that policy plus our accumulated assets we have reached the situation in which hundreds of millions of pounds of our <Col N="745" /> money are invested now in what is described as sterling assets in Britain.</P>
    <P>We are a generation behind the rest of Europe&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that they have gone through two devastating wars&mdash;in the matter of industrial and agricultural development and in the matter of improving the entire national economy by large-scale schemes of public works.  We cannot afford as a nation to continue the policy of immobilising substantial assets in Britain while our own country is starved of the necessary capital to carry out industrial and agricultural development and a public works programme. Sheer good national house-keeping&mdash;putting it no higher than that&mdash;and sound economics demand that there should be, as speedily and as prudently as possible, a repatriation of our sterling assets for the purpose of national development.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to agree&mdash;and I do not think it is a matter for argument &mdash;that it is far more desirable that our sterling assets should be repatriated in the form of capital goods.  Nobody challenges that.  If at times of crisis such as the Korean war you have to import consumer goods which you would need after the war took place, I see nothing wrong with importing them in order to sustain our people during a war.  But, generally speaking, everyone would prefer to see sterling assets repatriated in the form of capital goods or goods which will be used for capital development here.</P>
    <P>It seems to be nothing short of folly that we should lend money to another country at 1½ per cent. interest while, at home, the farmer borrows money for agricultural purposes at 6 per cent. and the industrialist finds that he cannot get it even when he offers to pay 6 per cent.  There is, of course, a mentality in this country which has its headquarters in Foster Place which believes it is the destiny of the Irish people to continue to invest their money and their savings in London.  The exponents of that mentality continue to give that advice to our people, notwithstanding the fact that they know that Irish money invested in London is at the mercy of every economic wind and blizzard that blows in Britain and is exposed to every risk to which Britain <Col N="746" /> with her far-flung Empire may be exposed. Notwithstanding the fact that the £ has depreciated from 20/- to 8/-in terms of 1939 purchasing power, nothing seems to chill the hearts of these people to prevent them from tendering that advice to our people. The actual fact to-day is that we can repatriate in crowns, the pounds which we originally invested in Britain.  In that way, we get back only a fraction of the capital sum invested in the first instance.  In face of that fact, and of the under-development of this country, we still find the Central Bank telling the Government and the people to keep up the merry policy of giving to Britain at 1½ per cent. interest the money that we need for development at home while we cheerfully pay 6 per cent. interest for essential loans ourselves.</P>
    <P>What we have got to do is to decide on a policy, accepted by all Parties, deliberately to repatriate our sterling assets for the purpose of capital development at home&mdash;in the field of agriculture, in the field of industry, or through the medium of large-scale public works.</P>
    <P>We have got to beam our propaganda on our people to convince them that that is the best policy for this country to pursue.  After all, in an uneasy world with an uneasy peace running, the safest place for Irish money is, not in the Bank of England to be used for the development of Britain's Colonial Empire but in Irish land and in Irish industry.  Nobody concerned with the well-being of the country can seriously challenge an assertion of that kind.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, the Central Bank, in its last report, advised the continuance of a policy of investment in sterling in Britain.  Let us look at what has accompanied that policy of investment in sterling in Britain for the use of the British Government and the British people.  It has given us 90,000 unemployed people, mass emigration, money-starved land, a low standard of living generally, endemic poverty in certain rural areas, inadequate industrial development and a relatively undeveloped country.  I know of no more suicidal policy than <Col N="747" /> one which requires us, as a matter of financial prudence, to invest our hard-earned moneys overseas when there is so much valuable work to be done at home, which could spell, if we undertook it, a new standard of living for our people.  If we want to end unemployment, to develop industries, to expand agriculture, to provide houses and hospitals for our people, to develop our turf resources, to afforest the country, to undertake valuable schemes of national reconstruction, we can do all that, not by taxing our people to raise money to do it in one, two or three years, but by repatriating our sterling assets and using the nation's credit and whatever savings may be available from the people, to embark on a bold and vigorous policy of national development, particularly in the agricultural field, as offering the best prospect at present before us of increasing the national wealth, stopping the haemorrhage of emigration and providing employment for the tens of thousands of our people who are idle to-day.</P>
    <P>You have a choice to-day.  You can do these things or you need not do them, but assuredly as we decline to do them, 20 years hence in this House we shall be still talking about unemployment, emigration and a low standard of living as we are talking about these social evils and abscesses to-day. If we make up our mind to learn from the mistakes of the past, to recognise that the policy we have been pursuing is not giving satisfactory results and determine to bring that policy to an end in favour of a policy of large-scale development, I believe that, slow though the process might be, the adoption of such a policy would nevertheless offer substantial prospects of a complete transformation in the whole Irish economy with a better standard of living for tens of thousands of people who are forced to exist on an appallingly low standard of living to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote on Account annually gives us an opportunity of reviewing the general financial policy of the Government.  On this occasion, we can stand back and look in a rather <Col N="748" /> staggered way at the appalling consequences of what might best be described as the Government's lack of financial policy.  We have had a situation developing in this country where Ministers, in an hysterical mood, created an artificial atmosphere that built up, step by step, first the financial report and the trends of external trade report, then the Central Bank Report and, finally, the budgetary policy of last year.  We have the Minister glibly talking to-day of increased production and about certain ills in our economy.  The same Minister has had one extraordinary success.  Every guess he hazarded, every premise on which he based his arguments for his financial policy has been proved completely false.  Last year we had the ranting about disequilibrium in the balance of payments.  First of all, it was built into a first-class &ldquo;crisis&rdquo;, then reduced to a &ldquo;problem&rdquo;.  The Minister was warned and advised that in the normal course of things, the normal development of these problems would of itself neutralise the disequilibrium.</P>
      <P>In his Budget speech last year, the Minister said that there was no possible or potential likelihood of a substantial increase in agricultural production.  There again, the very premise on which he built his financial and economic plan was wrong.  We review now a sad situation.  Where, a year ago, the Minister accused the Irish people of living too well, of looking too well and of dressing too well, to-day we have an appalling situation and a very tragic picture on the face of this country&mdash;a picture which even the most somnulent and inept of Fianna Fáil Deputies must see.  We have a country distracted by rising unemployment.  You have a wholesale flight from the land&mdash;in many cases to swell unemployment queues in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a wholesale flight of young people from the country.  In such a situation, the Minister comes in and preaches an economic doctrine whereby he, by deliberate act on his part, increases overnight the price of all essential commodities. &ldquo;Up Dev&rdquo; they cried one time&mdash;and last year they got from the Minister for Finance, <Col N="749" /> Deputy MacEntee, up tea, up bread, up sugar, up butter, up milk, up the price of every essential commodity that goes into the working man's home.  No substantial compensation has been given to the people to meet the impact of that increase.  At the same time, we had all the accompanying elements that are attached to that kind of economy axe.  We have had depression in trade.</P>
    <P>No matter how the Government may deny it, there has been a substantial and effective restriction of credit.  We have had rising unemployment, rising part-time employment, increasing uncertainty in the field of employment. Fianna Fáil have certainly succeeded in launching the third war on the Irish people.  In the first place they launched the civil war in 1922.  Secondly, they launched the economic war in 1932, and thirdly, in 1952, they launched a deliberate attack on the standard of life of the Irish people.  They have deliberately torn down a structure and an artifice that was built up to enable economic expansion to take place.</P>
    <P>I am fully convinced that it was activated from top to bottom by sheer spite.  One thing which is patent and concrete and obvious about the present Government is that they are an inept, senile and useless combination.  The gyrations and the cerebral somersaults of the Taoiseach last night are sufficient and concrete evidence of it. There is not the least doubt about it that the only people in Ireland to-day who want Fianna Fáil in Government are the Fianna Fáil group of Deputies in this House and their supporters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect, the whole financial structure of the Government is in issue and the Government is, in the main, drawn from Fianna Fáil.  As such, I intend to corelate my remarks <i>á propos</i> their policy.  They have succeeded in increasing the cost of everything.  They have increased the cost of all essential commodities&mdash;to the farming community in particular.  In a campaign launched by the Minister for Finance for increased production, he started <Col N="750" /> off by giving the impact of all the increases to the farming community.  The farmer has to pay more for tea, butter, sugar, milk, flour and bread not only for all his family but for his employees as well.  The Minister for Finance asks him for increased production at a time when he is imposing indirect taxation on practically every other type of commodity that is going into the farmer's home.  The Minister for Finance has some archaic conception of economy whereby a man, paying more for all the essentials and getting no compensatory increase by way of profit for his produce, is better off than if the prices of these articles had continued at the subsidised rate.</P>
      <P>Last night the Taoiseach said that the Government's policy is not only a wise policy but that it is the best policy.  According to the Taoiseach, the best policy for a country that has the potential of being one of the finest little countries in the world is rising unemployment, absolutely wide-open emigration, uncertainty in trade, depression in business and a complete lack of initiative and drive and confidence among the people themselves. That is what is suggested to us here by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance as the best policy and the wisest policy for this country.  I have said before in this House and I repeat it now that the greatest curse that has hit this country since Cromwell has been a Fianna Fáil Government.  Their ideas, their financial policy and their conception of a policy for this country are even worse than what Cromwell did.  They are inept, inefficient and senile.  Too long a period of rejoicing, regurgitating and enjoying the fruits of office has taken its toll not only of the capacity of the present Government but also of their mentality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;F.F.&rdquo; they called themselves once &mdash;Fianna Fáil.  The &ldquo;F.F.&rdquo; could now very aptly mean &ldquo;Full Failure.&rdquo; Consider their 18 months of office. We have had an all-time record of an increase in unemployment.  They changed over from the inter-Party policy that was putting people by the thousands per month into employment. In 18 months of Fianna Fáil Government, from 1,500 to 2,000 and <Col N="751" /> 3,000 persons per month are being put out of employment.  One can hardly describe that as success.  Emigration is at a new all-time high level and it is likely to exceed, as month succeeds month, the previous monthly record.</P>
    <P>There has been a recession in trade nearly as bad as the worst facets of the 1929 to 1930 trade depression in America.  A creditor nation like our-selves&mdash;a nation credit-worthy all over the world&mdash;is being treated, for some sinister reason which only Fianna Fáil could conceive, to a financial policy that is normally applicable only to a debtor nation.  What is the result? Can Fianna Fáil never get away in its policy from trying to instil fear, unrest and uncertainty into the Irish people?</P>
    <P>I know that the Party was born in disunity and grew up in dissension, and that any time it had a difficulty it created new problems for the Irish people.  I did think, however, that we had advanced to the stage where we would get beyond putting the very economic foundations of the country in jeopardy for political caprice.  During their 16 years in office, Fianna Fáil had the opportunity of implementing all the grandiose schemes which the Taoiseach had for a solution of unemployment. Is there any Fianna Fáil Deputy who can now go down to his constituency and proudly boast that, with the return of his Party to office, and on the financial and budgetary policy of Deputy MacEntee last year, this country has succeeded in having 27,000 odd more unemployed in the 20 months since Fianna Fáil got back to office? That is a record which the Deputies opposite should carefully examine.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that we can see unrest and so many rifts in the lute around this House.  We know that there are many members of the Government Party who are violently at variance with the financial line that is being followed and who, like ourselves, believe that, with a sensible investment in the land, with confidence in the people and with a will to work, we can develop this country not as a pauper or as a mendicant nation, but as a proud independent and prosperous nation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> I want to deal specifically with the consequences of the Government's financial policy on agriculture which is the basis of our whole economic structure. The position in regard to agriculture is becoming more serious week after week.  Eggs and fowl I have become uneconomic for export while pork has virtually become uneconomic for export.  The costs of production are still rising, so that we are left in the situation that with the exception of beef, whether on the hoof or in dressed carcase form, we are running into a serious red light where agricultural exports are concerned.  We have the Government all the time shouting for increased production on the land at a time when it will not make any effort to give the farmer the basis for that increased production.</P>
    <P>There is only one way in which agricultural production can be substantially improved.  You must first of all improve the soil itself.  That, of its very nature, calls for a substantial and nation-wide plan of fertilisation.  What does this Government do in regard to the provision of fertilisers?  When speaking on his own Estimate, the Taoiseach referred to the value of artificial manures for the land.  If there was any sincerity in his speech, that it would repay the farmer more than 100 fold to put fertilisers on his land, then surely this Government or any Irish Government that was doing its duty to the people, would devise a scheme whereby the fertilisers now on their hands would be made available to farmers rather than have them in stores all over the country in a consolidated form where they will have to be mined and broken down.  If, as I say, there was any sincerity in what the Taoiseach has said, the Government would see to it that these fertilisers were spread on the land.  Ultimately, they will have to be written off as a loss.  This Government has been offering a certain type of fertiliser to the farmers, at the exorbitant price of £6 10s. and £7 10s. per ton more than they paid for it.</P>
    <P>We have another example of the Government's financial outlook in the way the Minister for Agriculture has dealt with butter.  When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, Danish <Col N="753" /> and New Zealand butter was imported to fill a lacuna.  At that time we had the people opposite going around the streets of Dublin and through the country, wailing like a lot of banshees. They were led by the Tánaiste and Deputy V. de Valera, wailing about the terrible quality of the butter which was imported.  Now the Fianna Fáil Government, as part of its financial policy, is not only importing New Zealand butter this year, but is flogging it on the black market to the Dublin people.  They have increased the price of butter to 4/2, which has, of course, put butter beyond the reach of the ordinary working-class family and the lowly-paid worker, but, worse still, they are going to make a cool £200,000 out of the transaction.  I asked the Minister for Agriculture yesterday whether he intended to amend his Estimate and show that reduction in the vote for his Department.  He was nonchalant and airy in saying that he was going to put it in the bag for something else.</P>
    <P>The financial policy of this Government is a very easy one because it is being dictated by outside influences. Fianna Fáil prate of their nationality and of their tremendous national strength and their national fervour, but even the most naïve of us can see how far Mr. Butler and Deputy Seán MacEntee got in their fraternal relations last year.  We had a facsimile produced here in Dublin last year by Deputy Seán MacEntee of the Budget that was framed by a Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer in England for a debtor nation, one of the biggest debtor nations in the world.  We had that from our Minister in regard to one of the most credit-worthy nations of its size in the world.  We had two Budgets produced last year of very similar pattern, one for a country carrying a tremendous weight of debt, and the other imposed on this country at a time when it was geared for expansion with fruitful schemes to be operated on syphoned money from State reserves, schemes designed to supplement the earnings and savings of the people for investment at home.  We had an Irish Government which was using the small savings of the people to good national purposes.  They had been <Col N="754" /> obtained from the people by way of subscription to the loans, and with the counterpart moneys were being utilised to help the development of those schemes to their utmost.</P>
    <P>Where you had schemes like those under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, large schemes of drainage, large schemes of improvement in rural areas; where you had more and more State money being poured into that effort, more and more employment being created locally; where you had people smiling and happy and a country geared up for further expansion, where you had people with the will to work and the will to come back and develop their own resources, where you had a Department of Local Government bringing back tradesmen, carpenters, plumbers, for the housing drive, within 20 months of the blight of Deputy Seán MacEntee as Minister for Finance, the whole picture is completely reversed.  We have rising unemployment, now becoming a major alarming national problem; we have ever-increasing emigration.  We have worse than that: we have lack of confidence that has been deliberately nurtured and fostered by Government ineptitude.</P>
    <P>This is a rotten, bad Government There is no question about it.  I do not put a tooth in it.  Full failure, full flight, not only from the country but from the land.  Look at the figures. Take the statistics of the central office and see how, year after year, there are fewer people employed on the land.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister expect, with lip service, to secure increased production? How does he expect to get it when more and more of the young are flying the land?  There is only one way to get increased production on the farms of Ireland.  It is a simple way and a straightforward way, if a government takes it.  It is to invest Irish money and all you can get of Irish money in the development of that land.  Give the farmer all the facilities he needs by way of fertiliser and improved seed to make that land produce more.  With sensible organisation, with constructive planning we can reach the stage where every holding, without exception, can be stepped <Col N="755" /> up 100 per cent. to 200 per cent. in production. It can only be done by a firm lead from the Government in the way of investment in Irish land.</P>
    <P>If the Government leads the way and if the farmer sees the finances of the country being sunk in the development and improvement of the land, whatever conservatism there may be in him about the investment of his reserve money will dissolve and, hand in hand with State investment in Irish land, if it is done on the proper scale, will go the ploughing back into the land, year after year, by the farmer and his family of profits, so as to keep steadily improving its heart and yield.</P>
    <P>There is no good in talking about production.  What is necessary for production is proper capital facilities for the farmer.  It would be a laugh to talk about this Government's attempt to give credit facilities to the farmers. The Inter-Party Government cannot boast of too great an advance in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is time we got away from lip service to archaic economies or archaicthinking economists.  It is time we got down to a real appreciation of the fact that in growing grass, in improving Irish land, in improving live stock, in growing timber, there is an ever-increasing and ever-improving investment for all the money available for the development of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not want to weary the House by going <i>ad nauseam</i> into the arguments that have been advanced by some of my colleagues against Government financial policy.  In a very simple way we can see the results.  In every village in rural Ireland there has been a substantial increase in the unemployment figure.  Walk around the towns of consequence and around the City of Dublin and you will find rising unemployment in them all.  Walk down any morning you like to the exchanges in Dublin to see what the situation is there.  Walk down to the B. &amp; I. or to the pier in Dun Laoghaire and you will see a most tragic panorama of what is going on in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>You can rest assured that I do not intend to obtrude on the time of the House to the same extent as any of the speakers to-day, whether of my own Party or other Parties, or indeed of the Clann na Talmhan Party.  I want to make the simple point, that it is time for this Government to get out.  The country does not believe that they are competent to manage its affairs.  They have given a very clear indication of the fact that they are not able to manage the country's affairs.  Every single diagnosis made by the Minister for Finance in his speech on the Budget in 1952 was false.  Every premise on which he based his case for his hair-shirt policy was erroneous and completely false. Every conclusion that he drew was completely false.  He, the Central Bank and whoever conceived the White Paper on the trends of external trade got a salutary answer in the actual results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will say to-night when he is concluding: &ldquo;These hardships had to come, but we have compensated you with certain ameliorations in social services.&rdquo; This nation has always been a nation of proud, self-respecting people.  If the farming community were given the credit facilities, the capital facilities, required for the development of their land they would be able to produce sufficient to ensure an ever-improving standard of life and ever-increasing exports.  They have never been given these facilities.  But, even in the hardship of the present situation, we find that this year our exports have gone over the £100,000,000 for the first time.  We are faced, however, with the appalling situation that hand-in-hand with our exports going over £100,000,000, the cost of running <Col N="757" /> this country has topped the £100,000,000 mark this year.</P>
    <P>We have undoubtedly reached a stage in this country where administrative costs have become unwieldy and where money is being used in a manner which I might describe as not completely wise.  All we want in this country is a Government prepared to think on progressive lines, prepared to get away from the woolly Victorian idea of economics.  We want a Government prepared to put their trust in their own people, in their capacity to work their own land and develop their own agricultural economy, because there is no solution to our economic ills, no matter how people may prate about it, in industrial development. Industrial development can only be, at its best, a subsidiary to the main, fundamental agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Agriculture in this country is completely starved of capital; in many cases it is archaic.  Not only have this Government done nothing about it, but other Governments have done very little about it.  If we want to improve the standard of life of our people, to see them eating more and more if they like it, looking more and more prosperous and dressing a good deal better if they want to, we can only do it by getting a Government which will have the courage to pour more and more money into the development and improvement of the land.  If we try, we can grow three or four blades of grass for every blade of grass grown at present.</P>
    <P>With any decent effort, we can improve the yield of every crop by 100 and 200 per cent.  We can improve the standard of life of the people in rural Ireland if the Government are prepared to do their job.  Unless they are prepared to provide, by wise investment, in the homes throughout the length and breadth of rural Ireland all the facilities in the way of electricity and sanitary accommodation which are provided in the cities, we will not get the people to stay on the land and work it.</P>
    <P>This Government have been a catastrophic failure for 20 months. They have embarked on a completely <Col N="758" /> erroneous policy.  They have abused the privileges they got by becoming the Government.  They are a minority Government, unwanted by anybody but themselves.  The best appeal we can make to them is: &ldquo;Get out quickly and ask the Irish people for a verdict on your madness.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take up the time of the House at great length, although there are a great many things I would like to have an opportunity to deal with.  I read the Taoiseach's speech with a great deal of interest and it occurred to me that the theme of the speech seemed to be mainly a defence of the situation which now exists by seeking to blame it on everybody else other than the Government. The Taoiseach's speech was also remarkable by reason of the fact that it ignored completely what is undoubtedly the biggest problem which faces the country at the moment, the unemployment crisis.  I do not propose to go into that at this stage because it has been dealt with by previous speakers at some length.</P>
      <P>It appeared to me, however, that the Taoiseach was making frantic defensive efforts in order to blame others for the evil results of the Government's policy.  One passage in particular of his speech, presumably correctly reported in his own newspaper, the <i>Irish Press</i> of to-day's date, I think summarises the Taoiseach's approach and the Government's approach to the present economic crisis in the country.  I quote from to-day's <i>Irish Press,</i> page 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of itself had done nothing to cause stringency. They did not wish for it and it was caused by means outside their control.  The only reason they permitted it was because they were satisfied that the evils which would follow from attempting to oppose it would be greater than those that followed from accepting it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a way that is typical, I think, of the indefiniteness of many of the Taoiseach's statements.  The Taoiseach says in the first place that the Government did nothing to cause the present crisis.  Surely that does not <Col N="759" /> bear examination.  Surely the present economic condition is a direct result of the Government's economic policy for the last 18 months.  But he then goes on to say that it was caused by means outside the control of the Government. What are those means?  Who are those people who created the crisis, if the Government did not?  We are not told that.</P>
    <P>Then he goes on and in the next sentence makes a more surprising admission still: &ldquo;The only reason they (the Government) permitted it was because they were satisfied that the evils which would follow from attempting to oppose it would be greater than those that followed from accepting it.&rdquo; The Government did not cause it; it was caused by means outside the control of the Government.  Yet the Government permitted it and, according to the Taoiseach, they could have stopped it if they had so desired, but they decided that the evil of stopping it would be greater than the evil of permitting it.  Does any Deputy, even on the Government Benches, accept these statements as a declaration of policy?  Can they stand over and justify them in public?</P>
    <P>Of course, the present unemployment position and the present increase in prices are the direct result of the Government's policy.  I understood that it was the avowed policy of the Government by their economic policy to reduce the purchasing power of the people so that they would consume less.  I did not think there was any dispute about that.  I think the Government had deliberately set about creating that position.  They set about achieving that result in three different ways: firstly, by restricting credit and by advising the banks to restrict credit; secondly, by increasing the price of every essential commodity by the removal of the food subsidies, and, thirdly, by the imposition of additional taxation on consumer goods. Those were the most effective steps that could be taken to reduce the purchasing power of the people.  Inevitably when one reduces the purchasing power of the people one creates unemployment, <Col N="760" /> for it is an inexorable rule of economics that if one reduces the purchasing power of the people one inevitably creates unemployment.</P>
    <P>It would be possible to give the Government a fool's pardon were it not for the fact that the Government were warned of these consequences not merely here but by their own advisors; they were advised by the Central Bank which desired to create that position and pointed out how best that situation could be created and how best the unusually favourable condition of employment could be remedied, how best the standard of living of the people could be reduced and how best it could be ensured that the people would eat less.  They pointed out step by step the various measures that should be taken to bring about that result and step by step these measures were taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, difficult in those circumstances to give the Government a fool's pardon for having brought about the conditions which their policy was so inevitably bound to create.  I would like to correct one statement made by the Taoiseach, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> to-day, when he was dealing with unemployment.  He said that when the inter-Party Government left office there were 61,000 unemployed. That is not so.  When the inter-Party Government resigned there were 30,000 people unemployed.  Summer figures are not comparable with winter figures. These figures represent summer unemployment and they were the lowest figures for the summer period on record.  There were 61,000 unemployed in the winter months of 1951.  That also represents the lowest figure in the history of winter unemployment in this country.  I merely correct these figures because there is always a danger that when misstatements of this kind are published they gain general acceptance and circulation.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Dáil and the country are now facing the inevitable result of the Government's policy.  It is very alarming that the Government has given no indication that it proposes to reverse its policy.  The continuance of this policy must lead to further unemployment and further emigration. <Col N="761" /> There will be a decrease in unemployment in the course of the next few months for seasonal reasons but, by and large, so long as the Government's present policy continues in operation unemployment will continue to grow. Remember, unemployment is progressive. The more people there are unemployed, the less money they have to spend and, in turn, unemployment generates unemployment.</P>
    <P>I think, too, possibly there is not a sufficient appreciation here and in the country generally of the economic consequences of unemployment from the Exchequer point of view.  Recently I asked a question here in regard to the cost of unemployment.  On the present unemployment figures taken at 90,000 the weekly cost is £113,040.  Obviously the more unemployed we have the more taxes we must collect to pay them the rather miserly relief we give them. Again the more taxes we have to collect the more unemployment we generate.  From that point of view we are in a vicious circle.  Quite apart from the actual cost to the Exchequer the revenue also loses heavily because it is a recognised fact that out of every £ paid out in wages 6/- goes back into the Exchequer by way of direct or indirect taxation.  A man who earns £5 per week contributes something in the region of 30/- per week to the revenue.  Accordingly the more people there are unemployed the more the revenue falls and the greater the burden is on those who have to bear taxation.  I do not think any of these factors can have been seriously considered by the Government.  I am trying to approach this question quite apart from the obvious evils of unemployment itself and quite apart from the obviously damaging effect of emigration on the social structure of our State.</P>
    <P>One thing that shocked me in the Book of Estimates is the sustained way in which every form of help given to the Gaeltacht, to the undeveloped areas, has been cheese-pared.  That has been going on for the last two years.  I appeal to the Deputies on the Government benches who represent these areas to make their influence felt within their own Party in order to remedy that <Col N="762" /> position.  I was glad to know that the Deputies on the Government benches had succeeded in making their influence felt in relation to forestry. There was a cut of £250,000 in forestry last year, but that was subsequently restored as a result of pressure by Government Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands and the Minister for Finance jointly took £250,000 off forestry last year.  During the year they gave back some of the money but they retained £28,000 of it.  This year the Vote for special employment schemes has been cut down by nearly £100,000 at a time when unemployment is higher than it has ever been in the last ten years. The money made available for fisheries has been cut by £100,000.  The money made available for Gaeltacht services has been cut by close on £90,000.  The amount of money made available to Fóras Tionscal has been cut by £150,000.  Deputies will remember the flourish of trumpets with which the Undeveloped Areas Bill was introduced here.  We were told £2,000,000 would transform the Gaeltacht.  Last year £250,000 was made available.  That figure is now reduced by £150,000 to £100,000.  I draw attention to these matters because I think that though the amounts may appear small they represent a somewhat large percentage of the total made available for these particular purposes and I hope that by drawing attention to them at this stage it may be possible to ensure that these moneys are restored.</P>
      <P>There is one further matter to which I would like to draw attention and that is the tremendous increase in the Secret Service Vote in the last two years.  I do not raise this matter from the point of view of calling for economy, but it is alarming to find that in this year's Estimates the Secret Service Vote is approximately five times bigger that it was two years ago.</P>

      <P>To hear Deputies speaking of the enormous Estimates for public services next year one would not realise that they exceed by only a little over £5,500,000 the Estimates for the current year and that the increases which are shown in the Estimates are mainly under three sub-heads.  The first one is health and the health Estimate is up by £4,750,000; £4,500,000 of this amount is for the continuation of the hospital programme.  I assume there is not a Deputy in this House who does not welcome the fact that that money is being made available for the continuation of the hospital building programme.  For many years now hospital building has been financed directly from the hospitals' sweep fund, and we are now reaching the stage when that money will have to be provided from central Government funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tremendous progress which has been made in the last few years in the building of sanatoria and hospitals is, I am sure, supported and acclaimed by everybody in this House.  The number of beds that has been made available for tuberculosis sufferers and the very fine services that have been <Col N="764" /> set up are an indication of the wisdom of that expenditure.  The decline in our mortality rates for tuberculosis and the decrease in the incidence of tuberculosis amongst children must be of great comfort to all of us. Unfortunately, there are still many other health problems to be tackled. Tuberculosis is one that has had the advantage of a really serious attempt to provide proper facilities and a courageous effort to provide a decent service.  I do not regard these Estimates as high.  I hope that, in future years, this country will be able to afford to provide very much greater sums for the continuation of hospital building and for the development of our health services.</P>
    <P>The other heading on which there has been an increase is social welfare. Social welfare accounts for practically £20,000,000, and between the amount for social welfare and the amount for health there is over £30,000,000, approximately one-third of the cost of the entire services.  To many people this may seem a large figure, but let us not lose sight of the fact that many countries throughout the world to-day, because of fear of aggression, because they want to try to preserve the integrity of their own countries, are content to spend between 50 and 60 per cent. of their budget on defence and rearmament.</P>
    <P>There are many of these social welfare benefits which I would like to see increased, particularly children's allowances.  One of the great defects I see in our system of wages and salaries is that we have not sufficient difference in remuneration for married men and bachelors.  This situation can be offset to a great extent by an increase in children's allowances, and it can be helped in another direction by increased income-tax reliefs under the heading of family allowances.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, strange in these circumstances that we should have Government and Opposition Deputies calling for a limitation of expenditure in the future.  We have a certain measure of agreement on both sides of the House that unless the country's earnings are increased, unless the economy of the country is considerably <Col N="765" /> strengthened, we cannot hope to be able to continue to pay for these public services.  How is it that this situation has come upon us so suddenly? Has this situation, where this country is not in a position to pay for even the modest services that it has at present, been developing over some time, or has it come on rapidly?  The Government spokesmen would have us believe that this deterioration in our earning capacity has taken place during the last couple of years when the last Government had the benefit of Marshall Aid.  There is little doubt that national housekeeping would be very much easier while a Government had the advantage of Marshall Aid, but there are certain striking factors which emerge from this situation that go much further back than that.</P>
    <P>There is now agreement on both sides of the House that agricultural production has not increased since world war two.  Many Deputies claim that it has not increased for 20, 30 or 50 years.  There seems to be agreement amongst quite a number of Deputies that the agricultural industry in this country is stagnant.  The recent O.E.E.C. report which was presented to the last meeting of the Council of Europe points out that the labour force of the agricultural industry in this country is declining at the rate of 15,000 a year.</P>
    <P>When we look to the position of industry, we find that despite the attacks on our sheltered industries and our allegedly very wealthy industrialists, in the last 20 to 25 years industries have contributed considerably to improving our economic position.  If the agricultural industry had been able to show the same proportionate increase in production in the last 20 years that our industries have shown, we would be quite a wealthy country to-day.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to take up the time of the House any further.  There is now one real problem facing this country, and all other problems which have been discussed pale into insignificance beside it; that is, that there are 90,000 people unemployed.  I want to find out what exactly is the policy of the present Government to alleviate that situation.  I have looked in these <Col N="766" /> Estimates and quite frankly I do not see anything that promises the slightest hope of alleviation to those 90,000 unemployed.  As far as capital services are concerned, they show an increase of about £100,000 over what was spent last year.</P>
    <P>What is the attitude of the Opposition in this regard?  The attitude of the Opposition has been to do what any Opposition would have done in the circumstances, to capitalise on the present situation by throwing the blame on the Government now in office.  That is not enough, however.  It is not enough for the Opposition to sit here and wait for government to fall into their hands.  We are in a position now that the present Government have only just finished blaming the last Government for the difficulties that we are now facing and that the Opposition are holding themselves in readiness to blame the present Government if government should come to their hands.</P>
    <P>I think that it is the duty of any Government in power in this country to provide a definite plan to deal with the unemployment position.  The day has gone when a country could live from year to year on a haphazard system.  Whatever form of Government a country possesses, whether it be communism, capitalism, socialism or anything else, I believe it must have a plan prepared to deal with this problem.  I believe that whatever Government is going to tackle this problem will have to tackle it by bringing forward a courageous plan which will cover unemployment over the next five or ten years.  It must have the courage to set down definitely the number of people it proposes to re-employ each year.  It must set out clearly what private enterprise can be expected to contribute to the re-employment.  It must set out clearly what part the State will be expected to play and take the necessary powers to see that the State can attain its goal.</P>
    <P>The economic policy of the present Government, as far as I can see, is No. 1, that the Budget must be balanced.  It would appear that the Opposition hold the same view.  It is held, No. 2, that there must be no further reduction of external reserves and that the rate of external disinvestment <Col N="767" /> must be retarded.  No. 3, it is held that the deficit in the balance of payments should be reduced as much as possible.  So far as I can see, if each one of those tenets is accepted as sacrosanct the position in regard to the alleviation of unemployment cannot be helped in any way.  If one accepts these tenets, I see every likelihood of a further deterioration in the present employment position.</P>
    <P>So far as the Government are concerned, I think that much of the legislation which they have brought into being since they came back into office less than two years ago has been very good.  They have introduced a good deal of very progressive legislation, but I think that the Government's policy in general is based on wrong economic premises.  I say without a moment's hesitation that, even though their economic policy may be wrong, it is an economic policy in which they must believe with absolute sincerity because I pay little compliment to the Fianna Fáil Party when I say that no group with their political experience would attempt to stand over such a policy, unless they were convinced that there was no alternative.</P>
    <P>I cannot see that the policy adopted by the present Government or the hairsplitting alternatives put forward by the Opposition are going to deal with the situation.  I think that if we are going to tackle this problem seriously, we must overhaul our whole existing financial policy and structure.  We have got to throw the whole thing overboard, lock, stock and barrel.  What good is it to this country, if it is to have 90,000 people unemployed and 120,000 or 130,000 emigrating each year, to have high sterling investments? What good is there in having £400,000,000 invested in another country if the Irish people are to be condemned to these appalling conditions?</P>
    <P>No man in his private domestic budget, if he were not earning sufficient money to support his family and feed them properly, would neglect to seek more remunerative employment for himself, if he could.  So, too, we as a nation must consider the Irish people <Col N="768" /> first.  It is our duty, as a Parliament here, to provide a plan to deal with the situation and to stick to it.  I read recently that in the United States of America where unemployment at present is only a little over 1,000,000 &mdash;a remarkable achievement considering the population&mdash;it is expected that by 1953 or 1954 there may be up to 10,000,000 people unemployed.  In that country, the Republican Party is not preparing to blame the Democratic Party for that situation as it arises. It has informed the American people that measures must be planned now to deal with the situation and they are speaking in terms of capital projects much in the same way as we heard them mentioned in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan dealt with the question of turf production and many other speakers touched on capital projects which are crying out for development.  I think we have got to face the situation courageously.  We owe it to the country to provide a plan, to set up definite targets and to tell the people exactly what we are going to do.  I believe that if we tell the people what we intend to do, they will be quite prepared to bear whatever burdens may be necessary for the achievement of that plan.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, when he is introducing the Budget, to give consideration to these facts.  The last Budget was a very tough Budget.  It was thought by many of us at the time that it might have many unpleasant effects, but I think the Government had no alternative but to provide the amount of taxation which they sought at the time.  Let us, however, make no mistake about it, that Budget hit the working classes of this country much harder than anybody else.  I feel that we have now reached a situation where we in this House must produce a plan, no matter where it comes from, even though it may come from both sides of the House.  We have got to plan our economy to deal with a deteriorating situation, to give the Irish people a definite target and to work steadily towards reaching that target during the coming year.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="769" /> think we can divide the post-war period into two parts and take the dividing line at about the time the United Nations forces came up against what amounted almost to a debacle. We know it was that debacle that put an end to the inter-Party Government in this country.  The present Government is getting a great deal of advice from those who had their hands at the helm in 1950.  We know that when faced with difficulty they threw up the post as untenable, went out by the obvious method of having an election, and passed the buck to somebody who was prepared to face the music.  We are now facing the music and devising the means whereby the situation can be made manageable.  We have got a good deal of advice about financial manipulation, but Fianna Fáil does not recommend to the Irish people that, in a time of crisis, they can solve their problems by any financial manipulation. As the Taoiseach said yesterday, if we cannot produce wealth, then we continue to go down the slippery slope.</P>

We had arranged a very fine turf production programme.  The men who were to take charge of this production campaign were assigned to their posts.  When the Government which Deputy Hickey backed came into office that fine scheme of turf production was scrapped at one stroke, and all the people who were to find employment on it went to England.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition referred to the Budget as record in size. It is a record Budget.  Wages and salaries are at a record level.  Rates are at a record level.  Everything can have that &ldquo;record&rdquo; tag attached to it.</P>

      <P>Another argument of the Labour Party is on the question of subsidies&mdash;which Fianna Fáil reduced considerably, but did not abolish.  It is that they always regarded subsidies as being a supplement to wages.  To bring another inconsistency to light, while that viewpoint was being mouthed all over the country and in this House, we were all told that certain employers who were paying low wages were getting away with monstrous profits and that, in fact, they should be in jail and behind closed doors.  Can anybody consistently say that people who are making such huge profits should have the wages that they are paying to the workers subsidised by the taxpayer? We followed the logic of the Labour <Col N="771" /> Party argument in that respect.  We reduced the subsidies and made the employers pay the wages out of their own industries.</P>

      <P>We have heard about the increase in unemployment.  That increase is partly explained by the increase in benefits, as has been explained by various Government spokesmen. Assuming that that could not explain away any part of it and that the increase in unemployment resulted from economic causes, we can point to countries not very far away in which there has been an alarming increase in unemployment.  That is so, despite the fact that intense preparation for war is taking place and that conditions exist there in which one would expect that there would be no unemployment whatsoever.</P>
      <P>In Britain to-day the food situation is better than it was some years ago, but the strangest reason at all is offered for the improved food position. It is that the people are unable to buy it.  Although the numbers of registered unemployed&mdash;that is, those who are completely unemployed&mdash;have been swelled enormously in the last 12 or 18 months in Britain, that is not the whole picture.  A very large number of those unemployed are working four days a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to impress <Col N="772" /> upon Deputy O'Leary that the argument cannot be used both ways.  We are maintaining our population here&mdash; as all the evidences indicate.  The housing shortage, about which the Labour Party talked so much, is one evidence of it in all our towns and cities.  There is no evidence of a decrease in population there.</P>
      <P>I come now to the system of registering the unemployed.  The increase in the benefits under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, has made it worth while for people who never signed on before to sign on now.  I think that, coming from a rural constituency, Deputy O'Leary knows that to be the case.</P>

      <P>I think that when the question is put to us as to what we propose to do about tackling the unemployment problem we have a very good answer&mdash;even if I must quote statistics to give it.  It has been said of us that we threw the capital investment plan of the previous Government overboard. Nothing could be further from the truth as will be seen if one takes the development programme generally into account.  Take housing, hospitals, schools, Bord na Móna, electrical development, forestry, land improvement, arterial drainage, employment and emergency schemes&mdash;the whole gamut shows a better picture than was there two or three years ago.  In spite of the fact that hardships have had to be imposed in the Budget of 1952, the Government has seen to it that the question of finding employment for the people at home was not to be neglected &mdash;and the capital moneys necessary for financing these schemes have been found by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance were able to borrow £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 abroad and if he were able to borrow another £40,000,000 or £50,000,000 at home, it is obvious that it would not be necessary for him to impose this taxation. The Marshall Aid came to an end with the debacle in Korea.  That source of financing Government activities, when the inter-Party Government <Col N="773" /> were in office, dried up very quickly. The response of the Irish people to the last loan that was floated by the intere-Party Government indicated that that source of borrowing money at home had dried up.  What alternative was open to the inter-Party Government if they had come back to office in 1951?&mdash; and perhaps it is a pity, for the political education of the country, theat they did not come back to office in 1951. They would have had to do in 1951 precisely what we did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever Government might have been returned to office, it would have been their duty to look after the finances and to utilise the resources available to them.  After the debacle in Korea, the resources available to them were the ability of the Irish people to pay taxes to finance current expenditure.  In my opinion, the inter-Party Government might be here yet if they had not burned their boats so quickly on this question of taxation.  They could have continued to get a little more revenue from the Irish people after 1948 and still continue to blame Fianna Fáil for having imposed it.  However, the main plurpose was to endeavour to show that Fianna Fáil represented a policy of hair-shirtism and retrenchment. It was very pleasant to go into office and increase the circulation enormously of consumer goods bought on borrowed money.  That did create a very pleasant picture for the Coaliation Government for about two years, and if the Korean War had not upset the apple-cart, then I take it that condition of affairs might have continued for some time longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride said a short time ago that the Government's deliberate policy of reducing the purchasing power of the public was causing unemployment. As a matter of fact the reverse process took place in relation to the textile industry.  The extent to which the last Government allowed textile goods into this country almost finished the textile industry here.  It was not until the present Minister for Industry and Commerce put a very <Col N="774" /> heavy tariff on textiles that full employment in that industry was restored.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy MacBride say that our attitude towards the Gaeltacht was a cheeseparing one.  I do not think that is borne out by the facts.  He mentioned that the Vote for Fihseries was being reduced by £100,000.  I do not blame him for falling into an errot there, because under the 1952 Sea Fisheries Act the money advanced by Bord Iascaigh Mara is being found in the Central Fund.  Since it is advanced in that way.  It does not not appear in the Book of Estimates. That explains the figure of £100,000.</P>
    <P>With regard to other services for the Gaeltacht, Deputy Lynch, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, has a scheme of road development which was very badly needed by the local population as well as a by the visiting population in the summer time. That work, which will go on over a period of over eight years, will involve the distribution of a good deal of earnings in areas where it is difficult to find suitable schemes of employment. The Government is not confining itself to works such as road works and houses.  It has schemes which will give permanent employment as well. The object of one recently announced is to add to the total output of electricity by the utilisation of our bogs. As Deputies are aware, the Minister for Industry and Commerce announced recently that four stations will be erected in these areas.  The production of turf for consumption in these stations should, in my opinion, put the turf industry in those areas, at any rate, on its feet and on a permanent basis.  We know how effectively the turf industry, as it was carried on during the war, spread the earning of money in those areas and lifted them all out of a poverty line.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the scheme of electrical development in the County Mayo area of Bangor-Erris will eventually produce twice as much current as the Shannon scheme.  Again, let me make a comparison.  I do not like having to do so, but the Opposition force them on one.  Take the question of electrical development.  We place our faith on native fuel such as <Col N="775" /> water and turf.  We feel that these sources of power should be exhausted before foreign fuels are called into service. When we went out of office in 1948, and the inter-Party Government took over, they authorised the building of two stations, each of which is to use foreign fuel, one coal and the other oil.  I think that comparison speaks volumes on the difference in outlook between Fianna Fáil and the inter-Party on this question of national development.</P>
    <P>I might also point out, on this question of finding employment, that the action of the inter-Party Government in scrapping the chassis factory, which was to be operated by C.I.E., was regrettable.  The absence of such a factory was severely felt during the war.  I have heard people in various departments of the engineering industry say that such a factory was one of the greatest needs of the country during the war.  One person, in particular, said to me that it was the most retrograde and backward step any Government could take, and that, for preference, he would almost prefer to see County Donegal being given away to the Six County Government rather than that this very important step in national development should have been scrapped by the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House very long, but it is not easy to remain silent on a debate such as this when the whole field of national economic endeavour is subjected to review, and when you hear the most contradictory statements put forward from the same side of the House for the same purpose of putting Fianna Fáil in the wrong. I can give an example of what I mean by citing statements made by the Leader of the Opposition and another former Minister.  One said that production was so costly in this country that we could not export.  The other said that we were exporting satisfactorily, the reason being that the Irish people could not afford to buy the goods we were making.  On which leg do they stand?  If we take what one speaker said that our costs of production are so high that other countries <Col N="776" /> cannot pay us, I take it that is first-class evidence that our standard of living is high, and that we have no slave labour producing goods in this country.  Capital investment, as I have shown, has been increased.</P>
    <P>Great play was made with the question of the repatriation of our foreign assets.  It is very easy to get expressions that become in a short time, because of hackneyed use, clichés, like &ldquo;repatriation of national assets&rdquo;.  I understand that there is only about £100,000,000 abroad, which any Irish Government can control, and I fail to see how the bringing back of a sum of £100,000,000&mdash;which is only the equivalent of one year's Budget&mdash; the Book of Estimates this year is for £100,000,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Half of the £225,000,000 is the property of private people.  Does Deputy Hickey suggest or does Deputy MacBride suggest that any Government, even an inter-Party Government, will confiscate the earnings of private citizens in this country, simply because they have them invested in England?</P>

      <P>That leaves you with a sum of £100,000,000 which the Government can control, no matter how you try to juggle with the figures.  As Deputy Norton pointed out, you cannot repatriate your assets by going over and getting 100,000 pound notes in England and bringing them back.  You have to get goods and, as he admitted, they brought in consumer goods to a large extent in preference to capital goods to make the position easier for the consumer and to make life a little <Col N="777" /> more pleasant than was their experience while they had the Fianna Fáil Government.  In any event, we know that it was this inordinate purchase of consumer goods that created the trade recession about which we have heard so much.  If the American dollars had been spent on purchasing capital goods for the reproduction of wealth here you would not have had that recession of trade that is only gradually being overcome.</P>
      <P>I listened to eloquent appeals this afternoon.  I think Deputy Giles was the most eloquent.  The contradictions in the arguments and appeals from the Opposition lead to one inescapable conclusion, that there is no other method of rehabilitating the finances and economy of this country than the method that has been undertaken by the Fianna Fáil Government, and even if it happens to be temporarily painful, the result will be good, just like the drawing of a tooth.</P>

      <P>The toothache is over now.  The Minister for Finance has indicated that the people will have to produce more wealth and the policy for that production is being shaped by Fianna Fáil.

      <P>We are doing it.  I have read the heads for Deputy Hickey under which we are doing it&mdash;electrical development, forestry, Bord na Móna, land improvement, arterial drainage and then other matters like roads, housing, hospitals and schools.  We are doing it under all these heads.  If countries with the artificial stimulus of war preparations are finding unemployment <Col N="778" /> figures increasing, is it any wonder that we, whose economy is not based on war preparations, should be suffering difficulties in this time of universal difficulty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have struck out on our own.  For instance, we are trying to get as much of our electricity from our own turf and water as possible. There is a striking out on our own.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a facet of the whole national economy which Deputy Hickey can mention in connection with which Fianna Fáil is not doing what I know Deputy Hickey wants done.  The difficulty with Deputy Hickey is that he believes he can get achievement by manipulation.  Fianna Fáil believes no such thing.  Fianna Fáil believes there must be production, that we must have more butter, more turf, more wheat, more houses.  Therein lies the wealth, not in this ephemeral thing of printing money, manipulating credit or using high-falutin expressions like &ldquo;repatriation of assets&rdquo; which people repeat as parrot cries as political arguments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello brought us to book because of our fanatical adherence to what he called financial orthodoxy. &ldquo;Financial orthodoxy&rdquo; is one of those high-falutin expressions which there is not much use in using in Connemara.  If we use the term which the Taoiseach has used and say that every nation, like every household and individual, must pay its way, the man in Connemara understands what you mean.  That is what we mean&mdash;that the country, like the individual, must pay its way.  You will not find the Opposition, or even Deputy Hickey, saying that you should not pay your way, but he will rattle us on this question of financial orthodoxy, whatever he means.</P>

      <P>If we wanted to have a fluctuating rate of exchange to-morrow, Deputy Hickey knows that we have the power to have it, but we do not have a fluctuating rate of exchange because it would be inconvenient to have it, and for no other reason.  Use plain terms when you are talking to the people and trying to explain these things to the people and cut out these high-falutin expressions like &ldquo;repatriation of assets&rdquo;, &ldquo;financial orthodoxy&rdquo; and &ldquo;balancing of books&rdquo;.  We are charged with playing ducks and drakes with the well-being and, in fact, with the very livelihood of the country because of our text-book adherence to things like financial orthodoxy and balancing books.</P>
      <P>This term, balancing the books, has been referred to as if it were a juggler's job of equipoise.  We know, and Deputy Hickey knows&mdash;because I understand he is a student of international finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the best economists in the world, whom I am quite sure would be accepted without question by Deputy Hickey, have stated quite definitely that if you do not regulate your economic affairs with other nations, if you do not, for instance, keep this balance of payments under control, if the gap becomes too big, you will depreciate the standard of life of your own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we set out to ensure that the gap between our imports and our exports will not be too great, we did it for the same reason, that the value of our money will be maintained and, consequently, the standard of living of our people will not be impaired.  Therefore our appeal to the public is to face the situation as the head of a house would face the situation for his own <Col N="780" /> family.  If Deputy O'Leary were to borrow money to buy his tobacco and his other&mdash;what I might call&mdash;consumable goods, he would find himself out on the road very quickly.  But, if he borrowed money to buy a spade to dig his garden so that he can have a crop in it, when he gets that crop in the autumn he will be able to pay back the price of the spade.  We approve of that type of borrowing, but we say to the Irish people that they ought not to borrow for things which are for current consumption.</P>
    <P>In any event, there is one inescapable fact, a fact that any member of the former inter-Party Government cannot explain.  If their policy and their method of handling national affairs were as good and as effective as they want people to believe, why is it that in 1951, without being defeated in this House, they left the mantle of Government behind them and handed it over to Fianna Fáil?  Is it not because the world position had deteriorated so much that they could not get agreement among the various Parties forming the Coalition to take the steps that obviously had to be taken?  Is not that why they went out without being defeated in this House in 1951, and had an election, and by that means gave the difficult job to Fianna Fáil in the hope that Fianna Fáil would carry on over the difficult years and that, as the position got bright again, as it was in 1948, they would go again to the country and put Fianna Fáil out and the process would be resumed?</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister introduced this Vote he struck some rather peculiar notes.  One note that he repeated three or four times was the capacity and willingness of the people to bear this burden.  He did say that they were not able to bear any more, that we had reached the limit, but that the people are willing to pay and have the capacity to pay what is now proposed.  Of course, everybody knows that that is very far removed from the truth.  But when you examine the policy of the Government, no matter what anybody may say to the contrary, you find that it has been a complete failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> As has been stated, it has increased unemployment.  There is a bigger number unemployed to-day than for a very long time.  I have been over a good part of the country and the number of people on short time in various industries is very menacing. Some of them are on short time for three days a week and on the dole for the other three days.  These people are not shown as unemployed and are not included in the figures for unemployment. Deputy Dr. Browne stated that whether the figure was 60,000, 70,000 or 80,000, it was a very alarming figure.  Of course, he must accept what the Government say, and they say that the figure is 90,000 to-day. That represents one-sixth of those engaged in industry and agriculture. That is the situation that Fianna Fáil has brought about.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance deliberately imposed the plan of the Central Bank and the plan of his own Department by increasing taxation and reducing certain types of expenditure on the ground that there was inflation. Of course, the people who talk about millions for Constellations and £250,000 for a racehorse have inflated ideas.  But where is the inflation amongst the ordinary people down the country?  Where is the inflation amongst the people who are selling beet, wheat or barley?  There is no inflation because the price is not sufficient. Yet, according to Fianna Fáil, they are eating too much and living too well.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the condition of the farming community has improved considerably since 1939.  In 1939 the conditions under which they existed were almost impossible.  Whatever improvement has taken place in their condition, between rates and taxation, indirect, I admit, to a great extent, the increase for them has been enormous and any profit they may make is easily taken away.</P>
    <P>I was perturbed when I heard the Minister for Lands quoting the report of the American experts.  When I asked him to pass it over to his colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, because he was not in agreement with all that the Minister was preaching, he told me to chew upon <Col N="782" /> this.  Therefore I take it that he has already chewed upon it and accepted it.  As reported in Volume 137, No. 3, column 446 of the Official Report, he quoted this from the report of the American experts:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would appear that there is room for increasing the tax payments on the agricultural side of the economy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He told us to chew on that.  Deputy Dr. Browne takes the same line, that the agricultural community should be taxed further.  Of course when Senator Quirke in the Seanad proposed a tax upon cattle I admit that he was immediately disowned by Fianna Fáil. But is it not rather significant that a Minister and a Deputy should have suggested an increased tax on our agricultural produce?</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy Corry and the other farmer Deputies here will want to be wide awake before the next Budget because the blow is likely to fall upon them if they do not join with me and people like me to ensure now that the farmers are not penalised.  It is astonishing to find here the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Childers, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll lecturing the farmers about what they allege as the obsolete conduct of agricultural activities.  I guarantee that if one put the three of them together on a farm and told them to eke out an existence on it the three would starve inside a week.  They could not get a living on it even if they were paid for it.  I know the Minister for Finance would be in a bad spot, too, if he was down on a farm for a week.</P>

      <P>These are the people who lecture the agricultural community upon their activities.  One said that farming activities to-day were obsolete 200 years ago.  That is not true, and these Deputies do not know what they are talking about. The fact is that, up to the present, no help has been given to the farmers to get from the land the productivity they should get.  When the previous <Col N="783" /> Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, purchased £900,000 worth of fertilisers at £9 per ton, what did Fianna Fáil say?  They said he went on a spending spree and spent close on £1,000,000 in a night.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>The Minister will have his hour and a half.  Deputy Dillon was charged with going on a spending spree.  Was it not a pity he did not spend £9,000,000, because then we would have what the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture have now found out the country wants when they were down in the Gresham Hotel recently, namely, lime and fertilisers. Shades of James Dillon! They have now found out that these are some of our requirements.</P>
      <P>Another thing that struck me forcibly to-night was hearing the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bartley, calmly telling the House that the reason why food was becoming plentiful in Britain was because the people in Britain were not able to pay for food.  Shades of the economic war! I heard the Taoiseach declare that in 1934; he said the British market was gone, and gone forever, because the people in Britain could not buy our fat cattle.  Deputy Bartley trots that out to-night.  Mark you, the Government of which he is a member has asserted that there is a first-class market at our door and that there is available there a market for all our agricultural produce, to say nothing of whatever market is available upon the Continent of Europe or elsewhere. After all the efforts in the past, no market has ever been found to equal the market at our door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of this Government has created grave unemployment.  Speaking here yesterday the Taoiseach said that the Government did not select this <Col N="784" /> programme, that it was not of their choosing.  He said that the restriction by the banks was not their wish.  But in the very next breath he told us that they had to choose the lesser of two evils, and it was essential, therefore, to have a restriction of credit.  We all know the hardship that has caused.  I heard the Taoiseach say yesterday that there was no evidence of a restriction of credit to credit-worthy people.  I have told him before&mdash;I repeat it now&mdash; that there is a restriction of credit.  Last year a prominent merchant engaged in the production of certified seed potatoes was refused credit by the bank although every year prior to that from December until the 17th March there was always credit available to him.  He rang me up and I went down with him and saw the secretary of the bank.  The secretary did say that the restriction of credit had taken place under Government orders.  I asked him to give me that in writing and he refused. Strange as it may seem, because I challenged him to put it in black and white, that potato merchant got the credit he required the next day. If he had not had somebody like me to go with him he would not have got it.</P>
    <P>One of the main points in the Government's programme was increased production, but the production of seed potatoes would have decreased because of governmental policy as far as that man was concerned.  I could give other instances, but I do not want to delay the House.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bartley, talks to-night about the inter-Party Government stopping the production of turf.  He told us they were in favour of the production of electricity by water and turf.  I was glad to hear that.  It is a remarkable conversion. The present Minister for Finance declared on one occasion that the Shannon scheme was a white elephant.</P>

      <P>And the dearest plant is producing to-day the cheapest electricity that has ever been produced or will be produced by any of the new plants that have been put into operation. No turf plant or any other plant can equal the cheapness of its production costs.  I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say the inter-Party Government stopped both the hand-won turf and the machine-won turf.  Earlier this evening Deputy McQuillan complained that the present Government had now stopped the machine-won turf on the grounds that it was too costly.  Therefore Fianna Fáil is only doing now what they intended to do in 1947 and in 1948 if they had been returned to power and it was not the inter-Party Government that was responsible.</P>
      <P>The Government promised prior to the general election that they would not remove the subsidies.  The moment they were firmly entrenched they proceeded to remove them straight away and now Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, with a foot on both sides of the fence, complains of the hardships that are imposed on the poor.  He should remind the Minister for Finance and the Government of their promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call upon the Government now to go to the country and get a mandate for its austerity Budget and its austerity programme.  They have not got a mandate now.  If they get a mandate there can be no doubt as to their right to rule.  Judging by every report and all the information that I can get not even the most rabid Fianna Fáil supporter will try to pretend that the hardships are not great and should have been imposed.  The Parliamentary Secretary to-night said that it was like a painful operation; like a toothache, the pain would soon be over.  What is the indication that it is nearly over? This Book of Estimates is a positive proof that we are only in the beginning of Fianna Fáil's austerity, Fianna Fáil's plan&mdash;I regret to say it but I say it with firm conviction&mdash;to carry out the aims of the Budget of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is a poor day that the situation <Col N="786" /> would arise in this country that a Government would carry out a programme that would impose such hardships on our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to assure the House that I do not intend to start any hares while I am speaking. Any remarks I made last night while the Taoiseach was speaking were not in the nature of interruptions.  I was seeking information from the Taoiseach. I did feel disappointed and annoyed at the amount of time wasted in this House by people who were advocating things entirely contrary to the interests of this country.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was speaking last night about the Central Bank and claiming that it was going to look after the integrity of our currency I told him that the Central Bank could do nothing because it had no power to do anything effective.  He seemed to resent that, but I was in the House when the Taoiseach was speaking on the Central Bank Bill in 1942.  The people of this country cannot have any comprehension of what is taking place when they are not told the truth.  At column 1136, Volume 86 of the Official Debates of 23rd April, 1942, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This Bill is not put forward as a Bill that will enable the bank or the Government effectively to control the volume of credit.  It may influence it, and if there is co-operation it can influence it tremendously, but it is not designed to effect it by coercive measures.  It is based on an attempt to get co-operation between the three bodies interested: the Government, as representing the community; the Central Bank, as being the body that has to manage it from day to day, and the commercial banks.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing there to suggest that the Central Bank can safeguard the integrity of our currency.  If there is any truth to be told to the people I want to hear it spoken in this House. The Minister for Finance made a statement on November 13th, 1949, in which he said that this country had lost £120,000,000 in one year alone because of the devaluation of the pound in <Col N="787" /> England.  In March of last year, Deputy Dillon, speaking in this House, stated that of our £400,000,000 of foreign investments, the Government had lost within 48 hours more than would balance the Minister's Budget.</P>
    <P>If the Central Bank was able to look after the integrity of our currency was it true for the Minister for Finance to say that in one 12 months we lost £120,000,000?  I hope he will state when he is replying whether, in fact, we did lose that £120,000,000.  The Central Bank admit in their statement in 1947-48 that they cannot do anything except give a report.  I was listening to the Taoiseach telling us last night that we have to reduce our expenditure and I read a speech by the Minister himself at a public function last week in which he said that before there can be any reduction in taxation there must be a reduction in expenditure.  I want to suggest one of the ways in which we can minimise expenditure. I am a strong believer, in spite of critical or cynical remarks&mdash;whether it is Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael that is governing this country&mdash;in the principle that a nation should control its own currency.  We floated a loan of £120,000,000 last year.  I submit that the security on which that £20,000,000 was issued was the capacity of our people to produce goods and services.  Is it not absurd that we should issue that loan of £20,000,000 instead of being able to issue £20,000,000 on credit and put our people to work in producing electricity, building houses, improving the land, afforestation and many other activities?</P>
    <P>We have heard quite a lot of talk about reduction in expenditure.  Let us consider for a moment what the Irish people had to pay last year alone for interest on money borrowed for very worthy objects.  For Exchequer bills, public issues of stock by means of Government land bonds and saving certificates we paid a sum of £4,283,973; for local authorities, excluding harbour authorities, interest at the rate of £2,013,000 was paid in connection with the building of houses, drainage and all the other socially desirable amenities. In respect of the E.S.B. a sum of £1,125,071 was paid in interest on the <Col N="788" /> money they used to bring electricity to the country.  We guaranteed an overdraft for Tea Importers Limited for which we paid £3,931 interest.  On the overdraft for Grain Importers Limited we paid interest of £87,740.  On the Butter Marketing Committee's overdraft £29,207 had to be paid; the interest on the overdraft for Fuel Importers Limited amounted to £128,115.  For the development of our telephone business we paid the large sum of £86,271.</P>
    <P>I shall just give the figures for the Dept. of Posts and Telegraphs.  There are 300 full-time juveniles, 625 part-time officers, receiving wages up to £2 per week; 255 juveniles and 1,172 part-time officers receiving wages between £2 and £3 a week; 394 full-time officers and 1,198 part-time officers receiving between £3 and £4 a week; 926 full-time and 742 part-time officers receiving between £4 and £5 a week; 2,982 full-time and 621 part-time officers receiving between £5 and £6 a week; 628 full-time officers receiving between £6 and £7 a week; 411 full-time officers receiving between £8 and £10 a week; 183 full-time officers receiving between £8 and £9; and 89 full-time officers receiving between £9 and £10.</P>
    <P>I want to analyse that.  There are 4,444 receiving from £2 to £4 a week; 4,711 receiving from £4 to £5 a week, 680 from £6 to £7, while last year we had to pay £89,000 interest on money for the development of the telephone business.  I leave it to the imagination of every decent man and woman what that would mean if devoted to the payment of decent salaries and wages to these employees.</P>
    <P>I wonder under what system we are operating at the moment.  On the overdraft of Irish Steel holdings we had to pay interest of £7,286.  I do not mind if we had to pay five times as much if we got value for our money in the industry.  For £2,500,000 worth of American coal in stock we had to pay interest at 4½ per cent., amounting to £112,500.  For Bord na Móna we paid in interest £48,114, and for the harbour authorities £94,726, while the interest paid on our national debt was £7,354,700.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry has left the House <Col N="789" /> because I am satisfied he knew I was coming to this point.  Deputy Corry came in here last night and told us that the Government had to pay £7,000,000 interest for national debt, but he took good care not to make any reference to the £15,374,634 on interest alone for these semi-State organisations.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach appeared to be worried here last night and said that he did not think there was any restriction on credit.  I want to tell the Taoiseach that I cannot appreciate his innocence in this matter.  I have here some correspondence from the City Manager in Cork in reference to housing loans.  I shall just quote one case where a man looked for a £1,000 loan to build his house last April.  He was prepared to pay £180 himself, plus the grant, and the reply he got on the 6th June last was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your application for a building loan, I regret that there are no funds at present available for the making of the loan. Your application to the building society is being filed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach or any member of the Government say, in their innocence, that there is no restriction of credit when they know what is happening in these cases?  What was the latest message this man got?  On the 9th of this month he got a letter stating that &ldquo;the corporation is now in a position to make an advance not exceeding £1,000.  The rate of interest will be 5¼ per cent. and the period of repayment 20 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That young man, like many other young men, had been making a great sacrifice to build a house for himself. It was hard enough for that man to borrow £1,000 at 3¾ per cent., but he is now told that he can get £1,000 only at 5¼ per cent. and that he must repay the loan in 20 years.  Does the Minister for Finance or any members of the House claim that they have any control or power while the financial magnates can decide an issue of that kind?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made great play a while ago on the question of the Labour Party and the wages of <Col N="790" /> workers.  Let us know where we are on this question of profits.  I want to point out that the total net profits of 91 companies in Éire during the past few years were as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;1949&mdash; £1,328,079; 1950&mdash;£1,473,438; 1951&mdash; £1,775,535.&rdquo; This shows an increase of 34 per cent. in profits in those years, while in the same period wage rates generally increased only by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>We come then to the question of corporation profits tax assessments. Taxable profits for 1946-47 were £15,522,638; for 1947-48, £18,957,147; 1948-49, £22,833,411; 1949-50, £21,749,995 1950-51, £24,347,020, and 1951-52, £27,360,019.  In 1947-48 the net tax payable from excess profits duty was £5,438,749, while in 1951-52 the net tax payable was only £2,729,732 on taxable profits of £27,360,019.  In 1947-48 the Fianna Fáil Government removed the excess profits tax and made a present of about £3,000,000 to manufacturers and people who were making profits out of the community generally.  I pleaded that that tax should be reenforced during the régime of the inter-Party Government, but that was not done.  I am suggesting now again that it should be done.</P>
    <P>I think that there is a tendency on both sides of this House sometimes to devote our attention to matters that do not concern the economic ills of the people.  It is aggravating sometimes to have to listen to some of the things that are said across the floor of the House.  We have heard statements from Deputy Corry in regard to the reckless spending of money by the last Government.  Surely we ought to be honest enough to recognise that both Parties were doing what they thought best for the people.  That is not to say that we should not criticise the Administration whenever we find it faulty and endeavour to set it on the right track.</P>
    <P>Coming to the Report of the Revenue Commissioners for 1951 and 1952, particularly that part which relates to the capital values of the estates of persons who have died, I should like to point out that in a preface to the report the commissioners state that the capital paying estate duty each year constitutes a microcosm of the aggregate <Col N="791" /> wealth in the hands of individuals. What do I find in that?  I find that of the 33,000 persons aged 20 years and over who died in 1950, 22,861 left nothing worth the notice of the Revenue Commissioners.  That is to say, 69 adults out of every 100 who died left nothing&mdash;which may be called the disinherited class.  It follows from those figures that only 31 per cent. left anything in excess of £100.  Of the total wealth left&mdash;£23,351,182&mdash;the small estates under £500 made up only 5 per cent. of the total.  Less than 3 per cent. own 64 per cent. of the wealth left by deceased persons, leaving the other 97 per cent. owning the 36 per cent. of the capital.</P>
    <P>It would be much better if every member of this House examined these figures and tried to find the best solution to remedy that injustice than to waste time trying to score debating points.  The Taoiseach was very keen last night to contradict me about the restriction of credit.  Deputy Corry is in the House now and I should like him and every other Deputy to listen to what I have to say because it cannot be contradicted.  We have three bodies in Cork&mdash;the Cork County Council, the Cork Harbour Commissioners and the Cork Corporation.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners last year paid £50,000 in interest on the money they are borrowing to develop the harbour.  The Cork Corporation paid over £71,000 last year by way of interest on their borrowings from the bankers and the moneylenders to build houses and to do other necessary work for the people of Cork City.  The Cork County Council paid £93,000 odd by way of interest last year on their loans and overdrafts.  I suggest that if we are to make any progress in this country we must bring in an amending Bill to enable the Central Bank to do the things which we require to be done in this country and give it the necessary power to control our money and credit.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Vote on Account that we are paying the Bank of Ireland £30,000 a year.  We paid them £32,500 last year.  The higher rate of interest accounts for the increase of £2,500 for looking after Government stocks.  What <Col N="792" /> are the Central Bank doing that they cannot do that job?  The Bank of Ireland head office is not in this country.</P>
    <P>A short while ago Deputy Bartley taunted me in regard to the printing of money.  That is a most irresponsible statement for any Deputy to make in this House&mdash;not to talk of a Parliamentary Secretary or a Minister.  The Minister for Finance referred, I think to Deputy MacBride, in regard to the printing of notes <i>ad libitum.</i>  We cannot live on paper money but we do live and can only live on the labour of the people of this country.  If we were to send all the bankers and moneylenders and stock exchange people, with all their pen and ink money, to some uninhabited island nobody in this country would be upset, but if the workers remained idle for 24 hours&mdash; not to speak of 48 hours&mdash;they would smash the economic system which we are trying to operate here.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said last night that he knows nothing about a restriction of credit and he said that the financial policy of the Government was the best policy that could be implemented.  I said here while the inter-Party Government were in office that you cannot borrow yourself into prosperity and I am more than ever convinced of it now. This little country started out of trouble and sacrifice without £1 national debt&mdash;yet now we are told that we have to pay £10,000,000 to service the national debt.  We cannot afford to pay our agricultural workers more than £3 17s. 6d. a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Just picture the fact that we have 40,000 agricultural workers trying to eke out an existence on £4 a week, trying to buy food and clothing for themselves and their families, while, at the same time, we have bankers and money lenders&mdash;and I do not wish in any way to refer to <Col N="793" /> them in a disrespectful manner because I realise that they are doing their job efficiently and well&mdash;dictating to us what we shall wear, what types of houses we shall live in, and so forth. What service do the people who received £10,000,000 and £16,000,000 in interest last year render to this country?</P>

      <P>I am coming to that. Last night the Taoiseach said that I was talking high finance.  I am not talking high finance.  I am not talking in high-falutin' terms, like Deputy Bartley did.  I want to point out that we have 90,000 willing workers who want food, clothing, houses and furniture and who have no employment. They want all these things and they are willing to work for them but they are prevented from doing so by a group of people who are not responsible to anybody.  Is it not time that we considered this matter seriously and stopped all this cross-talk about the economic war, the civil war or any other war, and making debating points. For mercy's sake, stop in 1953 and try to forget the past except what is good. We should cast our minds back to the sacrifices of the men who made the functioning of this Parliament possible.</P>
      <P>I have read a speech which was made by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Boland, last Sunday, in the course of which he said that the people had reached the limits of their taxable capacity, so that any further increase in the cost of living must be paid by the consumer.  Does that mean that we cannot do any more, even though we have all the men and all the material that is necessary to produce houses for the people?  I want to say, without exaggeration, that there are people living in my own city in so-called houses, in rooms and in tenements, in what I can only describe as vermin-ridden slums, that are not fit to put an animal into at night to rest. That is all due to the fact that we are tied up with a financial system that is both immoral and beyond reason for anyone to try and cling on to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time we were paying 5 per <Col N="794" /> cent. for our last loan, I read in the newspapers the annual report of one of our semi-State organisations which deals in money for lending purposes. One of our responsible officials said in the course of his speech there that, in order to get money in the future, we will have to pay more attractive terms for it.  I want to suggest that the credit of this country is based on the land, on our raw materials, on our ships and on the skill of our men and women.  In view of that, I want to say that when anyone advocates that we should pay even 5 per cent., not to speak of paying any more for the money that we require for the development of the country and the welfare of the people, it is time that we made up our minds to say to people who make such statements that they are not to dictate policy to those who have been elected by the people of this country.</P>
    <P>Do we realise that there is a real social revolution taking place all over the world to-day?  Does anybody think that we are going to go back to the system that obtained in 1938 and 1939? The whole economic system of the British Empire collapsed in 1914-18.  It was rebuilt on the old model, and the last war has shattered it beyond repair. Yet we are trying to maintain that system and to live under it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when speaking here the other night, lectured us as if we were a lot of schoolchildren, and sought to minimise the fact that we had 90,000 unemployed by saying that we are no worse off than other countries.  That was the speech he made as if he had a lot of children listening to him.  Does he think that is going to save the future of this country?  Let us realise this, that the plain people and the workers all over the world are on the march.  All this talk about Communism and the fear of Communism can only be killed by our adopting a system based on Christian principles. All the demonstrations with bombs are not going to do that.  We are spending £7,000,000 a year on our Army.  I want to say that I am proud of our Army, but it is not going to save us from the thing we fear&mdash;the Communistic forces of the world.  I <Col N="795" /> read a very truthful statement which was made recently by a clergyman in Waterford.  He said that we were a very Catholic people, but that we have very little Christianity.  As I say, there is a lot of truth in that statement.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised when I heard Deputy Flanagan of Mayo talk about the unemployed, and say that they should not adopt the abuses that are taking place in connection with the social services.  I wonder do the people who say these things realise what it is to be unemployed?  Take the case of a man who is in employment and is told on a Saturday night, or maybe in the middle of the week, that his services are no longer required.  That man is thrown on the labour exchange. He has to sign on for three days, but will not receive a penny for the support of himself, his wife and his children.  In the following week he will receive three days' benefit. If he is a married man he will receive 24/- and his wife 12/-. If he is a single man, all he gets is 18/-.  I think some Deputy spoke about the incentive there was for people in the country to sign on.  A man who signs on at the local Garda station gets 12/- a week unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Surely, that is treating the unemployed as a class apart, as people who do not count.  These are matters which should be treated with a greater sense of responsibility.  Let me not be misunderstood.  I am not for one moment suggesting that the members on that side of the House or on this side of the House have not as much regard for the unemployed as I have. They have, and I am sure they would feel very indignant if I said that they had not.  We have a serious issue to face so far as the unemployed are concerned. We have 90,000 of them, and surely serious notice should be taken of that very serious problem.  We have the men, the women, the boys and the girls, and yet they will not be allowed to produce the things which they want for their homes.  That is the system we are living under.  Of the 90,000 unemployed, a good many of them have wives and children who are not registered <Col N="796" /> at all, but are the victims of the system that I speak of.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion that we want a money system that will reflect physical facts and that will guarantee to us the prosperity and happiness that our productive efforts entitle us to have.  We have not that money system, and so I want to say to the Minister in all seriousness, to the members of the Government and to the Taoiseach, that the sooner they get down to work and bring in an amending Bill which will give the necessary power to the Central Bank to produce for us a money system, it is then, and only then, that our people will be able to enjoy the economic freedom to which they are justly entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House.  To-day and during the past week we have had a statement from Ministers and their followers, which is of interest to the country, to the effect that the limit of taxation has been reached.  At the same time, we have the Minister for Industry and Commerce saying that the high prices which obtain to-day are, in his opinion, going to remain permanently.  That is cold comfort for the public if we couple it with the other statement that the limit of taxation has been reached.</P>
      <P>If that is the position, how can the Government hope to reduce the prices which the people are now called upon to pay?  The people are not able to buy goods at the prices which the Budget of last year forced on them. That was a vicious Budget forced on the people by an Irish Parliament.  It has left the ordinary people in the position in which they cannot buy the necessaries of life.  Most Deputies know, I am sure, that beef, bacon and butter have gone off the workman's table in the City of Dublin.  Working-class people do not know what it is to have meat.  They may be able to get a little for their dinner on Sunday, but the people cannot afford the three essentials which I have mentioned, thanks to the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise to join with other Deputies who have protested against the Government's failure to implement the arbitrator's award for the civil servants. <Col N="797" /> Deputy Hickey has told the House of the big number of people in the Government service, with families, who are trying to exist on a miserable salary of £4 or £5 a week.  Every Department in the Civil Service has protested against the Government's failure to implement the arbitrator's award.  The country has lost confidence in the Government because of their failure in that respect.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Government to think this matter over and do something for those who are anxiously waiting to get the wherewithal that will enable them to buy the necessaries of life.  Will the Government give those people some opportunity of doing that?  We have the teachers, the Gardaí and the Army, with their wives and families trying to carry on on very limited incomes.  They have no other source of income except the wage or salary they receive.  Will the Government do something for them? I will leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to get this debate back to appropriate ground.  The Opposition have been concerned to ensure that it would wander for away from it.  They have explored, for instance, with Deputy Dillon the fog banks of Newfoundland, and, with the Leader of the Opposition, by implication at least, have brought us through the teeming Continent of India.  I understand that Deputy Costello's new panacea for the ills of Ireland is to establish here a banking institution on the model of the Reserve Bank of India.  Now it would be well to remember, in that connection in this debate, as we have heard such a lot of talk about the restriction of credit and deflation, that the bank of the world which has outstandingly pursued a policy of deflation since 1951 has been the Reserve Bank of India.  That is the model which, according to the Leader of the Opposition, we are to adopt for the control and management of our credit system here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had from the spokesmen of the warring sects which sit opposite a great deal of talk, richly interlarded, if I may say so, with nonsense.  Among the best or the biggest or the richest <Col N="798" /> of the plums in the pudding I would put the comment made by Deputy John. Costello in reference to the last national loan which the Government floated.  He told us that one of the reasons why we had offered this loan on terms which ensured its success with the public was that we wanted to feed the greedy financiers.</P>
    <P>Now, who are these greedy financiers about whom Deputy Costello spoke?  I can best indicate them by referring to a reply which I gave to a question in this House, put down by Deputy Costello himself, on 22nd October last.  I find that out of the 21,000 people who subscribed to the loan over 14,500 applied for amounts of £500 and less, and quite a substantial number applied for amounts of even under £100, and they are included in that number, 14,500.  Are these the greedy financiers that Deputy Costello referred to&mdash;these thrifty, prudent, industrious people, who, because they had a Government in office in which they had confidence, were prepared to entrust to our keeping the savings of, perhaps, a lifetime?</P>
    <P>Then we had subscribers for over £500 and up to £1,000 and they number 4,500.  So, out of the 21,000 odd subscribers that there were to the national loan, 19,000 of them were people who had less than £1,000 to invest in it. And they are described by the leader of the Opposition as greedy financiers. Of course, we know that the people who support this Government, the people who have faith and confidence in our administration, have always been condemned by the spokesmen of Fine Gael.  The number of individual subscriptions to that national loan was certainly almost twice as much as had ever been secured by our opponents. It represented a record subscription. We had more applications for the loan from citizens of this country than had ever been received by any Government in respect of any preceding loan.</P>
    <P>Among the things which the Opposition speakers talked about in the course of this debate was the current year's Budget and the surplus which may or may not be realised on it.  Here we <Col N="799" /> come face to face with the split mind, the divided personalities, of the Opposition.  They did not know, they had not agreed even among themselves, as to whether they would plump for a surplus or a deficit in forecasting the outcome of the present year's Budget.  Deputy Dillon, ever a prophet of woe where his own country is concerned, plumped for a staggering deficit and wrung his hands saying &ldquo;woe, woe, Newfoundland&rdquo;.  Deputy Costello, Junior, with all the exuberant optimism of youth, prognosticates a bumper surplus and Deputy Costello, Senior, apparently, was not able to make his mind up either way.  Let me say before I pass from this that I suspect that the Leader of the Opposition would like to join his voice with that of Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>Before I pass from this question of whether there will be a surplus on that Budget or not, let me say that that question will not be determined by the method employed by Deputy Declan Costello.  After all, you do not balance a Budget merely by thinking of a number and then doubling it.  Whether the Budget is going to be balanced or not, whether it is going to be in surplus or in deficit at the end of the year, depends upon two facets: how much you spend and how much you get in.  This is not the place to discuss the outcome of the present year's Budget.  In the whole course of this debate I think it has been the most unfruitful and the most futile of all the topics that have been pursued.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Budget of this year and the Budget of the coming year, neither the Opposition nor may I say at this stage, myself, has the information which would enable us to come to any really reliable and informed view as to what the position will be.  Yet, the Opposition have occupied days of parliamentary time on these matters. I do not intend to go more deeply into them or to refer to them further, except incidentally, beyond saying that in opening the debate I stressed that the raising of the revenue to meet the greatly increased cost of the public services would be a grave and difficult task.  Instead, therefore, of pursuing that matter, I propose to put the <Col N="800" /> following questions to the Opposition: Why have you run away from the real issue which I raised in opening the debate?  Why have you been afraid to discuss the responsibility of Parliament for the public expenditure?</P>
    <P>The Vote on Account is based on the Estimates for the Supply Services.  I have already pointed out that the Estimates in terms of money present a statistical picture of public policy. Public policy is determined not merely by the Government but by the pressure of Deputies in this House and by interested parties outside.  That, I think, is why it is something of an overstatement to say that public policy is formulated by the Government and endorsed by Dáil Éireann.  It would perhaps more truly reflect the real facts to say that policy is framed by Dáil Éireann and made effective by the Government.  Indeed, one might go further and say that the Opposition carry as great a share of responsibility for public expenditure as the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government in these matters, whoever may happen to constitute it, is always more modest in its ambitions than the Opposition usually is.  It carries the responsibility of implementing the policy, of raising the money and imposing and collecting the taxes required to give effect to that policy.  I will speak, therefore, with greater reserve and will approach the question of public expenditure with much more caution than the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had in the course of this debate, in the prudent and weighty statement of the Taoiseach last night, an exemplification of what I mean when we contrast it with that of the statement of the Leader of the Opposition.  The Taoiseach faced up to the facts of the situation.  He pointed to the services which the State was providing for the people and said quite bluntly and frankly that if these services are wanted they must be paid for.  They must be paid for, not by paper money such as Deputy Hickey habitually hankers after, not with borrowed money, but out of the earnings and the production <Col N="801" /> of the Irish people who render to the State the taxes, direct and indirect, which the Government is compelled to levy on them in order to maintain such services.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the speech of the Taoiseach, we had the speech of the Leader of the Opposition trying to shuffle out of his responsibilities for the position in which the State finds itself to-day.  I have said that the Volume of Estimates reflects financially the public policy of the State.  The supply Estimates are, in fact, the governing factor in determining the shape and form of the Budget for the coming year.  If expenditure is high, taxation must be high also.  There is not any way out of that dilemma.  High expenditure means high taxation, and there is no use complaining of high taxation, as the Leader of the Opposition did, unless one is prepared to reduce expenditure.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Leader of the Opposition ran away from that issue.  He complained of high taxation.  But what is principally responsible for the present high taxation except the many commitments which the Coalition Government left behind them, the unbalanced Budgets of 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, the Marshall Aid Loan which, as Deputy Dr. Browne told us last night, had been squandered, not in buying capital equipment or in developing the natural resources of this country, but in buying consumers' goods which we could make for ourselves or pay for ourselves here at home?  The incontinent borrowing to defray expenditure which characterised the three years' tenure of office of the Coalition has been very largely responsible for the present condition of the country.  I can say that, if it were not for the policies which they pursued, we could have had the enlarged and expanded social welfare and health services which the Estimates now provide for without increasing taxation.</P>
    <P>That, however, is not the point on which I desire to focus public attention. My main purpose at the moment is to emphasise again and again that taxation and expenditure are reflections of each other.  They are the obverse and reverse sides of the one coin.  Bearing this in mind, will <Col N="802" /> Deputies turn their thoughts to the speech of the Opposition Leader and recall it?  Did Deputy Costello once address himself to the one matter with which Dáil Éireann should be concerned on the Vote on Account?  Did he even devote one sentence of his speech to the examination of the general pattern of public expenditure? He complained, as I have said, bitterly about high taxation.  It would appear, however, that even in relation to that matter he has not been able to carry the whole of the Coalition, because one member of the Coalition Opposition, if I might put it that way, the spokesman for the Clann na Talmhan Party, got up and said that in his opinion taxation was not too high.</P>
    <P>On the other hand the burden of Deputy Costello's speech was that it was too high.  But the Leader of the Opposition, when making this assertion, had not the moral courage to suggest one single economy in the public services which would lead to a reduction in expenditure.  If he did not suggest any one service which might be dispensed with or reduced or cut down or restricted in order to reduce taxation, neither did he suggest that the personnel administering any one of these services be reduced in numbers.  The Leader of the Opposition contented himself by complaining about the burden of taxation.  He had not the courage to suggest even one modest economy.</P>
    <P>Here on this Vote on Account the whole pattern of public expenditure is laid open for discussion by Dáil Éireann.  In the fact that it is the pattern of expenditure, the general structure of the public expenditure that is open for discussion, the debate on the Vote on Account differs, or should differ, from those more detailed discussions of the departmental Estimates which will take place in due course.  In this debate the picture should be looked at as a whole.  If we want to reduce taxation&mdash;let me repeat it&mdash;we should be prepared to suggest changes in the general public policy which we believe are desirable.  I said that Deputy Costello did not suggest one economy.  Not only did Deputy Costello not suggest that but <Col N="803" /> Deputy Cosgrave, perhaps the most promising of the younger members of Fine Gael, pleaded for a substantial increase in Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>It may secure a degree of commendation in certain quarters in Dublin to say that we should give effect to the Civil Service arbitration recommendation. But does anybody believe that that will mean a reduction in the taxation which the Leader of the Opposition already complained of as being too high?  Not at all.  On the contrary it will mean a substantial increase in taxation.  If the scheme of the Civil Service arbitrator were to be applied to all persons paid out of the public purse, the State would be compelled to raise an additional £2,400,000 by way of taxation.  While the Leader of the Opposition complains about the burden of taxation his colleague sitting beside him on the front bench wants to increase taxation by £2,400,000.  I think that would almost please Deputy Finan of the Clann na Talmhan Party.</P>
    <P>I do not want to anticipate the Budget and any figures which I will give here have no reference to anything which may have to be provided for in the Budget.  But if, by any chance, we had to find this £2,400,000, which Fine Gael are apparently so anxious to impose on the taxpayer, how could it be found?  I think that the possibilities in that regard are very limited. Assuming, however, that an increase in the rate of taxation would be likely to be productive, we might try the following: 2d. per packet of 20 cigarettes and a corresponding increase on tobacco would produce about £1,750,000; 6d. in the £ in the standard rate of income-tax, with some mitigation for the lower income groups, would yield about £500,000.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, if one makes the mental calculation, that even with this increase in taxation we would not secure all the money we would require in order to give full effect to the recommendations of the Civil Service Arbitration Board and apply it to all public employees and all persons paid out of the public purse.  Indeed, it would be very interesting and very <Col N="804" /> informative, if there should be any debate on the Central Fund Bill, if some spokesman of the Fine Gael opposition would let us know what tax additional to the 2d. per packet of 20 cigarettes and the 6d. increase in the standard rate of income-tax he would suggest should be imposed in order to get in the balance and to give effect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to Deputy Costello's proposal.  Here we have on the one side the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Dillon complaining that taxation is too high and, on the other hand, we have Deputy Liam Cosgrave advocating a proposal which would undoubtedly mean an increase in taxation.</P>
      <P>That is the sort of double talk we have had throughout the whole of this debate from the main Opposition Party.  It is not confined to Fine Gael alone.  We have had it also from their satellites.  It reached its zenith in the speech of Deputy Norton this afternoon. He began by complaining of high prices.  He talked in terms of the deepest gloom about the problems of the householder and his wife.  His heart bled here in public for them.  He told us how heavily taxation pressed on the people and then, having offered incense, as it were, to Caesar, he began to expound his real theme.  He began to argue in that highly moral tone which he assumes with such facility that expenditure should be increased.  He too wanted an additional £2,400,000 imposed on the public purse.</P>
      <P>Now Deputy Norton is not a neophyte.  He has been in Government. He knows how money has to be raised and he knows as well as I do that the Civil Service remuneration cannot in present circumstances be increased without increasing taxation. But, with his tongue in his cheek, he bewails the high rates of taxation while at the same time denouncing the Government because it is reluctant, and rightly reluctant, to increase public expenditure further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us leave the Opposition and their inconsistencies to one side for the moment and revert to what I said a little while ago, namely, that the <Col N="805" /> Supply Estimates reflect the general policy of the State.  In what signal respect does the picture which the Supply Estimates presents this year differ from that which was presented by the volume published by the inter-Party Government in March, 1951?  It differs signally in one respect.  It differs in the relatively enormous increase in the provision which has been made for social welfare, social assistance and social services generally. That is the real, distinguishing mark of this Government, which has always been concerned for the welfare of the people and for the welfare of those who are described as the under-privileged classes, and we are giving effect here in our legislation this year to things which the Labour Party undertook to do but which they, though dominating the Coalition Government, did not succed in doing during the three years they were in office.  That is my full and complete answer to everything that Deputy Hickey has said here to-night.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why we are anxious to ensure that the integrity and the purchasing value of our currency will be preserved is that we wish to ensure that these gifts which we have given to the people will not be filched from them by inflation.  We want, if we are paying old age pensions, if we are paying pensions to widows and orphans, if we are paying unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance and if we are paying tuberculosis maintenance benefits, the people who get these things from us to receive what the law allows them in real money.</P>

      <P>Let us examine the proposition that it is in a bad way. Let us examine the position and see how the known facts support that contention. Take, for instance, the question of the balance of payments and the balance of our external trade.  That is the most significant economic indicator we can have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as to how agriculture and industry here are enabling us as a nation to pay our way and maintain our standard of living.  So important is it that I feel I ought to recall to the House what a spokesman of the Opposition said about it on the 5th July, 1939.  A speech that I made in 1927 has been quoted here.  I would like Deputies who think that I am a hidebound, shell-backed orthodox financier to go and read my speech introducing my first Budget here in 1932 and to read a speech I made in 1926 before I came in here, and they will see that there is no rigid adherence to one school or another of economic thought; but there is a great deal of hard thought embodied in those speeches and a great deal&mdash;let me say it&mdash;of realistic common sense.</P>
      <P>I was talking about the balance of payments.  Let us hear what one of the spokesmen of the Opposition&mdash;the greatest &ldquo;axe&rdquo;-Minister for Agriculture in the world to-day&mdash;had to say in 1939:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is plain to the observant that unless we correct the adverse trade balance and correct it soon we are going to have a crash.  All the indications are there.  We have never retained any gold in our central banks.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> He did not know we had gold under the control of the Currency Commission.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But the same barometer is available because our joint stock banks have held external assets and by a process of calculation we can determine the net external assets.  They were £72,000,000 in 1934, after American money had gone back to America, in 1935 they were £71,000,000; in 1936, £72,000,000 and remained fairly stable over that period.  In 1937, they were £67,000,000, having fallen by £5,000,000; and in 1938 they were £61,000,000&mdash;a catastrophic fall.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With the disappearance of every £1,000,000 our problem with regard to the balance of trade becomes more complicated.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest difficulty in accepting that statement of Deputy Dillon, with an important reservation. If our external assets are going to be frittered away buying consumption goods to maintain an artifical standard of living which production in this country cannot maintain, then what Deputy Dillon said is quite true.  If, on the other hand, as has been the case always under Fianna Fáil, these external assets are going to be brought back to this country in the form of capital goods and capital equipment which will enable us to increase our productive capacity and to give to our people more constant employment and a better standard of living, then what he said is not true.  In that connection when I think of our modest national debt in those days and of the real assets by which it was offset and then of how the £41,000,000 of the Marshall Aid Loan was expended by our predecessors it almost makes me weep.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me go back to Deputy Dillon's statement in regard to public debt.  I am quoting from column 1821 of Volume 76.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Let us consider our debt position. <Col N="808" /> A lot of Deputies here are only too fond of welcoming the creation of public debt, and then forgetting all about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what Deputy Hickey wants to do.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You cannot do that.  Some day, somehow, you have to meet that debt and pay it and in the meantime you have to pay interest on it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey is one of those gentlemen who wants another person to lend him money and to ask for no return upon it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon says: &ldquo;That is a very substantial item in our annual bill.&rdquo; Now, one of the very substantial items in the bill which the country will have to vote next year will be the sum of £1,200,000 to be paid as interest on the Marshall Aid Loan. As I have said before, if that loan had been raised in this country and the interest were to be paid free of tax as the interest on the Marshall Aid Loan is being paid free of tax it would have represented an interest rate of all but 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Let me go on to quote again from Deputy Dillon's speech in the same volume.  At column 1830 he speaks on inflation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the one hand, we have the prospect of inflation, uncontrolled, which at first will be extremely pleasant for the people in this country.  Its first impact will be one of relief from strain, expanding wealth and greater comfort for everybody. It will provide just that kind of relief which Deputy Davin&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;he might add Deputy Hickey&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;has in mind when he speaks of using the national credit to absorb the unemployed and to stimulate the development of the nation.  But it has as its logical end for this country disgrace abounding, shame and confusion for all of our people scattered all over the world.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> I do not want to bore the House quoting <i>in extenso</i> this purple passage from Deputy Dillon's speech but I wish to quote the conclusion to which he comes at column 1831:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have object lessons of that before us.  We have seen Newfoundland travel that road, and end in London with a request for British Treasury officials to come and take from them their sovereign independence and run the country as delegates of the British Treasury.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In his speech in this debate, Deputy Dillon had what you might describe as an oratorical throwback.  He referred to what he had said to this country in Dáil Éireann in 1935 about Newfoundland. At this time, of course, we had succeeded in winning the economic war.  We had freed the people of this country from the commitments which had been entered into in their name by a preceding Government under which no less than £5,000,000 per annum was extracted from circulation here from the earnings, the blood, toil and sweat of the Irish people and sent over to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>We have succeeded in vindicating the attitude and action of the Irish people in refusing to pay those annuities to Great Britain.  There is not a farmer on the opposite benches who has not benefited very richly as a result of what we did.  Here is the sort of help we were getting from Deputy Dillon, who had the audacity to stir up these dead bones of controversy and to refer to what he said about Newfoundland in the year 1935 (column 1394) Volume 58:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They ignored these warnings, and eventually when the fishing community, which corresponds to the agricultural community here, became hopelessly insolvent, every other branch of the economic life of Newfoundland including the revenue, collapsed and they were ultimately faced with a situation in which they could neither pay debts nor interest nor the public servants in the employment of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Col N="810" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>At columns 2546-7, Volume 53, Deputy Dillon quoted the following comment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Loans amounting to over 50,000,000 dollars were raised after the war, but less than 1,000,000 dollars was devoted to stimulating the industry that was of chief importance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have quoted these passages because they go to the root of the matter. Our purpose is to maintain the political economic and financial independence of this country.  We want to be beggars or borrowers from no man. The aim of the Fianna Fáil policy always has been to make this country as self-sufficient as nature would permit. We do not ask to do more than that but certainly we are not going to strive to do anything else.</P>
      <P>I was referring to what Deputy Dillon had to say about the balance of payments deficit in 1935 and 1939.  Let me see what the Leader of the Opposition, the then Taoiseach said about it in 1948:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The adverse trade balance has grown to an extent which must cause anybody who thinks about it for one moment or looks at the figures the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That deficit in the balance of payments was very much less than the Coalition subsequently permitted that deficit to attain.  Three years later the position had developed so seriously that my predecessor in office, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The present position on external account is by no means satisfactory and, if it continues to develop un-favourably, the application of corrective measures will be called for.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan made that speech in introducing his Budget for the year 1951-52.  Six months later, the position in regard to the balance of our external trade had so deteriorated that there was a net deficit on external account of approximately £60,000,000. We had, consequently, to take the corrective measures which Deputy McGilligan foresaw were called for, <Col N="811" /> but which he failed to apply.  The result has been that this national haemorrhage has been checked, and it has been checked in this way.  It has been checked by decreasing our imports and increasing our exports.  Our agricultural exports, which for the year 1950 were worth £45,000,000, expanded to £54,000,000 in 1952.  Our industrial exports&mdash;and it was suggested that there was no hope for industrial exports at one time&mdash;increased in value from £25,411,000 in 1950 to £45,000,000 in 1952.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Although you said it could not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  I said it could not be done unless the Government took positive steps to ensure that it would be done.  I said 12 months ago that this would not occur of its own accord.  We did take steps.  I have indicated already that we took the preliminary steps to ensure that our exports would come into closer balance with our imports and that by that means we should considerably reduce the magnitude of this very grave and serious problem.  I do not want to suggest for a moment that we are out of the wood.  On the contrary, but we have made a great deal of progress in that regard.  We think that the problem has now become a manageable one and that we shall now be in a position to do what has always been the aim of Fianna Fáil&mdash;to secure the orderly realisation of our external assets and to replace them, as I have already said, by capital productive equipment at home.  We are no longer using up these valuable reserves, because even in the world of to-day there is value in sterling.  It is a valid currency over almost one half of the globe.  Therefore, to the extent that it will enable us to buy capital goods and equipment, it is a very valuable asset&mdash;an asset that is not to be frittered away or squandered&mdash;and that, if it has to be spent, must be spent in buying something that will yield to the community an income commensurate with that which we forgo when we realise our external assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I told the House what the position <Col N="812" /> is in regard to the balance of external trade, in regard to our agricultural exports and in regard to our industrial exports.  According to the official statistics the number of live stock in this country on the 1st January, 1950, which might be described as the last full year of the Coalition régime, was 3,821,000 head.  On the 1st January, 1953, this country, which it had been suggested is in a bad way, had increased its cattle population to 3,872,000 beasts.  Similarly, the pig population of this country was estimated on the 1st January, 1950, to be 510,500 beasts and on the 1st January of this year it had increased by over 50 per cent., the figure then being 764,700 pigs.  There does not seem to be any sort of a real factual basis for the ullagoning that has come from the other side of the House.  There does not seem to be any factual basis for the caoining.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly, comparatively speaking, very much better off than many other countries that are referred to in this House with approval. I referred to the fact that one of the reasons why the Volume of Estimates, on which our Vote on Account is based, compares very favourably with the Book of Estimates which was presented by our predecessors, has been the great expansion which has taken place in the last 16 or 18 months in the social welfare services.  That has naturally had repercussions because as the benefit of the Unemployment Insurance Acts and the social assistance code has been extended to a great many more people, naturally more people have been eligible to register at the exchanges than were previously eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very significant fact that there has been a very considerable shift from the category of social assistance to the category of unemployment benefit. <Col N="813" /> While the number of social assistance recipients&mdash;I am speaking now from recollection&mdash;has been decreased by almost 50 per cent., the number of people in receipt of unemployment benefit has correspondingly increased. In addition to that, there has been an influx of new beneficiaries, people who were neglected during the period the Coalition were in office and for whom we have made some provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>And there is no unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I never said that.  I have never said that there was no unemployment.  The Deputy never suggested that when he was in office&mdash; I withdraw that because there is no limit to the audacity of Deputy MacBride.  He might have suggested it but the more responsible members of the Coalition, during the period they were in office, never, for a moment, suggested that there were not people in this country who were out of work. Employment, as everybody knows, is a highly seasonal thing.  It has its ups and downs.  There are not such a very large number of workers who might be described as being in constant and permanent employment.  They are in and out occasionally and that is reflected, naturally, in the ups and downs to be noted in the employment register.  If there has been any real increase in the number of persons who were unemployed and who were previously entitled to unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit, that is not confined to this country. On the contrary, it seems to be a reflection of conditions which exist all the world over.  Unemployment has been increasing even in the U.S.A.  I think it was Deputy Dr. ffrench O'Carroll who said that even in America they were already taking steps to deal with the unemployment which they anticipated would reach really serious dimensions in about 1954 or 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is held up to us&mdash;and quite rightly&mdash;as an example of the foresight and advance provision <Col N="814" /> which a Government ought to make in order to deal with unemployment.  The Fianna Fáil Government, when it was in office in 1946, foresaw that what was expected to be a sort of boom period in employment for four or five or six years would undoubtedly be succeeded by what the Americans now very politely describe as &ldquo;a recession&rdquo;: They do not like the word &ldquo;slump&rdquo;. Therefore, taking time by the forelock, the then Fianna Fáil Government had projected a plan which would, when the slump came in the building industry, enable the unemployed workers&mdash; and in particular the skilled workers for whom Deputy Everett was speaking&mdash;to secure constant and remunerative employment on a worth-while project.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Briscoe, has elicited certain facts about that proposal.  He has shown that many of the buildings in which civil servants are housed in Dublin Castle were formerly old stables. Deputy Everett referred to us as building a palace for civil servants.  Apparently he thinks that an old stable is good enough for a civil servant.  At least that is the sort of building in which Deputy Everett was prepared to house the civil servants under his control between the years 1948-51.</P>

The Commissioners of Public Works reported to the Government of the day that the buildings were insanitary, unsound and highly uneconomic and that they would have to be rebuilt. They further pointed out that because some of the foundations were being undermined by an overflow from an underground river they were getting into a dangerous condition.  We gave them instructions to prepare a plan for the reconstruction of these buildings&mdash; a plan which would cost a considerable sum of public money.</P>

      <P>We planned the reconstruction of Dublin Castle&mdash;which was long overdue.  We were ready. The Commissioners of Public Works were so appalled at the responsibilities which rested upon them to maintain these buildings in a safe and sanitary condition that they actually came back again to my predecessor, the then Minister for Finance, and asked him to put up the matter again to the Government in order that the Government might reconsider it.  They pointed out that the matter had gone so far, that if they had been able to do that, they would be able to ask for tenders for the structural framework of the building, and that about 1951 or 1952 they would be able to go ahead with the main structure.  What did my predecessor say?  He said he would not put up the matter to the Government because every member of the Coalition &mdash;including Deputy Norton, Deputy Everett, Deputy Morrissey, Deputy MacBride and all the others who are crying out now for us to provide employment for the people&mdash;because that Government was unanimously and vehemently opposed to it.</P>

I have in front of me an extract from the <i>Machester Guardian</i> of 6th February of this year. It is headed: &ldquo;Where Men Run to Find a Job.  Race to the Swift on the Merseyside.&rdquo; Here is what the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> has to say about conditions on the other side of the water&mdash;to which, we are told, our people are now flocking for employment.</P>

Here is what it had to say about Manchester:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are more than 65,000 people on Merseyside drawing national assistance and about 40,000 in Greater Manchester.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>A number of those were men who had exhausted their <Col N="818" /> unemployment benefit.  They are still unemployed and out of work.  That is what a reputable English paper has to say about conditions on the other side of the water.  Someone asked why our people are going there.  I was for quite a number of years, before fate doomed me to be sitting on one or other of these benches, engaged in business, and there always has been, and always will be, a great traffic between Liverpool and Manchester on the one hand and Dublin and Belfast on the other.  There is a great deal of inter-marriage between people on both sides of the Border.  People go over there, sometimes to look for a job or sometimes not so much to look for a job as perhaps to see their friends, and take a job if there is one offering. That has been a common experience with everyone who has lived there.</P>

      <P>We have heard it said, in the course of the debate here that this country has not been wasted by war.  That is quite true.  For that, we are indebted to the leadership of the present head of the Government, <Col N="821" /> much more indebted to him than any of us will ever know.  In any event, we did escape, as some Deputies have said, the ravages of war.  We were not the only country in that fortunate position.  Sweden was in the same position.  It was in an even more fortunate position, because Sweden was not denied many of the supplies which we were unable to obtain for our people.  Here is the position in relation to Sweden.  I am quoting from a Swedish paper, the <i>Stockholms-Tidningen</i> of the 4th September, 1952. It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the two years since the outbreak of the war in Korea, Sweden has undergone something in the nature of an economic revolution. The standard of living of a large section of the population has radically changed&mdash;in some cases for the better, in other cases for the worse.&rdquo;</P>

Part of the agreement which was made to-day was that, when the division was over, the Central Fund Bill would be taken and concluded at 11.30.  Now, that the first part of the agreement has been broken the second part will not be kept as far as we are concerned. We will not agree to conclude the Central Fund Bill at 11.30.  The Minister is now trying to take up time.</P>

      <P>If I may continue <Col N="822" /> the quotation when I was interrupted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the beginning of 1952, however, the picture began to change rapidly.  The export-price index fell steeply&mdash;the fall being in fact steeper than the preceding rise....  Parallel with the contraction of foreign trade and the wiping out of the previous year's improvement in the terms of trade, the volume of industrial production declined.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have only quoted that as a preliminary to this.  Deputy Collins will be interested to know that this is in English.  I am quoting from the <i>Financial Times</i> of the 7th January, 1953.  It says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Sweden is facing harder times and labour unrest in 1953.  An incipient export slump, impending wages cuts and rising unemployment during the past few weeks show that 1953 will be a difficult year.  ... As their own statistics, and the recently published report of the O.E.E.C. show, general production costs have risen more in Sweden since 1950 than in any other European country.</P>
      <P>The result is that many of Sweden's exports are too expensive to compete with the lower-priced goods of West Germany, Great Britain, Japan and other countries.  Foreign firms offering cheaper goods are also getting a firmer foothold in the Swedish domestic market ... The result is that each union is now seeking to make the best deal it can for its members.  &lsquo;Distressed&rsquo; industries like textiles and engineering will probably pay lower wages.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These quotations are only relevant to this debate in this context&mdash;as a refutation of the allegation that the Budget of last year has produced adverse conditions in this country which are peculiar to this country.  What we are now going through is, of course, the slump which has followed what you might describe as the Korean War. Having made that point, I propose to sit down, although there are other things that I would like to say.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the following be adopted as a Standing Order of Dáil Éireann:&mdash;</P>
      <P>123A.  There shall be appointed, as soon as may be after the commencement of every Session, a Select Committee, to be designated &ldquo;The Estimates Committee,&rdquo; to examine such of the Estimates presented to the Dáil in accordance with Standing Order No. 117, as may seem fit to the Committee and to report what, if any, economies consistent with the policy implied in those Estimates may be effected therein.</P>
      <P>The Committee shall consist of 17 members, none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Parliamentary Secretary, and five of whom shall constitute a quorum.</P>
      <P>The Committee shall be otherwise constituted according to the provisions of Standing Orders Nos. 67 and 70, and so as to be impartially representative of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Committee may appoint subCommittees and may refer to such sub-Committees any of the subjects which are within the purview of the Committee.</P>
      <P>The Chairman of the Committee shall be <i>ex officio</i> a member of each sub-Committee.</P>
      <P>The Committee and its subCommittees shall have power to send for persons, papers and records and to adjourn from place to place.  Three shall be a quorum of each sub-Committee.</P>
      <P>The Committee shall have power to report from time to time.</P>
      <P>This motion in terms is almost identical with that which stands on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Sheldon. I am moving it to give effect to the statement which I made in introducing the Vote on Account, that the Government were prepared to accept Deputy Sheldon's motion in principle and put down a motion in terms which would perhaps be more appropriate to our procedure in this House.</P>

Deputy Sheldon's motion was moved I understand during the previous discussion. It was understood that the matter was under discussion at that particular time.  I submit that the Minister is out of order in moving this motion without any notice.  It is quite absurd to think that he can move a motion now and initiate a further discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the motion which was on the Order Paper in the name of a private Deputy, but there was no Order made to take that motion to-day.  On the contrary, there was an Order made to take item No. 9. The Government is in full agreement with the principle embodied in Deputy Sheldon's motion.  There are only one or two slight technical differences which were necesary in order to ensure that the proposal could properly be adopted as a Standing Order of the House.  The motion on the Order Paper corresponds in practically every particular with the motion put forward by Deputy Sheldon.  The main points of difference are that the new Standing Order will be No. 123(a) so as to follow immediately after No. 123, which deals with the Committee on Public Accounts. Deputy Sheldon also proposed that the new Committee should be appointed at the commencement of every session but in order to provide for immediate action by the Dáil on the motion during the present session, the alternative words: &ldquo;as soon as may be after the commencement of every session&rdquo; are now used so as to enable the Committee to go into operation immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that the title of the new Committee should be the Estimates Committee instead of the Committee on Public Expenditure. That will relate the activities of the <Col N="832" /> Committee to the Estimates as they come before the House.  In reply to a point raised by Deputy McQuillan, I may say that the operation of this Committee does not mean that those bodies which receive grants and subventions from the Exchequer and which are voted money by Dáil Éireann when it is considering the Estimate for the appropriate Department will be excluded from the preview of the Committee, but bodies like the E.S.B. and statutory bodies of that kind towards which the House does not vote money will be excluded from its operations.</P>
    <P>I would not like at this stage to commit myself to what the position might be where a subsidy is granted to any one of these statutory undertakings as, for instance, in the case of rural electrification.  I suggest that we accept the motion in the form in which it is now presented and the House should set up a Committee as soon as may be practicable.  That Committee, when it starts on its work, will be able to order its activities in any way likely to give the most beneficial results.  It would be most regrettable if the Committee were to dissipate its energies in trying to cover at the outset, at any rate, too large a field.  On that matter the Government cannot, of course, give any directions to the Committee.  The Committee will be constituted in the usual way and it will be the task and the responsibility of the chairman of that Committee to so guide its investigations and deliberations that it will yield to the Dáil the full fruit Deputy Sheldon had in mind when he raised the matter by a Private Members' motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution is put before the House as a covert piece of deception and in a most unprecedented way.  It was agreed that the motion standing in Deputy Sheldon's name would be discussed in principle with the Vote on Account.  As was suggested, that was done to try drag a smelly red herring across the discussion on the Vote on Account.  Now, when it is suggested that Deputy Sheldon's motion should be voted upon, the House finds itself in the position that <Col N="833" /> that was merely giving the green light to the Government to bring in a formal resolution which it wanted to put before the House for the purpose of taking a formal decision.  The House is being jockeyed into taking that formal decision in that matter now in a sleight-of-hand way quite contrary to the agreement which was entered into when we started the debate on the Vote on Account.  The proposal now is to take a definite decision to-day and not simply pass Deputy Sheldon's motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have a debate on this.  Let us get down to it.  What is the device employed by the Minister for Finance to-night?  He has come in here in a flap to tell us that the £9,000,000 surplus on his Budget has been spent by his colleagues because he could not control them; that the way to prevent that happening in the future is to have a Committee set up to do the work proper to the Minister for Finance; that it is not his fault, and that he is going to provide against this situation arising hereafter by having a Committee which will examine expenditure before he is called upon to make final recommendations to the House.  I have watched this process of fraud operated by Fianna Fáil in face of every responsibility they have ever been asked to undertake here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whose job is it to certify the Estimates of a Government to this House as being proper Estimates for the public services of this country?  Is it not a job for the Minister for Finance? Is it not his job to come in and say: &ldquo;I have examined the requisitions of the various Departments.  The Government has heard me upon them and it is our joint responsibility to come before Dáil Éireann and say that these are the moneys required for the public services and if they are not supplied, proper public services will not be furnished to the people.  I will defend the Estimates with which my name is associated before the Dáil in grand Committee of the Dáil.&rdquo; This is the first Minister we have had who announces that that burden is too heavy for his back.  He cannot do it. &ldquo;They have got out of control&rdquo;, he <Col N="834" /> says, and the only hope he has of restoring ministerial and departmental control over the public finances of this country is to invoke Deputy Sheldon and 14 or 15 other members of this House to do for him the job which he has abdicated.</P>
    <P>I have seen many degrading spectacles in this House, but not a Minister who abjectly comes in with that £9,000,000 for Supplementary Estimates and with a Budget which he himself says will not balance, at a time when he has warned not only this country but the world that Oireachtas Éireann is doing its best to bankrupt the nation. and then says: &ldquo;But I am not fit to control it.  Will you set up a Committee to help me?&rdquo; We have had many Ministers for Finance of this country since the State was founded and they have had to face the very unpopular duty of wisely administering public finance and they never looked for such help when they were called upon to shoulder their responsibilities. This is the first Minister for Finance who has sought a funk-hole when he has found his job too big for him.</P>
    <P>We have in this House a Standing Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Is there any precedent in the history of Oireachtas Éireann for bringing a proposal forward at 10.30 at night radically to alter the whole financial procedure of Oireachtas Eireann without even being in a position to tell the Dáil what its own Committee on Procedure and Privileges think about it.  For the period of three and a half years when we were in Government we examined the whole question of financial procedure. It was studied by the Minister for Finance repeatedly and all sides having been heard, it was agreed&mdash; and the Minister for Finance may interrupt me to say so; I hope he will&mdash;that one of the most desirable things in reviewing the whole method of public finance in this country or in Great Britain was not to follow slavishly in the footsteps of any crank that managed to wangle his way into Westminster but to show Westminster the way in which the system of finance <Col N="835" /> we inherited from them could be reformed.</P>
    <P>The whole abracadabra of public finance which we operate at the present time we got from London.  We adopted the whole system whereunder we have a Comptroller and Auditor-General and a Committee of Public Accounts of which I was the chairman &mdash;God forgive me&mdash;for seven years. This Committee may require any Minister any time to account for one halfpenny and it frequently costs up to £300 or £400 in administration to shape the destiny of one single halfpenny of money that has gone wrong. If it cannot be accounted for it is the duty of that Committee to send the whole Civil Service back to work to spend £300, £400, £500 or even £1,000 until that halfpenny is found.  It is that crazy Victorian system of public finance designed by Mr. Gladstone in 1864 which is one of the very substantial causes for many of the charges which fall upon Estimates to-day and which could be removed.</P>
    <P>It is monstrous for the Minister to come romping into this House and at 10.30 p.m. to move a resolution in the terms in which he has moved it on matters which many of us know would have to be the subject of months of anxious consideration sustained by expert opinion from our own treasury and by opinion from experts brought from abroad; and to tell Dáil Eireann to do this to solve a problem which has engaged the attention of a wide variety of people who have practical experience of public finance for many years and at a time when there is substantial agreement amongst all financial experts in this country as to what ought to be done.</P>
    <P>Every one of us knows what ought to be done and I am certain had we been in office for another 18 months the Minister for Finance would have considered proposals before Dáil Eireann with this recommendation, not that our majority would force them down the throat of Dáil Eireann but that Dáil Eireann would be asked to take proposals made by the Minister for Finance to their Committee on <Col N="836" /> Procedure and Privileges and to instruct that Committee that expert opinion was to be got, whenever they thought it wise to fetch it, to advise them as to what would be the most expedient thing to do to achieve what the Minister had in mind and to maintain the essential sovereignty of Dáil Eireann over Government expenditure while justifiably simplifying procedure in a way which would effect substantial public economy not only of public money but of public services and ministerial time.</P>
    <P>Any of us who have taken an interest in public finance know what requires to be done.  Responsible Deputies of this House know how it ought to be done, that it ought not to be done by a silly resolution of the character clapped down on the Order Paper which will achieve nothing except more confusion.  I intend to debate this matter at great length.</P>

There was an understanding at the beginning of this debate that the motion in the name of Deputy Sheldon would be discussed in conjunction with the Vote on Account.  The Minister, in his introductory statement in the debate, specifically mentioned that the Government proposed to accept Deputy Sheldon's motion and that during the course of the debate the motion dealing with it would be introduced.  That was explained to the Opposition from the start.  The Minister made a very categorical statement about Deputy Sheldon's motion, and No. 9 was ordered in the Order of Business for to-day.</P>

As I was saying in regard to the proper procedure of the control of public finance, what is here envisaged is that there should be superimposed on the existing Estimate procedure a Standing Committee of this House.  I invite responsible Deputies to consider what this now implies in terms of public expense.  A Minister will now prepare his Estimate in the Autumn.  He must then, through the officers of his Department open discusions with the Department and the Minister for Finance.  A considerable part of the staff of the Department will in the ordinary course of duty devote itself to those discussions during the Autumn months of the year.  Having examined in detail every sub-head of his Vote, and having argued by correspondence and personally every sub-head of his Vote, the Minister will reach a measure of agreement with the Minister for Finance.  The matter will then be referred to the Estimates Committee of the Cabinet and the outstanding matters of difference between the administrative Minister and the Minister for Finance will be argued at that Committee of the Cabinet until agreement is reached and Government policy decided upon.  The Minister for Finance, if he then endorses the Government decision and feels himself conscientiously entitled to recommend it to Dáil Eireann, will introduce the Vote on Account as at present ordered and, in due course, the administrative Minister's Estimate will come up for discussion in grand Committee of this House.

      <P>Yes, it is a more savoury topic.  The present procedure is that the administrative Minister comes to grand Committee.  Let us recall what then happens.  Deputies will remember my bringing my Estimate to this House and my distinguished predecessor, Deputy Smith, leading off with six and a quarter hours of eloquence in introducing his observations on that Estimate.  Every Deputy of Fianna Fáil exercising his undoubted and unchallengeable right can come in here and blather away almost unceasingly on an Estimate.  Goodness knows that is bad enough for the unfortunate public servant, the Minister of State, who receives the princely sum of £1,525 for listening to that for three or four weeks.  Now comes Deputy Sheldon, and he proposes that before the Minister is introduced to that delightful oratorical experience, 15 of the choicest spirits of that tornado of eloquence can be sequestered upstairs so that he may have the pleasure of grappling with them again, with the implied proviso, that if the 15 choice spirits discover something that the Department of Finance has not discovered, they may exhort the Department of Finance to start the whole procedure all over again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing more degrading than the over-zealous servant.  Come now, do your duty by the boys but do not prostrate yourself altogether.  I am asking the Minister for Finance whether he does not himself know that, in the British House of Commons at the present time, every rational member curses the day when the crank theorists were allowed to impose on the procedure of the House of Commons this device?  Does the Minister for Finance himself at this moment not know that the only reason that this proposal receives even countenance by persons qualified to advise him is the vain hope that it will be a further clamp on anybody who wants to do anything?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister for Finance know that the traditional belief of every Treasury in the world is that if you could tie sufficient balls and chains to everybody's leg the ultimate out-turn must be for the benefit of the Exchequer because, by preventing things being done, less money would be spent.  As every Treasury believes that no Legislature is capable of adding two plus two, the only way to prevent Legislatures from bankrupting the country for which they are responsible is to tie them down and prevent them from doing anything. That, at least, will do something to arrest the chronic haemorrhage of public finance which is perennially deprecated in every Department of Finance the world over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this House wants to entertain this <Col N="841" /> proposal&mdash;and I think they are wasting their time in contemplating it because it is a bookman's proposal; it is made by a man who has never had a single hour's practical experience of public administration&mdash;I ask the House to adopt the rational course, that is, to refer this matter to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges of Dáil Éireann and invite that Committee to report back to the House on whether it thinks this procedure is consistent with the sovereign authority of the House itself.  I very much doubt that it is.  However, if they are prepared to consider it, what are the terms? Are the Estimates to proceed without reference to the deliberations of this body or is the disposition of the Estimates to await whatever advice this body considers it to be its duty to tender?</P>
    <P>Does Dáil Éireann believe that it is desirable, from any point of view, to delegate in any part to a Standing Committee of this House the most important functions Dáil Éireann itself discharges and the fundamental duty that devolves on an honest Minister for Finance to face the Dáil and accept responsibility for the recommendations which he himself has made to his own Government and which he purports to make to Parliament?  If that matter comes before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House, with due notice that the precedents are consulted, and they decide that a very strong case can be made that the establishment of such a Committee is wholly at variance with the finance procedure which is very closely intertwined with the maintenance of the sovereignty of this Parliament, I think it can also be demonstrated to conclusion by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of this House&mdash;and evidence can be brought before the Committee to demonstrate it outside the House&mdash;that if the aim is a reduction in the annual Estimate, far from having that result, this Committee will impose a substantial additional charge for there will have to be a considerable staff recruited to grapple with this Committee in every Department of State if its Estimate is to survive.</P>
    <P>A much more effective method of <Col N="842" /> achieving the purpose which everybody familiar with public finance has close to his heart would be to allow an Organisation and Methods Division of each Department of State to function effectively&mdash;and the operative word is &ldquo;effectively.&rdquo; There is in operation in most Departments of State and we put it there, effectively, an Organisation and Methods Division.  One of the problems that exist at the present moment is that, under existing legislation, it cannot function because this House has put on the Comptroller and Auditor-General and on the Public Accounts Committee duties to dis-charge&mdash;and for the discharge of these duties Departments of State must maintain a system of accounts which make efficient operation impossible.</P>
    <P>I believe that if this crass motion were referred to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges that Committee, being a rational body, would send back a recommendation that the overdue step should forthwith be taken, that is, that the Minister for Finance should convene a meeting of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges, of the Committee of Public Accounts, of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and of the officers of his own Department to examine, agree and recommend to Oireachtas Éireann the necessary legislation to enable public finance economically and effectively to be administered.  Let this House not forget that, by our own act, the Comptroller and Auditor-General is a constitutional officer of the State; it is not in the power of the Government to discharge him.  He is set there by the Oireachtas to act as an auditor between the Oireachtas and the Treasury itself.  No Minister for Finance can direct the Comptroller and Auditor-General to do anything.  The powers and duties of the Committee of Public Accounts of this House largely derive from the duties imposed by statute and the rights enjoyed under the Constitution by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  They should not be changed without the consent of the Comptroller and Auditor-General and of the Committee of Public Accounts and of the Minister for Finance and his advisers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> I believe that every responsible Deputy knows that there is a large volume of agreement already in existence between these three Parties and that they desire nothing more than the expression of readiness on the part of this House to give effect to whatever reforms they would recommend if they were invited to do so.  I urge on the Minister for Finance, if he wants to press forward with this business, to ask the House to refer it to the Committee of Procedure and Privileges with the request that the Committee of Procedure and Privileges should, in addition to examining the matter, indicate proposals or further proposals which in its judgment would facilitate the administration of public finance.  I am certain that, if that is done, useful work could be put in hands.  I am equally certain that if this motion is passed we are simply putting on our neck a pestilential blister.  We are putting on our Ministers, who are already overworked in this country, an additional burden that they ought not to be asked to carry. Lastly, we are creating a new series of duties which will evoke, for their effective carrying-out, a new army of bureaucrats whose duty it will be to steer these Estimates through this new Committee and preserve their Minister scatheless from criticism by it.</P>
    <P>I know how easy it is to read a book. I know how convincing it can be to read a book.  I know how disastrous it can be to spread the substance of a well-written theory on the Standing Orders of this House.  No Minister for Finance in any Legislature in the civilised world has ever come into Parliament at 10.30 p.m.&mdash;at the end of a discussion on a Vote on Account which had gone on for two weeks&mdash;and asked it to make as radical a change in its Standing Orders as it could be asked to make&mdash;with no explanation, no suggestion of what function the new body is to carry out, and with the statement that he himself does not know what the ambit of this new body's discretion will be but that the best thing Dáil Éireann can do is to set up and see what it will try to do, with the assurance that if it tries to do too <Col N="844" /> much we can spancel it when it gets under way.  If Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party had any respect for their own Parliament they would censure the Minister for Finance for making any such proposals to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Deputies on this side of the House will contemptuously reject this proposal, not because we believe that a useful step cannot be taken in the ordering of public finance but because we know this is not the step. We know that we have a Standing Committee which could indicate expeditiously and readily to the House what is the proper step to take.  I certify to the House that the Minister for Finance knows what requires to be done, but he thinks that, instead of facing that and simplifying our procedure by the course which I have indicated, if he gets a Committee of this kind set up it will furnish him with an alibi this year for the deplorable admission which he was constrained to make that he had a surplus of £9,000,000 but that his colleagues went and spent it on him, and then asks: &ldquo;What does Dáil Éireann propose to do about it?&rdquo;</P>

The Deputy has not told the House that the Public Accounts Committee is a Committee set up to examine expenditure by the various Departments of State, to see that the moneys voted to each Department are spent in accordance with the Vote and under the proper sub-head, to see that, where there has been excessive expenditure, sanction has been received from the Department of Finance for that excess expenditure, and that where the expenditure is less than the sum voted the saving on the Vote reverts back to the Exchequer.</P>

Notwithstanding that, he himself referred to it, and again discussed it.</P>
      <P>Now what does the motion say? It proposes:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the following be adopted as a Standing Order of Dáil Éireann:&mdash;</P>

      <P>That represents a different approach altogether from the work that is undertaken by the Public Accounts Committee. It proposes to deal with what I may call the other end of the stick.

The Deputy may have a guilty conscience about what I am going to say and may feel that he is the person who is going to be offended. That is the only reason I can see for his interjection.  In the case of the Department of External Affairs, the moneys voted to it include a sum to cover travel expenses abroad by our Ministers and by officials.  It is true that when officials travel they do so in accordance with well established regulations concerning expenses and subsistence allowances.  We discussed that matter many times at the Public Accounts Committee as to whether they were getting sufficient to enable them to maintain their status abroad. When a Minister goes abroad there is no similar consideration for his expenditure. He can himself just sign a chit. We do not know whether he could have used the subway in New York instead of using, say, taxis all day, thereby putting huge unnecessary expenditure on his particular Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This Committee could examine and see whether two or three trips might be sufficient instead of 23. That could happen.  As I have said, a Minister brings an Estimate to the House.  He puts before the House what has been agreed to by the Cabinet of which he is a member, but the ordinary members of the House will not be aware of all the details.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture did he do his best to spend £40,000,000 in his Department, as he promised he would, over a period of ten years?  Deputy Dillon told us exactly what he was going to do.  He was going to blow up the rocks in Connemara and make that area a fertile green patch.  If a Committee of this kind had the opportunity of examining an Estimate of that kind it might come to the conclusion that a Minister coming to the House with such a proposition was exaggerating slightly, and say that it might be better if he did not attempt to blow the rocks of Connemara into the Atlantic Ocean.</P>

      <P>If the Committee feels that, notwithstanding what Deputy Briscoe says about the dangerous condition of Dublin Castle and the work that could be given to the unemployed in reconstructing the buildings as suitable Government offices, Deputy Briscoe's scheme about Dublin Castle is just as daft as Deputy Dillon's scheme about taking the rocks in the West of Ireland into the Atlantic, the Committee could say: &ldquo;Do not spend the money; it will be wasted&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting this motion as a result of many years of experience as an active member of the Committee of Public Accounts, during some years of which Deputy Dillon was chairman.  In the conduct of our affairs there many times the representatives of all sides of the House expressed themselves as dissatisfied with the limitations imposed on us in being allowed to discuss only the money spent, how it was spent, was it in accordance with the Vote as put before the House.  Deputy Dillon knows that he himself was dissatisfied on many occasions.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Dillon was an ordinary member of the Committee there were a great deal of irrelevancies but when he became chairman he was a perfect chairman; he did not speak much himself and the business was attended to.  He was an ideal chairman.  If some way could be found to have Deputy Dillon on certain occasions acting here as a kind of assistant chairman he might be in the chair at a time like this and we would get the matter settled in a very few minutes.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has long since passed the days of blushing.  I support this motion.  I think it is a very good one.  I think it is very necessary.  The time has come when members of the House, through a Committee of the House should be able to consider and examine the wisdom of certain expenditures envisaged in certain Estimates.  I agree that it is very important.  Deputy Dillon wanted a debate on this.  Apparently, he is not happy now that he is going to get a debate on this.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Dillon went on here for over half an hour with theatricals, without having read the motion, giving us a lecture on the operations of the machinery of State in connection with Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, meetings of the Cabinet to decide on expenditure, he deliberately was not putting his mind to the motion.</P>

      <P>All those who spoke on the Vote on Account certainly gave me the impression that if they had an opportunity of delving into the Estimates they would be able to show the House how substantial savings would be made.  Deputy Hickey wanted to examine in detail the Vote dealing with Arus an Uachtaráin.  He would make a great saving in the £50,000 voted for that particular office of State.  Other Deputies referred to other Departments.</P>
      <P>This motion seeks to give the House the opportunity of selecting for this Committee those very members who say in the House that, given the opportunity, they could show how it could be done.  Now that the opportunity is there for them, they are screaming the loudest against it.  It is imperative that this motion should be passed.  We have been too long restricted, as members of this House, without having a proper say in the examination of these matters.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan, when he was. Minister for Finance, immediately on taking office in 1948, informed the House that he had put experts into Departments of State to see if money could be saved by getting rid of people who were not necessary in Departments, who were not doing the work which they should be doing and for which they were being paid out of taxpayers' money.  I do not know whether the House remembers that or not.</P>
      <P>The proposed Committee could examine an Estimate very carefully and could give the House its views on it. It would make a Minister who was inclined to be extravagant aware of the fact that an examination of proposed expenditure would be taken in advance and that the Dáil would no longer be limited to seeing that he spent the money in the manner that he was given permission to spend it by the House, whether the expenditure was necessary or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come when we should examine a motion of this kind with a <Col N="851" /> certain amount of satisfaction.  Everybody wants economies.  The moment the door is open to enable them to attempt to bring about enonomies, to apply the combined wisdom of all Parties in the House, there are protests against it.  Am I to take it that the Opposition want only to be able to criticise without giving any constructive help?  Here is an opportunity for the Opposition to give constructive help for the benefit of the community instead of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
