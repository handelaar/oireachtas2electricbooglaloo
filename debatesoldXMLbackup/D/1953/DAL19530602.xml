      <P>On the last day this Estimate was under discussion, we found ourselves back again at an old argument which tends to become rather sterile, that is, the precise strength of the Defence Force that we can or should maintain.  As I tried to point out, the strength that we need to maintain <Col N="406" /> here&mdash;and that largely dictates the cost involved&mdash;is simply this.  It is the minimum strength that will give the protection or the insurance that we calculate should be given and that will also be sufficient to give a <i>cadre</i> on which to expand.  The calculation of that minimum strength must obviously be done by the staffs whose duty it is to do it.  They can arrive at their estimates only after a careful survey of the situation and they will almost inevitably find themselves in the position that, from the defence point of view, the optimum will be more than the purse could bear and that in the end they have to cut their requirements to the absolute minimum.  Having done that, a point is reached where to cut below the minimum would be to reduce the whole thing to a sham; in other words, to defeat the purpose for which these forces are there at all.  When you get to that stage, no further cut is possible and you are faced with a decision as to whether you are going to have a Defence Force at all, because if you maintain a Defence Force at all, you are going to have cost and if you maintain that force below the minimum, you are going to be spending money on a sham throwing money down the drain in annual instalments, as we have pointed out before.</P>
      <P>There is really no question, as I think I said on the previous day, as to one group or one particular Party wanting to maintain a strong whole-time Regular Army and pinning their whole faith on that and another taking up the position that we could do with a completely part-time voluntary Army and liquidate the whole-time element completely.  These are two opposite extremes which I do not think anybody could support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that we are agreed that we need a Defence Force which will provide a <i>cadre</i> for expanding and that the Army which would meet an emergency here is to be visualised as an embodiment on the skeleton of the permanent force, plus its immediate reserves.  I have gone into all this because on occasions it seems to have the appearance that Deputies on this side insist on a strength of 12,000 odd, while some Deputies on the other side pin their faith to the figure of 5,000. <Col N="407" /> Deputy O'Higgins, when Minister for Defence, pointed out that it is not reasonable to deal with figures in this way, that, from the point of view of actual ineffectiveness of mere numbers of men, there is not an awful lot of difference between 5,000 and 12,000, if you look at that number of men armed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if the figures were 5,000 and 12,500, I agree with the Deputy that, if you look merely at a Regular Force of 12,000 and 5,000 and nothing more, from the point of view of effectiveness, you have not gained an awful lot by having 12,000, but that is not the point of the argument.  What we have to visualise is a force which will, first, give you the skeleton of such emergency army as you are going to have, if you need it, a skeleton on which you can build your whole military defensive plans; and secondly, a skeleton that will have within itself a certain element available for immediate effective deployment, because it may be a matter of hours.  It is on that basis that our attitude has been adopted that we should maintain the minimum establishment which the Staff calculated was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am running the risk of repeating things which some of us said in great detail, particularly in 1948, 1949 and 1950, but it does go to the kernel of the whole thing in so far as we are at an argument about the strength to be maintained.  It has arisen again on this Estimate because, in particular, of Deputy O'Donnell's intervention <Col N="408" /> and the attitude he adopted.  Why do we say that it is unwise to cut below the minimum which the staff said was necessary?  Without repeating all that has been said on the matter before from the purely Regular Army point of view, I should like to have it looked at from this angle, in addition.  We hear people talking about the inadequate training of the F.C.A., about the inadequate servicing of the whole-time personnel and about the inadequate maintenance of the Reserve and Deputies are now pointing to the serious position of the First Line Reserve. Some of us saw that coming as far back as 1946, 1947 and 1948 and pointed out the grave threat there was to the First Line Reserve.  Those Deputies such as Deputy MacBride who mentioned it this year as if it were something new should look back on the records where they will see that these dangers were precisely pointed out as far back as that time under the system we were then operating.</P>
    <P>All these points are made on the one hand and on the other, the point is made that we are maintaining too strong a force.  The answer is very simple and it has been given a number of times.  The effectiveness of all your Defence Forces, their standard, their maintenance and even their strength, depends very largely on the effectiveness of the Regular Force which is the skeleton for the whole lot.  If the strength of that Regular Force is not maintained at least up to the minimum I have tried to indicate, its effectiveness is impaired and with it everything else suffers.  In fact, it can very nearly go altogether.</P>
    <P>In the history of the Defence Forces here, we can find some salutary lessons and we should look at them absolutely objectively and without worrying very much as to who in the past was to blame, who made a wise decision or an unwise decision.  The fact is that, after the demobilisation in the '20's, in a very different set of circumstances, admittedly, and particularly different world circumstances, the Defence Forces were depleted to a point where they rapidly became ineffective, in the sense of being a Defence Force at all, as various officers on the staffs at that time pointed out.  The first effort to supplement <Col N="409" /> them with voluntary reserves was made by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and the second by their successors.  These efforts, whereas they were, in part, successful, brought out a number of valuable lessons of which one was that there is a limit to the size of the voluntary force you can maintain and that that limit is very definitely posed by the size of the Regular Army you have.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from that, there is the whole question of the training of the Regular Army itself.  At the risk of repeating what I said here in 1948 when, I think, I gave a very thorough and very accurate resumé of the history of the Army on the first Estimate of the Coalition Government for Defence, I may say that we pointed out that during that period the strength which was round about the 5,000 mark that Deputy O'Donnell is talking about was so low that it was impossible to train at all.  Quite apart from equipment difficulties, men were absorbed in guard duties and routine duties.  They could never be got together for training.  It was possible to give battalions annual training at that time only because certain reserve battalions were mobilised for annual training and did garrison work in the city.  Do you see what that means?  It means that at that time things were so bad that when you got your reserve battalion for annual training all you did with them was to make them do garrison duty and you tried to get a little bit of field training for the regular battalion instead.  When the voluntary elements were provided, there were not the troops, the facilities and the officers available to train them, notwithstanding the fact that in the case of the Volunteer force experiment a number of officers were specially recruited for the purpose.</P>
    <P>All that is the experience of that time which in itself very definitely points to the fact that the figure mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell is just not workable.  It is not a question of opinion.  It is a question of something proved by the fact and by the record of that period.  At that time we were spending a considerable amount of money, even by standards in those <Col N="410" /> days, on the Defence Force and it meant that you were spending £1,000,000 to £2,000,000 every year on the Army with a very serious risk that when the Army was needed it would not be able to answer the function for which it was provided.</P>
    <P>Those of us who were through the emergency of 1940 realise that, I think. The General Staff realise it.  We realise that by a great combination of good fortune and good luck we were able to meet the 1940 emergency, through the fortunate situation that you had the so-called phoney war period to condition people and to get them accustomed to maintaining a bigger Army, that we had a first mobilisation eight or nine months before the actual emergency of 1940, that we had been trying to make up for lost time in the previous 18 months. Notwithstanding all that, the situation was so bad that if there had been any real pressure put upon us beyond the point to which it had been put, I doubt if the machine could have borne the strain.</P>
    <P>If anybody should care to do a calculation, he will find very quickly that when you try to provide for all the elements that are necessary it is not, on first look at the problem, 12,000 you will need; it is 15,000 or more.  Look at it this way: First of all you have to make an estimate as to what emergency force you could reasonably hope to have when an emergency would come.  You go to build for that.  That of necessity, must be largely composed of part-time soldiers&mdash;Reserves and F.C.A.  You cannot leave it all or beyond a certain percentage to emergency recruiting when the time comes. To maintain these part-time elements you will find that you need a certain regular skeleton for each unit and for each formation.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the case of an ordinary infantry battalion.  If you look at the organisation of an infantry battalion even as it was during the emergency&mdash;I should imagine the argument would apply even more strongly now than then&mdash;you will find that it is futile to think of it in terms of being completely part-time personnel.  That was all right in the days when the rifle <Col N="411" /> was your only armament, when it was only a question of rifles and men but now, with the various relatively complex armaments that you have and with the difficulties that are brought into the situation by air power and complications in transport, and so forth and so on, you will find that if you are going to have an effective battalion, even an effective Second Line Reserve battalion, you will have to allot to that battalion certain whole-time administrative personnel.  If it is going to be a battalion at all, it is going to have equipment which will be relatively complex and will take some time in minding.  That pre-supposes whole-time personnel on the quarter-master's side to look after that equipment.</P>
    <P>The organisation of the unit itself is more complicated than formerly.  That pre-supposes that if it is going to be run efficiently somebody will have to be whole-time and you need someone on the adjutant's side.</P>
    <P>Then there is the training, which is much more complex for every individual man in it.  When you work that out you find that you need a number of N.C.O. instructors and officer instructors, at least one or two officers and N.C.O.s for sub-parts of that battalion.  These will need for various purposes an odd private soldier here and there.  When you reckon the whole thing up you will find very quickly that, although this is to be a battalion of 800 or 900 men, say, of the F.C.A. or of some other Reserve, in order to make it effective, to make it worthwhile maintaining you will have to have a number of whole-time personnel allotted.  When you work out the essential allotment of whole-time or Regular personnel, you will find that you have a substantial number to account for.</P>
    <P>If you do that over every unit that you will have in your Defence Force you will find straight away, before you do anything else, that you have made a significant hole in your establishment; you will find you have absorbed a considerable number, a significant number of the 12,000 allowed by the Staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> That situation is aggravated by another fact, that in modern times there are a number of units, in the specialist end particularly, where the proportion of whole-time to part-time could be very high because of the nature of the work, that is, if that unit is to be effective at all.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there are certain complete or nearly complete units of the Regular Army itself required to meet an emergency occasion.  As some of us have pointed out, you may have a pre-emergency period or you may have the opening stages of an emergency where you want something available straight away while you are mobilising, if for nothing more than the protection of vital points or vital garrison duty.  If you are to be able to supply that immediately, that pre-supposes certain regular units as such.</P>
    <P>Then, again, in the case of specialist arms, having regard to the long time it is likely to take a purely voluntary or part-time organisation to get effective in these circumstances, you will have to supply, to make the remainder of your forces effective, a certain number of part-time or virtually part-time special units of various classes.  You can proceed with your calculation along these lines and you will come to the figure.  When you come to that figure, you will probably find that it is a great deal in excess of the existing figure.  The next problem is to reduce that to the minimum. That is, in fact, what the General Staff did when it was arriving at these figures.  There was more or less that kind of approach to see what was the barest minimum that could be got without making the whole thing a sham.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to it, too, and that is the interest and the effectiveness of the personnel.  I should like to deal with that separately.  I have not by any means put the argument for maintaining the establishment completely or thoroughly, because I feel that has been done on other occasions, particularly in the debate in 1948 and in 1949, and it is hardly necessary to repeat it again. But there are some other aspects on which I might touch.  One of the <Col N="413" /> desperate things that happened back in the late '20's and the very early '30's was that the strength was so low that people were absorbed in routine duties so much that they could not train. Officers were killed with the routine duties and they had no men to train, nor had they the time, because their time was occupied in long terms as orderly officers or in guard duties.  It has a desperate effect on morale.  It prevents Defence Forces from preparing or keeping themselves fit for the purpose for which they are there.  In fact, one who saw it at that time can only wonder that they were capable of the effort they were capable of after such a demoralising experience.</P>
    <P>Now there was inevitably bound to be a tendency towards the same type of demoralisation after the emergency. There was a contraction of numbers after the emergency as men went out, and so forth.  But I think that the strengths were let go too low and did, in fact, go dangerously near the position that you had in those times to which I refer.  From 1947 onwards the strength fell sharply and that was bound to have its repercussions on the morale of the Army.  Significantly, with the increase back to a workable establishment it makes it much easier for men to be interested in their job and to carry out their duties efficiently.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, there is the whole question, shall I say, of opportunity. Some Deputies said that we did not pay our soldiers or officers enough. Personally, I subscribe to that view. But one must also look at it from the point of view of the community as a whole and realise that this service is in the nature of an insurance; that there are other things that must, from day to day, be regarded as in priority to it; that in our circumstances we cannot afford to pay more; and that that is the situation which you have. One of the very important things in such a situation is that there should be as many chances as possible for advancement to personnel in this force and, of course, the larger the force the better the opportunities.</P>
    <P>One of the deplorable things that results from any policy of cutting down the size of the Army is that you immediately <Col N="414" /> restrict the future of good men in that force.  At the moment, if your establishment is, say, 12,000 and you are keeping up to it, there is a certain prospect for any good officer, N.C.O. or man to go a little bit further.  In other words, there are so many potential vacancies, so many niches, if you like, for higher appointments, whether to the higher grades of N.C.O. or commissioned rank, or even in the higher establishments where there is extra pay for the private category.  If you halve that, you automatically cut down the opportunities for promotion and with it the stimulation to interest.</P>
    <P>I wonder does Deputy O'Donnell realise that a direct consequence of what he has suggested would be to cut out the possibilities for promotion? If I understood him aright, his proposition was to cut the number down to 5,000 and pay them more.  Very good.  From the purely personal point of view of the soldier, I suppose there is something to be argued there.  But, even from that point of view of cutting down the size of the force, you are cutting down the opportunities for promotion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Deputy that as all the great military Powers are almost equally balanced, are we not emphasising too much about our Army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me finish my point.  I will come back to that.  The second point is that, of course, that proposition does not involve any saying. Deputy O'Donnell is not suggesting saving money on the Army obviously if that is his point, except in so far as you save it in equipment. But, remember, equipment is needed not so much for the immediate Regular Army, but to have it available in a time of emergency.  I take it that he is not coupling a saving in equipment with that.  I think I can leave Deputy O'Donnell at that.  The proposition does not seem to be without its objections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I come to what Deputy Hickey has suggested, there is another point.  Deputy MacBride, amongst others, has pointed to the decline of the Reserve.  I am sorry he is not here, because I should like to tell <Col N="415" /> him that it is just that decline we were afraid of five years ago when his Government was in office.  That was one of the consequences that was inevitable from the policy of cutting the Army, that not only were you impoverishing yourself by cutting down the Regular Army, but under the system which we have&mdash;I am perfectly open to any suggestion for altering it &mdash;for feeding the Reserve, you were not only cutting down the Regular Army but the Reserve.  What we are facing in regard to the First Line Reserve at the moment is the result of the postwar policy.  It was the inevitable result, as some of us pointed out at that time.  The worrying thing is just precisely how to tackle it.  I am not satisfied that with the terms of service as we have it, even if you maintain the Regular Army strength, that you can maintain your First Line Reserve.</P>
    <P>Deputies appreciate, I suppose, that the theory of the business is, and the practice as it works out is, that a soldier joins the Army for a certain period.  If he does not continue soldiering as a regular soldier for 20 years or so he automatically goes on the Reserve and comes up for annual training.  As he gets certain payment for coming on, the State has a lien and can call on him.  That &ldquo;A&rdquo; Reserve element was a most important part of our Defence Forces up to and during the emergency.  It was in many ways to be equated in value to regular personnel, and that was brought out very strongly during the emergency, where the &ldquo;A&rdquo; Reserve N.C.O.s were indispensable and the old officers and old Reserves were extremely useful.  I would nearly go so far as to say indispensable, too.</P>
    <P>At the time the establishment was being worked out, I remember, from personal recollection, that calculations were made as to what the inflow would be and that various calculations were made to see what was the position of the Reserves.  If my memory serves me right, one of the big objections, from the military point of view, to reducing the establishment from the 15,000 first proposed by the General Staff to 12,500, which was suggested <Col N="416" /> for financial reasons, was the adverse effect on the Reserve.  It is a pity that although Deputies are alive to this problem to-day, Deputies were not alive to it at the time when such a situation could have been stopped.</P>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory strength of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Reserve&mdash;what I mean by Reserve &ldquo;A&rdquo; is that type of Reserve that has got fairly full-time Army training for at least a couple of years and is called up annually.  I think when Deputy Dr. O'Higgins was sitting on these benches I pressed him to look into this question, particularly of officers of this Reserve type, that is, officers who would get a pretty thorough training as officers, something more than can be given to the F.C.A. officer, to supplement the regular officer corps, and also the question of N.C.O.s and men.  With adjustment you could probably get back the Reserve to approximately the same strength as the Regular Army under the present system, but the question is whether that is sufficient.  I would like to urge on the Minister that that problem be examined.</P>
    <P>Circumstances are constantly changing and some of us are too long away to add something useful in the way of detailed argument&mdash;at least I would hesitate to do so because I probably would not have all the relevant facts before me which the Minister would have&mdash;but it is apparent from the figures as they are going that there is an immediate necessity for building up the First Line Reserve.  It will be needed particularly in the first stages of mobilisation.  It will be needed to fill up regular units which may need to be deployed straight away.  It will be needed to fill up certain gaps in the organisation where experience is required immediately; and it may be even needed to fill staff and administrative positions.  Briefly the problem appears to be this: we have got to the stage where we are prepared to maintain Regular Forces at the establishment which the Staff has recommended. We have now the problem of that Reserve, which is a threefold one.</P>
    <P>The first problem is how you are going to supply officers.  We are <Col N="417" /> actually, in one sense, worse off than in 1939 because there was a fairly large number of officers immediately available at that time for whole-time mobilisation with a certain amount of intensive training.  There were the officers of the General Reserve as it was then called, and most of the officers of the Volunteer force had got a pretty intensive training also.  Then there is the question of N.C.O.s.  In 1939, you had a considerable number of them training in the Reserve.  I do not think there is the same number available now.  Then, of course, there is the question of soldiers.</P>
    <P>This question of the First Line Reserve needs careful and vigorous examination and attention to the F.C.A. will not fill that want alone. The F.C.A. will be needed, and the more I see of it as things are developing, the more I think we have to look on the F.C.A. as the First Line Reserve, no longer as we looked on it at the beginning as something corresponding to the L.D.F.  As things have developed we will have to regard the F.C.A. as we regarded the Volunteer Reserves of the past, that is the old Volunteer Reserve or the Volunteer force.  Whether the terms of service permit of their being regarded in that way I do not know, but if the terms of service do not permit that, or if those men are not available for mobilisation, in that sense then, we are very definitely much worse off than we were in the past.</P>
    <P>A little bit of clear thinking is needed at this stage to see how we are developing our Defence Forces, what we want them for, and precisely how we are going to dispose them; what the rôle of the F.C.A.&mdash;which in its name, Forsa Cosanta Aitiúil, is a local defence force&mdash;will be, and whether it is to be considered, as first contemplated, or whether it is to take the place of the Volunteer Reserve.  We should have a clear idea as to what rôle we want that force to play and some clarification is needed as to whether part of it may be included in the First Line Volunteer Reserve and part of it used as a local Reserve.  That is getting perilously near the old idea of lines as they were in the conception of the Volunteer force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> However, whatever it is there is need for our General Staff to sit down and be quite clear as to what the rôles are and, in the meantime, in some way to correct the position in regard to the First Line Reserve which is definitely disquieting and which is, I fear, only the logical result of the trend that was there, which some of us tried to point out and wanted to have stopped.  The results are there as well as the trend and I think something has to be done about it.</P>
    <P>Another remark made by Deputy MacBride was that he thought&mdash;as usual he was not very definite about anything&mdash;and insinuated that a certain deficiency was immediately attributable to emigration.  It may be that there is a factor there and we do know in the past that a number of reservists have always been employed in England and have usually, come back.  I take it the Minister will check on this.  I have no figures to show whether there is any difference in general from the position as it was in the past but in 1938-39 there was a large number of reservists employed in England and still the mobilisation figure for that Reserve was exceptionally high.  I have not the figures before me&mdash;my memory is getting a little dull on these things&mdash;but I would be surprised if I am wrong in saying that the mobilisation figure for the old Reserve was between 85 and 90 per cent.  If we take that in conjunction with the fact that a substantial number of these had permission to be employed abroad and to be out of jurisdiction and had returned, then the indications are that a very substantial number of those in that category at the present day are still available and likely to be available.  I do not know what Deputy Hickey wants but I think what he suggested was that there is no use in having any Defence Force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain what I was trying to convey.  I pointed out that all the Great Powers were almost equally balanced and I suggested that we should try to exercise our moral force rather than depend solely on a military force.  Mind you, the moral leadership of a small nation can be as <Col N="419" /> great as that of a big nation.  If we joined with other nations in a crusade against poverty, ignorance, sickness and the fear of want, we would be just as effective, if not more so, than in talking about building up an Army as we are.</P>

      <P>Here is the trouble about our defence.  We are not by any means spending an exorbitant amount on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not misunderstand what I said.  I stand for an efficient Army but not for a very big Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all stand for that.  I can put it this way.  We all stand for a small Army, the smallest that we can possibly have, consistent with efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to catch the Deputy out.  You see the way I am putting it&mdash;the smallest Army that can be efficient.  As I tried to point out, we do come to a certain point of smallness where you are not efficient any longer.  What does &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; mean?  Efficient for the purpose it is there.  Efficiency does not mean that every man in the Army is a good shot.  It does not mean only that every man in the Army is a first-class shot, that we can enter into international competitions and win prizes.  That efficiency is not being efficient for the purpose for which it is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, efficiency for the purpose for which it is there demands a certain minimum strength.  In other words, you have to go back right to the beginning and decide whether you are going to provide for defence.  If you are going to provide for defence <Col N="420" /> you have got to provide efficiently in that sense, and providing efficiently in that sense involves the spending of a certain amount of money, unfortunately. We have in this country actually been spending less on defence than most other countries&mdash;a great deal less.  In fact, we are spending so little that Deputy Dr. O'Higgins at one time&mdash;I hope I am not paraphrasing him wrongly but he is here and he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash; used to chide me with not being a realist.  He used to say to me: &ldquo;You talk about the amount we are spending on defence.  Even if we were to spend double that amount do you think that would give you complete defence?&rdquo; Of course it would not.  A small country such as ours cannot ever provide absolute defence but it can go a certain distance to meet its defence problem and meet it efficiently, and if it can I think it should.  Generally that is the way the argument more or less lies.</P>
    <P>After all is said and done, all that we can really hope to do in regard to defence is first of all in an emergency period to be prepared to garrison our own territory.  The advantage of that is that in such a period any vacuum is dangerous.  The big Powers about whom the Deputy spoke will be under pressure and any vacuum would be dangerous.</P>
    <P>The first consideration that jumps to mind is if there is an area such as this, an island, or even the partitioned part of it we have, the Twenty-Six Counties, which is completely unprepared, there is a vacuum there to be filled and if no preparations have been made for that portion of the country in an emergency period, there is a certain temptation to other people to say: &ldquo;That will have to be looked after.&rdquo; Therefore you are up against the fact that if we do not do that job ourselves and provide for the garrisoning of this bit of territory, even if any future war does not come any nearer to us than the last war did, the question will inevitably arise: &ldquo;Who is going to garrison this country?&rdquo;  Is it not better that we should be prepared to garrison it ourselves? Therefore when we mention <Col N="421" /> this word &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;, it should be remembered that it is not enough to keep young men together to garrison the country.  We must in addition have a certain amount of organisation, preparation and readiness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we have to incur the annual expense involved. Apart from the mere question of immediate garrisoning, we have the problem that if an emergency came any closer, close enough to involve us in any way, you have a second consideration. Would it be better that our young men should be involved, in that by being drafted singly into somebody else's army or that they should be involved in it, in units of their own in their own Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The ultimate answer is that we should provide our own Army and that involves a certain amount of expense.  There would be no argument in regard to that, were it not for the amount of money involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not concerned about the money but we are concerned about the futility of our talking about an Army and forgetting the very small part our Army can play in a military way while as a nation we can exercise a big moral force if we wish to do so.</P>

      <P>We are talking on this Estimate and I should not like to take advantage of the discussion on this Estimate to discuss wider issues which might arise on a general debate. We are talking now on the Estimate for Defence and it all boils down to one thing.  We are all apparently prepared to do what we can with regard to defence but some Deputies start talking about the cost and that is the trouble.  There has been a certain amount of criticism in regard to the cost of equipment.  Here again is a load that has fallen suddenly upon us. Personally I would be prepared to have seen the bill for equipment spread over a number of years.  There were three years of the Coalition Government <Col N="422" /> when we got practically no equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  Did you ask the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  The answer given to me was that we could not get it at the time.  All right, but we need equipment and it is unfortunate that the circumstances are such that we have got to get it.  It is something that we are able to get now and surely we ought to avoid ever getting ourselves, if we can get it, into the position in which apparently the Coalition Minister was, where he could tell me that he could not get equipment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he was told that.  There had been exactly that situation in the '30's.  In the early 1930's we had not got sufficient equipment; when we tried to get it in the late 1930's we could not get it and we were deficient in equipment right through the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And if an emergency comes again we will not be able to get the equipment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If we can get the equipment now we should certainly purchase it.  It would be illuminating to have some figures as to what equipment could have been purchased at certain times in the past and what could not.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins said that he could not get the equipment. That was the position when he was the Minister for Defence.  To-day the position is different.  To-day we can get the equipment.  Ought we to complain about that?  To some extent the bill is a great deal higher than it was but, as the Minister for Finance pointed out in his Budget statement, we have been spending less on equipment in recent years than we spent before the war, and what we were <Col N="423" /> spending before the war was completely inadequate in view of our requirements.</P>
      <P>The only policy the Minister can adopt is to get as much equipment as he can.  The type of equipment available seems to be suitable, and it is obvious that we have been very deficient in two particular types of up-to-date armament.  We are practically devoid of any kind of armament to deal with armoured vehicles.  We have made good that deficiency in the best way we could, namely, by the provision of a mobile type of weapon that can be put into the hands of any foot soldier.  We are also deficient in anti-aircraft, but I think some effort is being made to supply that deficiency.  I do not know whether, remembering air development and the manufacture of jets and so forth, ground anti-aircraft defences can be very effective.  I do not know what the value of such defences is but some defence must be provided; otherwise one leaves oneself wide open to old, cheap methods of destruction.</P>
      <P>The only plea I make is that we accept expenditure on our Defence Forces generally as reasonable.  In present circumstances it is unreasonable to suggest reducing our Defence Forces or abstaining from the purchase of equipment having regard to past history. Looking objectively at the history of the recent past, without any desire to score political points, a very simple lesson can be drawn; the Minister should maintain the minimum establishment that his staff advises him to maintain, and get all the equipment possible for the forces at his disposal. That is a very simple formula, but it is the most effective formula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of defence which is a little bit perturbing.  It is difficult to know what the prospects are.  Expressing a purely personal view I would not say that prospects at the moment are such as to offer a guarantee of peace in the future.  At times during the past five years things have looked threatening.  At times it has appeared as if everything was lovely in the garden.  In the over-all situation, the more one thinks of things the more depressing in some <Col N="424" /> aspects the future appears to be. That does not necessarily mean an armed conflict at the end of the road but it does mean trouble in some form or another.</P>
    <P>There are two big blocks.  Occasionally an apparent rapprochement takes place.  At other times there is a flare up and all the time there is a steady building up of strength on both sides.  There has been a good deal of talk of peace but we learn of the perfecting of fighting aircraft in Russia and the development of atomic field artillery in America simultaneously. We see no likelihood that either potential belligerent is willing to take the risk of being the first to disarm.  There is a steady tension all the time, economic as well as general.</P>
    <P>Recently we had a statement by the President of the United States which was interpreted as an &ldquo;olive branch,&rdquo; but there were conditions and one of those conditions was that there would be inspection.  What is the likelihood of that condition being accepted?  If that condition and all the other conditions are not accepted, what is the interpretation to be put on the statements that have been made?  What is the interpretation to be taken from a situation that is daily developing? Even if there are difficulties in Europe and the unification of armies, and so forth, is not going ahead as rapidly as some people might wish, is that a good sign?  Might the position not be more hopeful if one saw strength being built up on one side or the other without any obstacles in its way?  Might not that be a better guarantee in the long run?  Every Deputy can assess the situation for himself.  I do not think we are out of the wood yet and the time is past when we should consider the problem of our defence as something that may be important at a future date and all one need do now is make a token provision and wait until things &ldquo;hot up&rdquo; to make preparation for it.</P>
    <P>We have not reached that situation and, since we have not, there are a number of defence problems I believe we have not really tackled.  First and fundamental in the whole thing is food.  I wonder have we yet got to the <Col N="425" /> stage where that problem is thought of actively in relation to defence&mdash;the provision and the distribution of food, the provision of a transport organisation and the provision of other essential goods and services?  These are undoubtedly tied up with any defence problem we have.  While we have been largely occupied to date with training to get to the position where the Defence Forces should be up to strength, there is a still larger area to be attended to in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>There is the question of civil defence. I know the Minister is making certain moves in that direction and I think his predecessor actually initiated some training at the end of 1949 and that is being pressed forward now.  But have we got beyond the stage of training personnel?  What kind of a problem will cities like Cork, Limerick and even Galway be likely to face?  These matters were not attended to before the last emergency.  On that occasion we had time to get used to a situation which providentially did not develop. The problems are still there.  These are subjects that I can recollect dealing with in previous years and I do not feel I should repeat them in detail.  I would like, however, to stress again a number of things I said and which I tried to advocate to Deputy Dr. O'Higgins when he was on this side of the House.  I would like to advocate the very same things to the present Minister.</P>
    <P>It is always a question of balance and of how urgent the problem is.  It does not look to be so urgent at the moment but I have a feeling that until 1954 is out there is always a certain amount of urgency about it.  I would not advocate at this moment spending excessive sums on defence.  Nevertheless, the provision which is being made in that regard seems to be reasonable.  After all, what we are doing this year is to provide the moneys necessary for maintaining the Regular Defence Forces at approximately their peace-time establishment and then we are providing some moneys to buy equipment for them. That is where all the money is going and that is all we are spending on defence.  When we look at the problem <Col N="426" /> in its wider sense, we see there is a lot more to think about and a lot more to deal with.  We do not seem to have got to that stage and to get to that stage we will need a good deal more expenditure which we are not prepared to carry at the moment.  Let us carry the expenditure we are carrying, shall I say, cheerfully.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to ask Deputies who succumb to the temptation&mdash;let me put it that way&mdash;of saying: &ldquo;Save on defence&rdquo;, because that is really what it is, to pause and think on what is involved.  Would those same Deputies say: &ldquo;Save on a number of other things&rdquo;?  The last day I asked Deputy O'Donnell, when he spoke about cutting, whether he would advocate cutting in regard to the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Local Government or any of these Departments! It is very easy&mdash;it might be even popular&mdash;to say things like that, but it seems to me to point to the sterility of ideas in Deputies.  It all seems to come back to this one point which is, after all, not the biggest element in capital expenditure by any means in this country.</P>
    <P>I am referring to a table.  The routine expenditure on the Army and the Department of Defence is certainly not excessive.  Capital expenditure&mdash; if you call war equipment purchased capital expenditure&mdash;is not excessive either.  Deputies talk about saving but the amount of saving that would be possible, even if their views were to be carried out to the point of liquidation of this expenditure completely, would be relatively insignificant in regard to the total Budget that the State has to carry.  We are carrying on the current side alone, for supplies and services, roughly in the region of £100,000,000 in the year.  The Defence Estimate is only a relatively small percentage of that.  Even if you were to wipe out the whole of the Defence Estimate, it would still have relatively little effect on the total bill of the State for the year but if you wipe out only a proportion of that defence expenditure it would have a still smaller influence having regard to the total Budget but it would also have <Col N="427" /> a completely destructive influence on the problems for which the small sum is being expended.</P>
    <P>It is purely a question of balance.  I think that the sums we are spending on other items are very much in excess of what we are spending on defence. Altogether, on the capital side we are spending £39.29 million and the bulk of that goes in the directions mentioned by Deputy Hickey.  There can be no question but that the bulk of it is going into those things which have priority. The provision for defence is made very, very secondary, indeed, in all Government spending and Government calculations. It is less proportionately even than its importance warrants.  When you look at the matter realistically you are still taking a great risk with things as they are.</P>
    <P>Deputies talk about saving in defence but they do not talk about saving elsewhere. I wonder why?  Is it a question of popularity?  I do not know, but if they look at the sum they will find that the return from the saving they advocate is likely to be very small and that the bulk of the spending that you make is going in other directions altogether.  The amount of equipment which the Minister is going to get in next year will not bring us by any means to the saturation point in regard to the equipment that will be needed by the Defence Forces and even though we have already spent a considerable amount on equipment, we have not yet arrived at the position where we could say we were in any way over-equipped or even adequately equipped for the forces we have got.</P>
    <P>I think that those are the only remarks I would make about this Estimate.  One could join issue on the whole question of defence but we have done that so thoroughly on previous occasions that I feel it is mere repetition to go into it again.  I would like to know and the Minister would like to know precisely what the attitude of certain Deputies is.  If they wanted to cut it out altogether we could understand that but people who want it both ways are difficult to understand.  I would like to ask the Minister whether the question of the First Line Reserve <Col N="428" /> will be given attention.  It is a situation that will not improve of itself but it may improve to some extent slowly if the strength of the Reguar Army is kept up, but that will depend on service and other factors.</P>
    <P>Now, leaving defence, there is only the question of Army pensions.  I understand that an Army Pensions Bill is being brought in and that provision is going to be made for the dependants of officers and men in the Defence Forces who die while on service and that something is going to be done to improve that position.  I hope it is going to be adequate.  We did press certain cases very hard on the Minister.  What was unique about that was that members of every single Party and every single interest in the House urged the same views on him. I understand that something is going to be done now to improve the position. I hope so but still I am not satisfied, because I think there is one question that requires attention in that regard.  As far as I can gather, anything that is to be done will be done merely on the basis of a pension. That is all right as far as it goes&mdash;that is, where a person is serving in the Army and becomes disabled or dies there will be certain automatic provision for the widow and dependants, But there is something more.  There is the case of a man who is killed, say, or very seriously injured in circumstances arising directly from his duty somewhere, of a case where there is a particular risk associated with his employment and where that risk has resulted in serious or fatal injury to him.</P>
    <P>In the case of civilian employment, many firms have insurance schemes.  If an employee dies during the period of his employment, the insurance scheme makes provision for his dependants. If a man has to retire prematurely from his employment there is, very often provision for the payment of either a lump sum or a pension.  I presume that is the type of provision that should be made in the Army also. There should also be provision to meet a specific risk.  Take the case of an Air Force officer who is injured in the course of his duty, or of an engineer <Col N="429" /> officer who is blown up by a mine that he is working in the course of his duty. One can also think of the case of an artillery man who is killed because a shell accidentally explodes beside him when it should not have exploded. These are all additional risks which are associated with the work that these men are doing and which are not statistically serious in the sense of being of frequent occurrence.  In that way they are not likely to be the cause of large claims against the State.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances, I think we should make specific provision for insurance for such personnel, particularly in the case of people who are employed in the handling of explosives or in the flying of aircraft because civilian insurance is beyond their reach, due to the risks involved.  I know that the Minister challenged us on this before. I checked on it, and it is a positive fact that a civilian company will only insure a pilot of a military aircraft at an exorbitant, at an impossibly uneconomic, premium.  In the ordinary insurance policy there will be exceptions put in for such things as the flying of a military plane, for those dealing with explosives and matters of that nature.  That being so, I think that an opportunity for insurance should be given, and that the most direct way of doing it is to provide insurance for members of the Defence Forces who are seriously injured or killed as a result of some occurrence or accident arising directly out of their duty.</P>
    <P>I am referring now to cases where there is an enormous amount of risk. It may be urged that there are administrative difficulties in the way of doing that.  That is no reason or excuse, however, why this should not be done. I think that in cases of this kind, provision should be made for insurance. We are all glad to learn that the Bill that is to be introduced will, we hope, give some measure of improvement to people already affected.  At any rate, I think that the principle which I am urging needs to be established and, in fact, I would go so far as to suggest that there should be retrospection in certain cases.</P>
    <P>That immediately brings up the interesting <Col N="430" /> point of this award.  It is now over two years since this matter was raised, and as yet we have not had any result.  That is one thing.  The second thing is that I understand, there was an anomaly there in regard to N.C.O.s and men who had between 12 to 18 years' service, if they went ill, in regard to treatment.  The Minister is aware of this because representations have been made to him on it. I was told, although I cannot say that I can rely on the authority on which it was mentioned to me, that this matter was probably being adjusted. There is one urgent case at the moment of a man who had 19 years' service.  This is the case of a man who became seriously ill and who was hit very badly by the operation of this provision whereas if he had, before becoming ill, less than 18 years' service and more than 12 he would be in a more fortunate position.  I would ask the Minister to try to adjust the position there, because I understand there is only one week or so to go before the situation can be solved.  I can give the Minister the particulars. This is a type of anomaly which I think needs correction.  I think Deputy Cowan mentioned a somewhat similar case last week.  It may probably have been the same case.</P>
    <P>I think that is all that I can add to this debate.  In conclusion, I want to refer in particular to this question of insurance for Army personnel who are injured in the course of duty through something happening, and arising directly out of the performance of their duty.  In regard to that, I think there is an awful lot to be done both in justice and from the point of view of the morale of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pay Deputy de Valera the compliment of saying that he definitely does take himself seriously, and that he takes this question of defence equally seriously.  But, in the case of people who take themselves seriously, or too seriously, he occasionally falls into the mistake that is common to such people that, having conceived a plan or drawn up a theory, he falls into the mistake of thinking that nobody else could have a point of <Col N="431" /> view even nearly approaching the truth except himself.  In some frenzied way he has built up this figure of 12,500 into a kind of sacred emblem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was trying to avoid.  The Deputy was not here when I was speaking on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of 12,300 or 12,600 or 13,000 will not do.  It must be 12,500.  It must, of necessity, be the aim of any and every Government to attain to that particular figure, and to be satisfied with nothing less.  I would expect accuracy from a Deputy who goes into such laboured detail, but when he was giving us this lecture on the importance of that particular figure, and when he was referring to the question of strength in past periods, he was dealing with a Book of Estimates that outlines the strength of the Army for this present financial year as being 10,000 N.C.O.s and men&mdash;very nearly approximately the strength of the Army two years ago but certainly nearer the strength of the Army two years ago than the figure we have all this talk about.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Deputy refers to the cut in the Army strength in the year 1948-49.  There again, he pays no attention to a situation presented by anybody else.  He will recollect, if he looks it up, the strength of the Army when I took it over.  The only cut in the strength of the Army was to allow the Construction Corps to go home.  Not a man was demobilised. The Construction Corps&mdash;those little boys&mdash;were allowed to go home: nothing else.  But there was work and there was hope of work throughout the country at that time.  Business was throbbing and it was difficult if not impossible to get recruits, but recruiting was never stopped.  The strength that the country gave us, short of conscription, was the strength of the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, having spent three years on the Opposition Benches talking in terms of 15,000, took over.  He spent a lot of money on recruiting. He had to alter the age.  He had to reduce the age and reduce the <Col N="432" /> attestation period.  He had to take boys of 17 years and take them for two years' service in order to keep an Army even up to this strength. Remember, the whole trend of modern life is antagonistic to the well-being in strength of a modern army.  Unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, the State intervening in order to try to make employment and find employment&mdash;all that is deadly opposed to the maintenance of a voluntary army.  What was my problem a few years ago is the Minister's problem to-day.  I doubt if the Government would have an Army within 2,000 or 3,000 of its present strength if it were not for a reduction in the age to 17. Yet we have this change featured as if one person deliberately cut or reduced an army to what is called &ldquo;danger point&rdquo; and another came along, conscious of his responsibilities, and was able to build it up to safety point.</P>
    <P>We had the same tricky dishonest presentation of a case by the Minister for Finance when broadcasting about his Budget.  He dragged in, for political purposes, the amount he proposed to spend on armaments, saying how little was spent on armaments during the period of the inter-Party Government.  If there was ever abuse of the pure ether waves it was that tricky dishonesty in misrepresenting to the public a difficult situation.  Both as a Deputy of this House and as a Minister of Government, he knew that from September 1939 up to 18 months or two years ago there were no arms to be got by an island such as this, by a neutral country, except what was given to us&mdash;and it is well to express appreciation of it&mdash;by Great Britain alone in small quantities.</P>
    <P>During the emergency, Great Britain supplied small quantities of warlike stores: I admit she had her own interests at heart as well as ours.  They were supplied in small quantities. However, throughout the whole world, no other country would sell us a popgun. When the war terminated, and the Atlantic Pact formation, and so forth, began to take place, you had the same position except that it was intensified.  Countries in Western <Col N="433" /> Europe outside the Atlantic Pact would not be sold a bullet.  I was candid with the House all through those years.  I came here year after year and pointed out the situation.  I invited Deputies of all Parties to make suggestions as to where arms might be procured in case any one of them knew of any such place.  I did get suggestions from Opposition Deputies. I followed up every single one of them &mdash;from here to Israel, out to America and to Canada.  I tried any place where we heard of an army changing over in its type of equipment or anything else and where there might be surplus stores.  We got a certain quantity each year from Great Britain &mdash;and nothing else.</P>
    <P>Before I left office as Minister for Defence I heard from the ex-Chief of Staff that there was a possibility of getting arms in Sweden, that the Swedish factories had satisfied the demands elsewhere and that, provided sanction could be got for the export of those arms from the big people of the Atlantic Pact formation, they would sell to us.  I told him to follow up that vigorously and energetically. He did.  My successor in office was fortunate enough to get those arms. Yet, the Minister for Finance goes on the air and tries to pretend that, for purposes of false economy, we would not buy.  I think that that kind of play-acting in regard to the question of national security is disgraceful, discreditable and unworthy of any Minister in any country.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the minimum strength of the Army, compatible with safety.  What is our experience?  Any one of us can be dogmatic about these things.  What is our experience?  Nil.  But what is held up as our experience?  The bungling and difficulties of mobilisation in September 1939&mdash;and that situation was not due to numbers.  It was due to lack of experience, to lack of training, to lack of facing up to the fact that some day there might be mobilisation.  Every man who was within reach of the Army was called up practically simultaneously &mdash; and there was neither food, stores equipment <Col N="434" /> nor shelter for the unfortunates when they were called up.</P>
    <P>I am raising that matter not in any critical way at all.  We learn from mistakes.  There should be far more practice at mobilisation&mdash;partial here partial there&mdash;than there is.  All through the emergency, when we were talking of evacuation, I urged that there should be tests of partial evacuation. If the day came when we had to evacuate Dublin City I do not know what would have happened.  The children of not even one school had been evacuated for one hour.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a lot more training by the Army and by the reservists of different classes in something like a lightning district mobilisation.  That is not a very ambitious thing.  The child learns to walk by toddling and stumbling and falling.  If we had a fairly big mobilisation to-morrow, I think it would be a bit of a bumble.  A lot more should be done to overcome these problems.</P>
    <P>We have adopted an attitude of neutrality.  In the modern world, by far and away the smallest military problem, facing the General Staff or the Government, is the problem of manpower.  The real problem is not to get the Army together; that can be done simply enough.  The initial equipment, provided steps are taken in time, can be got quickly enough.  The real problem is how to maintain that Army as a fighting force.  The Army of to-day is mechanised, it moves on wheels.  On one occasion during the last war, I saw a modern composite battalion pass by; when it had passed, I had seen no man &mdash;every man was inside armour of one kind or another, the infantry were carried in vehicles, and so on.  The maintenance of an army in the field to-day presents two big problems&mdash; ammunition and fuel oil or petrol.</P>
    <P>Both ammunition and petrol come from outside this country.  We do not supply a bullet, we cannot supply a gallon of petrol; our sources of supply are at the far corners of the earth, our lines of supply are halfway across the world.  Yet our policy is one of neutrality.  The war we visualise as a possibility, if not a probability, is a <Col N="435" /> war between the western nations and the eastern and presumably the countries we think might jump in here to safeguard their own supply lines would be some of the western countries. What is our outlook with regard to ammunition, petrol and fuel oil in that situation?  If it is the Americans or the British that jump in here, are we going to say: &ldquo;All right, but will you keep on supplying us with ammunition, petrol and oil?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is not a practical proposition, if that is absurd, then should not our line of training in the main be to make it impossible, or as difficult as possible, for any such force to continue in this country?  If that is a sensible outlook we should look more towards the F.C.A., towards 100,000 or 150,000 men scattered around the whole country carrying light equipment&mdash;an underground army rather than look towards a regular army uniformed and moving in bigger units. The two types of training &mdash; the guerilla type, the underground type, as against the regular army type &mdash; are completely incompatible and contradictory. The man trained in a regular army is trained more or less to become an automaton, a robot, a man who without thinking will do the thing he is trained to do, who will subconsciously obey a word of command but wait for the word of command and until he gets the word of command will stay put.  If he is ordered to stay there, no matter what happens on the right or on the left, the well-trained soldier will stay there.  In its own way that destroys initiative.  It is the very opposite type of training from that given to a guerilla band or a subterranean army.</P>
    <P>All my time as Minister for Defence and since I came over here I have not been advocating the abolition of the Regular Army, but I have been advocating more and more attention to the F.C.A.  I think it is getting less and less attention.  One of the things any Minister for Defence has got to stand up against and resist in his office is the tendency for the Regular Army and its staff to pull him and his attention <Col N="436" /> away from any volunteer force outside the walls of barracks.  That is the test.  I found that I had nearly to quarrel with the officers and General Staff in order to force them to give adequate or even slightly adequate attention to the F.C.A.  The Minister probably found the same difficulty but I think he has succumbed to these influences.</P>
    <P>I heard from behind the Minister's back his own Deputies ask him and the Army to give more attention to the training of the F.C.A.  There is an immense potential there.  The F.C.A. could be a force of between 160,000 and 200,000 men.  They would not get anything like Army training, but they would get a taste of it.  They would not be completely raw if you wanted to mobilise a big Army and you would have them there within your grip in the legal sense.</P>
    <P>A force like the F.C.A. will not keep on its toes by itself.  It is very frequently and continuously encouraged by Regular Army personnel.  The F.C.A. group in any area feel that it is a tremendous compliment and encouragement for a regular officer to visit them, to go through them, even though he spends only half an hour. I insisted on practically every member of the headquarters staff being out one week-end a month, each of them moving through the F.C.A. &mdash;surprise visits, check inspections, short lectures, supervising or viewing the men doing their ordinary normal week-end work.  I found that that was appreciated, that it had the effect of encouraging them, that they were taking more interest, and that other fellows outside looking on at that were inclined to join.</P>
    <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera spoke of balancing.  I think that is exactly what we must do.  We may never get opposite views to coalesce but we should try to get a balance by having a reasonable Regular Army and also the biggest, the strongest, the keenest and the most enthusiastic Volunteer Reserve outside of barracks.  The cost of that is relatively small, but the degree of insurance or safety which it gives is relatively very high, and I <Col N="437" /> believe that, no matter what the attitude may be with regard to Regular Army strength, any Minister is failing in his duty if he does not insist that the officers under him do their utmost to keep that force up to its greatest possible strength.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that I did not hear the whole of Dr. O'Higgins' speech because I certainly concur in the views he expressed in the latter part of that speech.  I am one of the people who do not believe in the building up of a large Army, and my reason is that, if we are to be attacked, the attack will come from one or other of the large powers who are now facing one another in no uncertain way.  Any of these powers would possess the most modern and terrible of weapons possible in this atomic age.  They would attack us with remote-controlled aircraft, with guided missiles and with the new atomic gun &mdash;some details of which were published in the newspapers within the past few days&mdash;which can throw a shell, even at this early stage, a distance of over seven miles, a shell packed with as much atomic destruction as destroyed the Japanese city of Hiroshima during the last war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the size of this country and the manpower we can build up, even when fully extended, there is very little use in endeavouring to provide against attack from nations of so much greater size.  If that is a true assessment of the position, there is very little use in going in for large-scale defence which will be limited by our size.  We would be in the position, I suggest, of the other small European countries which came in the path of these nations during the last war and our resistance would be rather more a measure of the loss of life and destruction of the country than anything else. I do not see any point in sacrificing human lives and having our country destroyed just to give one of the other powers&mdash;we must be on some side, and if we are attacked by one power and we defend ourselves, we automatically line up with another&mdash;a short respite to regroup their forces to carry on the war somewhere else.  That does not <Col N="438" /> appeal to me personally and I see very little sense in building an Army if it is to carry out a policy of that kind.</P>
    <P>Even if such a policy is advocated, I wonder can this country afford it. Have we got, first, the manpower necessary to build an adequate force and, secondly, are we in an economic position to do so?  Deputy O'Higgins put forward the points that were running through my mind.  Can we make the ammunition for the guns, if we get them, and are we guaranteed a source of supply?  Petrol and oil are essential in a modern war, whether for tanks, aeroplanes or any other weapons we may have, and surely these essentials would be cut off from us in the event of invasion.  Unless we are linked up in some pact with another country, I see very little hope of getting either financial help to build up our Army or the essentials for an Army in the shape of ammunition and the petrol and oils necessary for mobile units.  Our decision on neutrality, I suggest, forbids us dreaming of entering into any pact.  This country has made it clear that it is standing alone, that it is on neither side and that we are prepared to fight only if we are directly attacked.  We cannot enter N.A.T.O., U.N.O. or any other organisation under any contract to take a particular line in particular circumstances.  The only circumstances I know of in which we have said we will fight is if we are attacked.</P>
    <P>That being so, I hold that our Defence Forces should be of a size only sufficient to maintain law and order internally.  It could be of that size and be of some use in regard to ceremonial occasions and it should be of such a type as to be able to play some useful part in the economic life of the country.  I can see a certain use for our patrol boats in protecting our fisheries and our coasts and in giving succour, in case of the need for rescue at sea, and, a lesser extent, I can see the air force, if they used scouting planes, being of somewhat similar value in protecting our fisheries, in directing our corvettes where to seek pirate trawlers and in directing the corvettes or other craft to places where rescues <Col N="439" /> at sea could be carried out.  I agree with money being spent on this aspect to a limited extent because it helps the economic life of a nation.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the views I have expressed are open to such criticisms as the criticism that it is a defeatist attitude and the advocating, as the Minister for Finance said when I expressed these views in my Budget speech, of a policy of &ldquo;come and take us.&rdquo; Whether that is so or not, it is very easy to accuse a person, but surely other nations are no more foolish than we are.  We can see these weaknesses, any sane and thinking person here can see them, and I am quite sure that other countries can see them. Small countries like Luxembourg, Holland, Denmark, Sweden and various other small countries during the Second World War did not invite them to come and take them, but they came nevertheless and they took them in very short time, short in terms of hours but at a very heavy cost in the loss of life, civilian and Army and almost total destruction of these countries.</P>
    <P>However heroic our defence may be, it must only be a question of hours, or days, at the outside, as to how long we could repel an invading army, armed with the atomic weapons of this age.  I believe we should train an Army which would be capable in time of invasion of expanding itself and taking under its individual sections recruits from the F.C.A. or other voluntary organisations.  That, I believe, will come in time of invasion in this country, as it came in other countries.  When France was overrun and defeated, she put up a more heroic fight than before with her underground movement, and I believe that a policy of guerilla warfare, a policy of non-co-operation by the people here, will be a bigger danger to any invader than any formal attempt at defence on the beaches or anywhere else.  An underground force, whether a uniformed force or a guerilla force, Britain found to its cost, could be a source of irritation and annoyance and trouble during the Tan War.  That could be increased 100-fold.  By disruptive <Col N="440" /> tactics, ambushes, the destruction of bridges and means of communication by men specially trained, such as the men in the engineering section, we could make it so costly on an invading force that any big power would not find it easy to hold or even to invade the country.  In that way we could tie down the troops and would automatically secure the support of the side opposing the invader, if that were of any use to us.  It would certainly come, whether we liked it or not.</P>
    <P>The training of a guerilla force or a force capable of being turned into a guerilla force, such as the F.C.A. is of the utmost importance.  The weapons that we purchase should be suitable for that purpose.  Training by the engineering section should tend towards carrying out that policy as a long term policy in case of invasion.</P>
    <P>The expense of adopting a defence policy on those lines would be minimal as compared with the present extraordinary amount of money that it is suggested we should spend on what are, at best, second-hand weapons even now.  We know that in this modern age weapons which are first-class to-day almost daily become obsolete and of very little use.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Lee Enfield rifle survived from the Boer War time until practically the other day.  It is a safe assumption that the modern rifle will remain in use for a similarly long period.  Certainly it is the most suitable type of weapon for us to adopt.  We should follow the line adopted by Switzerland, where every adult male is given a certain amount of training and is issued with a rifle and 40 rounds of ammunition per year. Switzerland can better afford to spend money on expensive weapons than we can, but Switzerland has succeeded in maintaining neutrality during two major world wars and I venture to suggest that we could follow the line adopted by Switzerland of depending for our defence in time of need on the civilian population.</P>
    <P>Whatever the pros and cons may be on the question of the best defence policy, I feel that there is a great deal in Deputy Hickey's suggestion.  Instead of arming and implying by the mere <Col N="441" /> fact of arming that we are prepared to fight, this country should adopt the line that this is a Christian country, a country that believes in the inherent good in all people and in all nations. As I said on the Budget, we should make a virtue of our poverty and let it be known that we, as a country, are not going to fight, that we are a peace-loving people, that we are prepared to join with any country in the world who will join with us in disarmament.  We should say that we are sent to this world to live a life of Christian charity and peace with all people.  By our example we should endeavour to win over even the big nations to rake that view.  That policy may not be very practicable; it shows very little signs of reward, but there is always somebody who has to do it.  We have very little to lose by it and we have a whole lot to gain if we could succeed in giving an example to the world.  If Ireland adopted that role, she could make a much more important place for herself in the world than by building up an Army at enormous cost and which would show an awful cost if we were invaded and if we were to make our defence on the lines on which we are preparing to make it.</P>
    <P>On the economic side of the matter I feel that this country cannot afford to have a proper defence and, if we cannot have a proper defence, we should take the other line.  That is a personal view.</P>
    <P>I wish to put before the Minister some complaints I received as a Deputy in my constituency, in the hope that the Minister will take note of them as individual cases or as typical cases.</P>
    <P>There is a case, in my town, of a young soldier who joined in 1924.  He served until he was released on to the First Line Reserve.  He worked from the time he left the Army until 1939, when he was called up.  During the 1940-1941 manoeuvres, which included crossing the Blackwater, he received severe wettings.  He was discharged in 1942, having been attended by the military doctor, at least twice, in hospital. A year or two later he was found to have T.B.  It is pretty evident that he contracted T.B. during Army <Col N="442" /> service because he had been medically examined on going into the Army in 1939 and in the years he was on the Reserve he had attended for a month's or fortnight's training and was examined each time and was passed as O.K. on all those occasions.  When he was discharged from the Army he was discharged unfit but not with T.B. Within a year of his discharge he showed signs of T.B. and is now a definite T.B. case.  He has not received a disability pension.  The matter is under discussion and no definite ruling has been made against him but a long period has elapsed since the time he was discharged.  He is a married man with a wife and children and has to survive as best he can on home assistance or something.  That is not encouraging to other people to join the Defence Forces.  I feel that a little more should be done in such cases to expedite decisions.</P>
    <P>I received a complaint from certain soldiers some time ago that at various times in the year soldiers in the battalion found that there were outstanding debts against them and that their pay for the week was withheld because of that.  When they wrote away, as they were entitled to do, for a statement of account of the arrears that were supposed to be against them and which were being held, they received a reply within a week or two that the matter had been rectified.</P>
    <P>It was suggested to me that that matter was straightened up within that time and that some other battalion somewhere else in the country was shown to be in arrear.  That suggestion was that there is a floating amount of money that is not completely accounted for and that it was dealt with in this way to keep the matter from attracting full attention. Whether that is the reason or not, I am quite positive of the fact that on a number of occasions, whole battalions' money has been shown against a number of soldiers for which it was later proved they were not liable. That matter requires investigation.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience of the matter about which I am now going to complain.  As a trade union official <Col N="443" /> I have had on occasions to go to Griffith Barracks, where the Labour Court is situated.  While awaiting decisions I happened to look out on to the barrack square.  It is no credit to us.  Of all the dirty looking things, with hundreds of men standing all around, that barrack square needs to be seen to be believed.  If some of the English papers published these things we would cry out in horror and say that it is not possible.  Only three or four months ago, when we were preparing for the Tóstal, I saw soldiers drilling there while all around, under the very window, was overgrown with grass, there were rusty cans, pieces of motor tyres, anything and everything, newspapers.  I certainly think that some attention should be paid to that matter.  I do not know of any others that are in that condition but if all our barracks are like that we certainly have a good deal to learn in the matter of tidying up.  There is plenty of room for improvement.</P>
    <P>There is the case of a civilian employed in the barracks in Clonmel, a carpenter.  When his time came to retire he applied for an extension. This man was a 1916 veteran and he understood that British war veterans under the old Board of Works were entitled to an extension.  He applied on these grounds and got an extension, but the extension meant that he was to continue in employment, not in his normal trade as a carpenter, but as a labourer.  Certainly that does not seem a fair and just reward for long and faithful service to the Board of Works and for his 1916 record.  Surely if he is physically fit and capable of doing labouring work, he is equally physically fit to carry out the work of his normal trade.  I have made representations to the Minister's Department that the concession should be given to him to carry out his normal work.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with other Deputies that the answers to questions by Deputy MacBride last March indicate that there is a serious falling off in the First Line Reserve and in the Second Line Reserve.  I was not impressed by Deputy V. de Valera's explanation as to why the numbers in the <Col N="444" /> First Line Reserve are so short.  His suggestion is that that is due to the policy of the inter-Party Government. There is not so much of a difference between the numbers during the time of the inter-Party Government and the present time.  I suggest that the reason for the falling off in the First Line Reserve and the F.C.A. is not that people have not gone into the Army, but that there is not work for the ordinary person in the country and that emigration is taking its toll.  If, instead of spending £1,800,000 on the most modern defence weapons, we spent that money in developing the economic life of the country, we would give work and employment to the people and there would be plenty of people to fill up the First Line Reserve and the Second Line Reserve and we would have the nucleus of a guerilla force if we ever had the misfortune to be in danger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note that Deputy O'Higgins, who, I suppose, is one of the older and more responsible members of the Opposition, expressed his substantial agreement with the policy of the Minister in regard to Army strength and Army equipment. For some time there has been a campaign carried on throughout the country denouncing the Minister and the Government for spending public money on the purchase of defensive equipment.  It has been represented by some members of the Opposition, and even some Ministers of the former Government, that this is an utterly irresponsible policy on the part of the Government and one which would not be operated by their predecessors. There has been during the past year, and there is contemplated in the coming year, a substantial provision for the purchase of defensive equipment. That policy has been denounced very fiercely by some members of the Opposition. But Deputy O'Higgins has blown the whole case sky high by asserting that he was as anxious to secure equipment for the Army as the present Minister and was only precluded from doing so by the impossibility of purchasing that equipment. He stated to-day that if he could have purchased the warlike stores which the <Col N="445" /> present Minister has purchased he would certainly have purchased them. That seems to indicate that there is not a wide divergence of opinion between the more responsible elements in the Opposition and the present Government.</P>
      <P>But another member of the former Government, Deputy Everett, who is a man also of military experience, went down to Arklow and stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Why were they suffering from taxation?  They had an Army costing £7,000,000 a year and £2,667,000 for warlike stores that, when they were finished with, would be obsolete with the atom.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That appears to show a wide divergence of opinion between the generals of the Opposition Party. Apparently, Deputy Everett wants to disarm the Army completely or, in all probability, to dissolve the Army.  On the other hand, Deputy O'Higgins, who still retains the old sense of responsibility and the old national outlook, which I think is also held by Deputy MacEoin, believes in maintaining the efficiency of the Army and in equipping it properly.  But there is not so much divergence of opinion between those who think seriously about defence problems on both sides of the House.  That was also brought home to us by an exchange of views between Deputy Hickey and Deputy Major de Valera in which both expressed the view that what they wanted was a small efficient Army, capable of expansion.  Deputy de Valera made it clear that the policy of the present Government is a small efficient Army capable of expansion and that <Col N="446" /> the present Regular Army strength is the smallest that would be effective for the purpose of expansion on mobilisation in the case of an emergency.  Thus we find that if we leave out the people opportunists and leave out the people who are merely indulging in moboratory and trying to appeal to people who are more ignorant than themselves &mdash;if it is possible to find such people&mdash; we have on both sides of the House acceptance of the fact that the present Army strength is something in or about the minimum that could be considered as efficient and that on that comparatively small efficient Regular Army, it is the hope of the Government and I think it would be the hope of the responsible members of Fine Gael also, that that Army could be expanded in time of emergency to deal with the situation that would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies&mdash;I think some of them were speaking with sincerity &mdash;expressed the view that it is utterly futile to think of defending this island at all, that the most we could hope for is a peace-time Army.  I do not know what is meant by a peace-time Army. If you want only a peace-time Army you want no Army at all.  It will be accepted that those who have expressed that view are utterly defeatist in their attitude.  There was a comparison with the situation that prevailed in Holland and Denmark in 1940.  It must be remembered, however, that there was no natural barrier to protect those countries against invasion.  In the dry summer of 1940 the land armies of Germany could roll across the frontier at the highest possible speed, overrun and cripple those countries in a very short space of time.  The Deputies who referred to that situation did not advert to the position in the island of Great Britain, which was also threatened with attack and which also had a very inadequate Army; nevertheless, by mobilising whatever forces they had, by putting up the best possible show they could, they succeeded in averting an invasion.  There is no doubt whatever that the display of resistance on the part of the British on land, combined with the resistance of the air force and navy, was instrumental in <Col N="447" /> saving Great Britain from invasion. If we were to adopt the line of some Deputies and say that if we could disband the Army completely, divest ourselves of all equipment and all defensive protection, it would be just as well, but if we did we might very easily be inviting an invasion of this country in time of war.  I do not think that is the thing which those Deputies would really hope for or desire.  A completely undefended Twenty-Six Counties without any semblance of a military force would certainly offer some invitation to a continental army if it wanted to establish a base for attack on, say, Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The argument that has been used&mdash; it was used by Deputy Dillon last year, by Deputy Kyne to-day and by other Deputies&mdash;that we could, instead of contemplating a defensive force which would strike at any invading army, whether by sea or air, organise guerilla warfare over a long period. I do not think that in modern world conditions such a proposal could be really entertained.  If, for example, a force required a foothold in Ireland for military purposes, they would not desire or require to occupy the entire country.  For that reason they would not be worried whether we contemplated a long guerrilla warfare against them in the future.  What they would be concerned about in contemplating an invasion of this country would be how much resistance they would be likely to meet within the first few days of their invasion.  That would be their primary consideration.  What would happen in months or years to come would not be so important to them. They would probably only require certain strategic positions in order to continue their war against Great Britain or other powers.  Therefore, when you consider this question from that angle&mdash;and I suppose we must as ordinary laymen, recognise that it has been considered by our Army experts &mdash;we are forced to believe that the present forces for defence are the only possible ones, that is to say, an Army sufficiently strong to be capable of offering some resistance to a sudden attack and at the same time providing <Col N="448" /> the basis for expansion and for the raising of a large voluntary Army.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy MacBride or Deputy Rooney or any of those other Deputies who advocate compulsory military service.  I do not think it is either necessary or desirable. There are many good arguments that could be put forward in favour of compulsory military service on the grounds that in it there is equality of sacrifice and that in the main it is fairer to all sections of the community. At the same time it carries with it evils which, I think, we would all like to avoid.  Compulsory military service is, I would say, a step towards the complete subordination of the entire population to the State.  We want, as long as we can, to preserve the individual independence of our people and for that reason as long as there is a reasonable prospect of securing sufficient recruits for our Defence Forces of all kinds, we should not consider this proposal for compulsory military training.</P>
    <P>What we should consider instead is the encouragement of our young people to join the F.C.A. if it is not feasible for them to join the Regular Army. There is no need for an investigation as to the reasons why there is a certain reluctance on the part of a great many young men to enter the F.C.A.  That matter requires to be carefully examined to find out what are those causes&mdash;are they social, psychological or what are they?  &mdash;that keep a large number of our young men from joining these forces.  I would be inclined to feel that one step in the direction of making the F.C.A. more popular would be to provide its members with a more attractive uniform.  Young men as a rule like to present an impressive appearance.  The uniform of the F.C.A. is purely utilitarian and, while it may be suitable for military service, it is not attractive to young men for dress parades.  After all, young men who give their time to training in the nation's interests are entitled to expect that they will be turned out in a uniform that looks well and is pleasing to the eye.  I think that is only natural and it would be no harm to cater for the ordinary pride and respect of these young men.  A purely utilitarian uniform <Col N="449" /> is all right from the point of view of service but it does enter to a certain extent into the thoughts and feelings of young men to make an impressive display when they turn out on parade.  For that reason, a more pleasing uniform should be provided.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will give careful attention to the many complaints which have been made in regard to the grievances of disabled men and those who are entitled to some assistance because of past military service. The case on behalf of these men has been ably stated by a number of Deputies. I do not want to repeat it but, at any rate, I think it is desirable that it should be known, no matter what some people may say about the financial stringency of the present time, that we should not under any circumstances be ungenerous or unjust to men who have served the country faithfully in the past in our Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>On the question of military service pensions, I want to ask the Minister who is responsible for sending out the recent notices to many former rejected applicants for military service pensions stating that the 1949 Act does not apply to them. I think these notices are sent out in the Minister's name to applicants who had applied for a re-hearing.  They have been notified in the Minister's name, not in the name of the Referee or of the board, that the Act does not apply to them, in other words, that they had not qualified for a re-hearing before the board.  These notices have caused quite a lot of annoyance and keen resentment in many areas to my own knowledge.  These men felt that they were at least entitled to a re-hearing because they are of a type who took part in volunteer activities, who perhaps suffered losses and in some cases actually took part in what could be described at least as minor engagements. Quite a few of them have told me that they believed the whole system of military service pensions is wrong.  They assured me that when they were doing their bit they never anticipated a pension; all that they anticipated was a yard of rope or a few leaden bullets but now that a <Col N="450" /> system of military service pensions has been established, they feel that they have been badly treated in having their applications for re-hearing dismissed in such summary fashion, as has happened.  They resent that.</P>
      <P>The people on whose behalf I speak are of a type who would not mind if their cases were re-heard and then rejected by the board but they feel that they have been rejected by the Minister.  They have been notified to that effect and they feel that the Minister has not that authority under the 1949 Act.  I do not know what the explanation is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember taking a keen interest in the matter myself when the 1949 Act was under Government discussion, before the terms of it were released to the public or to the Dáil, and I know that the spirit of the Act was that all rejected applicants would get a re-hearing before the board.  It appears that inside the last six months, since January or February last, that quite a number have been notified by the Minister that they did not qualify for a re-hearing.  They feel that the Minister stood between them and the board and prevented them from having their cases re-heard.  Let me say that in my own opinion quite a number of men may have failed in the matter of securing verification from a verifying officer.  They may have failed in that matter but to my own personal knowledge&mdash;and I think it applies to every district and to every rural centre which had its own company of volunteers&mdash;the officers of that company were well known and are well known to-day.  The part they played is well known.  We find that the officers of some of these companies have themselves been turned down although we know that they had been pulled out of their houses by the Black and Tans and British military of the day.  We know that they had been compelled to give up their means of livelihood, whether it was farming, business or some other avocation, and that they had suffered great losses.  We know that they missed being shot or executed in many cases by a mere &ldquo;fluke.&rdquo;  I think it is not fair that these people should have been deprived of a chance of putting their <Col N="451" /> case before an impartial board as was the spirit of the 1949 Act.  I should like to hear what the Minister has to say on the subject when he is replying because they feel, and I feel, that they have not been treated as they should.</P>
    <P>There were certain people who took a very active part in the volunteer movement without whose assistance and active co-operation, without whose eyes, ears and information, without whose active help, the flying columns could never have existed or brought off so many successful engagements.  These people incurred just as much danger as the actual members of flying columns all over the country.  The Black and Tans, the R.I.C., and the British military knew the names of these volunteer officers very well and it was by chance, more than anything else that they escaped with their lives.  In many cases their houses were broken into by the British forces and money, goods and valuables of many kinds were taken. To my own personal knowledge they suffered losses for which they never were compensated.  Young men who were in the volunteers were forced by the attentions of the British forces to stay away from their business, although their parents were old and disabled in many instances.  Their businesses went to loss for a period of perhaps two and a half to three years. These people feel very keenly, and I sympathise with them, the fact that their application has been turned down rather flippantly by the Minister.  They resent the fact that the Minister is standing between them and a re-hearing. I want to make it perfectly clear that these people on whose behalf I am speaking are not the type who cry and whinge for a pension.  They have made it abundantly clear to me that they believe the system is wrong. It is not my own opinion I am giving now.  I am stating what I have been told by these men who played an active part and suffered loss.  In some cases their health was impaired.  What they did they did out of patriotism, they never anticipated a pension or reward. They are not now asking for something for nothing.  The system has been established. Many of their former comrades <Col N="452" /> are getting pensions and they feel they are equally entitled to a pension.</P>
    <P>I know one case in particular.  I have mentioned this case before on the Minister's Estimate and on the Pensions Bill.  This man has letters in his possession showing that he was ordered out of his native town by the District Inspector.  His motor-car was taken from him.  Yet, his application has been turned down.  I know myself that he took a dangerous part in a raid on British military stores at a railway junction not far from my place.  His van was used on that occasion.  He was subsequently ordered out of the town by the District Inspector.  He continued to play an active part.  The evidence in his favour has been rejected and I do not blame him now for having a suspicion that the Military Service Pensions Acts have not been as fairly and impartially administered as we were given to understand they would be.  Some of the documents proving his claim are over 30 years old.  Everybody in his native town knows the part he played.  They know his claim is genuine.  He possibly is not in a position to submit documentary evidence on all aspects of his claim.  Some of his former colleagues may not be available to give evidence on his behalf but he feels he has been the victim of politics in the administration of the Pensions Code.</P>
    <P>There is another case, too, in which the applicant has been turned down. These rejections have brought the Acts into disrepute.  Many people feel they have not been justly and impartially administered.  I am sure the Minister must be well aware of the criticism. I have no experience of the administration of these Acts myself but I know the individuals affected in the present instance and I cannot find it in my heart to disbelieve the information they have given me.  I think these people should get a re-hearing.  There are not many of the old forces with us now.  The numbers are lessening each year.  Every day that passes death is taking its toll and the numbers are getting fewer and fewer with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>I make a special plea for those who <Col N="453" /> supported the flying columns.  Without them these columns could not have existed or successfully achieved their objectives.  The relatives and friends of all these people walked in constant danger.  We should devise some means now of acknowledging the part played by them in freeing our country.  Many of these would be satisfied with a re-hearing. If they were told definitely then that the Act does not apply they would be content.  I ask the Minister to consider the matter and, if anything is done along the lines I have suggested, I am sure it will meet with the wholehearted approval of the House.  No one would be so mean or so niggardly as to deny these people whatever this House in its wisdom might decide to give them.</P>

      <P>I do not deny I am against the propaganda being disseminated by the Fianna Fáil Party that we are in an emergency.  We always seem to be in an emergency according to Fianna Fáil and for that reason we must maintain a big Army. If we were in a real emergency I am satisfied that our Army would not be sufficient to cope with it.  I wonder at Deputy Cogan advocating the expenditure of such a huge sum on warlike stores and quoting speeches.  I would prefer him to quote some of the resolutions being passed at some of the meetings as regards his actions. The money we are spending at the present time on defence would be better spent on developing the land. We have 300 fewer men employed on the land this year than last year.  It would be better if the money were spent in that way rather than advocate that every man with a valuation of over £25 should pay the full rate on his holding.</P>

      <P>I agree that we can develop the F.C.A.  I believe it deserves every encouragement that public representatives can give it.  It deserves the congratulations of every member of this House.  The young men of the F.C.A. voluntarily sacrifice their time at great inconvenience to themselves. I see them in my own area, officers and men, working together in a voluntary capacity for the benefit of <Col N="455" /> the country.  I would like to see the F.C.A. developed and encouraged in many ways.  I would like to see the people who give their service in the Army and the F.C.A. get the first preference in regard to any position that might be vacant.  Instead of making promises to them, we should make it compulsory on public boards and others to give them first preference providing everything else is equal.  In that way, we could encourage a voluntary Army.</P>
      <P>If there is going to be a fight we will have capable men in the Army and in the F.C.A. together with other voluntary forces.  We have men even going to the North to recruit people and bring them to this part of the country. We have economic conscription at the present time and we are forcing people, who are unable to emigrate, into the Army.  I would prefer to keep our men employed in the industries in this country and develop the F.C.A. from the men working in the factories. We ought not to have the huge army of unemployed that we have at the present time.  We have a man from Wicklow getting up and talking about everybody else and now he is a fully fledged defender of the Government.  I hope that during the week he will make some of the speeches made by some of his colleagues and go the whole hog.</P>

These are the only two conditions necessary when an increase is granted: (1) that the county manager recommends it, and (2) that there is provision made in the estimates to pay it.  Both these conditions have been fulfilled.  I do not know what other conditions the Minister wants fulfilled. Anyway, the situation is that these people are being paid an appallingly low wage and that the matter has been with the Department for quite a considerable time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1, which stands in my name and those of Deputy Corish and Deputy Kyne:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1), lines 23 and 24.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to ensure that local elections will be held this year, whatever we may do about holding local elections at longer intervals on future occasions.  We stated our position in regard to this matter on the Second Reading of this Bill. We took the view then and still hold the view that local elections due to be held in 1953 should take place and that that ought not affect consideration of the proposal that future local elections should be held every five years.  I do not know why the Minister adopts the attitude that because he wants elections to be held every five years in the future he must now postpone the elections which are due to be held this year for a further two years.  I see nothing wrong with the idea of holding the 1953 elections which are due to take place this year and then approaching consideration of the problem of extending the period in respect of future elections.  We are not unwilling to look favourably on the proposal to extend the period of the holding of local elections from three years to five years but the fact that we agree to that in regard to the future is no argument for not holding the local elections which are due to take place this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Second Reading, I see no valid reason why we should not hold the local elections this year.  I <Col N="468" /> am convinced that the reason for not holding them is that the Government's political chances are receding daily, notwithstanding the brave face which the Minister for Local Government puts on the gloomy situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's brave efforts to put a face on the Government's receding political future, I am convinced that that is the reason why the Government do not want to hold local elections this year. The Government does not want elections this year&mdash;either local elections or, judging by the way they are holding on to office, Dáil elections.  It was quite an achievement to get them to move the writ for the Wicklow bye-election. The same hesitancy is displayed here in their desire to postpone the local elections.  The Government knows what is coming to it in local or Dáil elections.  However, the fact that the Government is not popular with the electorate is no reason for a postponement: it is an extra reason why the electorate should have an opportunity of expressing their views on the Government's handling of local and national affairs.  We see no reason why the elections due to take place this year should not take place, and then the electorate would know that those elected would hold office for five years.  No real case has been made for not holding them this year.  This amendment is designed to ensure that the normal right of the electorate to elect local authorities this year will be recognised, by the holding of the elections at the time when they are due to take place.</P>

      <P>When the Minister was replying the other day to the Second Reading debate, he suggested that most&mdash;he did not say all&mdash;of the objections came from people who are not members of local authorities.  If he looks into the matter further, he will find that the greatest objection comes from those who are members. During the Second Reading debate my colleague in the county, Deputy Harris, was here in the House.  I indicated to the Minister then that a substantial body of ratepayers' organisations <Col N="469" /> there had made it quite clear through the columns of the local paper that they wished to have an election this year.  They wished, as far as I could gather, to get rid of Deputy Harris and myself and, so that they could not be accused of being in any way political, they also wished to get rid of Deputy Norton's principal representative in the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite an ambitious programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Perfectly understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a programme which they are perfectly entitled to put forward.  They are entitled to an opportunity to change the council in Kildare.  I understand that the same position obtains in other counties. There can be no case at all for introducing this legislation just now&mdash;no case but a political one.</P>
      <P>We had a long dissertation from Deputy Briscoe, who purported to quote remarks made to him by various people.  It was a speech which appeared to me to be a breach of confidence from beginning to end, for no matter what one may say to anybody about repeating a private conversation it still remains, in my view, a breach of confidence to repeat it.  All that discussion, however, was on the question of a five-year term or a three-year term.  This amendment cuts the issue clearly away from that point. These amendments would defeat the purpose of the Bill.  The first principle underlying the Bill is that there should be no election this year.  That is the purpose about which the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party are really concerned.  Having achieved that, there is a second principle.  They felt that the only way in which they could cloak the purpose here would be to introduce a five-year term as the excuse for getting out of the 1953 election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ratepayers' organisations throughout the country say they want an opportunity to put representatives on local authorities.  Whether they are going to succeed in what has been described <Col N="470" /> as their &ldquo;ambitious programme&rdquo; or whether they are not is entirely irrelevant.  They are entitled to the ordinary democratic right to choose candidates and put them forward so that the people may have an opportunity of saying whether or not they want to support the candidates in question or whether they believe that the existing council should be reelected. The people have the right to know that the candidates they elect will come before them again for endorsement or otherwise at the end of the time for which they were elected. It is nonsense for the Minister to say, as he did in his concluding speech on the Second Reading, that when the people elected those representatives in 1950 they knew they were electing them, not for three years but for a longer term.  The people knew nothing of the sort.  The law was quite clear then that it was for a three-year term they were going before the people.</P>
    <P>There have been substantial changes in the three years since 1950, substantial changes in the manner of running local authorities, substantial changes in the ways in which local authorities receive their money I do not want, and I know I would not properly be allowed, to go into the question of health on this Bill, but it is an undoubted fact that any new health legislation that may be enacted this year will impose a very different type of responsibility on the members of the local authority.  Surely it is right and proper that the people would be given an opportunity of expressing their opinion on that and of expressing their opinion on the type of expenditure that they wish their representatives on the local authority to incur.  The Minister and I had some discussion a few minutes ago about expenditure that a local authority was being forced to incur. The people would be entitled to give a verdict on that also in a particular area if it affected the issue.</P>
    <P>We were told yesterday at the meeting of the Kildare County Council of a new basis on which the agricultural grant is to be allowed to our county and, I presume, to all counties.  We were informed by our officials that, as a result, £29,000 less will come in <Col N="471" /> agricultural grants to the Kildare County Council this year.  These things change the methods of working of a local authority and therefore it is right and proper that the people should be given an opportunity of expressing their views.  That is what this amendment asks.  It does not suggest that the five-year term should not be introduced after that.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why it would be desirable to do this.  Many members of local authorities are over-burdened, as they have to deal with many tasks at meetings of subsidiary committees. A much better method could very easily be found which would enable them to give more time to their local authority matters and by which they would need to spend less time on subsidiary matters.  We know perfectly well that the whole purpose of this Bill, even though the Minister was honest enough to admit that he put a very good face on it, is to enable the Fianna Fáil Party to avoid having to go to the country.  The Minister is a good hand at putting a good face on a bad case, but even so, when you analyse his reasons, they can be blown sky-high. Fianna Fáil want to avoid general elections and local elections and there is no use in anyone telling the country that there is any other reason for this Bill.  That is the primary reason for it and that is the reason why, for example, Deputy O'Reilly from the country and Deputy Gallagher from the city intend to support it.</P>

      <P>We heard a good deal from the opposite side about the fear of local elections.  We have 45 members in the Dublin Corporation and in recent years there has been very little change in the state of the various Parties there.  If there were a local election to-morrow or in a month's time, the same thing would happen and there would be no great satisfaction to the Fine Gael people or anybody else.</P>

      <P>If we were to bow to this propaganda by the Fine Gael <Col N="472" /> people and allow them to have local elections, it would cost the State approximately £80,000, and is it worth it to spend that sum of money merely to satisfy this Fine Gael whim?  It is quite a considerable sum of money, and, as a member of Dublin Corporation, I can say that we could build quite a lot of houses with £80,000.  That is an idea we should not lose sight of.</P>

      <P>So far as Fine Gael and other people supporting them are concerned, this is simply a little propaganda stunt and it would be a very expensive idea to spend £80,000 on satisfying this propaganda of theirs.  I know that there is no great demand, so far as Dublin is concerned, for local elections.  The people do not want them.  It is not my desire to disclose private conversations, but it is generally agreed amongst members of the Dublin Corporation that five years is the proper term of office and the majority of them so far as I know are quite satisfied that it should be a term of five years from now, but I suppose they are tied by the Party Whip and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is well known in the Dublin Corporation&mdash;and the Fine Gael group are satisfied&mdash;that there is no need for this great call for local elections.  I had no intention of intervening in this debate and would not have done so, were it not for the fact that I was honoured by Deputy Sweetman saying that I propose to speak.  My main point is that elections would cost the people approximately £80,000 and I do not think such an expenditure wise because it would achieve no great purpose.  There were local elections in Great Britain and <Col N="473" /> there was a swing against the Government, but, in a parliamentary by-election, the Government won the seat with a big majority.</P>

      <P>I feel that in Dublin there is no great call for local elections, especially among members of the corporation, but even outside them the people themselves do not want them because they know they cost a great deal of money and will not give any idea of what would happen in a general election.  I do not think Deputies opposite should be so cocky, <Col N="474" /> anyway, because if there were an election they might not do as well as they hope.  If there were an election, whether local or general, to-morrow I should not be in the least afraid of going before the public on the record of my work in the corporation and elsewhere, and I can say the same for the other Fianna Fáil members of the corporation.  It would certainly be a very expensive plan to bow to this Fine Gael propaganda stunt and spend £80,000 on local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say quite frankly that, whether the Dublin Corporation is for or against this Bill, I am against it.  I do not care whether what has been alleged here is true or not.  Even if it were true, that not merely were Fianna Fáil members of the corporation in favour of the Bill but that some or all of the Fine Gael members were in favour of it, it would not make it right.  On the question of the cost of £80,000, I could see the Minister making as good a case for the extension of the life of this Parliament from five to seven years by the introduction of a Bill next week on the ground of the cost to the country of a general election.  May I suggest to the Deputy that the voters outside, whether we are concerned with elections to local authorities or to the Dáil, might be of opinion that, even if it cost £80,000, they might save a sum far in excess of that by making a change?</P>
      <P>Three years ago, the voters of this country gave a three years' lease to certain people who offered themselves for election to local authorities, whether the Dublin Corporation or any local authority in the country, and a major change such as is contemplated in this Bill should not be made until the people have had an opportunity of expressing their view on it. We are not arguing here, by the way, whether the term of office of a local authority should be five or three years. I think it is admitted, generally speaking, that the five-year period is the better period.  What we are arguing here is that the period should not be extended or the contract amended until such time as the matter is put formally before the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> All we say is&mdash;and I think it is reasonable&mdash;that the present contract should run to the end of its legitimate life, which is three years, that the contract which the members of the present local authorities entered into with the voters three years ago should not be amended by us or by the people who are members of local authorities and that the next election should be fought this year and should be fought with people being informed that it was intended for the future that the period should be a period of five years.  I do not see anything objectionable in that and I do not see anything in it to which any reasonable person can object.  There is nothing at all in what the Minister says that the people who have spoken against the Bill are, in the main, people who are not members of local authorities.  There is nothing surprising in that&mdash;it would be surprising if it were any other way. I have not got a shadow of doubt that the majority of the members of local authorities throughout the country do not want to fight an election this year &mdash;they would prefer to get an extension of two years.  There is nothing wrong in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It has happened before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as there was any question of it, the circumstances were entirely different from the circumstances of the moment, and the Deputy knows that.  We know quite well that there is only one reason for it.  If the Government Party thought they had the confidence of the people and could hold or improve their position in the local authorities, there would be no question at all of this Bill.  The elections would be held this year.  It is because the Government, rightly or wrongly&mdash;I believe, rightly&mdash; fear that not merely would they not improve their position but would not hold their present position that they want to have this Bill put through. There has been no demand whatever from outside for this Bill.  None of the ordinary voters, none of the citizens outside, so far as I know, either individually or through their various organisations, <Col N="476" /> has asked for this Bill.  So far as we know, the only persons who are in favour of this Bill and who want it are the Government and certain members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I want to put it again to the House that the case which is made here for this Bill, such as it is, could be made with much greater force for an extension of the Dáil period of five years to seven years.  That would be highly objectionable, very objectionable and, certainly, if it were to be done at all should not be done in the middle of a parliamentary life.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that there is no case for this Bill.  There is no case for postponing the elections to 1955.  The Minister made no case for it.  He did his best but it was, I think, impossible to make a convincing case in this House or outside it for the Bill.</P>
      <P>I venture to suggest, again to Deputy Gallagher, that it is not a convincing argument to talk about the cost of it.  If you were to go on that basis, then the fewer elections we held, either for the Dáil or local authorities, the better.  It does not follow.  Neither does it follow that because the elections would cost £80,000 the ratepayers, the voters, might not consider that that was £80,000 well spent to give them an opportunity of expressing their view and making whatever changes they thought were necessary to be made in the personnel of local authorities.  It seems to me, Sir, that there is no case whatever for postponing the elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding any claims that speakers on the Government side may make that there is no feeling in the country in favour of holding elections this year, I claim, in company with many other Deputies, that there is considerable support in the country for their being held, because the voters feel that many matters have arisen in the course of the past few years which make it imperative that they should be held. In the view of those interested in everything that is done in the county councils and subsidiary bodies it is desirable, in view of many developments, that the elections should be held.  Many of those elected to the <Col N="477" /> present councils did not envisage the developments which have taken place and neither did the people who elected them.  Since the last elections were held people have come into public life who desire to become even more active and to take their place in local authorities.  If the present Bill is passed these people will be denied that right for another two years.</P>
      <P>The Party at present in office were at one time very keen on giving the vote in respect of local elections to persons at 21 years of age.  If there is an extension of the time now, some persons will be 26 years of age before they will have a chance of recording their vote at local elections.</P>
      <P>One of the major problems which affect rural areas and many urban areas as well is the considerable reduction which has been effected in the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In that respect it is necessary that by their votes at these elections people would register their protest at such reductions.  At present the local authorities are very concerned about the number of unemployed in their areas.  In the Cork County Council, for instance, an allocation of £150,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whittling down of these grants has had the result that these people desire to voice their opinions.  No doubt, when the local elections would take place matters such as the Local Authorities (Works) Act would be in the forefront of the people's minds and it would be an issue.  In face of the fact that in our county the grant has been considerably reduced&mdash;to £49,000 for 1952-53 and, this year, to 50 per cent. of that figure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The people of that county and every other county affected desire to record their dissatisfaction, just as I am endeavouring to <Col N="478" /> do it now.  By a postponement of the elections they would be denied that opportunity.</P>
      <P>As I stated on Second Reading, there may be agreement as to the extension of the three year period to a five year period but that should be done after the elections are held this year.  As Deputy Morrissey and others have stated, the argument as to the cost does not enter into the picture.  That argument could be related far more effectively to the life span of the Dáil. I want to emphasise that far from agreement being reached among the members of any corporation or council, urban or county, the opinion of the electors who, to my mind are the people whose opinion should be taken into account, is that they should be given their rights by being afforded an opportunity of going to the polls and electing their local councils this year and then, perhaps, agreement could be reached that the period should be lengthened in future.  In adopting that attitude we on this side, with the Labour people, are adopting a very reasonable one.</P>

      <P>As I see this Bill it is only reviving the proposals made in 1946 or 1947, which passed through this House and also through the Seanad but which were rendered void by amendments and were not followed up by the inter-Party Government that came into power subsequently.  That is the history of the proposals.  So that this Bill is merely to implement what had the sanction of the Dáil at that period.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, there are various changes being made at the present time by the extension of borough boundaries in Dublin and in Cork and, I think, in Limerick which affect not only the borough areas but also the county areas and thus make it impossible, until certain adjustments are made, to make the representation of those boroughs and counties effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a request made to the Minister both by the General Council of County Councils and by the municipal authorities to have the elections postponed.  Even though, in certain local authorities, various points of view have been expressed as to the <Col N="479" /> propriety or otherwise of holding the elections at the moment, in the two local authorities with which I am concerned, the members of all Parties unanimously wiped from the Book of Estimates the money which would be required to have the elections conducted in the present year.  They left only a token vote of £10 in each case, as would happen in a year in which no elections were anticipated.  They were unanimous in that.  It would mean that Supplementary Estimates would have to be passed if this Bill does not go through and elections have to be held.</P>

      <P>I am perfectly agreeable and you can talk as long as you like as far as I am concerned.  I thought I made my own position clear on this proposal in winding up the Second Reading discussion.  There are two questions involved.  One is that the life of existing local bodies should be <Col N="480" /> extended from three to five years and the other is that any future elections should take place at intervals of five years.  These amendments which we are now discussing seek to provide that the elections should be held this year but that in future the lifetime of local bodies should be as I originally proposed.  You can, of course, debate that matter backwards and forwards for hours.  You can, of course, for any purpose which you wish to serve, make any allegations that you wish which are consistent with order.</P>
      <P>I am not putting forward as my main plea the question of the cost.  Neither am I putting forward a plea that it is contemplated to introduce other measures as, for example, Deputy Mulcahy when Minister for Local Government did.  In 1931, when introducing a measure of the type I am now sponsoring, he gave the House an assurance that it was his intention to amend the whole system of local government. I take it he had in mind the extension of the managerial system.</P>
      <P>As I indicated when concluding the debate on the Second Reading, if I liked I could have seized upon my intention to introduce certain other proposals in regard to local administration, the responsibilities of local councils, the responsibility of managers and so on.  But I did not think that I should take that course because I believe, and I have not come to that conclusion only since I came into the Department of Local Government, that the lifetime of local bodies should be five years.  I have always held that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am here for the purpose of giving effect to what is provided for in this Bill; that is, to extend the life of existing local bodies from three to five years and to provide that elections will be held in future at intervals of five years.  No amount of argument, no amount of special pleading for any purpose which Deputies may have in mind, will in the least shake me in that.  You can say that £80,000 does not matter. You can say that it is not what the Dublin Corporation think or what the representatives of the municipal bodies think.  You can say that these are people who, having been elected as <Col N="481" /> members of local bodies, do not want the trouble of facing an election.  You may say that the ratepayers' organisations would like to have elections take place.</P>
    <P>I believe that I have as close contact with the minds of the people as any of my predecessors have.  For example, when the elections which should have taken place in 1923 were postponed until 1925, who could not have said that it would have been all right to provide that a postponement should take place in the future but not in that year?  I surely have as much information as to the public view on the holding of an election for a period of three years as my predecessor who decided that the election which should have taken place in 1926 should be postponed until 1928.  In that year somebody could have put forward the point of view expressed here by some few Deputies whose contact with local bodies is very limited.  Somebody could have spoken along the same lines in 1926 as Deputies on the opposite side spoke this evening and when we were discussing the Second Reading of the Bill.  In 1931, Deputy Mulcahy introduced a measure proposing to extend the life of existing councils and the very same argument could have been advanced then as has been advanced here.  The same attempt could have been made to give the impression that the Fine Gael Party were mighty brave, that they were mad to face the electors.  You might get enough of elections if you are that fond of them.  You never know.</P>

      <P>There is no use in my making charges against somebody else and somebody else making charges against me, because we will not prove anything that way.  My reply to the charge of cowardice levelled against me is that I have always believed that the period of three years is an unreasonable period.  I have made it clear that for the last 31 or 32 years ten Bills on the same lines as this one, with the exception that I am proposing to extend in future the life of councils for a period of five years, were introduced by different Ministers <Col N="482" /> and by different Governments.  Of course you can always say for the purpose of argument: &ldquo;I agree with the principle of five years, but why not let us have the elections this year?&rdquo;  I can only say to those who give the matter a tilt in that way: &ldquo;Tilt away at it to your heart's content.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Local bodies are doing their best to discharge their responsibilities.  Local bodies are as satisfactory as they have ever been.  My contacts with them since I came into office are closer than they ever were before.  They are composed of men who are genuinely trying to serve their people and to get along with the work for which local bodies are responsible.  It is entirely unreasonable to suggest, even from the point of view of the ratepayers, or from the point of view of other sections of the community, that the mass of the people take a pride or a delight in continually having electoral battles of one kind or another. I think their judgment is entirely at fault.  I thought one of the principal charges that used to be levelled against this Government&mdash;as a matter of fact it was used against us in 1951 at the time of the formation of the Government&mdash;was that this Party was one that would plunge the country into an election at the first opportunity.  During the 16 years of our existence prior to 1948, that was one of the charges made against us, and that was the line of propaganda; and it was the line of propaganda that was used in this House in 1951 in order to frighten and to intimidate certain Deputies here who were thinking of supporting us. Now the charge is that we are a Party that does not want to face the electorate, that we are afraid to face the electorate, that we want to save ourselves and our positions, and so on. As far as I am concerned you are entirely welcome to all that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>You are entirely welcome to throw that argument around either in this House or outside it.  However, again I feel I am capable of interpreting <Col N="483" /> the public mind at least as well as any other Deputy in this House, that my sources of information are as wide as those of any other Deputy and, I would say, wider than those of a great many.  It is reasonable, if you like, for Deputies who are not members of local bodies to say: &ldquo;Of course, members of councils do not want elections. They do not want the trouble of them&rdquo;. Who would blame them after a period of three years?  They are not entitled to complete security but who will say&mdash; even taking men who are standing on political tickets or others who are induced to come forward to offer their services to the people and go through the turmoil of an election&mdash;that they should be forced out just when, as some Deputies have said, and rightly said, many of them are coming to know what local administration is like.</P>
      <P>I do not want to indulge in any special pleading.  I agree the cost is an important thing and it is something that should not be neglected in weighing the pros and cons.  I also agree that members are entitled, within reason, to express an opinion upon the way in which local public men discharge their responsibilities, and so on. Nevertheless I do say that arguments in favour of holding the elections now are surely no stronger than they were on any of the ten previous occasions when ten other Ministers introduced proposals such as I am introducing here and proposals that were equally desirable and defensible.</P>
      <P>There is no matter on which my mind could be so clear as it is on the wisdom of this proposal here.  Of course, there is nothing new you can say on it.  You can turn and twist it; you can attribute motives to me and to the Government. You can do all those things but you cannot change the fundamental fact that this is a sensible proposition that was made with the general approval of the people and it is because I have these beliefs and convictions I am standing firm on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been treated to an extraordinary series of statements by the Minister.  He tells us because his view has been of a certain <Col N="484" /> nature for so many years that that must be right of necessity.  Secondly, he tells us that because ten other Ministers extended the lives of local authorities it must be right now.  I know thoroughly well, no matter how valid the reasons were for postponing the previous elections, there were arguments used that had great weight with the people who were then occupying the Government Benches no matter who they were.  But when the Minister blandly tells us that no matter what the argument is and no matter what case may be made from benches other than those of the Government, he will not accept or will not even consider them, that brings us to the position where Parliament is no longer a deliberative assembly and we must bow to the wishes and the whims of the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>It was argued that there was no demand for the Bill but there is a positive demand for elections all over the country and I would be failing in my duty if I did not express in the House the views of my constituents. They are people who insist that because of the rising costs of local administration and what they argue is the failure to check expenditure, the local authorities should be changed now, or at least that they should get the opportunity of doing so.  When that challenge is made I do not think this Dáil has the right to refuse that demand and we are running counter to all democratic principles when we refuse to allow them to decide upon questions that they think should be decided.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Morrissey said and correctly said, and as I said myself on the Second Reading, whether the Dublin Corporation does or does not want it, or whether the Cork Corporation does or does not want it, does not arise.

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There was not normality then, so that there was a valid reason for postponing the local elections but, whether there was or was not, the people got an opportunity of expressing their views in 1923. Deputy MacCarthy tells us that the reason the local elections are of no importance is that not 40 per cent. of the electors exercise the franchise in local elections.  I am astounded to learn that any local election was ever decided on a 40 per cent. poll.  I do not <Col N="487" /> think that is correct because I know that in local elections all over the country, votes registered at the booths were as high as 90 per cent. of the electorate.  If only 40 per cent. turned out to vote, there must have been some others who turned up at the booths to vote for absent electors.  A much higher percentage of votes actually went into the ballot box.  I am strongly of opinion that the elections should be held this year when the ratepayers would know the period for which they were electing their representatives.  They voted on the last occasion knowing that their representatives would hold office for three years and, if the elections are held this year, they will be voting in the knowledge that in future their representatives will hold office for five years.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister or the Government would be reversing their policy in any way by saying: &ldquo;Very well, as it appears that there is not a unanimous view in the House in regard to the extension of the life of local authorities and having heard that all the Opposition Parties object to the postponement of these elections, we bow to their wishes, but for the future, after the coming elections, we shall have a five-year period.&rdquo;  The people will then know that the representatives they elect at the forthcoming elections will hold office for a five-year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would that not be a reasonable line to adopt?  Why make a Party issue of it?  Why make the question whether local government elections should be held this year or not a matter of confidence in the Government?  I think the Government would be doing a very good day's work by simply saying to the Opposition: &ldquo;Very well, when you do not agree to the postponement of the elections on this occasion we shall give way to you now, but after these elections, the new local authorities will have a life of five years.&rdquo;  I think that would be a reasonable view and it would be a gesture on the part of the Government to show that Parliament serves some useful purpose, and that when arguments are adduced and reasons put forward as to why a <Col N="488" /> certain course should be taken, the Government is mindful of the views of the elected representatives in this House, no matter on what side they sit.  The Government, by their attitude so far, apparently take the view that they, and they only, know what is right and that in no circumstances will they consider any proposition made by Labour, Fine Gael, Independents or anybody else in the House. They take the view, apparently, that they are the sole repositories of the wisdom of the nation.  I never heard such piffle in all my life.  It is sheer nonsense, and anybody who acts like that or gives the impression that he holds that view is not serving the country well.  I would, therefore, appeal even yet to the Minister, notwithstanding the fact that he may be convinced that a five-year period is the correct period, not to proceed with the proposal to postpone the elections but to allow the elections to be held this year and to provide that for the future members of local authorities shall hold office for five years.  In doing that, he will have done a good day's work for the country.</P>

      <P>The Minister's argument in connection with the man who had been induced to stand for election for a period of office of three years and who would be compelled to retire just after he had acquired a good knowledge of local government on the completion of that term of office, could easily be turned the other way.  It could also be pointed out that the various political Parties had induced persons to stand for election by representing that they would hold office only for three years.  I think that if there is anything in the argument, the person with the grievance as a result of the introduction of this Bill, is the person who was induced to stand on the representation that he would be obliged to hold office for three years only and who now finds his period of office prolonged for a further three years, perhaps against his will, if he does not want to let down the political group or the ratepayers' organisation he represents.</P>

      <P>Co-options are not always carried out in the friendly spirit that the Deputy suggests.  If it happens in Waterford, for instance, the major political Party will scoop up the vacancy for themselves.  It did not happen in Limerick either, when the last Minister for Local Government had to resign.  The argument for a five-year period of office is sound.  A good many people have been thinking of a longer term of office, but I think the amendment pretty well meets the view of the Minister.  He can provide that after this election the period of office shall be five years.  I do not see any objection to that course.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin rightly made the point that all the Opposition Parties have agreed to the principle of the measure and they only required that change to be made.  It is not too much to ask the Government to yield to the Opposition in that point.  There is very little use in having an Opposition unless, having expressed our views, we get some reasonable attempt from the Minister to co-operate with us.  The point was made by the Minister, and I agree there is something in it, that the elections were postponed on previous occasions.  I do not remember 1923 too well but I do know that things were not so happy for the holding of elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I make the same argument now as I made then.  During the war years there was not much point in holding such elections because of transport difficulties for one thing.  I <Col N="490" /> see no reason why we cannot decide to accept a term of five years.  If a subsequent Government wants to change the term it will have to do so openly and blatantly, and quite clearly for political purposes.  There is no doubt that our local elections are an asset.  We have here a system of free election.  There are other countries to-day that would give anything to have a similar system.  Any Government who deprives the people of an opportunity of expressing their opinion by a free vote is acting in an undemocratic manner and leaving themselves open to the charge that has been made from this side.  If the Government wants to repudiate that charge the remedy is simple: hold the local elections this year and in the future have the elections every five years.</P>

      <P>The Minister has adopted a very extraordinary attitude in relation to this measure, and he emphasised that attitude, rather than anything else, this afternoon.  He holds that the electorate should be saved having elections, that it is tired of the electoral ballot and that it wants elections stopped.  From a democratic point of view, I think that is a very peculiar approach.  On what foundation did we establish our parliamentary and representative institutions here? What was the struggle that our people made for so long and so successfully in our own generation aimed at achieving?  For what reason did we arrange our local government machinery the better to fit the particular needs of our own people?  Are we to wake up now to the suggestion, after all these years of local government administration, that the people do not want this electoral ballot, that they want to be rid of it?  It is said that they do not want the expense.  It is said that they do not want the upset. Quite a number of very peculiar points have been brought forward in a rather finicky way perhaps.  The Minister has swept them all aside.  The Minister has made up his own mind.  Like the Minister for Lands on some election platforms recently, he represents Party discipline; the ministerial mind has been made up and everything else must suitably and effectively flow from that.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very bad thing to be able to make up your mind in such fashion that you walk into an Irish Parliament and, against the opinions of every Party in the House and every Independent Deputy not bound to the Fianna Fáil chariot, proclaim that you will stand for your mind as against the mind of every other Party outside your own in this House.  I think that is bad.  The Minister's proposal to prevent local elections taking place this year has been opposed by every Party with the exception of those Independents concerned with the fate of the Government and with the possible aspersions cast upon their own representative character.  I assert that these four Independents supporting the Government would, if they went forward in a local election, be deprived of any claim to represent the people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher claims that the Government wants to save the ratepayers £80,000.  He says houses could be built with that money.  Deputy Morrissey very properly remarked that it might be well worth the ratepayers' while to pay that £80,000 in order the more securely and effectively to take the hand of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government out of their pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition has very generously offered to accept the proposal that local elections should take place only every five years.  I think the Opposition may well be overgenerous in its acceptance of that proposal.  I would like to have the position examined further.  I would like to have the Minister's proposals in relation to changes in the machinery of administration of local bodies put before the House before we are asked to consider that proposal.  However, I am not at the moment making that point.  I am dealing with the urgent and immediate point that the Minister <Col N="492" /> and his Party are steam-rolling their opinion over that of every other Party here in order to prevent local elections taking place this year.</P>
      <P>On the point that this £80,000 could be spent on housing, if one can build x houses for £80,000, how many houses can one build with £450,000?  Deputy Gallagher suggests that the ratepayers will be asked to pay, if our proposal is carried, £80,000 for a Fine Gael whim.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to our opposition being described as a whim, but I do not want to grab all the credit for the Fine Gael Party, credit to which every other Party&mdash;with the exception of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;is entitled.  If the Government and its supporters wish to describe as a mere whim our support of orderly, rhythmic movement in the election of our local authorities, they are at liberty to do so.  We could find a better word for it, but we will leave them their whim. If it is a Fine Gael whim to spend £80,000 on local elections, what was the expenditure of £460,000 on Constellation aircraft to run a trans-Atlantic airline?  Is that a whim?  From where did that idea come?  If the Government describes this as a whim, certainly it could all the more easily describe the expenditure of £460,000 by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as a mere whim.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that changes are taking place in borough boundaries.  My recollection is that a simple arrangement was made under the Dublin Managerial Act whereby, without any dislocation or disturbance of any kind, the boundaries could be changed gradually as occasion required. I do not think the machinery provided there would necessitate the holding-up of local elections in Dublin City or County.  I am sure the same is true of Cork or any other area where an urban and a rural authority is involved in the changing of boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy MacCarthy who made the point that this is getting back to 1946-47.  That suggestion is a rather interesting one.  In 1946-47 we had the Government of the day planning <Col N="493" /> very systematically to take more and more money out of the people's pockets and to keep the people more and more in subjection.  You had your wages' squeeze Order to keep the workers in their place.  You had the increased taxation on beer and spirits the purpose of which was to provide the Government with further additional moneys to carry on their Government operations.  This is a measure to prevent the people electing their local bodies now in the atmosphere in which we find ourselves.  The people suffered under the blow of 1947. They have also received the blow of the last Budget and are continuing to receive it now.  In addition, they are receiving the kind of blows being prepared for them in some of the new Government legislation, including the Health Bill.</P>
    <P>Does anybody think that the Government would to-day reduce the amount of money available for the agricultural grant if they did not feel they had a sufficient majority in this House to stop the electors electing new local authorities?  Does anybody think that we would have the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the Minister for Local Government apparently acquiescing, pinching from local authorities a certain amount of money for the Treasury because of the allegation that manufacturers in this country were not able to make waterproof clothing or to manufacture them to meet the standard of the Minister for Local Government or of the county managers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying, Sir, that the Minister would not be imposing these additional financial charges on the people if he had not it fairly well in his mind that his majority in this House was going to defeat the amendment.  I am saying that the reason he is preventing local elections this year is that he wants to prevent the people, who understand the tendency of the Minister's policy to shove additional financial burdens over on to their shoulders and who can see what <Col N="494" /> is in the wind, from electing councils that will be strengthened to oppose policies of that particular kind.</P>
      <P>Everything that is happening to-day on the ministerial side shows that the Minister is using every possible endeavour and plan to push over on to local authorities financial burdens and take them off the shoulders of the State.  So much for the general idea.  I repeat the remarks I made on Second Reading in connection with this Bill, that the real purpose of this Bill is to prevent being exposed as non-representative people four of the Independents who are holding the Government in power and who make up four of the five that the Government can muster in their critical divisions.</P>
      <P>The proposal in this measure is just an attack on democracy&mdash;and a disgraceful attack, too.  It is being pressed by the Government against the opinion of every single Party in this House and every Deputy who is really independent.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael knows a good thing and it fell in with the Labour Party when Labour gave the lead.  That is my impression of the position.  I am not a member of a local body.  I am a co-opted member of a committee of agriculture and I have not heard very much from the members of that body as to what period is the more suitable.  I am in contact with county councillors and I have not heard very much from them as to what period is the more suitable to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that I have heard a lot from the people, and one of the things that I have heard from the people is that they do not want an election under any conditions.  They want to keep away from elections.  That is the attitude of the public.  I thought it was better to inquire the reason why. The majority of the people were so well burned and scorched for about <Col N="495" /> three years that their wounds have not yet healed.  They are hopeful that this present Government will remain in office for the legal term and that that will possibly give them time to heal the wounds that have been inflicted on them.</P>
    <P>That is the attitude of the public and it is no use trying to bluff them. The public do not want the disturbance or the expense of a local election. They believe that a three-year period is too short.  It is even impossible for members of committees of agriculture to develop any lines of policy they may like to pursue in three years.  It takes at least some five years for that purpose.  The main wish of the people in general is that they want to keep away from elections&mdash;especially general elections.  The sooner that is realised by everybody the better.  They do not want to chance their arm again.  They chanced it before.</P>

      <P>Where any act, matter or thing which was done or omitted by any local authority or by any member or officer thereof (including a returning officer) before the passing of this Act would have been lawfully done or omitted if this section had then been in operation, such act, matter or thing shall be deemed to have been lawfully done or omitted.</P>

This Bill will not become law between those dates and, until such time as the Bill becomes law, there is a legal obligation on the appropriate officers of the local authorities to take the steps, as if the local elections were about to take place.  What the Minister is now, in effect, telling the county managers or county secretaries or the responsible local officers concerned is: You can ignore the law; you can flout the law; you can pretend that it is not there.

However, last February, in reply to parliamentary questions in this House, I gave public notice of my intention to introduce these proposals postponing the election of local bodies and some local bodies may have neglected or ignored the existence of the law as it stood.

      <P>If this Bill does not become law and if they do not carry out their statutory obligations, where are we then?  I am making the point that, until such time as this Bill becomes the law of the land, the existing law must be operated and must stand.</P>
      <P>The Minister is taking the line that he is assuming, and wants every responsible officer of the local authority to assume, that this Bill will become law and that they will be protected under this Bill for failing to carry out their lawful obligations under the law as it stands at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>They have no right to assume it.  The Minister himself, as Minister for Local Government, has a big responsibility in this matter.  If a county manager or the secretary of <Col N="501" /> a county council or a city manager refuses in any other respect to discharge his legal obligations then there is an obligation on the Minister for Local Government to bring him to task and to take whatever measures are necessary to see that he is punished.  I want to make clear the point that the law, as it exists, is and will continue to be the law until this Bill becomes law, if it does become law.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, this is an amendment which says to the official of the local authorities: Whatever you did lawfully, that is O.K. Whatever you failed to do that is O.K., as well, so long as it is all done in pursuance of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Is it possible for a local authority to meet next week and decide that it will hold local elections in June or July of this year and is it possible for this section to give legal effect to the lawful character of that act, so far as the official of the local authority is concerned? Does that permit the local authority, in declaring a local election, to have a local election?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to make the position clear.  This amendment is designed to rectify the position if an official of a local body failed to give effect to the law as it now stands, and as it will stand until such time as this Bill is enacted.  A condition such as this was inserted in a previous measure. There is nothing more to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much more to it.  This proposal is a directive to the responsible officers of local authorities to ignore the law as it stands. The Minister is intimating to them that he wishes them to refuse to carry out their obligations under the law. He is asking them to assume that the present Bill will become law.  The Minister does not know whether it will or not.  I can think of a number of ways in which it could fail to become law. It may not pass through this House; the Seanad might hold it up; I suppose even the President could refuse to <Col N="502" /> sign it; or we might even have a general election beforehand, and where would it be then?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Where would the officers be?  With respect to the Minister&mdash;I am depending entirely on my recollection, while he has information at his disposal&mdash;I do not think there is any precedent for this.  It is something to put a section into a Bill to cover people who unintentionally and not deliberately evaded their legal obligations; but the Minister is giving not merely exoneration but a directive that they are to refuse to carry out their present legal obligations and he is telling them that if they agree with his direction he will cover them against any action that might be taken against them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be some meaning in this.  Somebody must think it means something, but one person does not know what it means and that person is the Minister.  It is bringing parliamentary government down to the level of a burlesque if the Minister can come in and read a brief to explain an amendment and then say that beyond that he did not take much notice of it and only read the brief someone put into his hand.  It purports to describe this, but when we ask the Minister a few more questions he does not seem to know any more about it. I do not blame him for, as a layman <Col N="503" /> trying to interpret this section, it seems Greek to me.  However, we ought not put it into the Bill unless someone can make a further effort to explain it.  I can see some reason on the side where this underwrites anyone who omitted to do something, but where he lawfully does a thing I want to know what that is committing us to do?  If a person lawfully does a thing to-day under the existing law, and if that lawfulness carries him to the stage of lawfully arranging for local elections this year, is that law so far as the holding of local elections is concerned?  This amendment seems to say that it is lawful if he arranges that.  I can understand that if he did not arrange it, if he omitted to do it, he would be protected, but apparently if he did take any steps to hold the elections, that is lawful also.  Someone must throw some light on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The present law provides that this is an election year but, as this discussion has revealed, local bodies, on the strength of replies to parliamentary questions, have assumed that the local elections will not be held and have made no provision for the expenditure on them.  What we are discussing here is a proposal for legislation. This is not the law of the land yet.  The law requires that local bodies and their officials should do certain things.  However, if they should act otherwise because of the declared intention to amend the law, this amendment will protect them.  If, on the strength of the assurance by the Minister that the law will be amended, they do not act according to the present law, they will be protected under this amendment.  That is the only explanation I can give, and I think it is a perfectly understandable one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing law the responsible officers are charged with doing certain things between to-day and the 12th of this month.  Now, nothing that we are doing here at the moment exonerates them or relieves them of that responsibility.  The mere <Col N="504" /> fact that a Bill is introduced and reaches the Committee Stage does not necessarily mean it will become law. We have numerous examples of Bills reaching the Second Stage or part of the Committee Stage and never completing the Committee Stage, or of reaching even the Fourth Stage and never being heard of again, because something happened in the meantime.</P>

      <P>If this Bill becomes law, Deputy McGrath will have another chance of running.  The point I am making is a serious one.  We are proposing now lightly to set aside the existing law, we are purporting to do what I honestly believe we have no power to do&mdash;to give a direction to the responsible officers of local authorities that they are not to make the arrangements for local elections, on the assumption that this Bill will become law.  I do not think any local officer has any right or authority to take that direction from the Minister or from any other Minister that might be sitting in his place.</P>

The Minister himself has told us that the officers know that this Bill has been introduced, that they got information in answers to parliamentary questions and that they are not going to take the necessary steps.  Of course, the Minister is giving them a direction.  He is not issuing a mandamus, but it is the same thing.</P>
      <P>I take it that what Deputy Norton is trying to get at is about the double safeguard, that if anybody does take the necessary steps in accordance with the existing law and if this Bill does not become law then they will be protected also.</P>

The Minister has the power under Part IV of the Local Government Act, 1941, to dissolve a local authority.  Am I to take it, therefore, that this section and sub-section (4) thereof, which we are discussing particularly, only affect local bodies dissolved before the passing of this Bill?  What happens supposing the Minister dissolves a local body immediately after the passing of this Bill?  Where is his power to deal with that situation?  Where is his power to dissolve?

      <P>When we were discussing sub-section (4) of Section 2, the Minister stated that that sub-section gave him between now and the passing of this Bill the appropriate power to remove from office a local authority, that it gave him, in addition, the appropriate power to declare an election in respect of a local authority previously removed.  These are the two things the Minister said it gave him power to do.  I asked the Minister then where was the power by virtue of which he had the right to declare an election in respect of a body removed before the passing of this Bill and where was the power in respect of which he had the right to remove a local body from office subsequent to the passing of this Bill.  The Minister told me that both these powers were contained in Section 6.  I can understand sub-section (2) of Section 6 meaning that the Minister has power to declare an election in respect of a body removed from office.  From the wording of sub-section (2) that seems so.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 11 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a date has not been appointed by a local authority before the 23rd day of June, 1953, for the holding of the annual meeting or quarterly meeting (as the case may be) of the local authority which is required by law to be held during the period beginning on the 23rd day of June, 1953, and ending on the 1st day of July, 1953, the county secretary or town clerk (as the case may be) shall summon a meeting of the local authority for a convenient hour and date within that period for the purpose, and a meeting held in pursuance of such summons shall be regarded as an annual or quarterly meeting held on a date appointed by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the passing of this Bill, the present year will cease to be a local election year and, consequently, every local authority will be obliged to meet and fix a date for an annual meeting, or in the case of boroughs or county boroughs, a quarterly meeting, to be held between 23rd June and 1st July.  Some local authorities will have done this in anticipation of the Bill passing, but <Col N="514" /> where a local authority has not done so, it may not have time or may find it inconvenient to meet to fix the date. This amendment proposes to overcome the difficulty by providing that if the date of the annual or quarterly meeting has not been fixed by a local authority by the 23rd June, the county secretary or town clerk shall fix a convenient time for holding a meeting within the statutory period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of the little breeze that was wafted in here from the Wicklow Hills by Deputy Everett, I think I could honestly say that these Estimates were debated in what I might describe as a rather serene and calm atmosphere and, generally speaking, the discussion went on in a helpful atmosphere. Nevertheless, I am somewhat bewildered by the volume of advice which has been tendered to me and, through me, to the Army authorities, on how to save money and how to spend money on the type of equipment which we do not want and the type of equipment which we should have; on the necessity for compulsory service to rope in more men; and, again, on the desirability of having a small army. It was, however, as I say, all given in a spirit of good fellowship and intended at least to be helpful.  Of course, Deputy Rooney, when he was speaking, gave it a somewhat political tinge.  He distorted a few of the statements which were made here from time to time to suit his own ends, but beyond that, there was not very much to say about his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was rather more pleasant to listen to Deputy Seán Collins giving his views when he opened the debate on this Estimate for the Opposition.  I was rather pleasantly surprised by the line or argument which he took and the advances which he made in his views in regard to the Army generally.  The Deputy may not take it as a compliment from me when I say the views which he expressed here were more akin to the views which we hold on this side of the House than to the views which are held by the members of his own Party.  I can only hope that in the course of time he will, perhaps <Col N="516" /> be able to induce some of his colleagues to share his views.</P>
    <P>He asked in the course of the discussion how he could help in advancing the cause of defence in which he himself was interested.  One of the ways in which, I suggest, he could help would be that which I have just mentioned.  If he could convince his colleagues of the necessity of retaining an Army of the strength which we on this side believe to be the minimum that we should possess, I think he would be doing a very good day's work for the State generally.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies who have spoken in this debate agreed that we must have an Army even though some of them mistakenly think that it is an expensive luxury.  I think that the only question we have to settle here is that of the strength of the Army.  I have on numerous occasions pointed out that the figure of 12,500 men which has been bandied about here, and which has become a kind of obsession with some of the Deputies on the opposite side, is not our reckoning of what the minimum strength of the Army should be. It is the opinion of the experts which the State employs to deal with that organisation.  I am very often inclined to think that this House holds too many armchair generals who criticise the experts' views, I would say mistakenly. If a contractor undertakes a job of work and makes an estimate of what he requires to carry out that work, it is very questionable if a person of little or no technical knowledge should start disputing with him in regard to his estimate.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it would be logical or that any sensible man would do so.  Yet we find in this House people who, beyond the fact that they are Deputies and have been elected by the people&mdash;Deputies who to all intents and purposes have no special qualifications to speak on this subject beyond that which might be described as the point of view of the man on the street &mdash;dogmatise on the question of the strength of the Army as if they had spent their whole lives studying military subjects, military tactics or strategy.</P>
    <P>I should say&mdash;if I am not making a <Col N="517" /> mistake, Deputy Major de Valera in the course of his remarks mentioned the fact also&mdash;that the peace-time establishment of 12,500 is not the minimum establishment that the Army asked for.  The minimum establishment that the Army authorities sought in 1946, when they put their scheme up to the Government, was 15,000 and the Government after very careful examination and a most minute scrutiny compromised to the extent of reducing that figure to 12,500, a reduction of 2,500, in an effort to save the taxpayers even to that extent.  It was done only after discussion with these experts, making the case clear to them that it was due to the financial position rather than to any disbelief of their assessment of the requirements of the Army and naturally they had to accept it as the next best thing.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on Deputies who have spoken, and who have not got that background of military knowledge which is required, if the Estimate is to be debated in the way in which I am sure the Army authorities would like it to be debated, the fact that in the 12,500 figure which represents the Defence Force in peace-time are to be found a very large number of non-combatants, men who could not in any circumstances be put into what may be termed the fighting line.  The people I have in mind would include the administrative officer, who cannot in any circumstances be done without by reason of the fact that there must always be that type of officer to keep the organisation going.  Then there is the Medical Corps which, as Deputies are aware, is a non-combatant corps and would not be used as combatant personnel.  There is also the School of Music which takes up quite a number of men, and there are many others of one type or another who would not be counted as effective fighting units.  I cannot say with certainty what percentage these various sections would represent but I am almost certain that they would represent almost one-third of the strength of the Army.  These are matters of which Deputies should be fully aware when they are considering the question of the strength of 12,500 men in the Army.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> I might also point out, when we talk about a small army, that this is not an army in the sense that armies are known abroad.  The 12,500 men, if we had them, would not comprise one fighting division.  They would be less than one fighting division of a modern army.  When we talk about a small army, therefore, we are talking about something which, if it were smaller than this Army, would be to all intents and purposes of very little use.  Apart from the fact that this 12,500 men is the <i>cadre</i> upon which an emergency army can be built, it is also intended to feed the Reserve.  Quite a number of Deputies spoke about the depletion of the Reserve and, if things were to continue, not only would we have no Reserve but we would have no Army.  Even though we have been reasonably successful to date in our recruiting campaign&mdash;I think we have recruited something over 5,000 men since we started a little over a year ago&mdash;we have not yet reached an Army strength of 11,000.  I mention that figure because I think it should give food for thought.  Even though we have recruited 5,000 men we have not yet topped an Army of 11,000, much less having reached a peace-time strength of 12,500.  In order to reach a figure of 12,500, therefore, we would have to recruit to an even greater extent and at greater speed than we have achieved over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of having 12,500 is not, as some Deputies seem to think, for the purpose of having an Army ready to go into battle and fight immediately an enemy attempts to assail us; the main purpose of this peace-time Army is to turn out first-class soldiers.  It is the endeavour of the Army authorities so far as it is humanly possible to make every private soldier efficient enough to become an N.C.O., if necessary.  He is trained to that very high standard.  It is the object to train every man who becomes an N.C.O. to the standard of a junior officer.  The purpose of that is to have the nucleus of a training establishment in the event of emergency.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputies have considered all these points when they talk about a small army.  It has been suggested that the only army we need <Col N="519" /> here is one to preserve internal order. If that is all we require we do not need an army at all.  The police force can be strengthened to do that work.  That force is already armed with all the necessary legal powers to preserve order and, if that is all that is required it would be unnecessary for us to have an army at all unless, of course, as some Deputies advocated, for ceremonial occassions.  I doubt if it would be fair to ask the people to provide an army for that purpose only.  The only purpose an army can have here is the purpose for which it is maintained at present, namely, to be in a position to deal with any emergency likely to come upon us as far as lies within its power.  Some Deputies in the courses of the debate almost suggested that we should not defend ourselves in an emergency.  I hope that view is not shared by very many.  I think Deputy Rooney is one of those who voiced that opinion.</P>

      <P>Practically all the Deputies who spoke referred to the reduced strength of the First Line Reserve and the F.C.A.  In my opening speech I mentioned that the best way of maintaining the strength of the First Line Reserve and of making it <Col N="520" /> a really valuable component of the Defence Forces is by the transfer of trained personnel who have completed their term of service in the permanent force.  From that point of view the intensive recruitment to the permanent force over the last year or so will show results in due course.  These young men who joined the Defence Forces 12 months ago, if they have taken on for a period of two years, will be going out again next year and will automatically pass into the Reserve.  If we can keep up the pressure from the point of view of recruiting, we will have over a number of years 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 men going into the Reserve and, in course of time, the depleted Reserve, of which a number of Deputies complain, will be replenished and again become the healthy organisation that General Headquarters Staff would like it to be.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, a number of soldiers who join for a much longer period and continue in the Army until they become what is known as &ldquo;time expired&rdquo; soldiers.  Of course, that class of man never reaches the Reserve. Having served his time he resumes civilian life without going on the Reserve.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride expressed alarm at the incidence of attendance at annual training and at the number of the First Line Reserve residing outside this country.  Now everybody would like to see a 100 per cent. attendance at annual training but that has never been achieved, not even before the emergency.</P>
      <P>As to those living abroad, it is a fact that at the commencement of the last emergency the vast majority of the reservists living outside the country reported for service.  That is a well-known fact and no Government would refuse to permit these men, if they desired to go abroad, to do so, provided they gave their undertaking, as they are required to do, that they would respond to the call up whenever that would be issued.  On the whole, they have done that.  They have honoured that undertaking and that arrangement will continue in the future as it has in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy MacBride and Deputy Corish <Col N="521" /> apparently feel that the financial attractions are not adequate.  Personally, I do not think that is the case. The Army has benefited and will continue to benefit, as far as pay and allowances are concerned, from the increases granted to all State servants from time to time.  As to the annual grants, if the Army authorities feel that increases in these grants would effect an improvement in attendance, I am pretty certain they would not be adverse to recommending that increase.</P>
    <P>As to the F.C.A., I am most anxious, and so, indeed, are the military authorities, that this force should be maintained at the highest strength and pitch of efficiency.  Undoubtedly, that strength has decreased over the past few years, but I think that decrease has been more apparent than real.  In the course of the discussion to-day, I think it was Deputy O'Higgins who dealt with the F.C.A., and he dealt with it in almost exactly the same way as he did last year.  Of course, as usual, he tried to suggest that whatever decrease took place only took place since the present Government resumed office.</P>
    <P>As I have said, he made a similar statement last year.  On that occasion I replied to that statement at length and I am going to quote from my reply on that occasion which will be found in Volume 132, No. 7, column 974 of the Official Debates.  This is what I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the 31st December, 1947&mdash;that was the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government before it was superseded by the Coalition Government&mdash;the total number of officers, N.C.O.s and men was 47,880.  At the end of 12 months, that is, on the 31st December, 1948, the force was reduced from 47,880 to 39,560, a decrease of 8,320.  On the 31st December, 1949, it had still further decreased from 39,560 to 34,636.  That represented a further decrease of 4,924, almost 5,000 men.  On the 31st December, 1950, the figures again showed a decrease from 34,636 to 30,311, a decrease of 4,325.  On the 30th June, 1951, that was, up to the time of the change of Government, the year to <Col N="522" /> which Deputy O'Higgins implored me to look to see what was done in respect of the F.C.A., it had decreased in the six months by no less than 7,941, bringing the total strength down to 22,370.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These figures might be alarming in certain circumstances but actually&mdash;I think Deputy O'Higgins himself so informed the House when he took up ministerial office&mdash;they represented only the clearing away of what he described as non-effectives, and non-effectives were people who had over a certain period of time missed a number of drills, parades, week-end camps and were written off and removed from the roll of the companies as being noneffective. That has gone on year after year and is responsible for the decrease. It was responsible for the decrease of the 7,941 in the last year of the Coalition Government.  That system of writing off still continues.  If men do not attend, if they have been attending for some time and then go off the active list, it would be foolish for the Army authorities to carry them on their list, because everyone of those who are on the list of the F.C.A. are on it because they are regarded as being effective.</P>
    <P>Because they are effective, there is an annual unit capitation grant earmarked to represent the expenses connected with these individuals and so, writing them off when they are no longer active or effective is merely an economy.  There is a continuous recruitment to the F.C.A. and there is a continuous leakage as well.  How best to deal with that is a matter about which the Army authorities always concern themselves.  We have been told here by Deputies who have been meeting these people that there is not enough variety in the training.  In some cases, we are told that the type of training is too difficult.  I myself do not think that either of these is the real reason.  There is no doubt that as the newness of the membership of the force wears off, the men feel they have secured all the knowledge that the Army can give them.  They just decide then: &ldquo;We are as well trained as we are ever going to be.  We are now going out, and if ever we are <Col N="523" /> wanted we will respond to the call.&rdquo; The suggestion was made to me on numerous occasions that if an emergency of any kind ever came on us every one of these men who received training for a year or more would be at our call.  That may be reasonable enough, but from my point of view and from the Army point of view it is not good.  It would be much more desirable that these men would be always there, always being trained, always being kept up-to-date, and well-in-formed on military matters as well as being introduced to new methods and new equipment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the wastage figures which the Minister is giving, would he have figures showing the intake of new recruits to the F.C.A.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the actual figures with me, but I can say this, that the figure of the total strength has now become somewhat static at round about 18,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the wastage is being off-set by intake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that that was so, but it is not quite that.  There is a continuous reduction. I want to be quite honest in my statement. The position is rather more of a continuous reduction than it is actually static, but for the last couple of years it has been nearer to being static, due, perhaps, to the fact that a better type of F.C.A. man is there.  What I mean by &ldquo;a better type&rdquo; is a man who gets into the F.C.A., takes a tremendous interest in it, retains that interest and, therefore, continues his membership of it.  It is true to say that we have in the country, as a result of the very large membership of the F.C.A. over the years, as well as of the many men who received training during the emergency, quite a large number of men now who could, in a much shorter time than in the previous emergency, be turned into very effective soldiers.  I believe that to be the case.  In addition, we are relying to a very great extent on the <Col N="524" /> fact that the Army which we are trying to maintain at the highest possible strength, but which I have mentioned has never reached the peace establishment strength, would be much more effective in training the intake of volunteers in time of emergency than were the men in the 1939-40 emergency.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer particularly to the regular training personnel attached to the F.C.A. because I regard this as a most important feature of F.C.A. training.  The regular personnel were withdrawn only because it was absolutely necessary, in connection with the intake of the recruits to which I have been referring, that we should be able not only to handle these young men who were coming in, but that we should be able to give them the best possible type of training during their period in the Army.  How soon we can release some of these men for the purpose of resuming duty with the F.C.A. is a matter which I cannot make a guess at at the moment, but whenever it is possible to do so we will do that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond suggested in his speech that there is a top heaviness of senior officers in the permanent force as compared with the pre-emergency period.  Well, the strengths of all ranks are based on peace establishments. These peace establishments were examined in the most meticulous detail by the appropriate military and civil authorities: by the Department of Defence, by the Department of Finance and by the Government before they were approved of as being necessary, both in total and with regard to the different ranks.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond also suggested that Army transport is being misused.  I think it only right to inform the Deputy that there are very definite regulations as to the use of Army transport designed to prevent its improper or wasteful use, and that there is very careful checking into all journeys undertaken to ensure that, if tasks and journeys can be combined, that is done.  However it may appear to the Deputy, I am perfectly satisfied that there is nothing in the nature of the unauthorised moving about of transport which he suggested.  The supervision is too strict for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> Any soldier going on a journey must fill in a form.  He must be authorised to go on that journey, and if the journey is of any considerable length, he is actually routed on the journey. In other words, he has to follow a particular route and he cannot deviate from it.  When Deputy Desmond makes a statement of the kind, he takes it for granted, because he sees a lorry or a motor-car carrying officers, that they are out joy-riding or that they are careering around the country without any authority to do so.  Such is not the case.  It is a pity that statements of this kind are made without producing some kind of evidence to support them.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Desmond's inquiry as to the reduction in the provision for privates under sub-head A from £920,138 to £906,304, the reason is that we are providing for a greater number of recruits than in 1952-53. The rates of pay are the same, but with a larger proportion of recruits there is a smaller total cost.  The cost of a corporal is similarly lower, as provision is made for a larger number of new promotions.</P>
    <P>The figures shown under certain sub-heads in respect of stores ordered but not delivered are included for the information of the Dáil.  The total of all stores ordered, or to be ordered during the year, is shown, but the amount for which the Dáil is being asked is the sum required for deliveries actually expected.  As in 1952-53, it could happen that these stores would be delivered earlier, and in that case, if the excess cannot be met from savings on other sub-heads, Supplementary Estimates would be necessary. The Department does not carry forward any unexpended balance.  In fact, such a practice would be highly irregular and would not be permitted by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible to meet the suggestion of Deputy Desmond to provide transport facilities for married men between their place of duty and their homes.  If it is a hardship on a married man to reach his home daily, he can avail of accommodation for himself in the barracks, and there is no <Col N="526" /> deduction made from his marriage allowance for this accommodation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney raised a question as to whether we can spend this year the sum of £1,800,000 provided in the Estimate for defensive equipment.  I can assure the Deputy that the sum in question is in respect of contracts already made and of materials to be delivered this year on foot of these contracts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any guarantee that these contracts will be fulfilled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have already said to the Deputy that I can assure him that the sum in question is in respect of contracts already made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and of materials to be delivered this year on the foot of these contracts.  The Deputy suggested they have not been delivered.  Is that right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a carry over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true enough. The contracts which we placed from the time we started to get after the purchase of equipment have been honoured to date.  In fact, I am glad to be able to report a rather unusual thing. Supplies of the equipment to which I am referring have, in fact, been delivered before the actual dates guaranteed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister referring to the Swedish supply?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Swedish and others.  There are other contracts, too.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Swedish were excellent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Swedish one not the main delivery?  Was it not the principal delivery of warlike stores?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say it was the principal because a greater amount was purchased from Sweden than from <Col N="527" /> the other countries.  But they were all excellent from the point of view of punctuality.  That was not always the case.  We often had contracts as much as a year and more behind time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a statement to that effect this time last year.  You said that you were unable to obtain your requirements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This time last year, on the Estimate.  You referred to the difficulty of obtaining them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The first order we placed was in July of last year.  In fact, I will deal with that on a question that was mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins this afternoon.  Actually, we only got after that, I think, last July. The order was placed then and guarantees were given and certain dates were given.  It is to these dates for which guarantees were given that I am referring. They were very satisfactory from that point of view.</P>
      <P>In the course of to-day's debate, Deputy O'Higgins referred to a statement that was made by the Minister for Finance.  He objected to that statement and described it as false and without foundation.  He went on to show that when he was in office he purchased this equipment that we got from Sweden.  He made that same statement last year and, in spite of the fact that I tried to correct him, he has repeated it again this year.  This is what I said last year and, again, I am quoting from No. 7 of Volume 132 of the Official Report.  At column 965, I am reported as saying on the 10th of June last year:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;What was the position which I found?  The position which I found when I got down to examining the file was, that the first move in respect to this particular type of arms was made on 20th December, 1950, and it was made as a result of information supplied by the intelligence arm of the Army which reported to the Chief of Staff that they were aware that a certain type <Col N="528" /> of arms were likely to be secured in Sweden.  The Chief of Staff, when he examined that information, decided to acquaint the then Minister of that fact, and from that particular date up to the 13th March I could find nothing in the file to show that any ministerial action was taken in the matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That covered a period of three months from the time it was first brought to the attention of the then Minister.  I continued:-</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I did see that the Army Intelligence apparently continued their efforts to secure information in the matter.  On the 13th March, 1951, the Chief of Staff recommended that the Department of External Affairs should be asked to request the Irish Minister in Stockholm to ascertain from the Swedish Government the prospects of obtaining certain war material and, in that connection, whether missions from this country to Sweden could be facilitated. The then Minister for Defence approved of this recommendation on the 19th March, 1951.  The sanction of the Minister for Finance to proceed accordingly was requested on the 28th March, 1951, and was received on the 17th May, 1951.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is another two months.  That is five months that have been&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Two months is quick for a Department of Finance in any Administration.  The Minister knows the Department of Finance as well as anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>May be.  I continued as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From that date until I began to prosecute my inquiries, no action of any kind was taken&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is, no action was taken on the reception of the approval of the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>You scrambled into office less than a month later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and on the 5th of July&mdash;I had been in office from, I think, the 14th June&mdash;as a result of the inquiries which I was making, I confirmed the <Col N="529" /> decision to send a mission to Sweden and at the same time agreed that contracts could be arranged by the mission while in Sweden, subject to certain conditions.  The sanction of the Minister for Finance to proceed on the revised basis was obtained on the 14th July, 1951&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman will have to admit that that was some speed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It was only a reendorsement of the decision taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;and the mission was empowered to purchase arms on the spot if the arms, in their opinion, were of a suitable type.  Now it was easy to give that permission because the officers who were on that mission were all experts in regard to the question of arms.  I want to give this in its historical correctness to show that so far as statements made in the debates are concerned, they are not facts, that the facts are as I have related them.  Again, of course, I want to point out that so far as I am concerned, the very fact that we have secured arms at all, is sufficiently satisfying.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to put on record that the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, did say in the course of a debate here that if arms could be secured money would be no obstacle. He said that in reply to a speech delivered by the then Leader of the Opposition, the present Taoiseach.  He said that if the then Leader of the Opposition could show him where and how arms could be secured he would be prepared to put up the money&mdash;in other words, that money would not be an obstacle.</P>
      <P>Deputy Rooney also made the statement that 1,400 reservists emigrated during the past year, and that I said so in my opening statement.  That statement by Deputy Rooney is not correct.  What my statement showed was that the number of First Line reservists provided for in the Army this year is 1,400 less than last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, in the main, is caused by the excess of discharges because of the expiration of service over the intake <Col N="530" /> from the permanent force.  As I explained, I hope this factor will be corrected in due course, as the men recruited during the past few years become due for transfer to the Reserve.  Let me emphasise, however, that there is no basis for Deputy Rooney's suggestion that 1,400 Reservists emigrated during the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could have clarified it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin raised a question about the appointments to cadetships from the ranks.  I am sure he is fully aware that is already provided for.  There is a limited number of cadetships reserved for soldiers in the Army, if they have the necessary qualifications.  There is hardly a year passes that we do not include two or three and sometimes more, but it all depends on the qualification of the man himself and his ability to pass the examination.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies also spoke about the desirability of having garrisons in different parts of the country, especially in Wexford and Donegal.  Deputy Mac Fheórais referred to Wexford and Deputies O'Donnell and Cunningham referred to Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who gives a moment's thought to the situation, to the strength of the Army and its present distribution, will very quickly realise that it would be quite impossible to put what might be described as garrisons in all the places where Deputies would like to see them.  It is a great tribute to the Army that Deputies should be seeking to have them residing among their own people.  The reason I have given is the only one why we have not garrisons of soldiers in those places <Col N="531" /> where Deputies would like to see them.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride spoke about compulsory national service and I think Deputy Rooney also spoke about it. Deputy MacBride quickly mended his hand, as he decided, after mentioning it, that the type of national service he had in mind was, apparently, not national military service.  He explained that it need not be solely of a military nature, that it could be used more for work of a social nature.  If that is what he is looking for, I would very respectfully suggest that it is not on the Defence Estimate that he should raise that particular question.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin spoke about the purchase of obsolescent equipment.  I do not know what particular equipment he was referring to.  If he had mentioned some particular type I might have been able to deal with it.  We have quite an amount which is rather old.  For instance, we have large quantities of rifles which have been here, I suppose, since the establishment of the Army, but as far as I am aware most of them are still very effective and could be fully utilised in case of an emergency. If it were possible to get more up-to-date rifles we, naturally, would try to secure them.  We have on numerous occasions sought to purchase additional supplies of rifles, but to date we have not been successful.  I do not know what other type of equipment the Deputy might have been referring to, except perhaps artillery.</P>
    <P>There again, while we have quite an amount of very effective weapons in the form of artillery, we have recently decided to go in for a type of weapon which is equally as valuable as the artillery but which is much more mobile.  This particular type almost becomes a kind of personal weapon, as it can be removed very speedily, much more quickly than could the very much larger types of artillery.  From that point of view, it would meet many of the suggestions that have been made from benches on both sides of the House that our most effective form of defence would be the guerilla form.  If we had to operate at all, this particular <Col N="532" /> type of weapon&mdash;it is the mortar weapon&mdash;could be very speedily taken away.  It is almost a personal weapon, as two or three men can operate it and move it about almost as speedily as they could move a machine-gun.</P>
    <P>Deputies Collins and MacBride enquired about the Air Corps and its technical equipment.  We have recently secured some more training equipment, that is, aircraft equipment; but it can only be described as training equipment. Naturally, I would like to see &mdash;and so would the Army&mdash;the possibility arising of purchasing more effective weapons for the Air Corps, but there is no weapon that is changing at a faster rate than the air weapon.  The machine that is up-to-date this week is almost written off next week, the progress is so fast.  Not only that, but the colossal cost of this new type of weapon puts it almost outside the bounds of possibility that we could secure it.  However, the Air Corps officers are keeping up to date by attendance at courses of instruction on the most modern type of aircraft. We have quite a number of officers now who are capable of using jet planes if the opportunity should ever be provided of securing such equipment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins inquired as to whether I am satisfied with the progress of civil defence.  I should like to say that the school in the Park is going on from week to week, doing excellent work in the training of new personnel.  The course takes a fortnight or three weeks and every week sees some progress being made in training new instructors.  I think we can say that we have now throughout the country quite a large number of very competent instructors who would be able to impart information should that be necessary at the shortest possible notice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the notation on a soldier's discharge certificate that he has been discharged as being below Army physical standard and other Deputies mentioned that point as well.  It is a very difficult matter to handle.  If a man is discharged for being below Army physical standards, it is a safeguard that he has not been discharged for some other reason <Col N="533" /> which might be more derogatory to his character.  I think that &ldquo;medically unfit&rdquo; was not the best possible form of words, and that one or other of the phrases they are using now, &ldquo;below Army physical standard&rdquo; or &ldquo;below Army medical standard,&rdquo; may be more helpful.</P>

      <P>It might be a better phrase to use.  Deputy Cunningham referred to unemployment amongst ex-servicemen. I do not know if the incidence of unemployment is higher amongst ex-servicemen than in other classes of the community, but I should be surprised if it were, because, for a long time after the emergency, in accordance with the resettlement scheme, I and my Department laboured with a considerable degree of success to ensure that suitable employment would be found for ex-servicemen. In so far as the Department and Government Departments generally can control the position, there is still a preference for ex-servicemen and every possible effort continues to be made to get outside employers to employ these men.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath raised some points regarding oil bunkering arrangements at Haulbowline.  The position is that the jetty which was recently completed and which gives a depth of 21 feet of water alongside is adequate for naval service purposes.  From the national point of view, I am also interested in securing that ocean-going vessels should be able to come alongside and thus permit of the operation of a bunkering service on a commercial basis.  Whether the necessary depth of water could best be provided by an extension of the jetty or by dredging has not yet been determined, but the matter is being considered.  I have been approaching the question of commercial bunkering facilities on the basis that private enterprise would be prepared to operate these facilities, but, if as the Deputy feels, such is not the case, the whole position regarding the provision of a greater depth of water will be re-examined.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> Reference was made to certain cases of long-service soldiers whose entitlement to sanatorium treatment was not covered by the regulations.  I am glad to say that the arrangements have now been made to have sanatorium treatment accorded in these cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton made some references to turf and seemed to have the impression that the small turf-producer in Kildare was not getting a fair chance from my Department; in other words, he felt that the man producing only a small amount of turf as against the man producing a large quantity was not getting his tenders accepted.  I have gone into the question and I find that the tenders which have been received and which, I think, number 38, are tenders for amounts running from 30 to 2,000 tons.  The amount we are looking for is almost 5,000 tons, but, so far as the Department is concerned, if the price is right, every one of these tenders would naturally be accepted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan raised a point which has already risen in connection with the Defence Bill, that the retiring ages are too low and that officers should be encouraged to undertake reserve service. As I informed the Deputy when discussing the point on the Defence Bill, the matter is being examined by the military authorities and if a feasible plan can be worked out, it can be put into operation under both the existing Acts and the new Defence Bill, when it has passed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of the right of officers to resign their commissions.  I think it would be better that this matter should be discussed and considered on the basis of the principle involved and not in the way in which it has been raised, namely, on the basis that a particular officer whose resignation was refused has since died in circumstances which everybody regrets.  The legal position is that the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act provides as follows: (1) An officer may tender to the President the resignation of his commission; (2) the President, on the advice of the Government, may accept or refuse to accept the tender by an officer of the resignation of his commission; and (3) an officer who has tendered <Col N="535" /> the resignation of his commission shall not, unless otherwise ordered by the Minister, be relieved of his military duties, unless and until the resignation of his commission has been accepted by the President, on the advice of the Government.  Let me emphasise that this is not a provision introduced for the first time during the emergency, as Deputy Cowan suggested.</P>
    <P>It has been there in its present form since 1937, and, under the original 1923 Act, when the Executive Council had the functions now exercised by the President, there was likewise no compulsion on that body to accept a resignation. The Minister for Defence is not empowered to refuse the tender of his resignation by an officer.  The Minister, of course, can make a recommendation to the Government which, in turn, may advise the President. Defence Force Regulation A 15 prescribes that the tender of a resignation of a commission is to be made to the President through the usual military channels.</P>
    <P>If the military authorities do not recommend acceptance of a tender of resignation and if the Minister agrees, the facts are put to the Government, with a recommendation that the Government should advise the President to refuse to accept the resignation. As the retention of disgruntled officers would not be calculated to give satisfaction, it will be appreciated that a recommendation to refuse to accept a resignation is not made without very careful consideration.  The number of such cases is small.</P>
    <P>The officer to whom reference has been made in the course of the discussion on the Estimate tendered the resignation of his commission in February, 1952.  He had just completed his training as a pilot and it was known that he, with three other young air officers, had applied for an appointment with Aer Lingus.  The Army authorities considered that it would be most undesirable that all the time, effort and expense associated with the technical training of an Air Corps pilot should be lost through his retirement <Col N="536" /> to civil life just at the moment when he had become of use to his corps and they considered, furthermore, that it would be most objectionable that officers should make use of the Army for their own personal gain and convenience or should avail of valuable training received at State expense to secure possibly more lucrative employment outside the Army, without having first given some service in return.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations, it was felt that the release of Air Corps pilots at the time would seriously retard the development of a scheme then under consideration in consultation with Aer Lingus.  The scheme, envisaging a system of short service commissions in the Air Corps with the dual object of providing pilots suitable for Aer Lingus and for the Reserve of the Corps, required the services of potential instructors to implement it. The authorities of Aer Lingus agreed that nothing should be done which would prejudice the launching and development of the scheme.  The full facts were put before the Government with the recommendation that they should advise the President that he should refuse to accept the tender of the resignation and the President, acting on the advice of the Government, refused accordingly.</P>
    <P>I might mention that the Special Committee on the Defence Bill accepted the viewpoint that the President, acting on the advice of the Government, should be able to refuse an officer's resignation.  As far as I know, the position is similar in other armies.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to note that at the end of 1952 two Air Corps Officers were allowed to retire to take up appointments with Aer Lingus.  They were appointed to the Reserve of officers.  Both of these officers had given 12½ years' service in the Air Corps and their services were not essential in connection with the proposed short service commission scheme. The Minister, as a result, consented to their resignation.</P>
    <P>A number of points were made about military service pensions but none of them was new, and I have <Col N="537" /> dealt with them all on various occasions, some of them as recently as in the course of the debate on the Military Service Pensions Bill earlier this year.  The first, that of petitions, was mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell. As I have stated on a number of occasions, the Referee and Advisory Committee in dealing with these petitions are not hearing appeals in the ordinary sense.  The applicant is putting forward additional reasons or evidence in favour of his contention that he is entitled to a service certificate. Already over 1,000 of these petitions have been successful and this shows, better than anything else, that the Referee is in no way embarrassed in dealing with these petitions and neither are the interests of the applicants prejudiced by the fact that he is doing so.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not see that any purpose whatever would be served by accepting the suggestion made by Deputy O'Donnell and, I think, supported by other Deputies, that there should be some form of appeal court.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin spoke about the claims of persons who had died.  In such cases, if the claim of the deceased to a service certificate is established the pension accrued up to the date of his death becomes part of his estate.  I am not sure if that is the point the Deputy was impressing on me but, if it is not, then the only other point that I can imagine he was attempting to deal with is the case of an applicant which has not been finished and who dies before it is completed.  In that case the examination terminates and cannot be brought to a conclusion.  If, however, the Deputy's point is that the pension should continue to go to the next-of-kin or to the dependents, well, that is out.  We could not agree to that at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton referred to military service pension applicants who are informed that there is not <i>prima facie</i> evidence that they are persons to whom the Acts apply and whose claims are therefore rejected without their being called before the Referee.  Deputy Norton seemed to be under the impression that that was not in conformity <Col N="538" /> with the Act.  I have looked up the Act of 1949 and there is no doubt whatever that the Military Service Pensions Act, 1949, provides, as regards petitions made under that Act, that unless there is a <i>prima facie</i> case the Referee or Board of Assessors, as the case may be, will not consider the petitions.  The 28-day notice may be given to enable the applicant to produce evidence that he is a person to whom the Acts apply, but to suggest that every petitioner should get an oral hearing would be no kindness to the applicants themselves since they would have to waste their time and incur expense in attending for hearing, the result of which was already a foregone conclusion.  Furthermore, it would bring about a worsening of the position about which other Deputies are complaining, namely, that there is already too much delay in bringing these applications to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed their anxiety that the text of the Army Pensions Bill should be circulated as soon as possible.  All I can say to that is that there is no one more concerned in that respect that I am, because I would like to see that Bill before the House at the earliest possible moment. I believe that its passing, like the passing of the I.R.A. Pensions Bill, will bring relief to quite a number of people.</P>
    <P>Questions were also raised in respect to fisheries protection.  Deputy Esmonde was particularly interested in that matter.  He was inclined to think that the corvettes were not the most useful type of vessels for dealing with fishery protection.  There were also suggestions made that we could have a more effective protection if we utilised the Air Force in that respect. The position as I know it is that there is always available in the general headquarters a naval officer who is to be found there the whole 24 hours of the day.  There is an arrangement with the Gardaí and sections of the Department of Agriculture whereby if any necessity should arise for getting in touch with the naval officer in order to inform him of the presence of poachers, it can be done most speedily by that means.  The utilisation of aircraft <Col N="539" /> is out of the question completely. All that the aircraft would do is what the Gardaí do, that would be, to inform the authorities at headquarters of the presence of poachers.</P>
    <P>I am not sure&mdash;I am making a guess &mdash;but I am inclined to think that we have something like 2,000 miles of coast to cover.  Two corvettes could not possibly be expected to do that.  We possess three but there is always one in for overhaul.  I would suggest that these corvettes can only cover a very limited area.  If, for instance, one of them is patrolling the West coast, which is probably from 500 to 600 miles long, and if they are informed that poaching is taking place at some very great distance, they can do very little about it.</P>
    <P>The only way I see that we can have effective protection would be by purchasing six, or perhaps eight, boats of the type which we had formerly. That is, fast motor torpedo-boats capable of doing something like 45 knots but which are not capable of going out on the West coast in anything like stormy weather.  Therefore we get down to the position that it will be necessary to have these boats scattered around the coast in the various harbours convenient to where we are told those poachers operate.  I can conceive no other way.  I want to be straightforward with the House and to tell them that with the limited number of corvettes we have we cannot be expected to give effective protection.</P>
    <P>To date, there have been something like 17 instances in which boats have been apprehended and, under the circumstances, that is not a bad record. The protection could perhaps be more effective if we had more effective craft. The question is whether the State is prepared to expend a very large sum of money on the boats to which I have referred which, I understand, is something in the region of £60,000.</P>
    <P>They would not be very effective for anything else.  The matter, however, is being considered by the specialists of my Department and we can only hope that that will result in some more effective method of dealing with that <Col N="540" /> particular kind of poachers.  Whatever we may decide to do, the House will have to be prepared to agree to the expenditure of what I suggest would be a very considerable sum of money.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points raised.  If, I have overlooked any of them, I can assure the House. as I have on other occasions that the debates will be carefully examined and if any point is overlooked by me it will be dealt with by the Department.</P>

      <P>The position in regard to pensions is this.  Deputy Norton appeared to think that we had no right to turn down a case without oral examination.  Actually, the 1949 Act covered that.  It states in the clearest and most unequivocal language that, if the Referee's opinion is that there is not a <i>prima facie</i> case, he need not call the petitioner.  The petitioner is only entitled to that if he can produce evidence to satisfy the Referee that he is entitled to a pension.  Supposing he simply makes an application and cannot produce such evidence, the Referee can decide that there is not a <i>prima facie</i> case, that it was not produced before and that no effort was made to produce it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of amendments have been tabled by the Minister since the Second Reading of the Bill, including seven or eight new sections and sub-sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new sections and the amendments would constitute a new Bill in themselves.  I suggest to the Minister that he should withdraw the present Bill and incorporate the proposed amendments and the new sections of the old Bill in one document and then present it to the House.  I can quite understand that since the drafting of the original Bill, new considerations <Col N="543" /> have come to light that might necessitate certain amendments and the moving of new sections in the Bill.  So many things have come to light that the sheaf of amendments proposed by the Minister practically constitute a new Land Bill in themselves.  I suggest that the Minister should withdraw the present Bill and incorporate the amendments and the Bill in a new one and put it to the House again.  I say that not for the purpose of making things awkward for the Minister but certainly he has made things very awkward for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that these amendments look rather formidable by reason of the number of clauses but, in fact, they are largely of a drafting nature.  Apart from the question of the issue of new bonds in cases where bonds have not already been issued to provide for the additional payments necessary, or the provision of bonus bonds in cases where the bonds have already been issued, it is not considered desirable to have two separate series of bonds dealing with a particular transaction; we have to have the bonds all of one series, if possible.  That is the design of the amendments dealing with the land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another portion of the Bill deals with technical matters which undoubtedly have been amplified in my amendments. The substance of them is simply to make the clauses in the existing Land Acts, which are applicable in the case of untenanted or acquired land in regard to the different stages of acquisition&mdash;the vesting in the Land Commission and the charging of rights against the price &mdash; also applicable to resumption cases.  The law adviser of the Department believes it is necessary; it is not that the problem has arisen in court or that a certain procedure has not been followed based on what we believe to have been the intention generally in the Land Acts, but we think that it should be made clear specifically that the same procedure which has been followed over a period of years and which it was clearly the intention of the Legislature <Col N="544" /> should be followed with regard to taxation cases, should hold also in regard to resumption.  When we come to the particular amendments, I shall try to explain as well as I can, if there are any difficulties the Deputy has in following the amendments which I have put down.</P>
    <P>It would be quite impossible for me to introduce a Bill which would avoid these cross references.  Besides, the whole position of land purchase is in question at the moment until we get this Bill through.  The issue of bonds for land purchase transactions is held up.  So it is really an urgent matter. Therefore, I would ask the Deputy to be kind enough, in view of what I have said, to facilitate the speedy passage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say from previous experience that the Minister has my sympathy in trying to put amendments through in this House or even trying to understand Land Bills, because land legislation is most intricate and highly technical.  However, I believe the Minister would, by acceding to my request, be actually making for speed.  What is happening is that we have a Bill on one side and a sheaf of amendments and sections on the other side.  It is as if two pieces of legislation dovetailing into one another had been pulled apart.  I can assure the Minister that I do not want to delay the passage of the Bill, but I do say that it would lead to a better understanding and it would be better for the Minister and all concerned if my suggestion were adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like also if the Minister would accept the suggestion of Deputy Blowick with regard to bringing in a more suitable Bill that might not be the subject of so many amendments.  I am aware, and the Minister is aware, too, that large acreages of land were taken from people many years ago and on that land roads and houses have been built, but those people have not received one farthing yet.  They are still waiting to be paid.  There is one case in North County Dublin where a man is owed £9,000.  He has not got one farthing of that yet.  That land was taken from <Col N="545" /> him although he wanted to work it himself. His position was facilitated by the Land Commission and the land was re-let to him for a while.  He has probably paid £1,000 or £2,000 back in conacre to the Land Commission for renting that land.  Since then, these roads and houses have been built on the farm and he still did not get a farthing.  This measure should be put through as quickly and as comprehensively as possible to ensure that the many people throughout the country who are still waiting for their money because legislation of this nature has not yet gone through the House, will be paid without delay.</P>

      <P>They do need rather different consideration of the Bill than before.  Perhaps the point could be met if the Minister would agree to this suggestion.  If we are taking the Committee Stage now, it will not be till the end of the Committee Stage that we will have one dovetailed measure.  If there is still difficulty perhaps the Minister would agree to recommit on the Report Stage.  The Minister knows we do not want to hold up the Bill.  We have been asking the Parliamentary Secretary continually when this Bill would be taken.  It was not through any fault of ours or of the Minister's that it was not taken before. However, there would be a desire to consider the matter in a slightly more detailed way than the Report Stage would permit when the Bill is as one <Col N="546" /> integrated whole.  If that did arise, it could be met if the Minister would be agreeable to recommittal then.</P>

      <P>When the Dáil assembled to-day I gave notice that, with your permission, Sir, I would raise on the Adjournment the matter of the reported intimidation of Dublin cinema proprietors by groups opposed to the showing in Ireland of films of the British Coronation ceremony and the threat to the freedom and liberty of the citizens involved therein.  To me, this is a matter of the gravest consequence. For many centuries the people of Ireland have struggled and fought for freedom and, by the sacrifices of our soldiers and the wisdom of our statesmen, we have achieved political freedom for 26 of our 32 counties. We have still to achieve the unification of all our national territory but recent world developments and events give grounds for hope that that unification will be brought about in the near future by the sound common sense of our statesmen and in an atmosphere of peace and goodwill.  The freedom we now enjoy was achieved through tears, blood and sweat.  Freedom, as envisaged by all our patriots, soldiers and statesmen in every generation, comprised liberty of the individual and the individual rights and civil liberties enshrined in, and guaranteed to us all <Col N="547" /> by the Constitution under which we live.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of public meeting, freedom to form organisations, freedom of religion and, in general, freedom to live and enjoy life within the statutes and laws of the country.  In recent weeks, the public have been seriously disturbed by rumours and rumblings of threats to our cinema proprietors if they should show to their patrons, our fellow citizens, pictures of the British Coronation ceremonies.  The public have indeed been alarmed by the information that the cinema proprietors were, in fact, intimidated by the threats and that, as a result, they would not show these pictures in their cinemas.</P>
      <P>The laws of this country do not sanction or permit threats of this kind issued by some group or groups of people who have arrogated to themselves powers that Parliament would be very slow to entrust even to our lawfully elected Government.  If the ukase of these groups is to operate in the way it has, we have to ask ourselves whether we are living under democratic Government or under a tyranny of the most detestable kind.  If any group of people arrogate or assume to themselves such powers and exercise them, it engages in unlawful activity against the people and the ordinary citizen must look to the Government for protection against such tyranny and dictatorship.</P>
      <P>In Britain to-day the British people are engaged in important national celebrations.  Their Queen is being crowned with all the pomp and ceremony associated with that historic event.  Nearly every nation in the civilised world is represented at the Coronation, and the ordinary people everywhere are interested in the panoply and splendour of the ceremonies, and particularly in their colourful spectacles and displays of pageantry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, personally, am not much interested in cinema shows as a rule and the fact that the pageantry of to-day's event <Col N="548" /> is filmed will not, in itself, attract me to the cinema.  I am, need I say, opposed to portion of Her Majesty's title and I repudiate the claim of her principal Government to exercise sovereignty over any part of Ireland. My opposition to that claim, however, will not be weakened in any way by the fact that I may see a film of the Coronation, either on the screen or on television, or that I may see pictures or descriptions of it in the newspapers.  I would have no right to seek to prevent any Irish citizen seeing the film or pictures of the Coronation and I will not permit any other citizen or group of citizens to prevent me seeing these pictures or films, if I should want to see them.</P>
    <P>In this part of Ireland we have had 30 years of political freedom and surely our nationalism and patriotism is not now so weak as to be endangered by pictures of royal pageantry in Great Britain.  If a group of individuals can prevent our citizens seeing these films, then there is nothing to stop that or another group from preventing us seeing any other film.  There is nothing to stop another group from preventing us reading the things we want to read, nothing to stop another group preventing us drinking what we want to drink.  And if those things happen then it is good-bye to freedom and individual liberty, good-bye to democracy.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to a number of men and women who carried on their shoulders a big part of the burden of the struggle for independence.  These men and women fought for the fundamental rights and civil liberties guaranteed in our Constitution.  These men and women are appalled, as I am, by the danger to our freedom and civil liberties involved in the threats to our cinema proprietors and to the owners of television sets.  These men and women look to the Government to guarantee our freedom and civil liberties against the sort of tyranny that is in danger of growing in our community.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to believe that the persons concerned do not know what they do, are not conversant with the seriousness of their actions and do not appreciate that the success of their <Col N="549" /> present actions could lead only to tyranny, dictatorship and the destruction of our freedom and liberties. Every person has the right to stay away from these films, has the right to advise people not to attend them, but he has no right by threats and intimidation to prevent people engaging in their lawful avocations or to prevent citizens enjoying the freedom and liberty purchased for them at the cost of much suffering and sacrifices by the patriots and statesmen whom all of us honour and respect.</P>

      <P>The first intimation that I received that there was any move to prevent the showing of films was about three weeks ago when I was approached by representatives of the cinema section of the Transport Workers' Union.  They did not say that they had been threatened but they told me that they had been requested not to operate cinema machines if they were showing these Coronation films.  I told them that all I could do was to say that if they insisted on their right to show these films and did not claim the right to censor them, they would get all the protection the Government could afford them.  I heard no more about the matter until the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána got a letter from the manager of a Dublin cinema enclosing a copy of two letters he had received in connection with the showing of films of the British Coronation.  This cinema manager asked the Commissioner for his guidance in the matter. In particular, he asked if in the Commissioner's view there was any danger of damage being caused to the cinema and to its patrons.  He also asked what steps the Commissioner intended to take to protect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That letter was received on the 6th May and the Commissioner replied to the manager saying that the Gardaí regarded it as probable that there would be organised protests against the exhibition of Coronation films and that these protests might result in damage to cinema property and cause panic among patrons.  The Commissioner assured the manager that the Gardaí would take all possible steps to prevent damage to property or injury to <Col N="550" /> persons but he pointed out that any steps the Gardaí might take might not be effective in preventing damage or injury.  That will be easily understood in a City containing over 500,000 people.  He also said that the local Superintendent would get in touch with the cinema manager with a view to seeking his co-operation in the measures to be taken by the police.</P>
    <P>I am glad that Deputy Cowan has raised this matter because I think there is a kind of opinion abroad that the Government has in some way allowed itself to be intimidated.  I can assure the House and Deputy Cowan that anything the Guards could do to protect people exercising their right to show such films they would do.  I think the reply the Commissioner sent made it perfectly clear to the manager concerned that the Gardaí would give all the protection they could.  Naturally, in a big city like this one could not guarantee, if it was decided to show these films, that some irresponsible person or organised group would not make trouble, cause panic and perhaps damage to cinema property.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to that letter having been sent by the Commissioner's private secretary to the cinema manager, the Garda authorities learned that, nothwithstanding this guarantee of protection the manager of the cinema in question and of other cinemas decided not to show films of the Coronation.  There the matter rests. All I can say is that if cinema proprietors insisted on their right to show these films the Garda Síochána and the Government would have given them all the protection they could.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Cowan has said.  I am sure every right-thinking person agrees that we could not allow any group of people to dictate to any body here what they are to see and what they are not to see.  As far as we are concerned, if people insist on their right to show the films I, as Minister for Justice, will do all in my power to see that they are protected. Further than that I do not think there is anything more I can do or say.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 3rd June, 1953.</P>
