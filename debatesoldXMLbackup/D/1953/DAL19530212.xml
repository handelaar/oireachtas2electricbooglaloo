    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 38, after &ldquo;following&rdquo; to add &ldquo;provided that the fair trade commission so recommended.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am not quite clear exactly what Deputy Dockrell has in mind but for the purpose of getting the matter clarified in the House and without at this stage committing myself either way I move the amendment.  I cannot understand the phrasing of the section as it is and how the Minister could make an Order if it was not recommended. Is it intended in the section, as it is framed by the Minister, that he can do something that the commission recommends that he should not do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission makes a report under Sections 5 and 6 in which they set out the conditions obtaining in regard to the supply and distribution of goods and the extent to which these conditions prevent or restrict competition or involve price maintenance.  They give their opinion as to whether these practices in the trade are or are not contrary to the <Col N="830" /> public interest and the reasons for their conclusions.  The Minister gets that report, considers it and decides whether, on the basis of the information, it is desirable to take further action in the form of making an Order and proposing legislation to the Dáil. Deputy Dockrell's point, as far as I understand it, is that the Minister should not be empowered to take any action unless the commission recommends that action should be taken. That would leave the position that while the Minister could refuse to act on a recommendation he could not act without a recommendation.  I think that is undesirable.</P>
      <P>The report having been received, it should be the Minister's duty to decide whether action is required or not and to justify that decision to the Dáil.  It seems to me that this amendment would create a peculiar situation, that some other Deputies having got the report and having read it, could propose that action should be taken on it to restrict the practices dealt with in the report which the Minister could not.  That would be a most peculiar situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That certainly would appear to be a peculiar situation.  If the Minister looks at sub-section (2) of Section 7 which has just been discussed he will see that there is provision there that the commission must submit a draft form of order so that the position is not quite as the Minister suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If they have decided that these practices should be restrained or dealt with in some way they should indicate the precise action they think is necessary in the public interest.  I think it is undesirable to leave the situation one in which the Minister cannot take action on his own decision even without a recommendation from the Dáil.  He would have to defend his action to the Dáil and could only succeed in doing it if he convinced the Dáil that it was desirable to take it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Perhaps, I should explain that Deputy Dockrell is ill.  If there is some point I have overlooked, perhaps, Deputy Dockrell could <Col N="831" /> be permitted to put it down for discussion on the Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete paragraph (f), lines 51 and 52.</P>
      <P>This amendment is not consequential at all as I understand it.  I would like the Minister to explain what he anticipates is the type of matter that will come under clause (f).  It seems to me that in dealing with the remaining five previous paragraphs he has dealt with every type of thing that is required, particularly in paragraph (e).  As I understand it this Bill is to ensure the equitable treatment of all persons in regard to the supply or distribution of goods.  That is the necessity, to ensure that equitable treatment is the basis of regulating the practices.  I am not a bit clear as to what the Minister intends to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There was some difficulty in drafting this section and in expressing the various courses of action which the Minister could take to deal with restrictive trade practices which had been brought to his notice in a report from the commission.  The difficulty arose out of the assumption that the investigations of the commission might reveal undesirable practices different from those which had been generally mentioned in the course of our debate.  It was thought desirable that this section should be drawn up with a wider provision so that the Order could, in fact, prescribe measures for dealing with practices of, perhaps, an unusual or peculiar nature that might be revealed in the course of investigation.  It was thought undesirable to restrict the section too rigidly in defining courses of action so that there would be a certain freedom of choice in the measures to be adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Clause (e) deals with the equitable treatment of all persons in regard to the supply or distribution of goods and the conditions under which goods may be sold generally. It would appear that clause (f) was intended to be the omnibus clause which would catch in its scope any type of practice the commission thought would be undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought clause (e) was put in as the omnibus clause, that it was not considered sufficiently omnibus and that clause (f) was put in without deleting clause (e).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (3) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  If the Minister revokes or amends any such Order he shall forthwith lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement giving his reasons for such revocation or amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30, which stands in the name of Deputy Norton and in my name:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Where the commission receives from any person or organisation <Col N="834" /> complaints as to restrictive practices in connection with the supply and distribution of goods and the operation of Orders under Section 8 they shall investigate such complaints, inform the complainant as to whether or not they found the complaint proven, and shall where necessary report to the Minister on this investigation and recommend what action should be taken thereon.</P>
    <P>The point of this amendment is that, in Section 9, there is provision that the commission will keep under review the general effect, so far as the public interest is concerned, of restrictive practices and the operation of the various Orders made by the Minister. That indicates quite clearly that there is a requirement on the commission to exercise their own initiative in the matter.  We feel, however, that there should be facilities to enable any member of the public to bring the attention of the commission to any particular complaint they may wish to make.  More than that, we think it is necessary that the commission should be empowered not merely to receive the complaint which would automatically follow by reason of the setting up of the commission, but that they should be empowered to investigate the complaint and to inform the complainant as to whether or not there was ground for the complaint.</P>
    <P>From our experience in regard to the Factory Acts, a trade union very often makes complaints to the Department, and these complaints are investigated by the officers, but we never find out the result of the investigation. In so far as we are concerned with protecting the public interest and individual members of the public, we feel that not merely should they have the right to submit their complaint to the commission, but that they should be informed whether the complaint has been investigated and what substance has been found in it, so that they would be in a position to decide whether or not they desire to have the matter pressed further either by raising it in this House or, if necessary, by having the matter brought directly to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Col N="835" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this amendment is based on some misunderstanding of the form of the Bill.  It is obvious that a person who desires to make a complaint about the prevalence of some restricted practice would act under Section 6.  He would go to the commission or to the Minister with a proposal that the practice of which he was complaining should be investigated by the commission or perhaps, alternatively, under Section 3, with a view to having fair trade rules made. It is only following the examination of a complaint and a report by the commission that the Minister would have power to make an Order and that that Order would be confirmed by legislation.  If that has been done, then a complaint that the legislation has not been observed would be a matter for the courts and not one for the commission.  It would be a matter for representation to the Minister with a view to having action taken against the defaulters or action taken independently in the courts.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that it is inappropriate that this provision should be inserted under Section 9.  An individual can move under Section 3 or Section 6.  Probably most approaches will be made under Section 6 with a view to inquiry.  If an inquiry has been made and if, following that, an Order is made and that Order is not observed, then it is a matter for the courts and not for the commission. Therefore, it is inappropriate to provide for action by individuals under this section.  Either they move under Section 6 or initiate proceedings to get action taken in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with the general review which the commission is required to undertake in respect of restrictive practices and the Orders signed by the Minister.  Clearly, if the commission is to form an opinion that over a period a new form of restrictive practice or evasion has been established and can form that opinion not merely on the formal complaint of associations referred to in Section 3 but as a result of formal inquiry, the ordinary process of establishing that there is a situation that requires to be inquired into on their initiative must be <Col N="836" /> as a result of collective information received from time to time, and so forth.  As far as Section 3 is concerned, the application for the making of fair trading conditions is confined to associations.</P>
      <P>So far as Section 6 is concerned, it might be that the commission could act on the complaint of an individual but that is a very formal approach.  It requires the commission to consider the matter.  It may even need the same attention of the Minister.  I am concerned with the individual member of the public.  The general form of trade restrictions emanates not merely from the top&mdash;by decisions from associations, and so forth: it also starts to make itself felt in regard to practices that gradually come from individual consumers. Many of them can be dealt with before they become embodied in the rules of an association.  I think it would be of benefit to the commission that this approach should be possible. All that is in the amendment is that, as a matter of courtesy, after receiving a complaint, the commission would inform the complainant that it has been investigated and also what substance was in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy's view at all, but I think this amendment relates to the wrong section of the Bill.  There are two categories of restrictive practices which come for consideration in this connection&mdash;(1) those in respect of which the commission has taken no action as yet and (2) those in respect of which it has taken action.  With regard to the first category, complaints that restrictive practices prevail may be made either to the commission or to the Minister and the commission, on its own initiative or by request, may proceed to investigate these practices.  It is to be assumed that the great majority of complaints from individuals will relate to practices which have not been investigated and will take the form of a request that they be investigated.  If that is done, a report is made and a Bill is passed.  If, at that stage, there is complaint that the requirements of legislation are not being observed, that the restrictive practices against which the legislation is directed are still <Col N="837" /> prevailing, then the representations would go to the Minister with a view to taking proceedings under Section 14 in the courts.  It is then a matter of law and the requirements of legislation would have to be enforced through the courts.</P>

      <P>Under this Section 9 we are directing the commission to keep under general review the operation of the Orders under Section 8.  If the commission are to keep obedience to these rules in operation, then it will be open to people to make representations to them that in their general review they should advert to the fact that these Orders are not being kept.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt?  It is not so much that.  An Order is made and a Bill is passed prescribing certain rules for the particular trade. It is undesirable that the position should be left that these rules can never be altered even if it is proved, in experience, that, in their operation, they are detrimental to public interest. The idea of Section 9 is to ensure that the commission will always keep these operations under review&mdash;not to enforce them, but to see if the Order should be amended and recommend an amendment of it to the Minister, with a view to having amending legislation submitted to the Dáil.  If there is failure to obey the law, then, of course, the Minister can be challenged here for not proceeding under Section 14.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point in referring to Sections 3 and 6 that we are dealing with conditions in respect of which no legislation has yet been made.  In Section 8 we are dealing with the position where Orders have been made.  Our common experience, in regard to the ability to obey Orders, is that no one will know that more quickly than the <Col N="838" /> consumer who comes up against an individual person engaged in trade.  I think, from that point of view, it would be well that we should have the assistance of those persons who would be in the way of getting complaints.</P>
      <P>The point that I am stressing is that, having received complaints, there should be some obligation on the commission at least to deal with them in a courteous way by acknowledging them and investigating them, and indicating whether there was some foundation for the complaints.  Our experience in regard to factory legislation has been that we find ourselves up against this same problem of evasion.  We make the complaints, and it is practically impossible to find out afterwards, unless you watch the reports in the newspapers, what have been the actual results of the complaint. The result is that you get tired making complaints when you think that they are not being treated seriously.  If we ask the commission to keep the operation of these Orders under review, there is no reason why we should not at the same time indicate that the evasion of Orders would be the subject of complaint to the commission and that they would be dealt with when received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot be dealt with by the commission.  If some individual finds that an Order made by the Minister and confirmed by legislation is defective in the sense that objectionable practices still prevailed in the trade, then the only way in which that situation could be dealt with is by an amending Bill.  That is why this section says that the commission will have the general duty of keeping the position under review and of reporting to the Minister so that amending legislation, if the Minister deems it to be desirable, can be proposed to the Dáil.  I do not think it is necessary to put into the Bill a provision requiring the commission to act courteously to people who make complaints. The purpose of the section is to entitle them to receive representations to the effect that Orders made were not satisfactory and should be amended.  You could hardly expect the <Col N="839" /> commission to write to a private individual and say that the Order was defective.  Its responsibility will be to report to the Minister and say that the Order requires amendment.</P>

      <P>My point is that it is very easy to &ldquo;brown off&rdquo; people by merely continuing to receive complaints from them.  The result is that they never know what happens to them afterwards.  If the commission is to keep these matters under review, how is it going to do it unless we supply it with an army of inspectors?  Surely, the most effective people to assist the commission would be those referred to in the amendment.</P>

      <P>It shall be lawful for a court of competent jurisdiction to grant an injunction on the motion of the Minister or of any other person to enforce compliance with the terms of an Order under Section 8 for the time being in force notwithstanding that any other proceedings, civil or criminal, may lie for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was some misunderstanding, I think, shown during the debate on the Second Reading as to the effect of Section 10.  I have thought it desirable to clear up that misunderstanding by <Col N="840" /> this amendment in Committee.  The misunderstanding arose out of the use of the term &ldquo;notwithstanding any rule of law&rdquo;.  The meaning of that phrase simply is that, in considering an application for an injunction, the court will be aware that it is a rule of law that the court should not grant an injunction where an alternative remedy is available to the applicant.  The amendment which I am proposing is really a drafting amendment.  It is designed to remove any misunderstanding in regard to the use of the term &ldquo;notwithstanding any rule of law&rdquo;, and make it clear that the court may grant an injunction either on the motion of the Minister or other person to enforce compliance with an Order made under Section 8, notwithstanding that other courses of action are open either to the Minister or to the individual concerned.</P>

It occurred to me that Deputy Costello might have some point in mind different from the one that I have mentioned and that I had better wait for his explanation with a view to meeting it if possible on the Report Stage.  If, however, the sole purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the court will not consider an application for an injunction except from some person who is interested in <Col N="841" /> the matter, then I am advised the amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 35, standing in the name of Deputy J. A. Costello:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the new section proposed in amendment No. 31 three new subsections as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Any person against whom any such injunction is sought shall be at liberty notwithstanding anything in this Act contained to oppose the grant of such an injunction and no such injunction shall be granted if he establishes to the satisfaction of the court that notwithstanding any Order under Section 8 for the time being in force he has not been a party or privy to any restrictive trade practices within the scope or intendment of such Order.</P>
      <P>(3)  Pending the final determination of any such application as aforesaid the court shall have power in its discretion if satisfied that the justice of the case and the public interest requires it, to make an interlocutory injunction within the terms of such an Order pending final determination of the matter.</P>
      <P>(4)  The court shall have power in its discretion to award costs in such proceedings and in particular if satisfied that it would in the circumstances of the particular case be just so to do order that as a condition of the person against whom any such injunction is sought being at liberty to defend such application he be liable irrespective of the final result for the entire or such portion of the costs as the court shall determine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of Deputy Costello's amendment is clear enough.  It proposes to <Col N="842" /> give to a person against whom a course of action is being proposed under Section 10 as it stands an opportunity of opposing the action if he has not been a party to or concerned in a restrictive practice within the scope of the Order.  I can quite see an objection being made by the Minister at once that the effect of that will be that one small section of a particular association or interest can hold up action in respect of the entire interest. I do not think, however, that that is in any way a valid objection and I do not think that the other objection that can be made in the normal course of events, that the effect of this section would be that the big combine would have the advantage, can be made because of the power that Deputy Costello proposes to give that a court can make it incumbent on the party moving to agree to pay the costs on the other side, whether he wins or loses.</P>
    <P>If there was not that provision of Deputy Costello's in the Bill, then I can quite see a case being made against it that it would obviously favour the big man who could afford to go on with the proceedings <i>ad lib</i> right up to the Supreme Court as against the small man.  The court is given specific power in the fourth sub-section that, irrespective of what the result will be, if the court deems it just, it can say to the interest moving the motion: &ldquo;We will not allow you to stay this injunction, to stay the proceedings, for the full consideration of this, unless you undertake to pay the costs of the person opposing, irrespective of the results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is also a provision included in sub-section (3) of Deputy Costello's amendment that the court will have equal power to grant an interim injunction pending the full hearing, but the effect of this will be to ensure that if, and it has been known to happen, Ministers and commissions do unjustly override the legitimate rights of the individual trader indicated, as they have already been indicated in amendment No. 1 and accepted in principle by the Minister, the court will have the power to remedy the injustice and will be entitled to look to the basis of the transaction and not merely accept what <Col N="843" /> might perhaps be described as a political decision by a Minister without regard to the justice of the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of paragraph (2), its purpose is not very clear and, in so far as I have been able to understand it, I am advised that the paragraph is not necessary at all.  Under the law as it stands, any person against whom an injunction is sought is, of course, at liberty to oppose the grant of the injunction. In so far as the concluding part of that paragraph is concerned, an injunction cannot be sought against a person who has not a specific obligation either to do or to refrain from doing a particular thing.  Consequently, a person who would not be under an obligation imposed by an Act of the Oireachtas, that is, an Act confirming an Order under Section 8, could not be proceeded against for an injunction under the section at all.</P>
      <P>As far as paragraph (2) is concerned, unless there is some point that I have not grasped intended to be met by it, it seems to me to be unnecessary.  So far as the second paragraph is concerned, I am advised that that is definitely so, that it is unnecessary, that Section 28 (8) of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Ireland) Act, 1877, empowers the court to grant an interlocutory injunction and that that paragraph is not necessary.</P>
      <P>The next paragraph, however, raises a point on which the legal advisers to the Government take a very definite view.  The Act of 1877 to which I have referred gives the courts power as to the award of costs and they do not require any other powers in that matter.  If the intention of paragraph (4) is, as it appears to be, to provide that the defendant in an injunction suit should be made liable for either a portion or for all of the cost as a condition of his being allowed to defend himself, that is regarded as a most unreasonable provision to make, one which would involve a denial of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, as I understand it, the amendment is either unnecessary or undesirable.  To summarise: in <Col N="844" /> connection with paragraph (2) a person against whom an injunction is sought is entitled to defend himself. An injunction cannot be sought against him at all unless he has in some way infringed a provision of an Act confirming an Order under Section 8.  So far as the second paragraph is concerned, that power is there already and, as far as paragraph (4) is concerned, I understand the power sought there is one that is undesirable and which, if given, would be regarded as an introduction of a new and unreasonable principle in law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what Deputy Costello has in his mind in regard to this amendment but, to be quite honest, I cannot see how he gets it with this form of words in amendment No. 35.  I think what he has in mind is to provide that if an Order is made under Section 8 by the Minister declaring that something is a breach of one of the paragraphs set down in the amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is.  What he was intending to provide was that if an Order was made that X was in breach of one of these specific clauses and that in fact he was not in breach, a person would have the power to show to a court that the Order had been made in error of fact as a defence to an injunction but that that power would not be there purely for the big combine to do it, that there would be a similar power available to the smaller man by means of sub-section (4) to provide that the opposing argument could be put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we can contemplate a situation where a court can decide whether the Oireachtas has or has not made a mistake.  I think there is some misunderstanding here. An Order under Section 8 prohibits certain specific things.  That Order is confirmed by law and the only question that comes before the court is whether an individual in a particular instance contravenes that law or not.  If it is <Col N="845" /> held that he has and an injunction is sought, he can defend himself on the ground that he has not contravened it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only possible interpretation is that Deputy Costello contemplates the Government going into court and saying he has contravened the law by doing something prohibited by the law and the defendant says: &ldquo;I have contravened the law; I am doing something prohibited by the law, but what the law has prohibited is not a restrictive practice, and therefore I should not be expected to obey it.&rdquo;  That seems to be the object of the amendment.  On that assumption, it could not be accepted.  He seeks to provide that an injunction cannot be given unless he is held to have contravened a specific provision of the law, and there is no need for the amendment at all.  Paragraph (2), in any event, is unnecessary as that power is there.  Paragraph (4) appears to introduce an undesirable provision, that the person against whom an injunction is sought may, as a condition of being allowed to defend himself, be required to pay a portion or all the costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>The effect of sub-section (2) is to change a person from being in the position of defending himself to being in the position of taking the initiative.

      <P>Is it clear under the section which the Minister proposes to substitute for Section 10 that a person against whom it is sought to get an injunction is entitled to go into court and say that the Minister has made an Order under Section 8 requiring him to do something or to refrain from doing something which he alleges is unconstitutional?  Let us imagine that a person has refused to comply with an Order, and the Minister seeks to compel him to obey his Order.  Under the new section proposed by the <Col N="846" /> Minister is it clear that that person has the right to go into court and say: &ldquo;I have refused to comply with the Minister's Order, but I have good reasons for it.  I will give the reasons and ask the court not to grant an injunction&rdquo;?  Suppose the court grants the injunction and he goes to the Supreme Court and succeeds in persuading the Supreme Court that he has a constitutional right and that the Order is invalid.</P>
      <P>I take it these three proposals in amendment No. 35 are designed to ensure that such a person, should he succeed in his contention and defeat the Minister's motion to get an injunction against him, would be entitled to recover costs against the Minister for the proceedings in the High Court and in the Supreme Court?

    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to prevent a body of persons or an association from regulating the minimum price for a commodity unless it is in accordance with an arrangement approved by the Minister.  I think the House is familiar with the cases which this amendment is designed to cover. In a recent case a member of a particular trade had sold goods below the specified price which the association representing a number of traders regarded as the minimum price or which they had fixed as the minimum price.  Although that person continued to sell the goods below the price fixed the association succeeded in inducing suppliers to withhold supplies until the particular trader concerned complied with the price regulations which had been made by that association.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside entirely the question of arguing as to whether in present circumstances price cutting is either desirable or beneficial, it seems entirely wrong that any association acting without the authority of a statute or without ministerial authority should arbitrarily decide a price and, if an individual trader or individual traders refuse to comply with the price so fixed, attempt to impose a penalty by the withholding of supplies.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is always desirable here to mention specific cases but this particular case evoked considerable public interest and received a great deal of publicity.  It appears to me to be the type of case this Bill is designed to cover and the proposal in Deputy McGilligan's amendment would ensure that no association, organisation or body of persons could fix or regulate or attempt to fix or regulate a minimum price for a commodity unless that organisation or association had the sanction of the Minister for that arrangement.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything in the amendment which will conflict with the terms of the Bill.  In fact, if the amendment is accepted it will enable the particular abuse to be dealt with or prevent that particular abuse from occurring and will provide legislative <Col N="850" /> sanction for the Minister to enforce compliance with a particular arrangement of which he approves.</P>

      <P>This amendment, together with amendments Nos. 37 and 38, raises of course the big issue as to how this problem of restrictive trade practices can best be approached.  I take it all three amendments stand together because it is the one question that has to be debated in all three of them.  That question is should we approach the problem of restrictive trade practices by providing for their investigation and eradication following such investigation when it has been demonstrated clearly that they are contrary to the public interest?  Or should we in a general way prohibit them all forthwith without investigation and then only permit their restoration as consideration of applications for their restoration proceeds and as some case for them can be shown?</P>
      <P>This is naturally one of the big questions I had to decide in formulating this Bill and I came to the conclusion that it would be better to proceed with the Bill in its present form rather than in the alternative form suggested in these amendments both because of my own recollection of certain problems that had arisen here and because of the experience in other countries.  Investigations that were carried out in other countries seemed to show that it would be very dangerous to proceed by way of a general statutory prohibition on defined practices without any previous investigation of the circumstances of individual trades.</P>
      <P>It is true that the British White Paper which was published in June, 1951, indicated that they were then contemplating proceeding in that way, although the White Paper admitted that some minor arguments could be advanced in favour of the retention of price maintenance arrangements in certain cases.  In fact, the British have not adopted that procedure.  I think they are having second thoughts and are now questioning the wisdom of proceeding on the lines indicated in the White Paper published a couple of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Opposition Deputies know, <Col N="851" /> officers of my Department went under a technical assistance project to the United States of America to examine the experience there in the matter and to discuss the operation of the various State and federal codes there with the officers responsible for them. They got more or less unanimous advice &mdash;off the record&mdash;from those who had the responsibility for making the United States laws effective that it was far better to proceed in the way contemplated by this Bill, that is taking action only after investigation showing action to be justified rather than by attempting to prepare statutory definitions of certain practices and prohibiting them absolutely.</P>
    <P>This particular amendment relates to retail price maintenance.  Many Deputies will remember that there was lively public interest before the war in the practice of some shops in cutting the price of cigarettes.  Cigarettes are the most obvious example we have of goods affected by retail price maintenance agreements between the manufacturers and the retailers.  In that connection the strongest representations in favour of the State taking action to prevent the continuance of the price cutting tactics of certain shops came from the trade union representing employees in that particular type of establishment.  The trade union argued that the operation of these cut price shops was not merely prejudicing the employment of their members but was also restricting the union's power to improve their remuneration.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be taken as saying that I agree entirely with that point of view.  I do not.  But I think it would be very undesirable that we should dismiss it completely without examining the desirability of prohibiting straight away the operation of agreements of that kind without giving the trade unions, or the traders or the manufacturers concerned an opportunity for making the case they believe they can make, that the arrangement operates to ensure better service to the public or more regular conditions in the trade and that any departure from it would be contrary to the public interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> It may be that they could not convince the fair trade commission that their case was a sound one, but I certainly think they should be given an opportunity of making it and that we should not proceed by legislation to ban all these arrangements without giving those who have devised them an opportunity of producing the justification for them.  The same applies to a number of other matters that would arise under these amendments.</P>
    <P>We know that petrol companies are making exclusive dealing arrangements at the moment with garage proprietors. The proprietor enters into an agreement to sell only a particular company's brand of petrol and the company, on its part, undertakes not to supply that brand to other traders in the vicinity.  From many points of view that is one of the most objectionable types of restrictive trade practices.  Yet, it will be strongly argued by the garage proprietors, and I think by the trade unions who cater for the employees of garage proprietors, that it would be contrary to the public interest that petrol pumps should be installed at hotels, public-houses or other places which are not motor garages and are not equipped to give service to motor owners or even to repair a puncture in a tyre, and that there are good reasons of public policy, including a diminution of distribution costs, if delivery is confined to retailers who are <i>bona fide</i> garage proprietors.</P>
    <P>Again, it is possible to argue both ways.  Petrol companies contend strongly that their present arrangement has cut the cost of distribution of petrol by some fraction of one penny per gallon.  Whether that is true or whether it is in the public interest that they should do that, even if it is true, are matters upon which it is difficult to arrive at a conclusion.  I do not think we should attempt to do it until all the facts have been carefully sifted by the commission and a report on those facts made available to us.  I suppose that in respect of every restrictive practice some case can be made that it is not contrary to the public interest.  We all feel that the <Col N="853" /> arguments in favour of these practices are thought of afterwards, that the practices are devised first in the commercial interest of the people concerned and that only subsequently they come around to thinking of arguments based on the public interest to justify them.  There may be cases in which many of us, as individuals, would take a chance on prohibiting a practice straight away without even hearing the case in justification for it believing that the public interest would thereby be served.  But taking this whole problem of restrictive trade practices, the view which I urge is that it is safer and wiser to proceed in the way contemplated here, to establish an investigating authority and to act only when that investigating authority has sifted the facts and has published a report which makes it clear to us that action is necessary in the public interest.  None of us could possibly foresee the immediate consequence on many trades and on many classes of employment if these general prohibitions were enforced without further examination, getting automatically the effect of law on the day this Bill is passed through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan's amendments also contemplate that the subsequent application to be allowed to restore, in individual cases, the practices which will be banned under these provisions should be made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It is obvious that he just could not give a decision on a matter of that kind, a decision which he would almost certainly be required to justify fully here, without carrying out an investigation as thorough as the fair trade commission would have to make.  It would be an undesirable arrangement in which the Minister and the fair trade commission would be simultaneously conducting inquiries into the circumstances of particular trades or the restrictive practices operating in them.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the Industrial Prices and Efficiency Bill, 1947, I contemplated action somewhat along these lines.  I did not propose that investigations should be undertaken by the Minister but by the Prices Commission which was to be established under that Bill. <Col N="854" /> But we did then contemplate a general ban on certain price agreements unless they were submitted to and approved by the Prices Commission.  However, we are now dealing with something more than retail price maintenance. As we are dealing with restrictive practices of every kind, I would strongly urge that we should not proceed upon the basis contemplated in these amendments, that it is wiser to proceed by way of prior investigation before taking action.</P>
    <P>It is also obvious that any such general prohibition as is proposed in these amendments would lead to an immediate rush of applications by various trades to have fair trading rules prepared under Section 3 or permission given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to restore the practices, as contemplated by Deputy McGilligan, and that no machinery of inquiry or investigation could possibly hope to dispose of a proportion of the applications in any reasonable time and, in the meantime, there would certainly be very wide confusion in many trades and possibly serious repercussions on employment in them.  That view may be wrong, but it is because that element of uncertainty is there that I urge the Dáil to agree on the general principle around which the Bill is framed, prior investigation before action rather than the alternative method which these amendments suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether, if this section was inserted, it would result in the situation which the Minister has stated or whether it might be desirable to amend the amendment to the extent of deleting the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and inserting the words &ldquo;fair trade commission.&rdquo;  It would be open to any body or organisation to make a case to the fair trade commission which in turn would have to report to the Minister because either investigation by the fair trade commission, or, if this section was inserted, investigation by the Minister, could not be made effective unless the Minister took action by means of promoting a Bill or an Order in the House.  The cases which this section is designed to cover are those which <Col N="855" /> I mentioned where an association takes action to prevent a person who does not comply with the requirements of that association's views on a particular matter, from receiving supplies of goods either at normal trade rates or at all, as occurred in certain cases.  I think the Minister should consider the desirability of accepting this amendment with the substitution of &ldquo;the fair trade commission&rdquo; for the &ldquo;Minister.&rdquo;  Otherwise there might be great delays in dealing with cases in which individual traders may have difficulties when the commission is established.  It is true, as the Minister stated, that the White Paper which was published in Britain has not been followed by immediate legislation but that White Paper was published. I think, in June, 1951, by the then Labour Government and before action could be taken on it or before that Government introduced legislation, there was a change of Government.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Conservative Government have the same views on resale price maintenance.  This particular amendment, if accepted, would prevent the type of case I referred to earlier where a trader, in order to give what he considered was value to the public, was subsequently penalised by members of an association making representations to his suppliers and ultimately succeeding in withholding supplies from that trader of the particular goods which he was selling. That may seriously interfere with the carrying on by any individual trader of his business or certainly prevent him carrying it on in the way in which he wanted to carry it on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that if this amendment resulted in a great number of applications being made to the commission or to the Minister after the enactment of this legislation, it might cause dislocation in the operation of the Act when passed, but I think that could be avoided and, in any case, it is likely that when this Act is passed a great number of associations, as well as individual traders, will seek to secure from the fair trade commission sanction for their operations and will in the ordinary course make application <Col N="856" /> to it.  I would suggest, anyway, to the Minister that he should consider the amendment with the substitution in paragraph (1) of &ldquo;approved by the fair trade commission&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;approved by the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that this amendment cuts across the broad principles of the Bill.  It is neither feasible nor is it practicable, and certainly I think the Minister has made a good case for further consideration.  May I say, first of all, I am not concerned with the after effects of the working of any price maintenance arrangements because I think our main concern is the maximum prices we are working under rather than the minimum prices? It seems to me that the approach in the amendment is that very facile approach we all are heir to.  We all like to get the bargain for ourselves, but we are not concerned as to the effect of the bargain on somebody else. Naturally, if we go out to shop, we like to think we know some shop where we can buy an article cheaper than anywhere else.</P>
      <P>There is a certain satisfaction in that and the satisfaction continues until we find, in a particular walk of life whether as an employer or as an employee, that our next-door neighbour has gone and bought some particular product we are interested in below the price and we are now suffering because we thought we had been successful in getting a particular bargain.  The implications are wide, not merely from the point of view of the employee&mdash;with whom I am immediately concerned&mdash; but from the whole aspect of maintaining and giving good service and good quality goods and even maintaining individual businesses in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me, first of all, that we should look at the results we will achieve through the application of the present principles and machinery in the Bill before we widen its scope to include not merely retail trade but every sphere of activity in the community. It is quite clear that if a group of shops engaged in the sweet-confectionery business is not to be allowed to maintain a certain minimum <Col N="857" /> price, the same principle could also be argued against the E.S.B., C.I.E. or individual concerns engaged in selling certain goods or services.  It raises issues that, desirable as we may feel it to try and break down the restriction imposed on these practices we are hearing about now, may also create a certain amount of chaos and do a great deal of harm to many sections of our people.</P>
    <P>Where one has to deal with the problem of maintenance of retail prices, the average person does not object to paying a fair price.  It is the feeling that we are being taken advantage of because there is a standard price that makes us go out and look for something else.  If we had an assurance that the standard price was a fair one and was justified by reasonable rates of profit, by provision for maintenance and by reasonable conditions of employment right through the whole process of manufacture of that article, at reasonable rates of pay, no one would object to that since every member of the public in turn is looking for those conditions himself either in his business or in employment.  But as soon as suspicion arises&mdash;and we are entitled to have it because of experience in the past&mdash;we want to smash everything we have, in the hope of solving this problem and getting an assurance of a fair price.</P>
    <P>In many cases, the existence of minimum standard prices has become, as the Minister said, the guarantee for hundreds of thousands of ordinary workers that they in turn will get fair standard rates of wages or conditions. If, in the hope of solving this whole problem of restrictive practices, we impose now this omnibus principle, we may cause dislocations in practices which, although long established, would probably on examination be endorsed by any reasonable man or woman.  We may create difficulties all round us and we are, in turn, leaving the door open, not for the trader who wants to supply cheap goods but for the trader who wants to take advantage ultimately of consumer, manufacturer and supplier.</P>
    <P>Those with some knowledge of the &ldquo;cut-price shops&rdquo; that existed in Dublin for cigarettes, tobacco and <Col N="858" /> sugar-confectionery realise very well that, however much one may desire to stand for a reduction in prices, the background of many of those shops would not bear investigation, not only from the point of view of fair practices but even from the point of view of the law.  We are opening our doors to that kind of abuse.  While all of us are anxious to have this Bill made as effective as possible, we should proceed, not only with understanding of the problem, but we should test the ground as we move forward. We have fairly effective machinery in the Bill as it is.  We can test it and get some indication as to how much further on we can move.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned with the point made by the Minister&mdash;and I do not altogether agree with Deputy Cosgrave &mdash;that if the amendment were adopted, in so far as it prohibits immediately the making of any arrangements in respect of minimum prices or such arrangements in regard to the supply of goods, automatically you must have a large number of applications to the Minister, or to the fair trade commission if that is substituted, and then you are going to break down, by the very weight of the applications, the machinery we are now trying to devise in the hope that it may prove effective in dealing with the problem.  We should not, out of eagerness to settle the problem which has grown up over the years and has become more intense in recent years, try to do more than we are capable of doing at the beginning and in spite of possible repercussions and harm it may create for many thousands in businesses coming under this Bill.</P>

      <P>There is one point I would put to the Minister, arising out of a remark he made in the course of his observations.  I take it we would all be agreed, in our eagerness to deal with the problem, to see that no injustice is done.  Under the existing law there are certain arrangements by certain traders for cash and for a cash consideration covering a period of years.  It would be a matter for consideration whether those should be interfered with or not.</P>

      <P>I think it is an important consideration also.  In reply to Deputy Cosgrave, I am anxious also to eradicate the practices which gave rise to the court proceedings he mentioned. It is not a lack of desire to clear up that situation as quickly as possible that induced me to argue against this amendment: it is rather a conviction that we may destroy the whole attempt by trying to go too fast.  It would be much better to go on a basis of investigation leading up to action, rather than try it the other way round.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely scattered by the development which appears to emerge from Deputy Larkin's point, that is, that we are not all opposed to price rings.  It now appears to emerge that certain price rings are highly desirable and that we ought to walk very warily lest we disrupt them.  I understood that if there was one thing about which there was unanimity in this House it was that price rings should be ended.  What the purpose of this legislation is at all, if our purpose is not to put an end to agreements to restrict trade for the purpose of exploiting the consumer, I am at a loss to understand.  It is the purpose of the Bill.  When I first read it, I urged that Section 4 should be deleted, as it seemed to me that that section created facilities for making trade restrictive rules.  I urged on the House that we ought not do that, bad enough as we were with all the restrictions that exist, and that we should confine our activities to getting rid of restrictions. If I understand Deputy Larkin aright, the trade union view is that certain restrictive trade practices are good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but that is the very point of view against which I most energetically inveighed on Second Reading, and if there was one quarter in which I should have expected to get unqualified agreement with me, it was the Labour Party.  If we are to have now a combination between merchants, industrialists and the trade unions to promote other restrictive practices, we may as well throw our hats at it.  Picture the position of the <Col N="860" /> fair trading commission.  Who is going to make the case against the restrictive trade practice?  Suppose such a practice is designed to exploit the consumer and a manufacturers' organisation comes in and energetically defends it.  Suppose that R.G.D.A.T.A. also comes in and defends it and then the trade unions come in and energetically defend it.  Who is going to make the case against it?  I am appalled because I never believed that such a thing could transpire in this or any other country, and it appears to me that the consumer is going to become the subject of not one vested interest but of the most dangerous of all situations, a combination of vested interests.  It is common knowledge here that a dozen men, well organised, can overwhelm 10,000 who are leaderless. Who is going to make the case for the consumer before this commission?</P>
      <P>I have seen this very dilemma develop in connection with tariffs and quotas.  I have seen bodies of manufacturers combine with trade unions to press for tariffs and quotas in order to maintain price levels which, in my opinion, bore most unjustly on other interests in the country, such as farmers or, indeed, the consumers at large.  The deplorable situation then developed that it was evident that there was nobody prepared to make a case against it.  If anybody did appear to make a case against it, he was attacked from one side as being desirous of sabotaging industrial development, and from the other side, as being desirous of throwing men into unemployment.  There was nobody to say that he was actuated by a desire to protect either the agricultural industry or the consumers at large.  If there is an agreement between an organisation of distributors, the manufacturers and the trade unions that a restrictive practice is a benefit to them all, who is going to make the case against the practice?  Is that not the practical problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy with the Minister's careful approach and his rational desire to avoid precipitating chaos by well-intentioned general regulations which, in practice, will not <Col N="861" /> work.  Could there not be some kind of middle course pursued?  Could we not arrange that a term of months or years would be prescribed within which any agreement for the control of prices, methods of distribution or the three matters referred to in amendments Nos. 36, 37 and 38, would become illegal, if, before the end of that term of years, its nature was not registered either with the fair trading commission or with the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  The really effective way to put an end to evil restrictive practices is to let in upon them the light of day.  I am actuated by no zeal at all to prescribe long terms of imprisonment and heavy penalties.  I believe that public opinion is one of the most effective methods of putting an end to restrictive trade practices or other abuses of that kind.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister's point.  He does not want to make illegal to-morrow morning a thousand practices of which he may have no knowledge at present. Would it not be possible to say that, after 1st January, 1955, practices coming within these categories will be illegal if, prior to that date, full particulars of the agreement implementing them have not been deposited, either with the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the fair trading commission? If a proviso of that kind were made, as these registrations came in to the Minister, those of them which <i>prima facie</i> appeared to be objectionable could promptly be referred to the commission to investigate, the others being set aside until the commission has time on its hands to look into them.  The Minister could forward the ones which seem objectionable and ask the commission to investigate them with any other cases before them.</P>
    <P>Thus, everyone would have full and fair notice that, if they wished to continue a restrictive trade practice, they must file full particulars with the Department, or, if they were not prepared so to file, put a stop to the practice before 1st January, 1955.  Unless something of that kind is done, I foresee a situation in which some of the worse restrictive trade practices operating in this country will continue under an umbrella consisting of a combination <Col N="862" /> of the trade unions, the manufacturers' federation and distributors' organisations acting in collaboration for the maintenance of the most evil practices for the restriction of trade which it is possible to conceive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the practical difficulties that would arise in proceeding on any such course as that suggested by the Deputy is the constitutional problem which might be involved in too wide a delegation of legislative powers by the Oireachtas to a Minister. I came to the conclusion, in framing the Bill, that an Order made by the Minister under it might have such wide repercussions, affecting a large number of traders and a very large number of workers employed by them, as well as the general community, that the Minister should not have the right to make that Order without getting it confirmed by the Oireachtas, that it would represent too great a delegation of legislative functions by the Oireachtas, and that he should come back here and get the sanction of the Oireachtas.  If you accept that idea, it seems to me that there is no really practical alternative to the course proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general question raised by the Deputy, I think the best thing I could do is to refer him to what I said when dealing with the Second Reading.  I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My argument is that these arrangements&mdash;retail price agreements and similar restrictive practices&mdash;operated by private trade associations are open to the suspicion of being operated for the benefit of those engaged in that trade and they should be approached with suspicion. The idea is to have them investigated in that mood by this proposed commission and sanctioned only if the case that they are operating to the public benefit is overwhelmingly established.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we have to rely upon the commission to inject into the examination of all these restrictive practices the element of suspicion that should be there.  They should come to their task full of suspicion wherever restrictive practices are under examination and only permit the maintenance of these <Col N="863" /> practices, as they were previously operated or in some modified form, when that suspicion has been completely removed by the overwhelming nature of the case made for them by the parties concerned.  We have to rely on the commission for that.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 41:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  Where a person is charged with having committed an offence under this section and such person is an employee of another person or of a body corporate or incorporated body it shall be a good defence in law if such a person shall prove to the satisfaction of the court that at the time the offence charged against him was committed he acted under the orders of his employer or employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to try to clarify the position under the section in regard to the ordinary employees.  It is sought to establish, in respect of a person charged with having committed an offence against the section, that where such person is an employee it shall be a good defence &mdash;and here I have frankly to admit to some dubiety&mdash;if he is able to plead that he was acting on orders.  I see various objections to the amendment from the Minister's point of view, but it does seem to me that he should bear in mind that we are dealing now with something that may be fairly complicated so far as the worker is concerned.  If we take it that certain Orders may be made by the Minister of a very widespread and complicated nature, and that in the application of these general Orders an employee is involved, it is quite possible that, so far as he is concerned, not merely will there be ignorance but even a lack of appreciation of the effect of carrying out these orders.  I agree that the amendment as it stands is not altogether satisfactory but I do feel that, in so far as we seem to fail to make a distinction between guilty parties, an <Col N="864" /> effort should be made to make the matter somewhat clearer.  It would be regrettable if we found that an ordinary worker is required not merely to carry out orders but in addition to apply to these orders a judgment based on knowledge which it would not be possible for him to acquire.  I am not pressing the amendment but I think it should be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle which it is sought to establish by this amendment is essentially unsound.  The law does not accept as a good defence the fact that an employee was acting on the orders of his employer, and it seems, on the face of it, to be wrong that an employee should thereby be released from the penalty attaching to a breach of the law.  Our experience in relation to other Acts is that a provision of this kind would make the enforcement of the law practically impossible.  Just try to visualise the various cases that might arise.  A firm has been confining supplies to certain individual retailers and refusing supplies to others.  The fair trading commission says that that is a restrictive practice and that supplies must be made available to all traders.  The firm says: &ldquo;Right; we will give an order to our sales manager to supply these traders,&rdquo; but they continue to supply only favoured traders.  You cannot establish that fact without reference to the records of the firm.  If the secretary takes the records home or loses them, you may be placed in a difficulty unless you can bring a charge against individual officers of the firm who are, in fact, carrying out the orders.  That is particularly the case when you are dealing with a public company, any company formed under the Companies Acts.  Everybody who has an effective voice in the management of the company is, in fact, an employee.</P>

      <P>Would the point be met by leaving out sub-section (2)?  I think we can get an altogether wrong impression of this Bill if we view it primarily as a penal instrument.  The Bill deals with restrictive practices which we wish to change, and there is no necessity to visit such breaches of the law with these heavy punishments.  To send <Col N="865" /> a person to penal servitude for ten years in this context seems utterly ludicrous.  I do not think that the Oireachtas should envisage penal servitude for our neighbours in reference to matters of this kind.</P>

      <P>If we were defending the natural law and providing penalties for crimes such as murder, theft or serious offences of that kind, the imposition of heavy penalties would be justified but there is a great deal of regulatory legislation, conflict with which is not as grave as conflict with legislation designed to defend the natural law.  This is regulatory legislation. I do not want to diminish or belittle in any way the conduct of some person who would set himself up against the law of the country.  That in itself is a grave matter but I think our purpose is to stop certain practices and to bring guilty parties, be they joint stock companies or individual citizens, who are primarily responsible for the attempt to perpetrate these practices, to book and force them to put an end to these activities.  It is not the people who are guilty of these practices with which we are primarily concerned; it is the practices themselves. We want to eliminate the practices and to do it in no vengeful manner.</P>
      <P>Look at sub-section (2):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every person who aids, abets, or assists another person or conspires with another person, to do anything (whether by way of act or omission) the doing of which is declared by sub-section (1) to be an offence shall himself be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to be a more appropriate section to an Act dealing with mayhem, arson or some hideous and disgusting crime with which no respectable citizen would conceivably have any contact whatever.  Take one of the limiting trade regulations with which our social life at present swarms. There are thousands in operation at the present time.  I think this sub-section <Col N="866" /> catches every person who handles merchandise in any way.  Let me try to offer a <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i> Take a firm making fashionable ladies' clothes.  It is a universal practice in the trade that whatever shop in a town handles these fashionable goods asks the manufacturer not to sell these goods to any other shop in that town. These practices exist.  Suppose the practice were stopped and the fashion manufacturer continued to operate the restrictive practice.  Every shopkeeper who accepted goods from the fashion manufacturer would become an offender under Section 11, whether he had any part in making the arrangements or not.  I do not rebut the suggestion that if he were on the receiving end of an illegal practice instituted by the fashion manufacturer, he would be in some sense aiding, abetting or assisting the manufacturer to carry out a practice which had been prohibited.</P>

      <P>I agree with the view put by Deputy Larkin to the Minister. When I was trying to deal with the flour business it was thought necessary to institute a system of costings and that involved getting certain fundamental information from all the mills. It was put to me that the officers who were being vested with the authority to require the information should be authorised not only to deal with the firm concerned but to go to the clerks in any department to get the information.  I said: &ldquo;I shall never give that power to a Government inspector.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never gave power to any Government to go to a business house and ask an old and trusted employee to betray his employer.  If we want to pursue an employer we should go for him and bring him before the courts but it is not fair to ask a man working side by side with an employer for 30 or 40 years and who is on terms <Col N="867" /> of the most intimate confidence with his employer to betray the trust reposed in him by his employer.  The employee feels himself bound by the closest ties of intimacy and trust and to ask an employee to betray his trust is simply not justice and we should not do it.  If an employer is fractious and refuses to conform with the provisions of the legislation passed in the Dáil, we should bring the employer before the court and invoke the proper remedies against him.</P>
    <P>We should never go to his employee and put him in the horrible dilemma of having to break the law or his trust. I can conceive many honourable men who will say: &ldquo;I will not betray my trust under any circumstances.  Confidential information has been given to me on the assumption that I would not disclose it.  I accepted that trust and I will not break it under any circumstances.&rdquo; I can see that in certain circumstances the Oireachtas may have the right to require that trust be broken but I do not think that that is justified in this case.  If there was a crime like murder, manslaughter or one of the greater crimes in question, the Oireachtas would have the right to act in order to prevent the commission of a crime but I do not think that offences contemplated in this Bill come within that category.  I do not think it is fair to put our neighbours in that dilemma. I think the Minister and every Deputy in this House would feel, if they were put in a dilemma of that kind, constrained to say that they would not break their trust.  Let it be fought out with the employer but do not come to me and require me to furnish you with confidential information that the employer gave me.</P>

      <P>The section in question referred particularly to contraventions of an Order made under Section 8. They are listed under six different headings.  A whole number of matters could come under those headings.  Any person, a shop assistant, clerk, etc., who aids, abets or assists another person leaves himself open to committing an offence under the Act.  In Section <Col N="868" /> 13 the penalties are set down.  They are very heavy penalties.  There is no saving clause at all in that section, not even in respect of the most minor worker, the most humble employee or, if I might say so, the most ignorant employee so far as the conduct of the business is concerned.  When we come to deal with a corporate body we make a specific exception in the case of the director or a member of the committee of management who &ldquo;shall also be guilty of an offence unless he shows to the satisfaction of the court that he did not consent to nor approve of the act or omission constituting the offence and that it was not facilitated by any neglect on his part.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the Minister's point of view on this particular point but I do think that to the extent an effort was made, however slight, to deal with the case of the director and the committee of management who would not have a knowledge of all that was being carried on in the business under their control, some regard should also be had for the wage earner, the clerk and the shop assistant working in the same business. We do not even attempt to have some regard for the position of the ordinary worker.  I am not a lawyer and I am not trying to preach what the attitude of the court should be to the director who has no knowledge of this matter or the shop assistant or clerk who was carrying out instructions and was not aware he was committing a breach of the Order.  That is a matter for the court.  Whatever attempt we may make to ease the position of the director or committee of management acting without consent, we should have the same regard for the ordinary worker.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 42:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  No prosecution shall be heard or determined until an injunction shall have been obtained under Section 10.</P>
      <P>To a certain extent this amendment is tied up with the amendment which I put down, amendment No. 31, to Section 10 but it can stand on its own merits irrespective of the fate of the amendment that I proposed to Section 10.  There are two purposes behind this amendment, one is my desire to allow the citizen who is affected by anything done by the commission or done by the order of the commission when giving legal effect to an Act of the Oireachtas to have resort to the courts if an injustice has been done or appears to have been done to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> I have a very uneasy feeling that in our desire to get rid of these restrictive practices we will do a grave injustice to some individual citizen and I want the individual citizen to have resort to the court on the lines I suggested.</P>
    <P>The second purpose I have behind this amendment is much on the line of what Deputy Dillon said, that the approach should not be via the criminal law but via the civil law.  Our Statute Books are cluttered up with Acts very similar to this section and the section provides heavy penalties for doing this, that and the other.  Experience has proved in every court where the legal system is similar to ours that undue penalty provisions defeat themselves. I may be wrong in this but I believe the reason why the provision for an injunction to the civil courts was thought of was because of the failure of the criminal procedure to deal with matters of restrictive practices. The Minister probably has more resort to the literature on this subject than I have.  Such limited reading as I have been enabled to do has led me to the conclusion that the suggestions of injunction proceedings in the civil courts, which are comparatively recent in origin, were made because of failure to deal with the situation through the criminal law.  I do not know that any other country has a provision in its legislation dealing with restrictive practices or trusts or monopolies or matters of that kind such as is contained in Section 10 of this Bill providing that it shall be lawful for the civil courts to grant an injunction.  I think that if we get this Bill through we shall be the first country to put that on the Statute Book.  I may be wrong but that is my impression.  I suggest to the Minister, in complete agreement with my colleague, Deputy Dillon, that the whole approach should be on the civil side of the courts.  It is far more effective to obtain an injunction from our courts than to get any number of prosecutions in the District Courts.  The machinery of injunction is a powerful instrument to secure the obedience of the individual citizens concerned to the order directed by that injunction.  We have agreed to the procedure by injunction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> I wish to give a person against whom an injunction is sought, an opportunity of defending himself when those proceedings are brought against him.  If we have that procedure&mdash;and it is a very powerful machine to secure compliance with the law, far more effective than any number of prosecutions or convictions in the District Courts or in the criminal courts&mdash;then I think we ought to stick to that procedure alone, for the present in any event.  I have no belief, like Deputy Dillon, in all the prosecutions in the District Court, and so forth.  I believe it is just a facade of having, if you please, a company prosecuted in Green Street and indicated before a jury.  It is nonsense and there is the danger that if the people come to think that it is nonsense the law will become ineffective.  Nothing tends to bring about more insecurity and disbelief in the law than a number of restrictive proceedings of a penal character which become ineffective.  Looking at it from the point of view of principle, restrictive practices grew up in admitted, as it is now the law in this country, exercise of private right.  The objection was that these practices infringed other persons' private or civil rights.  So far as they did not infringe other persons' private rights then they were lawful and declared by our courts to be lawful.</P>
    <P>The whole subject of restrictive practices deals with civil rights.  It was the British Common Law that first developed the idea of restrictive practices when it developed the notion of agreements in restraint of trade.  It is a tribute to the genius of the British Common Law that they did that and saw many long years ago the evil to the community from restrictive practices of that character.  I want to emphasise that the whole matter is one of private right.  We are introducing the element of public wrong into this by bringing in criminal proceedings.  I admit that the thesis in considering this Bill is that the public interest may adversely be affected by these restrictive practices and to that extent there is justification for bringing in criminal law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> I think we would have a very reasoned attitude towards the Bill if these restrictive criminal proceedings, which will very largely, if not completely, be ineffective in practice, were not contained in it.  The British Government brought in a Bill to deal with restrictive practices.  It set up a commission.  I am subject to correction but I understand that they have given only two reports since that commission was set up.  Here we envisage a procedure of ten years' penal servitude for all sorts of workmen, employers, secretaries, and so forth&mdash;a procedure of heavy penalties.  It will just go the same way as dozens of provisions of a similar character which are on the Statute Book and which are never operated.  Unless you can get strong public opinion behind this measure it will not be effective.  For that reason I have insisted that, so far as I am able, there should be some precautions to enable private citizens who think they do or who, in fact, may suffer an injustice to have resort to the courts of justice.  I have had some experience &mdash;I think I may say considerable experience&mdash;of the operations of quasijudicial tribunals.  I assert that, by and large, they are very injurious to the public interest in their operations. Experience in other countries will bear that out.</P>
    <P>My chief objection to this particular type of tribunal to be set up under this Bill is that it is political.  I do not think that point can be made too often.  The composition of its members may change with different Governments. The outlook of each tribunal will be different according to the political philosophy actuating each particular Government.  Whether that may or may not be, I think the Minister will find, if he reads some of the reports in connection with other countries where they have endeavoured to deal with practices of this kind, that it has not been found satisfactory for a tribunal to be at once an investigating body, a prosecuting body and a judicial or semi-judicial body.  It has not worked and it has not succeeded in eradicating the practices which it was set up to eradicate.</P>
    <P>When I moved this amendment that <Col N="873" /> no prosecution shall be heard or determined until an injunction shall have been obtained under Section 10, I had that two-fold object in mind&mdash; that a person who is sought to be injuncted in the civil courts should have an opportunity of making his case. If he is prosecuted, all that has to be done is to prove the Statute or Order that is given legislative effect here and then conviction must follow. If he has an opportunity, on injunction proceedings, to defend himself, there will be no prosecution if it can be shown that he is not guilty. As we are taking very tentative steps under this Bill&mdash;and that is all that can be claimed for this Bill&mdash;at least we should stop short at injunction proceedings and leave aside the matter of criminal proceedings for the time being at any rate, until we learn more from practice and from the activities of the tribunal that may be set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If we have to rely upon injunctions in my view we will get nowhere in the enforcement of the Orders made under the authority of this Bill.  The provision for proceedings by way of injunction is inserted in the Bill on the assumption that if the injunction is disregarded the courts will deal very severely with the offender.  It is true also that our experience suggests that proceedings against individuals for offences of the kind which may arise under this Bill, taken in the ordinary courts on the basis of criminal law, are frequently very leniently treated by the courts.  I think we must contemplate the injunction procedure, where special issues arise or where the case is of considerable public interest or of considerable magnitude, and the criminal court procedure for the ordinary day to day contraventions of the law which may arise where the Minister would be required to take action.  This procedure which we have here is not as unique as Deputy Costello has suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have taken notice of the American law in this regard which provides for both criminal court proceedings and for injunctions.  It even contemplates <Col N="874" /> civil proceedings where a party, claiming to be injured by reason of the non-observance of the law, may proceed in the courts for damages.  But in all cases there, I understand, the criminal court proceedings come first and the civil court proceedings come subsequently, if they come at all.  I think it would be impracticable to cut out entirely the proposal for action through the criminal courts.  There seems to be no reason, certainly in the ordinary type of case of a minor infraction of the law, where we should have to go through the injunction procedure before taking action in the criminal court.</P>

There are a lot of respectable citizens in this country still who do not see themselves <Col N="875" /> in the dock either in Green Street or in the police court and who would be horrified at the thought that, in any circumstances, they could be arraigned in the dock and convicted of an offence for which the penalty, prescribed by Oireachtas Éireann, can be ten years' penal servitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to lay down that for an infringement of the law made under Section 8, if tried on indictment, there is to be a penalty, at the discretion of the presiding judge, of ten years' penal servitude.  Surely, we ought to have some respect for those elements in our community who would say: &ldquo;Whatever the law is I will conform to it because it is the law, and I would regard it as unthinkable that I should appear in any criminal court in this country to be convicted of having broken the law.&rdquo;  There are occasions upon which the Executive interprets the law in a certain sense. A man may say: &ldquo;My best advice is that they are wrong and I want some tribunal or some procedure other than an appearance in the dock in Green Street whereby that issue can be tried out.  I invite them to invoke the courts and ask the courts to order me to carry out the law in accordance with the Government's interpretation of it.  If that is done, I will conform to it promptly after I have had a chance to make my case as to what the correct interpretation of the law is.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All that I am objecting to, and asking to be delivered from, is that the Government which, in fact, is the Minister, and which in practice is a civil servant, shall say to me: &ldquo;I interpret this Order as confirmed by the Oireachtas in a certain sense.  You claim it is in another sense.  You are wrong and you will do what I tell you to do and if you do not you will turn up in Green Street.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that to a principal officer in any Department of State is a routine duty.  It does not cause him very much trouble to initiate the appropriate machinery for arraigning that citizen in Green Street.  But see what it means <Col N="876" /> to the citizen.  It is not an agreeable thing to be returned for trial and to have to appear in the dock in Green Street.  That can be a very distressing experience for any citizen.  I do not think it is right that Oireachtas Éireann should quite casually say: &ldquo;Oh!  bring the poor chap up to the District Court and fine him 2/6.&rdquo;  I do not like to be fined 2/6 in the District Court.  I never was fined in the District Court.  At night, I light the lamp on my bicycle not because I always think it is necessary to do so, but because it is the law.  I think it is a good approach for the ordinary man, if he does not like the law, to agitate to get the law altered.  In this section we are dealing with a very responsible body of people, with the members of the mercantile community.  They are people who have a sense of public duty. Therefore, I suggest that we ought to give them the right, if they wish, to challenge the Minister's interpretation of the law in the civil court.</P>
    <P>Suppose the Minister is required to seek an injunction against some fellow who knows perfectly well that he is acting in the wrong.  He is not going to contest the injunction proceedings. Am I not right in thinking that he can simply make no appearance and so the court will give the injunction after offering him the opportunity of appearing to resist it?  If he makes no appearance, and does not attempt to resist it, the injunction issues automatically.  If, however, he continues, after the Minister has given him the chance of justifying himself, to violate the law, then he can have no complaint if he is brought to the criminal court.  He now knows that he can be brought back to the civil court, and that the civil court will apply the appropriate penalty for failing to carry out the terms of the injunction, or he can be prosecuted in the criminal court.  Everyone will know that he has continued to break the law, and I think public opinion will sustain whatever penalty it is appropriate to impose upon him, whether they approve of the law or not.  No man has the right to break the law, but he has the right to agitate for its alteration.  Therefore, pending its alteration, he must comply with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="877" /> I urge strongly on the Minister that he should bear in mind that here we are dealing with an important section of the community.  We must proceed on the assumption that, whether they be merchants, manufacturers or their employees, they are respectable citizens earning their living and contributing to the national welfare.  I urge that persons so circumstanced ought to be given the chance of making their case, and that it is only when it is perfectly clear that they are resolved to break the law that it is appropriate either to bring them to Green Street or ask a judge to issue an injunction and impose a penalty on them for their disobedience of the law.</P>

      <P>There is only one comment that I omitted to make on the Minister's statement.  I just did not get the precise words he used but he referred to the contemplation of the American procedure of civil proceedings by individuals concerned. If this Bill becomes law and there is an Order given legislative effect to by proceedings of the Oireachtas, then a private individual who suffers wrong, loss or damage by the infringement by a combination of traders or trade associations of that law, can bring civil proceedings of his own.  In our country, under our law, he would then be in a position of being damnified, suffering loss by wrongful act of any person.  He could bring it under that cause of action or under conspiracy, which is agreement by two or more persons to do something which is declared to be wrong by law.  He still has recourse to the courts.  You have that remedy as well, the remedy of the individual, and you have the remedy of the injunction and you would have a cleaner Bill and a better Bill, a Bill that would more ensure public confidence and opinion than all this nonsense&mdash;because I think it is nonsense&mdash;about ten years' imprisonment for a corporation.</P>

But where a man breaks the law and knows he is breaking the law and gets away with it and, when the law catches up with him, merely says: &ldquo;It was good while it lasted&rdquo;, is there any reason why we should proceed in any way other than to put him in the dock and charge him with the offence?</P>

If the law catches up with him you catch him by the neck and you put him in Green Street.&rdquo;  If it were as simple as that, there would be some power and force in the Minister's argument.  Suppose there is a legitimate case of difference of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So says the Minister but I can assure the Minister, having like himself sat on both sides of the ministerial table, that every case of this character does not reach the highest echelon of the Civil Service, never mind a positive ministerial decision.  If every case of this kind had to, government would break down in our kind of society.  I am putting the case where you have a perfectly honest difference of opinion between the two parties and I suggest to the Minister that the number of cases in which a man is going to persist in law-breaking, everybody knowing that he is breaking the law, is very trivial, very small but the case where a man who honestly <Col N="879" /> believes he is not breaking the law but would most bitterly resent conviction under the criminal law is a matter of great gravity.  I think the Minister might at least bend his mind to it.  I do not believe this procedure of the injunction is going to weaken the Minister's hand or delay the expedition with which Orders made under Section 8 can be put into effect but it is going to ensure that injustice will not be done and I think it will relieve the minds of a great many Deputies that the powers of this Bill, while effectively used, will not result in honourable and decent men being exposed to affront which they ought not to be exposed to by Oireachtas Éireann and that decent men will not be put in a criminal dock to which they do not belong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is that we must never proceed in the courts without going first for an injunction. That seems absurd having regard to the case put that some of these matters may relate to quite trivial offences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We do not want to set up a chronic persecution of the trading community.  We want to stop <Col N="880" /> abuses and I suggest to the Minister that nobody in the House envisages hundreds of minor prosecutions under this Bill.  Does the Minister?  I do not think he does.  He does not envisage a vast army of inspectors snooping around the country looking for every kind of minor breach in order to maintain a barrage of prosecutions in the District Court.  We only envisage a person being brought to court under this Bill if he is carrying on a conspiracy to restrain trade.  Is not that right?  If the Minister would reflect a moment he would realise that it is desirable to put on himself and his own Department or his successor and his own Department the obligation to go against a person by way of injunction if legal proceedings are in contemplation. Remember, the warning that, if a person continues in his present practice, injunction proceedings will be taken against him, is in itself a powerful inducement.  I am urging the Minister to think this over.  He ought not to have a multitude of 2/6 prosecutions. The only prosecution that ought to be brought under this Bill is a case which would justify injunction proceedings.  When there is no other means of stopping the abuse then resort to the courts ought to be had. I am suggesting that the first resort should be the civil court and then, at the Minister's option, criminal proceedings or reference back to the civil court.</P>

    <P>I move it without the slightest hope of there being even the smallest consideration for it.  I drew the attention of the Minister to the difference between this section and sub-section (2) of Section 11, dealing with aiding and abetting, where the burden of proof is on the prosecution while here it is on the accused.  That is contrary to the principles of our criminal law and it should not be done. It has been objected to in other countries.  It has not worked, and it brings the law into disrepute.  You can only have proper respect for the law, proper enforcement of the law, and belief in the law when you stand solidly on principle.  It may be difficult for a Department to get a conviction, but it is better to have that difficulty and keep the principle enshrined in our Constitution and law that a person is not to be found guilty until it is proved by the prosecution. We are departing from that.  Every time the Minister comes into this House, we depart from that principle.

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph 1, sub-paragraph (1), line 5, after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; to add the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and in making such appointments the Minister shall take steps to ensure that not less than half of the number of persons appointed (exclusive of the chairman) shall be representative of the interests of consumers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is very clear as to what we intend.  In so far as the whole purpose of the Bill appears to be to protect the consumer, the consumer should be afforded adequate representation on the commission.  In the first paragraph of the Schedule it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The permanent members of the commission shall consist of a chairman and not less than two and not more than four other members.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In appointing a chairman, the Minister, I take it, will have regard to appointing the type of person who will, as far as possible, be representative of all the citizens in our community and to that extent he will have due regard to the interests of the consumer.  There will also be representatives, presumably, of the manufacturing and distributive interests.  It seems essential that the consumers' interests on the <Col N="889" /> commission should be the strongest since the purpose of the Bill is to protect the consumers.  All the activities of our industrial and distributive system are designed to meet and fulfil the needs of the consumer, and it is for the protection of the consumer ultimately that we are trying to provide fair trading practices, with all due respect to what Deputy Dillon said about protecting the interests of the manufacturers.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly the Minister should recognise that in appointing the personnel of this commission we should not seek a balance as between manufacturing and distributing elements on the one hand and the trade unions on the other but rather we should weight the commission on behalf of the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not contemplating a commission composed of representatives in the sense in which the Deputy is using the word&mdash;some selected because they can be regarded as representative of certain interests and others because they can be regarded as representative of the opposite interests. This will be a commission of three persons, any one of whom may, in fact, preside at an inquiry by himself.  I did promise to reconsider the desirability of that provision in view of the representations made here in the early stages of the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will be a commission of persons each one of whom will have definite duties to perform and can perform them in that competent manner in which the commission as a whole will be expected to act.  I do not disagree with the Deputy's view that the commission is to be regarded as a commission representative of the consumers' interest in the sense that the consumers' interest is the public interest, and I think the commission as a whole should be regarded as having the particular duty of protecting the consumers' and the public interest in relation to trade practices.  I think the commission should be such that any one member can be regarded as being equivalent to another and can discharge any functions that another can discharge and not be limited solely to <Col N="890" /> the task of representing a particular viewpoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the Minister has to make a choice.  If he wants a commission composed of members each one of whom will be capable of discharging the duties of chairman in respect of various aspects of the inquiry, it will be something like the present prices body.  Will it be largely a commission composed of members of the legal profession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the legal profession could represent the consumers' interests, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>If he goes outside that, we know from practice and experience that in seeking the members of his commission he will have to have regard to the background of the persons he will consider most suitable.  He cannot simply pick them out of thin air and, once we get into the ordinary walks of life, we come up against individuals who have a direct interest in such activities as manufacturing or distribution or in consumption&mdash;in other words, people with a predilection towards one or the other&mdash;and there is no use trying to avoid that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer having persons appointed to that commission because they did represent certain interests and had strong views than try to get persons who were completely neutral and because of that fact had no opinion at all or, what is even worse, had such strong, fixed opinions that they were worse than direct representatives of the particular interests. I would prefer to have the person selected by the Minister with a knowledge of his background and an acceptance of the fact that if you appoint &ldquo;John Murphy&rdquo; he will be generally regarded as speaking for the manufacturers or the distributors, or if &ldquo;Michael Doyle&rdquo; is going on he is there to speak for the consumers.  In that way I believe you would have a much more effective organisation. Furthermore, I do not see why a member of the commission representing the manufacturers' or consumers' interests should not equally be able to discharge the duties of chairman as <Col N="891" /> are members of the legal profession or of the judiciary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am trying to ensure is that the commission we are about to set up under the Act we are proposing to pass is reconciled in its character with the purpose of the Bill and that this commission will represent overwhelmingly the interests of the consumer.  I particularly stress that because of Deputy Dillon's earlier remark in regard to the danger of a conspiracy between the distributors and manufacturers and to ensure that they will not get away with anything.</P>
      <P>The commission is our sheet anchor and I am anxious that that commission will act on behalf of the consumer. The only way of doing that within the limits of the authority given to the Minister who appoints the personnel is to ensure that he will be guided in his selection of persons so that at least half of the members will represent the consumer.</P>

      <P>Does it mean anything? Cannot any Minister pick certain individuals and say they are representative of the consumer?  People will criticise his judgment.  His job is to be able to answer that criticism and it is the knowledge that he will be criticised which will induce him to make the best selection.  But there is nothing to prevent him from saying, no matter whom he picks, that they are representative of the consumer.  A statutory provision of this kind means nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Except to this extent, that there is such a thing as public opinion and if the Minister, in public before this House, says that a certain person represents the consumer interest and it is generally known from the activities of that individual that, in fact, he does not, but that he represents <Col N="892" /> contrary interests, the Minister will soon find himself in difficulty, but worse still, the commission might break down.</P>

      <P>While the Minister has an interest in selecting persons who would be competent for the work, he should also be under the obligation of saying to the public: &ldquo;I am taking the responsibility of saying that certain persons appointed to the commission do, in my opinion, represent the consumer interest and I am prepared to accept responsibility to that extent.&rdquo;  Again it is the old question we had in regard to control of prices.  The personnel does not matter; it is the amount of confidence the public has in it and this commission could break down on its first case.  I think the Minister should take on himself the responsibility for saying: &ldquo;I am going to appoint a commission which is weighted in favour of the consumer.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I mean only in the case where the commission had proceeded to the investigation of a particular restrictive practice.  Before them would come the trade union to make their representations, the distributor's representatives and the manufacturer's representatives, but there is nobody to go and make the case for the consumer or rebut on behalf of the consumer the case made by the manufacturers, the trade unions or the distributors.  The Minister says he hopes the members of the commission will do that themselves but the members of the commission have not got the means of preparing the case.  I suggest that the members of the commission, while being expected to have a bias in favour of the consumer, cannot be expected to make out the consumers' case and that if the commission is to function efficiently there ought to be somebody there whose duty it is to make the case from the point of view of the consumer.  This commission, having heard the respective cases of the consumers, the manufacturers, the trade unions and the distributive trades, admittedly with a bias towards the consumer, will seek to give a decision that will do substantial justice to all.  But I cannot see how they can effectively function unless there is somebody there to press the consumer's point of view, as there will be and ought to be persons there present to press the trade union point of view, the trade point of view and the manufacturer's point of view, more especially when it is not at all impossible that the manufacturers, the traders and the trade unions will all be on the one word with a carefully agreed case to put forward.</P>

      <P>I do not contemplate a commission that is impartial in the sense that a judge in the courts is impartial.  I want a commission that is prejudiced against restrictive trade practices, that will approach every one of them in that spirit and consent to them or tolerate them only to the extent that they are satisfied, on balance, that the public interest is served by them.  Therefore the commission itself will have the object of the abolition of restriction in competition and in conducting these inquiries <Col N="894" /> will have to fulfil that function of arguing against them and only allowing people who are urging the retention of certain restrictions to beat down their arguments by weight of superior argument.</P>

      <P>But reports to the Minister that will have weight. The tribunal must have weight otherwise it is no use.  If it acts as a one-sided commission with that outlook then its conclusions are bound to be one-sided also.  I am in favour of some way of getting rid of restrictive trade practices.  At the same time, I do not think you achieve that purpose by setting up a tribunal that will cause suspicion.  I say from experience of these commissions that a decent citizen who is doing what he is allowed legally to do at the moment, has fired at him the most impudent questions from people from whom he expects to get fair play.</P>

As is now suggested, the appointments were left to the discretion of the Minister.  I had no objection to the appointments; those people have done their job well but they have <Col N="895" /> not been accepted in the public mind in the way that was intended.  That is why I say you can put persons on to this commission that I personally regard as being exceptional and outstanding from the point of view of performing their duties and yet they will not inspire public confidence.

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In page 16 to delete Section 4 (1), lines 47 to 49, and substitute:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The Government, a motion specifically authorising them to do so having first been passed by Dáil Éireann, may by Order under this sub-section declare that a state of emergency exists for the period mentioned in the motion authorising the declaration.&mdash;(Deputy Peadar Cowan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the question of &ldquo;emergency,&rdquo; and my recollection is that Deputy Cowan was making a constitutional point in this regard.  The distinction which I sought to make on the last occasion&mdash;and, if my recollection is right, I went into it in some detail&mdash;is that in the Constitution there is general provision for an emergency and the declaration of a state of emergency, under Article 28, and legislation here cannot go beyond the field defined by Article 28.  That refers to a national emergency embracing the whole national fabric.  What we have to deal with in this section and in this Bill is a more localised type of emergency.  If one could find a suitable word to make the distinction clear, it might be desirable to use it in this Bill.  We are dealing here with a localised emergency affecting the armed forces only. The circumstances of that emergency would have relation to an emergency of a wider nature, but the action to be taken in the emergency referred to in this section would refer only to people <Col N="896" /> who come within the scope of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think the point Deputy Cowan is seeking to make in regard to the Constitution is not well founded.  The provision in the section can go no further than the armed forces and simply enables an alerting of the forces.  When all is said and done, what is involved is that the Government may declare that an emergency exists, within the meaning of this Bill and for the purposes of this Bill.  Following on that, they are empowered under the Bill to take certain specific steps regarding people who come within the law as defined by the Bill.  That may mean calling up a reserve or taking certain other action in preparing the armed forces. That is not in any sense putting the nation as a whole into a state of emergency, which is what is envisaged by Article 28 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>It is obviously important that a Government should have power to act immediately.  Without going over the whole ground again, but looking quickly over the report of what I said on the last occasion here, I may say it is obviously necessary that the Government should be in a position to act rapidly, whether in aid of the civil power or in case of a national emergency, and put its own forces in a state of preparation to meet any such emergency as may arise. That is quite clear, from the military point of view, the overall national defence point of view.</P>
      <P>Let us hark back, say, to the experience of 1939&mdash;an experience that may well confront us again some time in the future&mdash;where the international situation is getting more and more threatening; the Government with its responsibility feels that the time has come to make certain preparations; the situation is not clear enough yet to warrant an all-out emergency over the whole country but some preparations must be made.  It is to meet that type of case that this section was primarily drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us go back again a little more specifically to 1939.  In the early months of 1939 it became obvious&mdash;in fact, from about October, 1938&mdash;that there was a real threat of war in the offing.  In the <Col N="897" /> early months of 1939 the Government of the day did not declare an emergency or anything like it or take any emergency steps under the legislation empowering them at that time.  They did make certain preparations, there was a reorganisation of the reserve and efforts were accelerated and intensified to get equipment and to reorganise the Defence Forces.  The Department of Industry and Commerce and the Department of Agriculture acted also in regard to essential supplies, to some extent.  All that was mere normal precaution. But that was not enough. From about 1st July onwards, the situation became really threatening and then in September war actually broke out in Europe.  That war broke out in a localised kind of way and would merely bring about an emergency of the type contemplated in this section.  It was not a national emergency in the sense that an immediate threat lay, with necessity for mobilising the whole resources of the State to meet it.  The war as it broke out between Germany and Poland, with the consequent entry of the other Powers that came in, was still remote enough to leave it as a restricted emergency. The result was that the Government then used powers to mobilise the Reserve and take other precautionary steps.  That was a good deal short of the all-out type of national emergency that was considered in the Constitution and invoked very shortly afterwards. I am referring to the steps taken just before the declaration of the emergency in the full sense.  It was obviously desirable that the Government should have power to do that. Later, it had to go the whole hog with regard to declaring an emergency. Some provision for that kind of situation should be provided, from a general defence point of view.</P>
    <P>There is, then, the other aspect which I mentioned previously and which rather irritated Deputy MacEoin when I referred to it&mdash;the possibility of internal disturbance.  The Government, no matter what Government it is, is charged with the responsibility of maintaining order within the State and maintaining the constitutional framework of the State.  If it should happen in this country, as has happened in <Col N="898" /> many other countries, that there should be such an organised threat to the institutions of the State or to the internal order of the State that the ordinary police authorities were not likely to deal with it, and there was in fact something approaching an emergency, the Government should be in a position to act and to act quickly.</P>
    <P>I gave an example and the spirit in which I gave it was somewhat misinterpreted. It was an example, however, but looking at it completely objectively&mdash;and that is the best way&mdash; let us take a hypothetical Government in the future, a Government in which none of us&mdash;Deputy MacEoin, Deputy Collins or myself&mdash;is interested.  It is obviously desirable that that Government should have that power.  I think there is a slight misappreciation of the position due to the use of the word &ldquo;emergency.&rdquo;  This in no way conflicts with the provisions of the Constitution and applies merely for the purposes of this Act, and, from the point of view of national defence as against an external aggressor, this power is needed on the ground that the Government should be in a position to act quickly, especially in modern times, should be in a position to make adequate preparations and should have, so to speak, a half-way house in these uncertain situations which can arise preparatory to actual hostilities of being able to declare or arrange for a restrictive emergency.  These are two considerations which seem to be dictated by common sense and for these reasons they should have the power.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, from the point of view of internal order, it would seem an extravagant and unnecessary upset of our national life that if such an internal threat as I have tried to indicate broadly were to arise, we should have to put the whole nation straight away in a state of siege to deal with it. The approach should, and with any normal Government, would be&mdash;as it was the approach of the Government in the case to which I referred previously&mdash;to try to keep life going normally, to maintain a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; attitude, while at the same time taking the necessary steps to deal with that threat of disorder.  On these <Col N="899" /> three grounds&mdash;I differ from Deputy Cowan in these instances, although we are in agreement on a large number of other things&mdash;I think the section should stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy de Valera has made any case in answer to the amendment.  Take the first basis of argument he has tried to establish.  He says that in the event of a quickening of the tempo of threat, it might be necessary for the Army to take certain steps to ensure that the machinery for the call up of various reservists would be geared up for action.  Surely if it is only a quickening of the tempo, there is no reason why the Government should not come to Parliament in the ordinary way and get parliamentary authority for the action they propose to take.  I should have thought that if the Deputy were serious in his argument, the only basis on which any justification might be put forward for such a section would be expediency and there the first line of his argument must fall completely.  There are no circumstances that I could conceive in which it would be difficult for a reasonable Government, coming to Parliament, to get the Order envisaged in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we allow the section to go unchallenged&mdash;and I for my part will not allow it to go unchallenged&mdash;we are writing into this measure a power which, on the basis of the existence of a reasonable Government, can be argued in a way that might seem to justify it; but it is our duty as a Parliament to visualise the direct opposite and to consider what power we would be vesting in an unscrupulous Government. Deputy de Valera speaks airily about a hypothetical Government.  If he wants to take a hypothetical Government, let him take a Government which might find itself in the position of having a parliamentary majority and which, when pressure was being brought to bear on it in respect of the legitimate grievances of a body of the public, might use the section for its own purposes.  Take the situation which could arise in which, through something in the nature of a <Col N="900" /><i>coup d'état</i>, a particular Government was established for a period.  Here we are giving legal authority for the exercise by that Government of powers which none of us would like to give.</P>
    <P>We have to get these things into proper perspective.  There would be nobody more anxious than I to see that the Army, in the event of an increasing threat or in conditions of exigency due to a tremendous change in equipment or general war technique, would have the right to call up a limited type of personnel, limited numbers of the Reserve for purposes of national security, or for the purpose of giving the basic training to ensure ultimate national security.</P>
    <P>When one takes this section as it stands one cannot see in it any of the limitations to which Deputy de Valera referred.  We are in the situation now that this section can be used but not merely in the limited sphere suggested by Deputy de Valera.  Say that the Government declares a state of emergency and issues a certain warning. The section could then be used in a way in which it cannot be used now.  Take it that we have some kind of internal disturbance or even go back to the particular type of internal emergency to which the Deputy himself referred in his original contribution to this debate.  Could it be of such nature that the Government could not have resort to the normal machinery of the Houses of Parliament to take such action as they might in the circumstances think proper?  On the occasion that this particular difficulty arose before, Deputy de Valera cannot contend that it had arisen overnight under circumstances in which the Government were not able to come to Parliament for power to deal with it.  What we are unconsciously giving away in this section is the sovereignty of our parliamentary institutions.  The Constitution has been designed and framed to ensure that where a state of national emergency exists, the declaration and the ultimate establishment of that state of emergency is vested in the Houses of Parliament.</P>
    <P>In this case if a Government, less worthy than Governments of the past <Col N="901" /> have been, a Government with any tendency to unscrupulousness, were in power they could use this section of the Bill, not as suggested by Deputy de Valera for the limited purpose of calling up reserves but they could call the Army to assist the police in a civil disturbance and by virtue of the authority of this Bill relieve the Army from the obligation that at present rests upon it, where a chief superintendent of the police may, as he is entitled to, call for the assistance of the Army which is then amenable and answerable for such powers as it exercises to the normal civil authorities. Any officer or personnel of the Army executing a certain mission of restraint can only do so within the concept of the civil code whereas, under this section, a situation could arise where without any previous reference to Parliament the authority taken under this section could convert that situation virtually to one of military law.  There is no limitation in this section to prevent that being done.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be well advised to view the situation in its reality.  There is no member of this House who will deny the Minister for Defence or the Army authorities the right to be able to deal with what they consider a matter of crisis within the armed forces.  I do not think any Deputy would deny the Army the right to advise the Minister and to tell him that it was in the interests of security and of the general defence position that they should call up a certain type of personnel, but that is not what is sought in this section.  If this section were limited to dealing with that type of situation there would be no controversy with regard to it, but I contend positively that, in the broadness of the section, we are striking fundamentally at the root of the civil liberties of our people.  I am not going to suggest, nor should I like the House to think that I am suggesting, that in the hands of the Government we have, or in the hands of a Government such as we have known in the past, improper use is likely to be made of this section but we must be fully alive to the fact that the section as it stands gives powers to <Col N="902" /> an unscrupulous Government which none of us, no matter how immature we may be in our concept of political philosophy, would grant.  It is not a situation that can be treated lightly. I think that Deputy Cowan may be completely right in questioning whether it is constitutional or not.  It certainly does tend to cut completely across the Constitution.  We find ourselves in the dilemma that if the case made by Deputy de Valera is that in three conceivable circumstances, there might be necessity for this particular type of power, why is there not a limitation in this section and why is there anything objectionable in the amendment proposed by Deputy Cowan?</P>

      <P>The situation would not even have the same justification for legislation.  It would then be a question of revolt as distinct from an act with a semblance of legal authority. My research leads me to believe that it is from some Canadian Act that this particular concept of the Emergency Act has been brought.  Could the Minister justify to this House circumstances under which he was not able to summon the Dáil to get the authority that he seeks?  Even assuming that he could make a case that it was not possible to summon the Dáil before he sought the power, at least the Government would appreciate the necessity for limitation.  If the case could be made that he could not summon the Dáil there should be a provision made, within a certain date of the coming into operation of the warrant which he signs under this section, for the ratification and acceptance of that.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy look at amendment No. 9?  That is just the whole point.  We are all with <Col N="904" /> you and Deputy Cowan in regard to appreciating the danger.  The essential difference between us now is that the Deputy wants to have the Dáil determine the matter before the Government can move.  We say that that is just not quick enough and it would not meet the situation.  Would the Deputy look at the section as it stands in the Bill in conjunction with amendment No. 9 which the Minister is moving and which states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If, at the time an Order is made under this section, either House of the Oireachtas stands adjourned, that House shall be summoned to meet as soon as conveniently may be.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I still do not think that meets the case at all.  I can conceive in a hypothetical way that the emergency Deputy de Valera is trying to argue for could arise.  It cannot arise in the circumstances as suggested by the Deputy himself of the quickening tempo of danger in the international situation, the situation of the Army wanting to alert itself or get the power to call up various categories and types of personnel.  On the Deputy's own argument that could not call for this particular type of legislation.</P>
      <P>There is nothing to prevent the Minister coming to the House and making the request.  If that request were backed up, as it would be in the case of a responsible Minister, by an Army request there would be no difficulty about getting it.</P>

      <P>If the Minister can make a case for this section he should ensure that only in respect of the type of situation where there is grave immediate need arising would there be any warrant issued under this section. I am anxious that only in that one type of case would he provide as suggested in Deputy Cowan's amendment and have resort to the Dáil to get the permission and that in the case where the situation had become impossible at least within 21 days' issue the warrant or Order under this section would come before the Dáil for ratification.</P>
      <P>An unscrupulous Government&mdash;I think Deputy de Valera would concede this&mdash;would be the arbitrators of when it was convenient for the Dáil to meet and might conceivably postpone such a meeting for quite a considerable period and during that period they would have certain protection for acts which might have been carried out by virtue of the warrant putting the court in a situation that it was subject to martial law as distinct from civil law.  Deputies will not argue that the section will not go as far as to allow control being switched from the normal civil law to the military authorities.  If the section does not go that far we are arguing in a hypothetical way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, as the section is framed, the Minister can go that far.  If the fracas <Col N="906" /> of 1932 or the situation in regard to the milk stoppage had been allowed to spread into a more serious type of internal disruption we could conceive where it might be necessary for the civil authorities to get the assistance of the Army.  In normal circumstances and under the present provision of the law a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána in an area can request that aid and support from the military located within his area or from such military commander upon whom he can serve notice.  In the main, I think that situation is provided for.  The final arbitrator is the normal civilian law and any Army personnel carrying out their duties at the request of the chief superintendent of the Garda authorities is to that extent in such peril of the civilian law that he cannot go any further than reasonable prudence and reasonable interpretation of prudence would let him.</P>
    <P>If the rule of martial law became dominant in the emergency situation, the responsibility would be on the Army authorities themselves who would also be the ultimate arbitrators. I say to the House, not in any spirit of contention but in a spirit of jealously safeguarding the rights and authorities and functions of Parliament itself, that we will have to view very seriously the full impact of this situation.  I concede willingly to the Minister that if we had any assurance that persons of his responsibility and character would be the arbitrators of the use of this power, we might not have the fears that we must have when we realise that we cannot look into the future and envisage future Governments.  Remember that you are in this position.  Under this section a situation could arise where a Government could become divided against itself.  Let us say that the stronger elements in that Government depose, as they can in a very rapid way, their objecting colleagues. They have here, under this particular section, wide powers on which they can act if they are unscrupulous, to hold up the normal operation of parliamentary democracy for an almost indefinite period.  I feel that the object that the Minister wants to achieve can better be achieved in the national interest with the co-operation and help <Col N="907" /> of Parliament as distinct from the overriding of it.</P>
    <P>I concede to Deputy Cowan that I feel in this particular instance that he is genuine in his desire, by nature of the amendment framed, to ensure that Parliament and the Government will try to act hand in hand when this type of situation arises.  Therefore, it would be in the best interests of the Government itself, if of nobody else, in dealing with a national situation, to come and get the co-operation and help of Parliament that it requires to create what Deputy Major de Valera has described as either a localised or a semi-localised emergency within the State.  If it is a question of what line of action the Army might like to take in a situation of gathering war clouds, I think the Minister will readily agree that there are very wide powers already vested in the Army authorities themselves by virtue of which they can get to a state of preparedness that certainly would not in any way be impeded by the Minister's coming to the House to ask for wider powers for them.  If the Army are already in the position that they feel that they should have more personnel up for training or on stand-to or on the alert, they can proceed to get the mechanics of such an action into being and the Minister will have adequate time to come into this House and ask the House, in the light of the recommendation of the Army Council and in the light of the request from the Army, to grant them the wider powers or such powers as they need.  There will never be any difficulty about that.  If Parliament were in normal session or was meeting in circumstances such as those in which Parliament had to meet in 1938 and 1939 the position would be that they would urge these powers on the Minister as distinct from trying to withhold them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What about 1939?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is why the argument is basically unsound.  It is all right to say: &ldquo;What about 1939?&rdquo; now.  We are fortunate in this <Col N="908" /> country that where this particular subject of defence and national defence is concerned we have made very considerable advances in our approach to the general problem since 1939.  I cannot see any Parliament in this country, in a situation of impending serious national danger, not giving in an unstinted way the right to the Army to put in motion such machinery as it thinks necessary to put our trained military personnel in a position to be of the most valuable service possible in the national defence.  I think, with all due respect to Deputy Major de Valera, that the day on which there would be obstruction in this House in such a national situation has gone.  So far as that particular facet of argument is concerned, I say that no case is made.</P>
      <P>I feel, with regard to this section, that I can see the Army point of view. An omnibus section such as this would ease their difficulties considerably.  But it is the very omnibus nature of the section that compels me in a deliberative and non-contentions way to argue that it is most unwise to let the section go as it stands.  I think the Minister could devise, and for that reason I urge him to devise, a method whereby this particular section, if it has to stand, would be drastically limited.  I think that he would have to make a very strong case to this House before we would willingly give him any of the facilities which this section asks for.  I want to hear what particular case the Minister can make for not coming to the House for authority for the warrant that he wants to issue under the section.  If a situation arises&mdash;and let us concede that a situation could arise overnight&mdash;that would put the Minister in the position that he would need wide powers, is there any reason why an absolutely definite period of time cannot be fixed within which the warrant issued by him would have to be ratified by the Dáil?  I cannot conceive a situation in which an overnight crisis would arise that would not already be covered by the powers which the Government have under the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose, for the sake of argument, such a situation did arise, I want the Minister to tell the House why it is <Col N="909" /> not possible instead of having the omnibus expression &ldquo;when convenient&rdquo; to lay down a specific time within which the Dáil would have to meet for the purpose of either confirming or annulling the warrant that he issued.  This whole section, to my mind, whether it was conceived by my colleague when he was Minister or by the present Government, still allows a situation to develop whereby, in circumstances short of an emergency and not contemplated by the Constitution, we could, in fact, hand over the normal authority of the rule of civil law to the Army.  I do not think any of us really want that.  I myself, except for the affection which the Army Council may have for having wide powers &mdash;not using them but having them&mdash; cannot see any justification for this section as it stands.  I believe that it could be considerably bettered not only to ensure the preservation in the best possible way of parliamentary democracy but also the best possible type of protection for the Army itself in the event of the Army coming into active participation in a national crisis under this section.</P>
    <P>I was opposed to this section in Committee and I am opposed to it now on the basic principle that, I think, it is not necessary in the manner in which it is conceived because, in foreseeable circumstances, it could be an instrument that might negate the very principle of parliamentary democracy.  I know that the Minister, in the exercise of his power under this Bill with his amendment in, might deem these words &ldquo;as soon as is convenient&rdquo; to be an implicit trust on him to summon the Dáil with all haste.  I might be perfectly satisfied in my own mind that, in the event of a warrant having to be issued under this section and that if any member of this House, as I now know them, were to be the occupant of the Ministry of Defence, he might deem the expression &ldquo;as soon as convenient&rdquo; to be coercive on him to summon the Dáil immediately, but a situation could arise where the convenience might run into months and could conceivably run into a period much longer than months if an unscrupulous Government with the support <Col N="910" /> of the Army had to use this section for its own purposes.</P>
    <P>I think we have to realise that there is involved in this section the basic principle of a clash between the sovereignty of Parliament and the powers that we might give to the Army in certain circumstances.  As I have said before, and repeat deliberately, if the circumstances, as envisaged by Deputy Vivion de Valera, are the basis for argument for this case, then no argument exists.  The first leg on which the Deputy stood was the leg of the increasing tempo of unrest, the increasing menace of danger that might involve the Army in the necessity of being, to use his own words, on the alert.  Now, in those circumstances I cannot conceive that it would not be possible and practicable for Parliament to meet and discuss the situation as presented by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>The second circumstance envisaged by Deputy Vivion de Valera, and adverted to by him, was that of certain internal troubles.  He made reference to the trouble that arose in 1932-33 when the Public Safety Acts had to be invoked.  That did not arise in one night or indeed in one month or series of months.  There, again, taking the case as being the classic that he wanted to make it, the powers given by Parliament then proved adequate to deal with the situation.  I say deliberately that, on that particular line of argument, no case has been made for the retention of this section.</P>
    <P>The last case which Deputy Vivion de Valera made was that of a sudden, shall we say grave, revolt arising, where is would be imperative for the Minister for Defence to use his Army to quell it.  That is the only case in which there could be a seeming justification for the section.  I think the Minister would be well advised to reconsider the section by limiting the authority to issue a warrant to that particular situation.  Further, he should put this limitation on himself for his own protection and that of the parliamentary democratic institution that appoints a Minister, that it must be ratified by the Dáil within a certain period.</P>
    <P>Now let us review the position plainly.  I think the Army are asking <Col N="911" /> for too much in this section, and that if we give it to them we are conceding to them more than they should get. I honestly feel that it would ill-become this House to prevent the Army exercising its judgment in a situation where national defence was concerned. I think, however, that there can be no difficulty as regards a Minister coming to this House with the considered and concerted view of his Army behind him and asking for powers to call out the Reserve and to put a certain type of ancillary personnel at the &ldquo;stand to&rdquo; or the alert because of a menacing national situation, or the menace of a threat of war.  I cannot conceive a Minister not getting the willing co-operation of this House, in those circumstances, before he issues the warrant.  It protects him and it protects the Army in the normal case of internal disruption, or in a situation arising internally that might cause a localised crisis or a temporary state of administrative break down that must be arrested by stern measures.  I think that will not arise in such a way that it will not be possible for the Minister to forewarn the Dáil of the situation and get its prior authority.</P>
    <P>I think a Minister would be very well advised to consider carefully the amendment moved by Deputy Cowan, because it serves two purposes at one time.  It ensures the right of the Parliament to deliberate on the warrant that the Minister may want to issue and at the same time gives the Army the benefit of the concerted view and decision of the Dáil to back its ultimate activity.</P>
    <P>I feel that argument on this section will be futile if the Minister is not prepared to reconsider this particular section. I am not anxious to limit the Minister in any way as to the type of amendment he might conceive, but I would ask the Minister to reconsider it in the light, not of what a reasonable or ordinary Government might do, but in the light of the powers that could be taken under this section by an unscrupulous Government, because that is the yardstick by which we ultimately will have to judge the effect of this particular <Col N="912" /> section.  If the Minister does that between this and the next stage he might be able to put limits in this section that will serve not only as a safeguard for Parliament but, in the final analysis, as a protection for the Army.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins has certainly stretched his case to breaking point, and I am not too sure if he was affording any help to Deputy Cowan by the case which he endeavoured to make in respect to this amendment.  He stated that to some extent he was depending on hypotheses.  I think what he was looking for was legislation by imagination.  We all know that circumstances are likely to arise with which no law or no Parliament can ever attempt to deal.  We have had examples all over Europe of circumstances in which Parliaments were obliterated, and I have no doubt in my mind that every one of the States concerned had laws governing their movements and their Parliaments and providing all the necessary safeguards.</P>
      <P>We cannot have legislation by imagination. We will have to endeavour as far as is humanly possible to deal with this matter in a realistic way, foreseeing as far as the human mind can foresee, the things for which we desire to legislate.</P>
      <P>I do not know if Deputies are aware that the section we are dealing with was introduced in 1940.  It has not brought about any of the fears which Deputy Collins expressed.  It has been operating quietly, silently, providing for the Army the things that the Army thought it required.  No one in this House or in the other House, was worried about it.  No one in the State was worried about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had the lawyers' point of view put forward by Deputy Cowan, by Deputy Major de Valera and, just now, by Deputy Collins.  The only case put forward by anyone outside the legal persons mentioned was put forward by Deputy McQuillan.  Deputy McQuillan was expressing the views of the man-in-the-street, the man whose views count even above the views expressed by any of the three lawyers I have mentioned.  I would say that Deputy <Col N="913" /> McQuillan was nearer to representing the point of view of that individual than anyone else who had spoken on this question.</P>
    <P>What did Deputy McQuillan say? He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In peace time, having regard to the fact that the speed of sound has been exceeded, it is essential that a Government should be in a position to act at a moment's notice.  It may be necessary for a Government to declare a state of emergency overnight. In modern warfare no warning is given.  Deputy Cowan's argument would have applied when horses were used by infantry instead of tanks and when the only type of invasion envisaged would be swallows at a certain time of the year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he expressed this very realistic point of view:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If we weigh in the balance, on the one hand, the necessity to give to the Government a right to protect the people and, on the other hand, the possibility of there being a bad Government, we will have to take the chance and give the powers to the Government, whether it be good or bad at the time, to safeguard the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say that that is the view that would be expressed, I suppose, nine times out of ten by the individual in the street, who would not be worrying too much about legal phrases or the effects of a particular word in a legal phrase but who would be thinking in terms of the fact that modern warfare is so different from warfare in the past that we have to provide ways and means of dealing as expeditiously as is humanly possible with circumstances that might be likely to arise out of a sudden emergency.</P>
    <P>Every one of us knows that circumstances might arise where it would not be possible at the precise moment to do anything other than the things which the Act provides that we should do.  A great deal of play has been made in respect to the powers that this section gives to the Army.  It is almost suggested that we are giving to the Government and through the Government <Col N="914" /> to the Army the powers to overthrow the whole people.  What are the powers that are under discussion? They are: (1) to enlist men under Section 54 for the duration of the emergency as distinct from the ordinary type of enlistment for a fixed period of years.  We operated that in the course of the emergency.  Every Deputy knows that, instead of enlisting individuals for a fixed period, we enlisted them for the period of the emergency. Having enlisted, they were kept for that period, however long or however short that period might have been.</P>
    <P>The next power is: to call out the Reserve on permanent service under Section 89.  In the event of circumstances arising such as I have outlined, a sudden overnight emergency, the situation envisaged by Deputy McQuillan, it gives us power to call out the Reserves on permanent service under Section 89.  Deputy Collins made our flesh creep with the things which he said it was possible could happen. They could only arise from the imagination of an individual who wants to stretch the case to the fullest extent, as it was stretched by Deputy Collins. The third power is: to billet members of the Defence Forces in private houses or elsewhere under Section 37 in contradistinction to the peace-time position under which, pursuant to Section 38, troops can be billeted only in hotels and such establishments.  It may be suggested that that was going too far, that we were inflicting something on the ordinary citizen which we should not inflict upon him.  I referred to this in the Special Committee because it was argued out for weary hours in that Committee.</P>

      <P>I will not dispute that. They were pleasant hours, anyway, and we were trying to do a good job of work.  I pointed out on that occasion that there was no question of compelling civilians to accept these people into their homes, because they would be going there as the protectors of the people.  If they were the army of a dictator, it is quite possible that they would be forced into the homes of the people, that the people might not <Col N="915" /> be prepared to accept them or, if they had to accept them, might not accept them in the same spirit that I suggest they would be accepted in the circumstances in which this particular clause would be given effect to.  They would be going there as protectors of the people and, I am sure, would be welcomed as such.  There is nothing, therefore, in this power which would be of any great use to a Government such as was envisaged in the course of the debates.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan had doubts in respect to the validity of the section.  In response to what the Deputy said, that he was thinking along the lines that the section is unconstitutional, I have had that examined by my legal advisers and they are satisfied that it is quite constitutional, that there is no clash with the Constitution.  What we are seeking is something that has been, as I said, in existence and operating quietly, effectively and efficiently over all these years.</P>

      <P>In page 17, Section 4, to insert at the end of the section, the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) If, at the time an Order is made under this section, either House of the Oireachtas stands adjourned, that House shall be summoned to meet as soon as conveniently may be.</P>

He will not accept blindfolded what the officials produce to him.  He will examine it and express his own point of view.  Since I resumed office, I have made alterations on minor points that perhaps those who preceded me would have made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins referred to his own personal suspicions which I hope are not shared by his colleagues.  He said that he would force a division on this. Will he force a division on his own personal suspicions?  These are the words, I think, he used.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I do not think it is necessary for me to say any more but I reiterate that the fears expressed by Deputy Cowan and Deputy Collins do not exist.  I do not think they could exist.  If circumstances such as those outlined did arise, there is no law in any country in the world that could prevent them.  I am sorry that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said quite correctly that the Bill has been in draft over a long number of years.  It was on the stocks before either I or my predecessor took office. It is not a Bill framed in the last three years.  When I accepted what the Minister now seeks to provide I knew at the time that Parliament would take a serious view of it and that it would not be easy to get such a provision passed into law.</P>
      <P>When an officer is called out on active service he likes to be bound by the military law and he likes to be protected by all the law that can be put around him.  The Minister says that Deputy Cowan and Deputy Collins want law by imagination.  I think legislation by imagination is better than legislation by regulation.  The whole trend of ministerial action in every Government in the world at the moment is to have legislation by regulation.  That is something that must be put an end to if Parliament is to survive and retain its power.</P>
      <P>If the Minister states in the definition section what constitutes an emergency, that will be all right and we will have no objection to it.  I think the Bill could easily be amended to that effect.  Deputy de Valera gave us examples of what he thinks would be likely to constitute emergencies.  He talked about emergencies in the past, and for the first time he made it clear to us what is in the mind of the Fianna Fáil Party in connection with this.  It is something which was never in my mind certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emergency visualised by me and, I think, by those who are advising the Minister, was an emergency constituting an external rather than an internal danger.  It is true that the Constitution gives the Government all the power it could possibly want in the case of an external menace.  Where the limitation arises is in the case of internal danger.  Deputy de Valera gives as an example of an internal danger the Blueshirts; he could have added the formation of Deputy Cowan's army.  Under the emergency power herein contained, the Government should have declared a state of emergency for the suppression of <Col N="918" /> Deputy Cowan's army if we accept Deputy de Valera's contention.  At that time a serious effort was made by those who are now in Government but who were then on these benches to get me to take such action as that visualised under this emergency power. I was challenged recently on that and told that it was never done privately. It was not done privately.  It was done publicly here in the House.  I was asked what steps was I taking to suppress this unlawful and illegal and, as some sneeringly said, contemptuous army raised by a Deputy then supporting the inter-Party Government.  I do not know if that mentality still prevails. I do not think it does.  I think Deputy de Valera was certainly calling on his imagination when he produced that particular rabbit out of the hat. It obviously appeared to him to be a good argument when he was making it. I do not know if he believes the argument is as good to-day as when he first advanced it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the power that may be taken under this section and when we are given instances of what would be likely to be the future occasions on which such power will be used, then we must take notice of it and we must take notice of what is in the mind of the Minister and in the minds of the Government Party who will operate this measure. The Government Party will not, of course, be long there to operate it, but this may be the law of the land 50 years hence.  What could an unscrupulous Government not do under it?  It is very easy for the Minister to ask: &ldquo;What powers am I taking under it; what power does it give me?&rdquo;  And it is very easy for him to reply: &ldquo;It gives me the following power; it gives me power to recruit for specified periods.&rdquo;  The Minister gives examples from the past. He then goes on and says that it gives him power to billet and to call out the Reserves.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that there is more in calling out troops than just calling them out.  Once they are called out they are on active service and when the Army is on active service the civil law is suspended to a very large extent and everybody in the area in which the emergency is declared becomes subject to military law.  Members of this House could be stopped coming to the House. Parliamentary business could be held up for days to prevent them annulling certain regulations.  This is a very serious matter.  I hold this is a dangerous power to give the Minister. It is a power that should be restricted and the Minister should amend the Bill by declaring in the definition section what will constitute an emergency. The amendment put down by Deputy Cowan is a safeguard to a certain extent, but only to a certain extent.</P>

      <P>There is no statute which enables a Minister to decide whether a criminal prosecution by the State should or should not be undertaken.  Where a case of misconduct bearing a criminal aspect occurs in a Department, the Minister concerned reviews all the relevant circumstances of the case&mdash;in the same way as would a private employer in such a case&mdash;with a view to determining whether the case should be referred by him to the Attorney-General. Considerations which a Minister would naturally take into account include: the public interest aspect, the disciplinary measures already taken against the officer (for example, dismissal), the gravity and frequency of the misconduct, the officer's record and his domestic and other circumstances.</P>
      <P>The function of the Attorney-General is to direct prosecutions in cases in which, in his opinion, the evidence furnished to him warrants such a course.</P>

    <P>I.  All moneys advanced to the board for its first development programme are now subject to interest.  The amount of £4,242,557 advanced to the board in the period 21st June, 1946, to 21st June, 1951, is subject to interest at 2½ per cent. per annum as from 1st October, 1952, and interest will be payable half-yearly, the first payment falling due on 1st April, 1953.  Moneys advanced to the board since the 21st June, 1951, for its first development programme are subject to interest from the date on which each advance was made at the rate current on that date.  These rates are shown in column 2 of the table.</P>
    <P>II.  Under Section 4 (1) (c) and (d) of the Turf Development Act, 1950, no interest is payable by the board on advances made during the period of five years commencing on 1st July, 1950, for the board's second development programme.  Of the sum of £910,000 shown in column 3 of the table, £431,000 relates to second programme advances.  The balance of £479,000 relates to repayable advances made to the board for its housing schemes under Section 6 (3) of the Turf Development Act, 1950, for which the rate of interest has not yet been fixed.</P>
    <P>5.  Total amount of interest paid to date:&mdash;£28,514.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the dissatisfaction among district midwives at the basic salaries paid to them, which range from £100 to £160 per annum, that great hardship is suffered by them due to their having in many cases to <Col N="928" /> hire cars to transport themselves to dispensary cases in rural districts, and that facilities for augmenting this small income by private practice are not possible in many districts; and, if so, if he will consider either giving them a compensatory travelling allowance or sanctioning an increase in their basic salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am satisfied that cases arise occasionally in which a midwife is under expense in connection with travelling to public assistance patients, I feel that, in general, having regard to the number of cases dealt with, the present remuneration of midwives is not unreasonable.  The average number of cases is low and in a number of dispensary districts the services of the midwives are not called upon even once in the year.  As the Deputy can appreciate, the problem is a difficult one and I am still seeking a solution which, while being fair to the midwife, will not be unfair to the rate-payers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is no doubt aware that when attending a case a midwife has to pay at least eight visits, sometimes ten visits, and that in country districts it is quite usual for a midwife to have to travel up to ten miles.  Does he not consider there is a reasonable case for giving them some travelling expenses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrigetMRice" hpid="Mrs. Rice Mrs. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the case of midwives in these areas.  Most nurses now have general training and also take up training as midwives.  If they are not offered more attractive salaries they will leave the country and will be a loss to us.  In view of that the Minister might reconsider their case, if not for the sake of the old nurses at least for the new nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy must realise there is a difficult problem considering the fact that in some areas they are getting a salary for doing nothing.  It may be quite true that in other areas there are high travelling expenses.  As I said, it is a difficult problem and requires further consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>1.  (a) There were 287 Savings Bank books involved. (b)  There is no such thing as a Savings Certificates account but there are approximately 300,000 holders of Savings Certificates in the State and these holdings are registered in serial form at headquarters.  Without spending an entirely disproportionate amount of time and labour on <Col N="936" /> the examination of every individual holding, it is impossible to say what certificates were purchased at Ballinalee or, indeed, at any other office.</P>
      <P>2.  The examination of the Savings Bank books commenced on 27th August, 1952, and was completed on 31st December, 1952.  No examination of savings Certificates holdings was made.</P>
      <P>3.  No written application from the Deputy for details of the irregularities was received by me.</P>
      <P>4.  The first part of this section of the Deputy's question does not, therefore, arise.  As regards the second part, it was suggested to the Deputy in a letter dated the 15th September, 1952, that he consult a prominent local person who has been acquainted with the full circumstances of the case.  The Deputy acknowledged in a letter to me that he had consulted the person.</P>
      <P>It distressed me more than the House can appreciate to ventilate the facts of this case on February 5th, a course forced upon me by circumstances over which I had no control, and I sincerely trust I have now heard the last of the matter.  I can assure the House that I have an adequate answer to any question any Deputy might care to ask, but I feel I can with safety rely upon the discretion of Deputies not to force on me the painful task of again emphasising the facts and dispelling doubts based upon a false interpretation of the events which led inevitably and according to unvarying tradition to my final decision.</P>

      <P>In the middle of November, Deputy MacEoin, accompanied by Deputy Carter, made verbal representations to me on behalf of the postmistress and was given all the facts upon which the dismissal was based.  Deputy Carter was present, and in his own right as a Deputy wished to assure himself in the same way as Deputy MacEoin that this dismissal was justified in view of the wide agitation that had taken place. Deputy MacEoin was informed that the postmistress had admitted the charges in statements made by her to officers of the Department.  The Deputy was also informed that the decision had been made by me, in September, 1952, not to forward the papers to the Attorney-General with a view to a public prosecution, and that she was dismissed because of the chaos in the office and gross irregularities regardless of her motives and that this decision by me should hold good unless further irregularities were found in the savings books being investigated.  The actual position is that from the time the postmistress signed her second statement of admission, it was open to any friend of hers or to her solicitor to suggest to her that she should renounce her statement and to take such action as was available to her, according to the ordinary law of the land, to deny the validity of the charges.  No such action was taken by any person, and the postmistress herself, <Col N="938" /> neither on the advice of her solicitor nor of any other person, has ever made any statement renouncing the correctness of the statements she signed.</P>

      <P>Each year I am asked to provide sufficient seed under my Department's <Col N="941" /> seed distribution scheme to meet all applications from certain parts of County Donegal.  The very nature of the scheme and the limited supplies of seed available preclude me from meeting this demand.  I have, therefore, decided to introduce an alternate year rotational system of distribution in these areas.  Under this system the quantity of seed which would ordinarily go to Cloghaneely and Annagry parishes this year will be diverted to supplement the Gweedore and Burtonport allocations.  Next year the position will be reversed as between the two groups.  In this way it is hoped to meet in alternate years the requirements of all eligible applicants in these four parishes, thus fulfilling the real object of the scheme, which is to provide a regular change of seed at intervals.</P>

Has it not been one of the Minister's difficulties that the people in these areas did not avail of the scheme?  Is it not a deplorably dusty answer to these people when they do come forward and seek to co-operate with the scheme that we cannot supply all of them, that we can do only two parishes this year and two next year?

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph 1 to delete sub-paragraph (3), lines 10 and 11.&mdash;John A. Costello, Liam Cosgrave.</P>
      <P>The sub-section, as drafted, is to enable the Minister to appoint temporary members.  I think it is undesirable that there should be temporary members of this commission.  I think that temporary members for a particular purpose do away automatically with continuity in relation to the administration of the Bill.  Secondly, the appointment of temporary members leaves itself open to the most grave abuses.  What the Minister has in mind is that a certain type of person might be required for a certain type of inquiry.  I think it would be very wrong that this type of person should be a member of the commission.  I think the Minister can get what he wants equally well by their being given an assignment as an officer of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> Suppose, for example, that the Minister considered it necessary to get a chartered accountant with a particular type of experience to deal with a particular type of practice coming before the commission, it would be highly undesirable that the Minister should temporarily appoint some such accountant to be a member of the commission for the purpose.  The commission should have power to retain such a person to make an investigation on their behalf and the commission should judge following an examination of the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.  It happens that in quite a number of these Bills this provision appears because the possibility was always envisaged of the need for getting specialised knowledge on the investigating body.  It is not merely enough that the commission should have available to it special advice but the public should have confidence in the capacity of the commission to judge fairly the matters that will come before it.</P>
      <P>I was not thinking so much of chartered accountants or people with any general qualifications.  I was thinking of cases where the commission would be dealing with practices relating to shipping, insurance or some specialised business of that kind, where a deep knowledge of the conditions in a certain trade would be essential for the understanding of the questions that the commission was investigating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that, where a specialised type of investigation is being undertaken, it would be desirable to have power to put on the commission people whose competence in that particular field would be recognised by the people who appear before the commission by asking the commission to appoint assessors for a particular purpose, just as the admiralty judge does in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the same thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite the same thing because one course preserves the continuity of the commission.  We assume the commission has secured <Col N="947" /> the confidence of the public generally. If they are sustained in peculiar technical problems by competent assessors to advise them they have all the advantages while the public have the reassurance that the commission is a continuing body which does not fluctuate and into whose membership no person can be arbitrarily injected. It would not be a good thing that the Minister could inject one or two additional persons.  When President Roosevelt tried to do that he upset the apple-cart.  People would begin to wonder if by putting extra special members on the commission, you might sway the verdict.  If the Minister put in assessors to assist the commission the integrity of the commission would remain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an even worse aspect of the matter than that to which Deputy Dillon adverted. Under Section 6, the position is such that one member of the commission can make the inquiry and that one member might be the temporary member.  In regard to any particular specialised branch of industry, we are a small country, and it is practically impossible to get anybody in one of these specialised branches, if that is what the Minister has in mind, who has not got an axe to grind one way or the other.</P>
      <P>I appreciate entirely that the ordinary members of the commission may not be acquainted with insurance procedure, practice, business methods, etc., and that it might be impossible to get them to understand these things without assistance.  In regard to insurance, I do not think it would be possible to find a person here who understood insurance from A to Z who had not got a vested interest of one sort or another.  If you are going to take a person from within the country he probably must of necessity have a vested interest.  I do not think it is right or fair to put such persons in the position of being arbitrators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is essential, where the members of the commission are not skilled in the particular and diverse practices of a particular trade, that they should have available to them the <Col N="948" /> highest technical advice.  Let them afterwards assess as between the technical aspect put up by A and that put up by B.  That method is the most free from vested interest control or influence.  I do not think it would be right that a single person so appointed with those technical qualifications should be in the position of being able to decide in the name of the commission in respect of a particular inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where the kernel of the weakness lies.  If the Minister appoints a highly qualified technical person to be a member of the commission for a specific purpose no matter how many of the commission may sit on the inquiry it will be the opinion of that person who is especially qualified that will carry the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Call him a technical assessor or anything you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better from the point of view of the commission if a person with a particular expert knowledge were to give that in such a way as not to influence the ultimate decision of the commission. It should be left to the commission for assessment and appraisal.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be well advised to take the view in the long run that the more stable he can make the commission and the more broad the technical assistance he would make available to it by way of assessors the better.  There may even be more technical questions than shipping. There may be questions in regard to certain types of cost accountancy in regard to which you might only be able to find one person&mdash;he might not even be in this country&mdash;who would be able to make an accurate assessment.  In those circumstances, it might be wiser for the Minister to take the view that people of unique technical ability would be brought on to the commission by means of nomination as a &ldquo;friend&rdquo; of the commission to advise as distinct from influencing the decision of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care very much what name we call them&mdash;whether it be &ldquo;temporary members&rdquo; or &ldquo;technical assessors.&rdquo;  The problem of having only a limited circle of experts from <Col N="949" /> which to draw in this country would arise no matter what name we used. I would not agree at all that the commission should itself have the right to appoint extra members.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem would arise only whenever the Minister considers that the commission is not qualified to do the job thoroughly.  The commission is less likely to admit that than the Minister is to see it.  In so far as the main aim is to establish and maintain public confidence in the competence of the commission to go thoroughly into the matters that are under investigation and to give a completely objective and adequate report, it is desirable that the Minister should have power to make these additions whether we call them &ldquo;temporary members&rdquo; or &ldquo;technical assessors.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of the commission is to make a report to the Minister.  On receipt of that report the Minister may or may not act by bringing a Bill before Dáil Éireann.  Is is not clear that it is not designed that the Minister should refer to his commission of three a trade practice, that he should get a report from the commission that this practice is unobjectionable and that, three months later&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They just do not report their view upon it.  They must give a report upon all the practice of the trade.  The Minister would make the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They submit a report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But the report ends up by saying something to this effect: &ldquo;We feel that this practice is unobjectionable and that, therefore, no Order should be made.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Three months later a very closely analogous practice is referred to the tribunal and the contemporaneous announcement is made that, this time, the Minister has added two special members.  Surely a person who is going to defend his course of conduct before that commission <Col N="950" /> will feel that the Minister knows blooming well that in the last case he had the chairman but that the other two members went against the chairman and that the Minister is now hauling him before this commission although, in fact, he feels he should be acquitted by the previous decision. This time the Minister will take the precaution of bringing in two full members who have full voting rights with the permanent members, so that the Minister will get a report for them in the sense that the chairman of the last commission told them he wished to get but which, in fact, he did not get because the chairman was voted down.  It is wholly otherwise if the commission still consists of the original three members but the Minister deliberately says: &ldquo;I want to bring within their knowledge special technical information which, I think, will sway their judgment.  I am going to send in assessors to advise them on the matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the commission still take the view that the original decision is still the decision they would have taken after what they heard, and if the commission have the confidence of the public, I think the public will believe that whatever assessors the Minister sends in&mdash; while they will be listened to with respect&mdash;will not have the power to vote down a majority of the commission. I think it is very important, if the commission is to maintain public confidence, that the public will have the assurance that whoever the Minister sends in as special advisers will not have voting power to reverse a decision previously taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the anxiety is that the Minister might use his power to, let us say, &ldquo;pack&rdquo; the commission then I think we could devise safeguards. I agree that there is a point there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. Subject to the discussion we had on Section 6, the report of the commission will obviously be influenced by the person who makes the investigation. You will not get the continuity if the one member of the commission who makes the investigation does not apply the same type of outlook to the various procedures that come before him.  If he is coming in only for a particular inquiry he has not got, shall I say, the tradition or precedent that will spring up as the commission goes on working. You will not, therefore, with a temporary member, be able to get the same continuity that you will get by utilising the permanent members or by the Minister's direction to have technical advice.  If the Minister wishes to put it that way I would not object to that aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all interested, as consumers, in say, an inquiry into bakery.  This is open to the very greatest objection and, I do not think that the Minister means to allow <Col N="952" /> that section to be operated in the manner in which it is open to operation at the moment.  If a member of the commission is interested in or has a substantial shareholding in a business akin to or in rivalry with the type of business under investigation by the Minister it would be grossly unfair to ask him to act on the inquiry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But it does not do it in the right way.  To be &ldquo;personally interested&rdquo; is not quite the same thing as to be publicly interested.  We are all publicly interested in things, as consumers.  &ldquo;Personally interested,&rdquo; I think, is the same as interest in a private business capacity, if you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that if he is interested to the extent that there is any danger of a conflict between his personal interest and his duty as a member of the commission, he should not act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But if he is, say, the owner of a small block of railway stock and he is called upon to deal with some substantial question of freight charges, I would not consider that that was such as to debar him from acting. I would not object to something like this: &ldquo;The Minister shall not authorise a member if he believes that the member's interest is substantial,&rdquo; or something of that kind.  What is in the section is that he will not act without reporting the fact of his interest to the Minister and getting his authority to act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true if his interest is a small one, but if his interest is substantial it is far more likely that people will know of it.  The Minister will not authorise him to act unless he is satisfied that the amount of his interest is not such as to debar him from discharging his duties as a member of the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely what is here.  A member of the commission comes along and says: &ldquo;I have doubts as to whether I should act,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I have a personal interest in this.&rdquo;  If, when he is asked what is his personal interest, he says that the commission is dealing with cigarettes and he is a smoker, that would not be a reason; but if he was a principal shareholder in a cigarette manufacturing concern it would be a different problem.  What is stated here is that he reports his interest, and he must not act if it is a substantial interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if a man came along and said that he had doubts about acting because he was a smoker himself that would be so manifestly irrational that he should not be invited to act at all.  If a man is too closely connected with a business then I think he should not act.</P>

      <P>As regards amendments Nos. 50 and 51, I am prepared to accept in principle amendment No. 51 in the name of Deputy Costello.  I am thinking of taking the corresponding clause in the Electricity Supply Act or the Turf Development Act which requires that a member cannot be removed except for stated reasons which are set out in these Acts, such as that a member has been unable for a long time to act as a member of the board, that he has been suffering from ill-health and for the other reasons stated.  A statement of the reasons must be given to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 50 and 51 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 52:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In paragraph 8, to delete sub-paragraph (1) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In this paragraph, &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; means a person authorised in writing by the commission for the purposes of this paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I promised on the Second Reading to introduce an amendment of this character. There are a number of amendments dealing with this point, namely, the authorisation to be given to officers of the commission to carry out investigations. I think it is adequate to provide, as I propose to provide here, that an authorised officer means a person authorised in writing by the commission. I do not think we should exclude ourselves from utilising an officer in the Garda Síochána from carrying out investigations, provided he is authorised in writing by the commission, nor would it be wise to limit ourselves <Col N="955" /> to the authorisation of officers in the Civil Service not below the rank of principal officer.  In practice, any work of the commission will be done by officers in the inspectorate in the Department of Industry and Commerce. I contemplate that most of our departmental inspectors, in addition to their existing duties, may be authorised to carry out inquiries for the commission.  I would not like to exclude completely the possibility of using an officer of the Garda Síochána in certain cases.  The objection, I understood, was to the possibility that members of the Garda Síochána, on their own initiative and because of the wording of this paragraph, would go around carrying out inquiries on their own behalf and reporting to the commission. I agree that that prospect should be ruled out.  That would be an undesirable position.  I think I have succeeded in doing that by this amendment which requires an authorisation in writing by the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to one particular member for all the investigations that he might wish to make.  I think that the Minister ought to limit his appointment, and that an authorised person should mean an authorised person, in writing, for a particular inquiry. The commission could very well authorise an inspector of the Department of Industry and Commerce to make all the inquiries that are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission will have more to do than conduct inquiries. It has the further duty of keeping under general review the operation of restrictive practices or <Col N="956" /> the adequacy of the orders made under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the commission want to find out whether X has occurred in Ballydehob or not, and they do not want to go to the expense of sending an inspector from the Department just to make one inquiry, and they ask the local sergeant to make the inquiry for them and report back to them, if the thing is simple enough, where a person goes in and asks did you sell this or did you not, I can see possibly a case for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misunderstanding the position.  In so far as there is any question of a trader or any other person having contravened an Order which has been confirmed by the Oireachtas, there is no question of having to use authorised officers. There is then an offence against the law committed, and all the machinery of law enforcement is available to check repetition of that offence or to bring offenders to the courts.  We are dealing here now with the work of the commission, and only the work of the commission.</P>
      <P>The work of the commission is to conduct specific inquiries into the sale and distribution of particular goods or else to carry out this general investigation as to how Orders made are working out; whether they require amendment in view of the effect that they have on trade or the methods that have been found to evade them.  It is to carry out inquiries of that kind that the commission should have authorised officers, and I think there could be certain instances in which those authorised officers would be given by the commission a sort of general authority to go through the country and see how an Order that was made is working out; whether it is unduly restrictive on trade or means have been found to evade it; so that they can report to the Minister whether an amendment or annulment of the Order is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are circumstances where it might be more desirable to have it undertaken by a uniformed Guard than by a non-uniformed inspector of the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely all experience teaches us that in matters of that kind you want a person of prudence and discretion.  All of us have had the experience in administration that the zeal of youth brought into raw contact with the public can sometimes produce the most unexpected results, and that an experienced officer, either of the Civil Service or the Garda, can often get the same thing done without an explosion while a zealous young civil servant or a young member of the Garda could stir up a hornet's nest. It is not an easy thing, without creating a good deal of annoyance, to question people about their personal affairs. I think the outstanding example is that if the Post Office are trying to put a pole on your premises they always have senior responsible officials who can come in and put the come-hither on you, whereas a young fellow, such as some of the E.S.B. officials, announce that they are going to put up a pole and the matter will go to the Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>I never heard the Post Office being refused leave to put down the most preposterous poles, because they have senior men and take the trouble to send senior men to put the come-hither on somebody that they want to get around.  Speaking as a shopkeeper, I do assure the Minister, from considerable experience, that it makes all the difference in the world if a responsible and experienced officer of the Department or the Garda comes in, makes his inquiry as a rational man, without putting the pistol to your head, rather than the young fellow who comes in and claps down a form and says: &ldquo;Answer these questions and sign the paper.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point I am trying to meet with this amendment.  It will not be any Guard or any civil servant.  He must be selected, personally authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has come a long way to meet it.  All I am <Col N="958" /> suggesting is, is it desirable to go a step further and say that persons so authorised&mdash;as Deputy Sweetman says &mdash;who will have a general authorisation, should have a certain rank in the service from which they are drawn to qualify, certainly, for general authorisation, as distinguished from <i>ad hoc</i> authorisation for one particular inquiry?  Here, again, it is a matter the Minister might turn over in his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would agree with this, we could provide that the authorisation in writing shall specify the purpose for which the officer is authorised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I think that goes the way I want it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But I understand it is quite possible that they will have one officer, or more, who would be given a general sort of authorisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  And there are officers to whom it would be desirable to give a general authorisation.  There are other officers in whose case it would not be desirable.  I want to ensure that the officers to whom you would not give general authorisation are not, in fact, empowered, under the authorisation they have, to make general inquiries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a second time.  In any review of the progress of industrial development in this country, special reference must be made to the exceptional circumstances prevailing in the Western areas, and the occasion of the Second Reading of this Bill is perhaps an appropriate one on which to recall the more obvious of these circumstances.</P>
      <P>As has been indicated on more than one occasion previously, this country has for historical reasons suffered from underdevelopment of industries.  Such industries as existed, or were developed, tended to become concentrated in the eastern and southern areas of the country, which were already established as the centres of financial and commercial activity and represented the principal market for industrial products.  Even under the impetus of the industrial drive begun in 1933, this tendency has continued, for the purely economic reasons mentioned, to the almost total neglect of industrial development on the Western seaboard.</P>
      <P>Chronic underdevelopment of industries produced a situation in which the level of industrial employment in this country was substantially lower than elsewhere, and as non-industrial employment was insufficient to absorb the available labour force, a tradition of emigration grew up as the only solution to the resultant economic problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Western areas, the proportion of the population engaged in industrial employment is less than half the proportion for the country as a whole, and, as emigration continues to be heaviest from those areas, it is a reasonable assumption that the most effective way of checking emigration would be to provide a wider variety of employment, and particularly industrial employment <Col N="962" /> in those areas.  Positive steps to this end have already been taken by the Government.  The Undeveloped Areas Act, 1952, provided for the grant of substantial financial assistance to encourage the establishment of industries in the undeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>The competitive disadvantage arising from remoteness from the main centres of consumption, and the lack of indigenous raw material have combined to make industrial development in the Western areas a matter of peculiar difficulty.  Industrial activity based on agricultural products appears to afford the greatest prospect of successful development and it is on this assumption that the scheme covered by the present Bill has been put forward.  The natural wealth of the Western areas consists almost entirely of extensive peat bogs and considerable progress has been made in the development of these bogs for the production of peat as fuel.  There are, however, many bogs which will not be required for the production of fuel for many years to come.  If left unworked, these bogs will merely continue to grow peat&mdash; producing vegetation which will add only slightly to the potential fuel supply.</P>
    <P>The value of these bogs and their contribution to the economic development of the Western areas in particular, and of the country generally, would be immeasurably enhanced if it could be shown that by drainage and cultivation they could be utilised for the production of agricultural crops suitable for subsequent drying or other industrial processing.</P>
    <P>Grass crops have already been grown experimentally on drained bog land. The primary purpose of the present measure is to enable further, full scale, experimental work to be undertaken to demonstrate the possibilities for the economic utilisation of drained bog land on a commercial basis.  For this purpose it is proposed to set up a limited company, Mín-Fhéir Teoranta, to acquire, drain and cultivate bog land in the Bangor-Erris area of County Mayo, and to process grass and other plants for sale.  Primarily, the company will manufacture grassmeal, but they may also undertake the production <Col N="963" /> and processing for sale of other plants, such as medicinal herbs, which are in short supply throughout the world, and some of which can possibly be more successfully grown on drained bog land than elsewhere.  If and when required Mín-Fhéir Teoranta will have the benefit of the technical advice and assistance of Bord na Móna as well as of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, who have already undertaken experiments in the cultivation of drained bog land in other areas.</P>
    <P>The scheme is in the nature of an experiment and it is not possible, therefore, nor is it desirable, to attempt to anticipate the method of working which may be adopted by the new company.  It is obvious, however, that two or three years may elapse before grass is available in sufficient quantities to justify the economic operation of a full-scale drying plant, and other methods of disposing of the crop may have to be adopted during this initial period.</P>
    <P>It would be idle also to suggest that even the most successful outcome of the experiment would automatically solve the problem of industrial employment in remote western areas.  As has already been indicated, the purpose of the experiment is to demonstrate the commercial possibilities for the successful cultivation of drained bog land, and it is the intention that expenditure by Mín-Fhéir Teoranta during the experimental period should be limited to the amount necessary for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Several considerations influenced the choice of the Bangor-Erris areas for this experiment.  Firstly, Bord na Móna are in process of acquiring a substantial area of bog there (about 20,000 acres) out of which the much smaller area of 2,000 acres required for the grass meal experiment could readily be made available without in any way interfering with the plans for turf production.  Secondly, the larger area of choice would permit the selection of a location suitable for the use of the mechanical equipment proposed to be used.  Finally, as the ultimate objective in the bog development at Bangor-Erris was the erection by the E.S.B. of a peat-fired electricity generating station, the availability of any <Col N="964" /> electric power required for the industrial processes would be ensured.</P>
    <P>Grass meal is used here mainly as a constituent in the manufacture of compound feeding stuffs for which purpose there is a demand both at home and for export.  Grass meal may also be used as a source of chlorophyll, a substance now used extensively in pharmaceutical preparations, and it may be possible to develop a new export market for this purpose.  (The plant for the extraction of chlorophyll would involve a capital expenditure of the order of £500,000 which could not be justified at the present stage of development.)  It is estimated that approximately 4,000 tons of grass meal will be produced annually.</P>

(Adopting the least favourable figures, the grass meal is estimated to cost £22 7s. per ton at plant against the current delivered sale price of £31 to £34 per ton, according to quality.)  It is understood that there is a market for all the grass meal estimated to be produced at Bangor-Erris.</P>
      <P>Capital expenditure on the grass meal project is estimated to amount to approximately £165,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>For the total period-and provision is made in the Bill for the making of grants to this amount out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  It will be recalled that the Minister for External Affairs informed the Dáil on the 10th June, 1952, that proposals for the utilisation of <Col N="965" /> moneys in the Grant Counterpart Special Account were sent on the 4th June, 1952, to the American Ambassador for transmission to the United States authorities.  These proposals included the grass meal project, for which it was proposed that £150,000 be provided from the Grant Counterpart Special Account to meet capital expenditure. Irrespective of the outcome of this proposal for the use of counterpart funds, it is intended that capital expenditure on the project should be met in the first instance out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Bill, the activities of the new company are restricted to the processing of grass and other plants, but there is provision under which licences may be granted to the company permitting it to manufacture other products suitable for use as animal feeding stuffs or fertilisers.  I have particularly in mind the production of seaweed meal.</P>
      <P>The licensing provision in the Grass Meal (Production) Bill, 1952, might be described as merely precautionary.  A final decision regarding the large-scale production of seaweed meal has not yet been taken.  One of the major obstacles to the development of the production of seaweed meal so far has been the absence of a suitable organisation, within a reasonable distance from the source of supply of the seaweed, adapted to undertake the actual drying and grinding processes.  The occasion of the introduction of legislation to provide for the production of grass meal has been availed of to provide that the proposed new organisation might undertake, under licence, the production of seaweed meal.  That, however, is not its primary function, and if a decision were taken to introduce a comprehensive scheme of seaweed meal production, separate provision would have to be made for the financing of such a scheme: there is no financial provision for it in the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might add that in relation to giving Deputies a general picture of the proposed project, I myself was not enamoured of the suggestion in the initial stages.  Since then I have had the benefit of reports of progress at <Col N="966" /> Gowla bog.  Coupled with that I have seen a film which gives a very clear picture of the progress and which, to say the very least of it, is most encouraging in relation to the prospect of a fuller and better utilisation of drained bog land for agricultural purposes.  That film is available for showing at very short notice by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  It can be shown in a small room and in all it takes only about 20 minutes.  I have been given permission by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann to say that they will make it available for any Deputies who may be interested in seeing it.  The projector and films could be brought here or it can be seen in the boardroom of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann in Clare Street. I am sure that seeing it will more than convince any Deputies who still have any misgivings about the utilisation of drained bog land for agricultural purposes.</P>

      <P>I admire the unfailing forbearance of my successor.  There is no indignity to which he is not prepared to submit himself for the common good.  I do not think my <i>bona fides</i> in this matter can be questioned because very shortly after the Parliamentary Secretary was appointed I heard this project mooted.  Probably one of the first letters he got as Parliamentary <Col N="967" /> Secretary was a letter from me because I was concerned to help him, if I could, in the work to which he put his hand, urging on him most strongly that before he seriously entertained a proposal along these lines he should consult the Department of Agriculture and have their view upon it.  I think it is immensely significant to-day that in the carefully prepared statement which the Parliamentary Secretary has made he has told us that he has had the benefit of the advice of the Turf Board and of Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, but the one party to whom he has not apparently applied for advice at all is the Department of Agriculture of the Irish Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press the Parliamentary Secretary unduly but I think it would have been more disingenuous if the Parliamentary Secretary had mentioned that he had consulted the Department of Agriculture and that their opinion of it was of so sulphurous a character he did not care to communicate it to Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Dáil that this country has 12,000,000 acres of arable land, most of which are acknowledged the world over to be the finest grass-growing land in the world.  I would ask the Dáil is there reason or common sense when one has 12,000,000 acres of the best grass-growing land in the world in turning to the bogs of Bangor-Erris for the purpose of growing grass?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would Deputies reflect for a moment <Col N="968" /> on what grass meal is?  Grass meal is grass.  Now who in this country ever heard of anyone paying 32/- a cwt. for hay?  That is all that grass meal is, good hay.  All the difference between grass meal and hay is that for grass meal one cuts the grass before the seeding stage and, instead of allowing the sun to dry it, one dries it artificially by electricity, or coal, or whatever else one pleases; having dehydrated the grass, if one wants to sell it as meal one passes it through a mill, breaks it up and puts it into large bags.  But in our economy that product must compete with silage and good hay.  It is ordinarily estimated that after pulping it has a crude protein content of 22 per cent., which is a very high percentage, in the first quality such as the Parliamentary Secretary suggests might command £34 per ton.  But, even at that, it is a very expensive form of live-stock feeding.</P>
    <P>There is a big demand for it in England where it is almost entirely used for fowl kept in the backyards of the big cities.  It is of very special value as an element in the diet of fowl confined in a small space.  Eggs are so scarce in England that every woman likes to have a few fowl and if, in order to keep them healthy, in addition to the ordinary cereals with which they are fed, grass meal completes the diet and thus a very fancy price is obtained. But in our economy you cannot compete against silage and hay with grass meal at 34/-.  It is true, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, that this product may pass into consumption mainly as a constituent of compound feeding stuffs, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to recall the fact that if it is to be in compound feeding stuff and the compound feeding stuff manufacturers are required to use it, the net result will be an increase in the cost of pig meals, layers' mash, calf meal and the other meals the farmers have to use in producing live-stock.</P>
    <P>Surely if we are going to use grass meal our purpose should be to make the best grass meal we can at the lowest possible price.  Under the Department of Agriculture there was <Col N="969" /> installed a grass drying plant at the farm at Grange, County Meath, installed to see, if we grew grass on the best grass land in Ireland and dried it as economically as it was humanly possible to dry it, using the best mechanical devices you could employ, what was the lowest penny at which you could produce dried grass.  It was decided to make that test before determining whether the Department would recommend as a general practice to the agricultural community the preservation of grass by its conversion into dried grass rather than silage or hay.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has asked the Department of Agriculture to give him the benefit of their experience in the operation of their grass drying plant at Grange, but I think it is strange if he has not taken the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to help the Parliamentary Secretary in any way I can to promote in the congested areas the sort of industrial activity that would provide work for the people and useful activity, because I think one of the great mistakes that has always been made with regard to the congested areas is to smother them in relief schemes, whereas I believe their productive potential is great.  Their ability to earn profit and a decent living for themselves is very great if they are given a chance.  It is common knowledge that the last kind of land in the world on which you ought to grow grass is bogland, because, in order to be bog, it must be acid.  If it were not acid, it would not be bog. The first thing you must do if you want to grow good grass, is to produce a hydrogen iron concentration of about 6.5.  You cannot have a bog in the presence of that concentration, so that vast quantities of lime must be put down to begin with.  Then you find the bogland is destitute of phosphates; you cannot have grass without phosphates and that must be provided. Your next problem, if you want to get any kind of return for grass for land sown is to provide nitrogen.  I do not know what the potash status of these boglands is.  It is conceivable that their potash content is adequate and <Col N="970" /> that they do not require much, but it is possible that you might, in addition, have to supply a grave potash deficiency.</P>
    <P>Anybody who understands the growing of grass knows that you cannot contemplate the growing of grass by the annual application of artificial fertilisers exclusively, because if you did that the grass would become more expensive than asparagus.  The only way you can profitably grow grass is to have in the soil where you propose to grow it a cycle of fundamental fertility to which you might make modest annual additions.  The very essence of successful grass growing where grass has not been grown before is to establish a sward on which you can graze livestock whose manure establishes in the soil a certain basic fertility which can be augmented annually by the application of artificial fertilisers, but in the absence of that natural organic manure in the ground the expense of growing good grass would make the crop hopelessly uneconomic and you would find you were growing grass under conditions which would make its production more expensive than if you tried to grow it on top of Nelson Pillar.</P>
    <P>Supposing we were faced with the dilemma that if we did not grow grass in Bangor-Erris we would simply have to abandon the whole countryside, I would be prepared to say that since it involved such a big loss we ought not to suffer the loss and therefore we should grow grass there.  But it is not so.  Bogland is the best land in the world in which to grow potatoes. Anyone who knows anything about it will tell you the best seed potatoes in the world are grown there, and you will get the best of ware potatoes in bogland. If you asked Professor Sherrard of Glasnevin he will tell you there are certain types of bog soil uniquely suitable for the growing of vegetables like asparagus and carrots.  I agree there is no market in Ireland for our capacity to grow vegetables of this kind in Bangor-Erris.  But why should we not can them?  There is an immense market in all the cities of England and Great Britain and indeed on the Continent for canned asparagus and <Col N="971" /> canned vegetables of other kinds which are quite too expensive for the ordinary greengrocer here.  A locality like Bangor-Erris could be made the basis of a canning station and when you start canning vegetables you can contemplate the canning of a variety of other commodities.  I merely say that it is something worthy of investigation and I think it should be effectively investigated and a useful opinion secured upon it by the experts whom we have already in our service.</P>
    <P>Some of them are some of the most distinguished men in Europe.  The only place in which there is no respect for them is in their native country.  I know of whom I speak because I travelled with them.  In Washington, Rome and Paris their word carries great weight and their opinions are listened to with great deference, but when they come back to Upper Merrion Street it seems to be pretty generally accepted that they are not worth listening to.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative method of providing employment and, I think, at great profit in that area stretching from Ballycastle right out to Port-naCloy and that is, the growing of potatoes on a large scale, the provision of piggeries and, if necessary, the provision of pigs on credit.  Such a scheme is operating under the Department of Agriculture through the Pigs and Bacon Commission at the present time. The scheme provided that a man could take a sow or a number of store pigs and he could get potatoes and meal and the pigs on credit on the understanding that, when they were fit for market, the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Commission would market the pigs for him, deduct the cost of the bonhams, the meal and the potatoes which he had received, and give him the difference.  As often as he was prepared to do that, three or four times in the year, they would give him as many pigs as he was in a position to house and let himself and his family feed them.  Now, we have an unlimited market for pork, pigs and bacon at prices that I think would provide any industrious man with a very good living producing them.  We could afford to pay 260/- per cwt. for <Col N="972" /> all the pork produced in Bangor-Erris, cure it at Ballina or Castlebar or ship the pork through the port of Ballina or ship it in the form of bacon from other suitable ports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use producing any vegetable in Bangor-Erris &mdash;be it grass, potatoes, sea kale, asparagus or anything else&mdash;unless we see some means of consuming it.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that he proposes to put the grass meal into compound feeds or to sell it abroad.  I propose that he should put this into live stock and sell the live stock produce abroad.  I say we should produce grass where we can produce it best and cheapest and try to use the resources of Bangor-Erris to their best advantage in another direction.  I think we can do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of converting seaweed into meal.  I remember being exposed to great ridicule here when I said, from the very seat where he is now sitting, that I hoped in Kilkerrin in Connemara to convert seaweed into nylons.  I remember Deputy the Lord Mayor of Cork going into paroxysms here on the suggestion to put silk stockings on the girls in Cork from seaweed grown in Connemara.  First of all, he was an ignorant man and did not realise that it had been found an eminently possible thing to do, something that we ought <Col N="973" /> to do.  I have a feeling that if we can convert seaweed in Kilkerrin into suitable fibre for weaving, we should not baulk at the task.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why we should get the raw material in Kilkerrin and ship it into Glasgow and there see it woven into textiles, when we could make the filament just as easily in Connemara. I would see no objection to making seaweed meal, if I knew what the Parliamentary Secretary intends to do with the seaweed meal, but I think it has very limited value.  Certainly, looking into it very closely, I could not find out if we would get very much out of seaweed meal worth getting and it seemed probable that the most attractive user of seaweed was as a fertiliser in the wet state in the immediate vicinity of where it was taken ashore.  The expense of handling it beyond that puts it out of court.</P>
    <P>Surely this House ought carefully to reflect before it launches out in Bangor-Erris on an experiment in growing grass which is commended to the House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce but on which the Minister for Agriculture has not a word to say and under a scheme in regard to which the Parliamentary Secretary has sought the advice of the Department of Agriculture and has received so sulphurous a reply that he does not care to indicate its contents to Dáil Éireann.  Surely before we throw ourselves on a scheme of that kind we do ourselves more credit and we do the whole of this plan for the development of the Gaeltacht more justice, if we embark on something which has in it a promise of success and of the rational exploitation of the resources that one naturally would expect to find there.  Is it not more sensible to grow potatoes in bogland and grass on grassland, than to grow grass on bogs and potatoes in County Meath?</P>
    <P>If it is true&mdash;as I believe it is true&mdash; that this land in North-West Mayo is uniquely suited for the production of vegetables of a character that can be canned and sold in the luxury markets of Great Britain and abroad, would it not be a more rational thing to grow such products there and process them <Col N="974" /> there for export than to attempt to grow grass to be converted into grass meal, with the knowledge that if there is no other means of disposing of it, it will be put into the compound feeds used by our farmers and will ultimately constitute a hidden charge on the export branch of our agricultural industry?</P>
    <P>There are 4,000 tons which will have to be disposed of, I take it, and I suppose that in the last analysis the compound feed people will be required to take it at a price and that they will recover that price from the stock feeders of the country.  That means an addition to the cost of production of the live stock that must ultimately be exported.  I would welcome any scheme which I thought provided employment and enabled the people of Bangor-Erris profitably to spend their time in their own service, primarily, and secondarily in the service of the community at large; but I do not believe it is consistent with reason or common sense to adjourn to Bangor-Erris for the purpose of growing grass.</P>
    <P>I invite Deputies to address their minds to this question.  They have as fine a Department of Agriculture as functions in any country in the world. There is no country in the world that would not seek and profoundly respect the opinion of the Irish Ministry of Agriculture on the question of growing grass.  Do not Deputies think that they ought to know the opinion of their own Department of Agriculture on this question before coming to a final decision on it?  I do not know that I can add anything to what I have already said.  I am bound to tell the House&mdash;and I would be false to my trust if I did not&mdash;that I think this scheme is not a practical user of the resources that are available in that area.  I think the scheme will fail because there are none of the constituents for success present.  I saw this film two and a half years ago.</P>

      <P>I should be long sorry to charge the Parliamentary Secretary with sponsoring a project to put soil into the bogs of Bangor-Erris.  I am not alleging that against him.  I am assuming that he is going to try to grow grass on the boglands there and I think he is going to have a very stormy passage in trying to get the grass to grow.  That he can get it to grow is perfectly certain.  You could nearly grow grass on top of some of the Deputies' heads here, if you wanted to, and if you were prepared to spend enough money, time and attention in getting it to grow, but it would scarcely be an economic proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the sole ground on which I challenge the desirability of what the Parliamentary Secretary is putting his hand to.  A proposal to grow grass in Ireland which is presented to the House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the recommendation of the Turf Development Board and the Sugar Beet Company, without any reference to the Department of Agriculture of the Irish Republic is about the daftest proposition I have ever seen even Fianna Fáil bring before Dáil Éireann.  I want to say, with respect to my distinguished successor, Deputy Tomás Breathnach, the Minister for Agriculture, that much as I admire his modesty and even his humility, I do feel constrained to say to him that he can carry these two great Christian virtues too far.  There is such a thing <Col N="976" /> as duty and when he undertook the assignment of Minister for Agriculture, he undertook the duty of protecting the interests of the agricultural industry and all those engaged in it.  I think the time has come for him to ask himself if he discharges that duty when a Bill, designed to promote the growing of grass in this country, is presented to the House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, sponsored by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government and sustained, not by the technical advice of the Department of Agriculture but by a film of the Sugar Company's and the encouragement of the Turf Board.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that I am in no way qualified to assess the value of this scheme, or indeed the value of the alternative schemes proposed by Deputy Dillon.  Many of his arguments did seem to be based on common sense and I think should be examined by the Parliamentary Secretary. I am afraid, however, that my approach to it would be a completely unscientific one.  Bangor-Erris is one of the areas from which there is a very heavy drain of emigration.  There is a proposal embodied in this Bill which provides for the spending of £165,000 in Bangor-Erris&mdash;at least, I hope the money will be spent in Bangor-Erris and not on Civil Service offices up here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The bulk of it will be spent on machinery imported from Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If even half of it were spent in Bangor-Erris, it would be of quite considerable assistance to many people in that area.  The only word of warning I should like to utter to the Parliamentary Secretary is this &mdash;and this applies not merely to this scheme, but to many schemes which, I am sure, he has considered from time to time.  There is always a temptation to put up some employment-giving industry in an area, in the hope that it will be an economic proposition, or will require only a small subsidy.  I can see that in a number of cases it would be wise to pay even a permanent subsidy, provided the employment content was sufficient to justify it.  There <Col N="977" /> is a great deal of danger in putting up small schemes which involve a large amount of State expenditure without providing any substantial employment. I do not know what employment these proposals will provide and the Parliamentary Secretary might tell us later whether he has any indication of the number of people who will be employed locally; but I urge him to resist the temptation to put up a spectacular scheme which may prove uneconomic and will not have a sufficient labour content.</P>
      <P>If I may digress for a moment&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary ranged fairly widely in his opening remarks and perhaps I may be allowed to make this disgression&mdash;I should like to urge him to try to move the Department of Lands and Forestry into acquiring more land and planting more land in the West of Ireland, because it is a sound investment.  Forestry work has a greater labour content than any other public works.  It provides an investment which will keep it going and provides raw material which make secondary industries possible within a reasonable space of time.  I would prefer to see this sum of £165,000 spent on forestry in County Mayo than on a scheme which may or may not succeed for the growing of grass, but again I am in no way qualified to express any view on whether or not the scheme is feasible or good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not studied the Bill very carefully, but I do not quite know or understand the purpose of Section 11 and its consequential provisions.  It does seem to indicate that the granting of a monopoly to the company is contemplated and, if a licence is granted under Section 11, nobody else will be allowed to manufacture the same product.  I may be mistaken, but I think that would be dangerous.  Most of the suggestions made by Deputy Dillon do appear to be constructive and should be considered.  The question of the growing and canning of vegetables for an export market, for consumption in the bigger cities, in Mayo and Bangor-Erris is probably worth pursuing, and likewise the developing of the growing of strawberries <Col N="978" /> in the whole of Mayo is probably worth considering.</P>

      <P>Mayo happens to be one of the few areas in the world which is free from disease in regard to strawberries and in which the best strawberry plants are produced.  I do not think that the growing of strawberries has been sufficiently developed in Mayo and, in my opinion, it should be helped considerably.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary envisages the development of a sufficient strawberry acreage to warrant the establishment of a canning factory for strawberries and vegetables, but these are matters that are worth considering.</P>
      <P>The only other remark I should like to make is that I am glad to hear that some proposals have been put forward in regard to the utilisation of the Marshall Aid Grant Fund.  Not a penny of that money has yet been utilised, as far as I know, or allocated for any purpose.  I hope if we are going to spend that money now, we shall be a little more grateful than we have been in the past in regard to Marshall Aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not the pleasure of hearing the Parliamentary Secretary introducing this Bill and I can only take the Bill as I find it.  The purpose of the company to be set up under the Bill, is the acquisition, drainage and cultivation of bogland in the Bangor-Erris area, the processing of grass and other plants for sale, including in particular the manufacture of grass meal. As a farmer, I should like to urge consideration of the fact that a fundamental principle in farming, even if it is being carried out by a State company, is to put back into the land <Col N="979" /> a certain amount of organic matter, or as much organic matter as it is possible to use.  I should like to advise the Parliamentary Secretary that, in so far as it is possible, there should not be complete reliance upon one particular type of plant or crop.  I think that farmers have invariably found that a certain amount of variety is essential. Therefore if the Parliamentary Secretary has decided on the advice of experts or after experiment, to grow grass and utilise this land for the production of grass meal, he should also give attention to the production of other crops.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon suggested potatoes and I think there might be something in his suggestion, but I do not know the exact quality of the land in question. I am aware that sugar beet of various kinds can be grown on very peaty soils or actually on peat.  I have seen good beet grown for the Carlow factory on land which resembles peat. I am wondering whether it would be possible to utilise this land for the growing of potatoes and other crops and also for the growing of sugar beet or, if it is thought desirable, fodder beet for the feeding of pigs.</P>
      <P>I was interested in Deputy Dillon's suggestion in regard to the growing of potatoes, to be supplied to small-holders in the district for the feeding of pigs.  That might be a sound proposition or an equally sound proposition might be to carry on pig feeding on the property on the extensive scale which has been in operation in Mitchelstown creamery or cheese factory.  There you have an industry for the conversion of the by-product of cheese into pork or, if you like, pigs which are sold to the bacon factories. I think that is a proposition worth considering because if you require, as you must, a certain amount of organic manure, the best way to get it is actually to feed the pigs on the property and utilise the manure which is the by-product of the pig-feeding industry for fertilising the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that I did not hear the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory statement but I think that this project <Col N="980" /> is worthy of support.  Every aspect of the question should be considered.  One thing essential is that an effort should be made to make this project economic at the earliest possible date.  We cannot afford, even for the laudable purpose of assisting a distressed area, to spend or waste large sums of money. When an industry such as this is established, it should be our earnest effort to try to make it remunerative at the earliest possible date.  I feel that the growing of feeding stuffs and the utilisation of these feeding stuffs for some form of live-stock production &mdash;pig-feeding is the form of live-stock production I would suggest&mdash;is a sound proposition.</P>
    <P>It is clear that such an industry would give a certain amount of employment. I think it should prove profitable, provided always that it is established on a sound basis and after scientific investigation has convinced the Parliamentary Secretary that this particular soil will produce the plants which it is proposed to grow on it.  I am satisfied that the Parliamentary Secretary would not embark on a scheme such as this without very careful examination.  The House will watch this experiment with very great interest.  There are wide stretches of bogland and wasteland of various kinds in the country and any movement which is set on foot to utilise such land for productive purposes must command the sympathy and the support of everyone who has the interests of the country at heart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any suggestion or legislation from the Government that would tend to ease the problem that exists in Mayo, whether it be North or South Mayo, or in any of the Western counties such as the Parliamentary Secretary referred to in the course of his speech.  To be quite candid, while I am prepared to welcome legislation which would ease the problems of these areas, I do not believe that the production of grass meal in Bangor-Erris or elsewhere will contribute towards easing the unemployment situation, as we know it, in Bangor-Erris.  It has been there since the establishment of the State and before.  If I thought it would be <Col N="981" /> a success I would be prepared to give it every possible support but I do not think it will be the success that we are led to believe it will be.  I could hardly imagine that we will have on the bog in Bangor-Erris&mdash;I know it very well&mdash;a successful output of grass such as the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to believe.  If we do it will be a very costly success indeed.</P>
      <P>Coming from the County Mayo where a considerable amount of land is bog or reclaimed bog, I have a good idea of what can be produced from bogland. Bogland requires careful nourishment and if it does not get that nourishment it reverts to growing heather.  I have noticed that land on which considerable energy and labour was employed for 30 or 40 years became derelict and eventually heather and besoms grew on it when it was left unattended for ten or 12 years.</P>
      <P>If we are going to have this grass on the ordinary raw bog in Bangor-Erris it will require special care in the form of fertilisers.  Deputy Dillon said&mdash; and quite rightly&mdash;that it will need ordinary, natural manure, cow manure or horse manure or some form of stable manure.  It will also require a certain amount of soil to build it up for the process of turning it into turf mould. It will need an addition of ordinary soil taken from the mountains or from places where there is a surplus of soil. That will have to be added to the ordinary raw bog.  Where upwards of six or seven inches of soil is mixed with ordinary raw bogland we find that after a period of years, when it is left to rest and is not cared for carefully it reverts to growing heather and besoms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see how this is going to be a success.  I hope it will be.  If it is going to be a success it will be costly and who will pay for it?  I do not know.  I am told there will be a limited company with £165,000 capital.  Who will be the gentlemen in this company? We have not got the names.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary gave the names.  We do not know who they are but I have a feeling that Mr. Costello, the Chairman of the Sugar Company, is keenly interested in this. Has he induced the Parliamentary <Col N="982" /> Secretary more than anybody else to utilise this bog?  Is it his will that has been imposed on the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government arising out of the experiment by the Sugar Beet Company in the neighbourhood of Tuam?</P>
    <P>I hope it will be a success as far as employment and manual labour are concerned.  The number employed will be small having regard to the output of capital and expense which this project will cost.  I can speak with authority in regard to bogland and reclaimed bogland because the land I live on in my own holding at home is reclaimed bogland and is much more suitable for the growing of potatoes, carrots, parsnips and a variety of potatoes than for the growing of grass. One will notice that after using the best grass seeds there is a tendency for weeds to spring up unless the grass is carefully tended.  It goes back into heather if it is not carefully husbanded and looked after.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary who the gentlemen are who will be responsible for the formation of this limited company.  I would like to know who the chairman will be, how many workers in the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary will be employed and what amount of manual labour this company will employ.  I would also like to know how many grass crops he would expect to get out of it in a year.  I am also anxious to know if the Parliamentary Secretary will have a factory established there with a view to processing the grass into meal and the cost per cwt. of this meal.  Will there be a levy imposed upon any other animal foodstuffs with a view to making this grass meal cheaper for the farmer to purchase?  These are just a few things I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to answer in the course of the reply he may furnish to the House.  I hope he will give a clearer explanation than he gave in his opening remarks.</P>
    <P>I believe the acreage is roughly 2,000.  Bangor-Erris is a very big bog. The Parliamentary Secretary was down there recently.  He knows the difficulties and he knows how little <Col N="983" /> land the tenant farmer has in that particular area.  If we are going to rehabilitate 2,000 acres of raw bog, such as exists in Bangor-Erris, it would be much better to divide the bog into 50-acre holdings among 40 tenants roughly.  By doing this you will have 40 tenants established on 50-acre farms.  If you are going to have 2,000 acres rehabilitated and made productive it would be much better to have a semi-State farm so to speak on which you would have the workers employed. It would be much better to have the 2,000 acres divided up and allocated in 50-acre lots among 40 tenants.  The 40 tenants would give their little holdings better care and attention because bog land, like a baby, requires constant attention not merely for a day or a year but at all times otherwise the bog land will revert to heather and besoms.  That is my experience of reclaimed bog.  Even though you may carry out a wide scheme of drainage and take away a considerable tonnage of water, and even though the bog may fall and dry up, nevertheless, there is always that tendency.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of fertilisers will have to be applied at least every two years to keep body in the bog land with a view to growing grass.  If that is not done the body will disappear and the grass will die away.  It is well-known to country Deputies that you find rich grass growing for a time only on the wild bogs where cows graze and where their droppings and urine fall.  That is well-known to everybody who travels the country particularly the boggy regions.  But the rich grass fades away after a short time and falls back again into heather.  That proves that it needs the constant attention of natural manures and fertilisers. Constant digging and turning of the subsoil is essential in the reclamation of bogs.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary and the House to understand that I would be with him if I thought the Bill would be a success but I fear that it will be a costly success and that the produce of this undertaking will, so to speak, be outside the purchasing power of the consumer.  The consumer will be the farming community and <Col N="984" /> unless a levy or a subsidy is forthcoming from this State I fear that the produce of the undertaking will be outside their purchasing power.  I have a feeling also that the amount of employment which will be created will not justify the development.  I understood that this bog was to be used for the development of electricity and I thought that, as the bog was cut away, it would be reclaimed.  In my time, five or six acres of my own holding were reclaimed.  They started off by reclaiming the virgin bog.  I know from experience that you are seeking trouble, and considerable trouble&mdash;unless, of course, you have great wealth at your command and can afford to apply a great deal of fertiliser year in and year out.  By getting near the subsoil, and with a certain process of drainage combined with hard work, you might be able to get the land into production and with constant care you might then be able to keep it up.</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary's scheme will not be a success although I sincerely hope that it will.  I fear that if it should prove a success it will be a costly success.  I welcome any step that will relieve the situation in that particular area.  It is not my constituency but I know the district well.  Any scheme which will help to create employment and keep at home our young men who are accustomed to emigrate to Scotland and elsewhere would be a godsend.  I am afraid that this is just another hare-brained and costly scheme which eventually will go up in smoke and be forgotten about.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of sense in the speech which Deputy Dillon made.  The Parliamentary Secretary would be wise to consider his suggestions.  As a former Minister for Agriculture, I believe Deputy Dillon was interested in a similar project of this nature and secured the best possible advice on the matter.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should work in close collaboration with the Department of Agriculture and not with the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Department of Agriculture will inform him of the advisability of spending £165,000 and of taking a chance on a scheme of this kind for the success of which there is no guarantee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> I mentioned carrots, onions, parsnips, artichokes and also strawberries.  Our county is remarkable for the fact that the strawberries grown there are free from disease.  I know from experience that reclaimed bogland is very suitable for the growing of strawberries.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consider the development of strawberry-growing in that area because it would tend to create employment there.  I know a number of farmers in my part of the country who go in for the growing of strawberries.  Some of them have five and six acres under strawberries, some three and four acres and some as high as ten acres.  Not long ago the Minister for Agriculture received a deputation with regard to certain production and markets.  Their big complaint at the moment, as the Parliamentary Secretary knows, is that they do not receive the protection or the consideration they are entitled to receive as an industry.  I am afraid that this Bill will be like some other Bills that were passed by the Oireachtas.  I am afraid that, after it is passed, we shall hear very little about it.</P>

I shall be very pleased indeed to be able to go down to Bangor-Erris and to see the 2,000 acres of bog there brought back into production. I feel that if we are going to bring it back into production it should be done with one objective and that is that the small tenant farmers who live adjacent to the bog will, in time, be allocated 30 or 40 acres of it so that they will have a permanent means of making a livelihood there.  That would be better than a State farm or whatever else may be the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to this Bill.  These small farmers and their sons would put their labour and energy into the working of the holdings in adding soil and in endeavouring, in every way possible, to make the land richer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon mentioned pig production. One of the constant complaints <Col N="986" /> of farmers in the West of Ireland is in regard to the interference of the Pigs Marketing Board.  They claim to this day that the Pigs Marketing Board killed pig production there.</P>

Deputy Dillon suggested that if we produce grass or grass meal, carrots, onions or other vegetables we must also find a market for that produce.  If the production of pig feeding is going to be controlled by the Pigs Marketing Board, that certainly will ensure its downfall.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that I welcome the Bill.  I welcome anything that is calculated to help the unemployed in the County Mayo because at present the conditions there are even worse than they are in the City of Dublin.  There are more unemployed in the County Mayo at this moment than there have been for a number of years.  Things are in a bad state, and if this tends towards easing that position then we are all out for the success of it.  I have grave doubts however, of its success and of the outcome of it.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy Cafferky has so many doubts as to the success of this scheme.  I had thought that he, at least, representing Clann na Talmhan, and claiming to represent the small farmers of County Mayo, would have given every encouragement to the scheme.  Instead, he has drawn red herrings into the discussion on the scheme.  This is a great scheme.  It is one that gives great hope, new hope, to the people of Bangor and in Erris generally.  The people in that area have been migratory labourers since I was a child. The men, women and children go off in their hundreds every year to seek work in foreign fields.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that the people of Bangor and in Erris generally will do all they can to co-operate in making this scheme a success.  It is a chance that has never come their way before, a chance to turn cold and barren land into a prosperous countryside, <Col N="987" /> a chance that will give new hope to the people instead of having the prospect before them of having to go away every year.</P>
      <P>During the last few days, and indeed over the years, we have listened to lamentations about unemployment, but to-day we see some new hope for Mayo, some hope that we may end this problem so far as our migratory labourers are concerned.  I know that the scheme will be a success.  It deserves to be.  It is a bold scheme. The only regret I have is that a Deputy from the County Mayo should stand up in this House and draw a red herring across the trail which is calculated to keep the scheme from being a success.  It is a great pleasure to me, on the occasion of my first speech in this House, to rise to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on this scheme, and to express the hope that it will be a success.</P>

I think that many of us could take example from the way in which he marshalled his facts and arguments, and on the forcible way in which he put his case.  His speech was certainly in contrast to the speech that was delivered by the speaker previous to him, a Deputy from the County Mayo.  I had hoped that when Deputy Cafferky started to speak that he would have welcomed this or any scheme that would provide employment for people along the Western seaboard.  Any scheme that was put forward with the full authority of the Government on the advice which they have got, and which will give employment and bring into production an area that is barren, should, in my view, have the support of Deputy Cafferky. But, unfortunately, Deputy Cafferky, I think, was misled by the criticism of the scheme that we had from Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacBride wants to grow strawberries on the bogs and he wants forests on the bogs.  The peculiar thing is that when any scheme is put forward somebody wants to do something different, and suggests that something else should be done.  Deputy Cafferky hopes that the scheme will be a success.  He will be glad to go down to Mayo when it is a success, but he has the gravest doubts that it will be a success, and if it is a success it will be a costly success.  If the Government were to accept the advice of Deputy Cafferky they would abandon the scheme right away because there can be no other interpretation of Deputy Cafferky's speech than that this is a bad scheme&mdash;it is costly, inefficient ill-thought out and should not be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not know what he was talking about.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us when he started out that he approached this scheme from the angle, first of all, that he did not think there was any possibility in it and was convinced as he went on.  I approached it in exactly the reverse way.  I thought, when I heard the scheme first of all, that it had great possibilities but the more I went into it the more I came to the reverse of the Parliamentary Secretary's conclusions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say quite clearly that, so far as the Bill is concerned, it provides <Col N="991" /> that the objects of the company will be two-fold, that the first object shall be the acquisition, drainage and cultivation of bogland.  The second object is to utilise that bogland, when cultivated, for the purpose of grass meal. So far as that is concerned, the Parliamentary Secretary gave us the minimum of information.  I do not believe that any Department, even the Department of Industry and Commerce approaching what is an agricultural matter, dealt with the matter in the dark in the way the Parliamentary Secretary left this House.  I believe that he must have some figures, that he must have got some estimates and that he must have some knowledge in regard to the processes that are intended and the probable effects.</P>
    <P>I want to put this to the Parliamentary Secretary in the most categorical manner so that he can contradict me if he has estimates that are to the contrary and can show the figures. This scheme, according to the Parliamentary Secretary's statements, is to provide 4,000 tons of grass meal per annum.  By and large, you may take it that to provide 4,000 tons of dried grass you want five times that tonnage of wet grass and that in regard to the drying of 20,000 tons of wet grass the amount that will be spent in wages on the drying process, that is to say, on the second part of the scheme, will not exceed £1 per ton per annum and that the labour content in regard to this scheme will be a maximum of £4,000 a year on the grass-drying part of it. It does not require very much calculation to see that that will not be a very great contribution to the success that, with Deputy Calleary, we all hope there will be in regard to providing employment in the congested districts.</P>
    <P>The complaint that was made by Deputy Dillon was that the production of grass meal is the least employment-producing method of utilising the bogland when it has been acquired, drained and cultivated.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary has any different figures, I will be delighted to hear them but I have a little experience in regard to grass drying, not in bog.  There is, as the Parliamentary <Col N="992" /> Secretary told us, bog reclamation work done at Gowla, on the Galway-Roscommon border, by the Sugar Company.  That dealt with the acquisition, drainage and cultivation of bogland but, of course, it has not dealt with the grass meal end of it.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that in producing 4,000 tons of grass meal the employment content for labour would be high at £4,000 a year, that the fuel content will be a very, very big cost and that there will be for fuel cost, for drying, somewhere about two and a half times the ordinary labour content.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhelimAlfredCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The fuel is alongside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a minute.  I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that this was being taken off a part of the bog that would be utilised for electricity production and that, therefore, there is no use counting in this scheme the labour content in the production of fuel as applicable purely to the grass drying because similar production would be available there for the electricity generation and that if you take it from one you merely add it to the other.  There will be a substantial user of electricity, I agree, but that will not provide additional labour content.  So far as the purely drying costs are concerned, probably somewhere about three to one or four to one against labour content will be the proportion in costings.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the costings from the other end&mdash;the capital cost.  The Parliamentary Secretary as far as I could follow him, suggests a capital cost of £165,000.  I would like to know how, approximately&mdash;I am not trying to tie the Parliamentary Secretary to anything like accurate estimates&mdash;that figure is proposed to be divided between what I might term bog costings, bog capital expenditure and factory expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all you will have purchase cost.  The bog is already bought.  It was bought, as well as I remember, about two years ago by Bord na Móna because I remember being down there about this time in 1951 and seeing acquisition notices with people who came to see me at the time.  The purchase <Col N="993" /> has to be paid for, whether it is paid for by the grass meal company or by Bord na Móna or the E.S.B.  On what figure is the Parliamentary Secretary estimating his cost for purchase and drainage?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary proposing that the 2,000 acres would be a block or would it be dealt with in separate units?  The reason I ask that is because when you are dealing with a block the fencing costs would be lower than when you are dealing with separate units.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary proposing that there would be no live stock grazed on the sward produced and that it is merely necessary to keep off strays from outside.  One of the points that Deputy Dillon made was that in the Bangor-Erris climate it would not be possible to graze the sward at all.  I do not know enough about that area to be able to give any indication of that, but it might be possible by way of electric fencing.</P>
    <P>I want to know what is the cost involved.  I want to know what estimate has been made of the prime cost in relation to liming and in regard to fertilisers.  We all know that, in order to cultivate bogland, it must be limed and manured heavily to start with.  I imagine that some estimate of costing has been made there.  One estimate given to me was that it would cost in or around £30 an acre.  I do not know whether that is justified or not.  I am not capable of making an assessment, but I say it is the job of the Parliamentary Secretary when he brings in a Bill like this to give us these figures.</P>
    <P>There is also the question that it has to be sown down for the first time. What will be the cost of that?  What will it cost to put 2,000 acres under grass to start with?  Of that cost which is going into the putting down of 2,000 acres under grass, how much will be money expendable in local labour, either directly or indirectly? I am sure that, apart from that first costing, there will be in the figure of £165,000 a substantial sum for the purchase of suitable machinery for the job.  I have not any idea of what the cost will be in that regard.  I am not <Col N="994" /> so interested in that, because I started off by being interested in grass meal from the employment angle. The position, as I see it, is that, of all the things that could make bog land, when reclaimed, pay, grass meal will give the least employment of the lot.  If the Parliamentary Secretary's figures are opposed to that, then let us have them, and we will be in a position to put them side by side with the figures that we have with regard to grass meal plants in Leinster, the only ones I have any contact with.</P>
    <P>Apart from the capital cost for purchase, drainage, fencing, fertilisers and lime and for the setting up in the first instance, there will be a substantial cost for the erection of what I might term the factory plant. How much of the £165,000 will go into the erection of the plant?  What type of plant is visualised?  Is it to be the tray type or the fan type of drier or the new type which has only become available experimentally within the last six months, and which has the effect, according to what is claimed for it, of fixing the carrotene content in the grass meal in a way it is not possible to fix it with the older types of drier?  Where can that plant be got?  Can it be got in a sterling country or have we to pay dollars or other hard currency for it?  What will be the cost of that plant that has to be bought outside the country compared with what has to be spent in Bangor-Erris on labour?  These figures should be capable of being given to us, and I think that we should get them.</P>
    <P>So far as annual costs are concerned, will the Parliamentary Secretary break down the figure of £22 7s. per ton which he gave us into the bog proportion of that and the factory proportion of it?  I suppose a more accurate description would be as to the production cost on the one hand and the factory cost on the other.  With these figures which the Parliamentary Secretary should have brought in we can have some appreciation of whether the information available to some of us is correct or not.  I am not being dogmatic with regard to the figures <Col N="995" /> given to me by people who operate grass meal drying plants in Leinster, but I must accept their word for the figures they give me until such time as more authentic figures are put up.  The figures given to me show that this scheme will be an extremely good scheme in respect of the first half of its operation in regard to the drainage and cultivation of bogland, but that when it goes into the utilisation of the bogland for grass meal you are going into the worst type of thing for the congested districts because you are going into a type of utilisation of your produce in which much more machinery is used than in other methods of utilisation of that produce.  Grass meal is one of the most mechanised forms of production and the more mechanised form of production you have the less will be your employment content.</P>
    <P>We are agreed that what we want in the West are things which have in their economic fabric and build-up a form of production that utilises a high labour content rather than a low labour content.  I suggest that in this respect the Parliamentary Secretary has got in this something which is of very low labour content once he has done the first part of the job set out in the Bill, and then he is going into a production which is going to utilise substantial costings in machine processes and very little in labour costings to balance it.</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the objection of Deputy Dillon and it is the kernel of my criticism.  It is a criticism which can be very easily disposed of if the Parliamentary Secretary puts all the facts and figures before the House.  It is a criticism which can be easily met if the figures are not as I have stated.  But, with those figures, we are entitled to more than the Parliamentary Secretary has given us.  He has just come in here and the sole statistical information he has given us is that there are 2,000 acres to be developed to give us 4,000 tons of grass meal, the cost of which will be £22 7s. per ton.  At present it can be sold for between £31 and £34 per ton.  For that he wants £165,000. I suggest that when he reflects on the matter he will agree that is hardly the right way to treat the House.  The <Col N="996" /> House is entitled to at least some of the estimates on foot of which this scheme is being prepared so that people will have an opportunity of judging whether or not this is a wise way to utilise this money or whether, having acquired, drained and cultivated the bog, it may not be better for the people in Bangor-Erris to utilise some other method of dealing with the subsequent production in a way which would provide a substantially greater labour content than I believe this scheme will give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I must express my appreciation of the objective manner in which most of those who spoke approached this subject. In introducing this measure I made no attempt to pander to any feelings one might have towards the development of the West of Ireland in any particular respect.  We all know there is a problem there and that any means we employ to solve the problem in the West must naturally be welcome to the members of this House and to the community in general.  It has been stated in the course of the debate that some enterprise and some vision is necessary if the peculiar difficulties of the West are to be overcome.  In presenting this Bill I hope that we have with some vision at any rate adopted one of the means whereby we can achieve that end.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that the emphasis on this scheme is not on grass production.  It is on the utilisation of boglands for the production of food and for the provision of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We had to have some title on the Bill.  I am convinced from my examination of the proposal that bog can be successfully reclaimed in such a manner as to produce wealth far in excess of what it is doing at the present time.  I prefer to regard the choice of grass only as an initial crop from reclaimed bogland.  As far as I understand the rotation of crops the production of grass for some years is necessary to the subsequent growing or production of root and other crops where reclaimed bogland is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that is a very revolutionary view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that in order to utilise reclaimed bog the growing of grass initially is very desirable, if not essential, in order to tune up or prepare the soil for the ultimate production of other crops.</P>
      <P>The utilisation of bogland is the main object of this Bill.  The suggestion by Deputy Dillon of the growing of potatoes or other crops naturally occurred to me and, as Deputy Sweetman pointed out, there is provision in the Bill for the growing of other plants. I understand, for instance, that it is on bogland mainly that peppermint and spearmint are grown.  As a result of repeated growings in America the plants have become susceptible to different types of disease and there is a marked shortage of spearmint and peppermint at the moment for the distillation of the necessary oils for medicinal and commercial purposes in the United States of America.</P>
      <P>I have been told on good authority that there are many plants growing wild on our boglands which are very useful for commercial purposes.  Some two years ago I referred to the possibility of using wild plants, processing them and selling them commercially at a good profit to those who harvest them, and particularly to those who live in the bogland areas of the West.</P>
      <P>With regard to the utilisation of bogland after it has been drained and brought into heart, surely the simplest process is the growing of grass.  The areas which have been drained by the sugar company in Gowla bog are growing quite good grass at the present time.  I have seen in the film to which I referred earlier fairly heavy heifers grazing in the month of October on land drained earlier in the year and sown down to grass in the month of March.  I am informed that sheep feeding on such grass increase their live weight by 2½ lb. per week, and I believe that is a pretty good standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the utilisation of seaweed and the possibility of processing it under the terms of this Bill.  I referred to seaweed in order <Col N="998" /> to illustrate what might be done under the licensing provision of the Bill.  I admit that Deputy Dillon is a much better authority on the matter than I am.  He said that the best utilisation of seaweed would be the spreading of it in its wet state as fertiliser as near as possible to the place from which it is won.  There are, on the other hand, strong views held by people with chemical qualifications that there are other means of profitably using seaweed as a fertiliser or as feeding stuff. That is a matter upon which I have no technical knowledge at the present time.  I mentioned seaweed merely to illustrate what might be envisaged under the licensing provision of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride, in particular, and subsequently Deputy Sweetman referred to the employment content of the scheme envisaged under the Bill.  I would like again to say that the Bill is not primarily designed as an employment-creating vehicle.  It is primarily an experiment to demonstrate whether the utilisation of reclaimed bog is economically feasible. He expressed some fears as to whether Section 11 might tend to create a monopoly for this company in the manufacture of any particular commodity. There is no intention whatever of granting such a monopoly to the new company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely an enabling section and not an excluding section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is probably self-explanatory. If some commodity that might be grown, manufactured or processed is not being produced at all or not being produced sufficiently by private enterprise, this company under this section might consider applying to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for a licence to embark upon such processing or manufacturing.  In all the circumstances, I think it is a desirable section to have in a Bill such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you leave Section 11, would the Parliamentary Secretary consider between this and the next day whether he would not <Col N="999" /> insert some sort of tabled addendum to that section so as to be sure that the House would know all the things the company was going to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The employment content is candidly rather doubtful at the moment.  In the initial stages it is envisaged that between 40 and 80 men will be employed.  The company which it is proposed to set up will have perforce certain latitudes with regard to the manner in which they propose to drain and put this bog into production.  The method used in Gowla is, I think, the best system.  It is to drain the bog in strips by cutting drains, subsequently using mole drains flowing into the cut drains and saving the turf within the cut drains and utilising it, first of all, by drying it on every alternate strip going through the bog.  The strips of land are designed to be long enough to enable modern machinery to traverse them.  It has been achieved in Gowla, and I believe it is possible to achieve it here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cafferky was concerned whether this land, if it can be reclaimed, will not require a considerable degree of attention, otherwise he considers it will revert back.  I think that is fairly well true of almost all land which is not in itself good land. Most of the land that Deputy Dillon attempted to reclaim under his land rehabilitation scheme was, I am sure, not very many years ago, reasonably good land that was allowed through disuse to revert back to the stage when production of crops off it was impossible or very difficult without some extra special measures being applied to make it productive.  The same applies to this, and constant fertilising will be necessary in order to ensure that the cultivated bogland will continue to be productive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Cafferky that this grass meal production would have an effect on the prices of all feeding stuffs, if used as a constituent of compound feeding stuffs. I do not think that fear is apparent at all.  The disposal of the meal, when manufactured, will be a matter for the company, and naturally they will have <Col N="1000" /> to find the best market they can, but I am asured there is a sufficient market and I believe that there will be no difficulty in disposing of the output when that stage of development has been reached.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman, I think, was fairly accurate in assessing the cost of drying the estimated output of grass. However, we must realise the drying end of it is really very secondary.  As regards the employment content of the whole scheme, the actual number engaged on drying will be very small, that is, in relation to the number of men who, first of all, will attempt the drainage and cultivation of the bog, the fertilising of the bog and the cutting of the grass.  It is all part of the process and the fact that a limited number of men will be engaged actually in the drying will in no way reflect the total number engaged in the whole process.</P>

      <P>About a year and a half ago, the Parliamentary Secretary was there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  It was in the summer you were there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It possibly was but the fact that it was summer or winter does not take away from the vastness of that particular bog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And the breezes that blow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The breezes in the summer would be very different.  Ask Deputy Calleary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman asked me a question in relation to the capital formation of the company.  I think that it is more appropriate to the next stage of the Bill and I prefer to deal with it then but the estimates given for the different aspects of the undertaking&mdash;acquisition, drainage, drying and ultimately the cost of production per ton&mdash;have been based on the least favourable figures, with the result that the estimated figure of £22 7s. per ton cost of production is erring, if anything, on the high side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House because it shows an earnest on our part of our desire to grapple with the problem of the West of Ireland, with the under-employment problem, with the problem of creating work and maintaining the people on the land.  No doubt, as Deputy Dillon said, we have 12,000,000 acres of good grass land, but nevertheless no matter how much there is, we have far too little to maintain <Col N="1002" /> sufficient of our population on the land.  That applies particularly to the West of Ireland.  If we can illustrate and establish that the big tracts of bogland and the smaller tracts of bogland in the West of Ireland can be cultivated, I think it is a step in the right direction to maintain employment and to maintain the people on the land and particularly go some of the way to make up the shortage of arable land in the West of Ireland.  Deputy Dillon suggested that it was a daft scheme. Let him throw his mind back some four years, when he referred to tomato glasshouses as an exotic scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary know that it costs £457 to instal heating in one glasshouse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hear that, but will not dispute the point now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure him the Minister for Agriculture told us that to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not in the House at the time; but without any heating there can be earned by the individual owner of a glasshouse in Connemara upwards of £120 per annum in the sale of tomatoes.  That was daft and exotic. This may be daft, but I am convinced, firstly from what I have read and seen, that bogland can be brought into useful cultivation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>No one is arguing about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, secondly, that this grass meal project, as part of the bringing into cultivation of the bogs, can and will be profitable and that ultimately, with the powers created for the new company in this Bill, the growing, processing and sale of different plants will be a practical proposition and will be a step in the right direction towards utilising to the full our natural resources.  By assisting the people who live in these areas in such a manner, we will be doing practical work in making employment available for them and so maintaining our population on the land and particularly in that part of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that for the last 40 years the Department of Agriculture has carried out experimental work for the exploitation of bogland under crops?  Does he think it is unreasonable if we ask that he should let us know broadly what the advice of the Department of Agriculture is?  That Department has been engaged in this work in Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry for the last 40 years.  Could he not give their opinion purely on the technical side of the proposal he now submits to the House?  Surely, if we have a Department of Agriculture which has that kind of experience in this work, Dáil Éireann ought to know broadly what it thinks of the technical merits of the proposal now before us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we not going to get an answer?  I wanted to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question also, but I did not wish to do so until we heard his reply to Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I told Deputy Dillon that, when this Bill was in course of preparation and before it was envisaged as a Bill, I did inquire as to what advice the Department of Agriculture had to offer.  I also sought the advice of the Turf Board, who were well used to draining bogs, and of the <Col N="1004" /> sugar company, who were well used to attempting to cultivate bogs.  The Department of Agriculture told me candidly that if it were grass meal I was concerned with I would get a better return from good land.  But on every consideration and having regard to the particular work with which I am charged, I decided that it would be worth while, from the point of view of the West of Ireland, to undertake drainage, cultivation and growing of grass and other plants on these bogs. This Bill, and the company proposed to be set up under it, was the best means by which I could have that done.</P>
