      <P>I agree that the principle behind this section is good, but I think it needs a little clarification. It appears to me that this section replaces, or amends, sub-section (1) of Section 38 in the Principal Act.  That sub-section says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a chief medical officer is of opinion, either consequent on his own inspection of a person in the area for which such medical officer acts, or consequent upon information furnished to him by a registered medical practitioner who has inspected such person, that such person is a probable source of infection with an infectious disease and that his isolation is necessary as a safeguard against the spread of infection, and that such person cannot be effectively isolated in his home, such medical officer may order in writing the detention and isolation of such person in a specified hospital or other place until such medical officer gives a certificate (for which no charge shall be made) that <Col N="2008" /> such person is no longer a probable source of infection.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It appears from the new section we are discussing that an order made under it, in addition to being signed by the chief medical officer, must also be signed by another registered medical practitioner.  As I have said, we accept that principle as being sound, but it would seem to put certain difficulties in the way which I should like the Minister to clarify.  As far as I can see, this section deals with all types of infectious and contagious diseases.  I can envisage a situation arising in which a case, that was discovered to be highly infectious, might come into this country by sea or by air which it was necessary immediately to isolate for the protection of the public.</P>
    <P>Under the Principal Act, it was possible for the chief medical officer to have that case isolated forthwith, but, under this new section, in addition to signing the order himself, it must also be signed by another registered medical practitioner.  I can envisage this difficulty arising, that if it were discovered that the person suffering from the disease had come into the country by sea or air there would not be any registered medical practitioner in attendance on the case.  Deputy McGilligan raised that point last night as to whether it was considered necessary that another medical officer of health or State official would have to sign the order.  As I say, if it were a case that had to be isolated immediately, the case of a person who had come in by sea or by air, there would not be any general medical practitioner in attendance.  That is a difficulty I should like the Minister to clear up.  I am somewhat confused as to what is the actual intention behind this new section.  We are not against the section, but are simply seeking information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the original Act, this clause was introduced to deal with what you might call an emergency and not an ordinary outbreak of infection.  What we had in mind was smallpox or even a very bad outbreak of typhus.  We had such outbreaks at the time; of course they <Col N="2009" /> have practically disappeared with modern treatment.  It is only in a case of that kind where the chief medical officer would have great difficulty in clearing up the situation that he would have to take rather drastic measures and he would have to have power to detain certain people until the whole outbreak had been cleared up.  At the moment I cannot think of any emergency that would be likely to arise, except in regard to smallpox, where this section would be necessary.</P>
      <P>The objection that was raised to this section at the time and since then on many occasions was that one man could come to the conclusion that it was necessary to detain a certain person and that, first of all, he might be wrong in his judgment or in his diagnosis, or secondly, he might be too drastic or too impatient with certain individuals.  It was thought that it might be well to have at least a second doctor to agree with the chief medical officer.  In most cases there will be a second man because in most cases the first person to deal with the case, the field workers, as it were, will probably recommend this and the chief medical officer will sanction it.  However, if the chief medical officer is on the spot himself he might order a man to be detained. It was because of such a case that this amendment was put in so that he could not order a person to be detained unless a second medical man agreed with him.</P>
      <P>As I understand what Deputy Dr. Esmonde has said, he is afraid that it might be difficult for the chief medical officer to carry on.  I cannot imagine any situation of this kind where the chief medical officer would not have a number of doctors with him clearing up the situation.  I do not think it could ever arise where there would be any great difficulty in having a second man available so that, if he thought fit, he could sign the certificate with the chief medical officer.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reply very much and the clarification he has given as far as it has gone.  The Minister said it would not be difficult to get a second doctor.  I agree it would be very easy.  Does it <Col N="2010" /> mean that the chief medical officer is empowered to employ a second doctor? I envisage a case in which a person arrives in this country in a ship or an airplane not having had contact with any private doctor.  The Minister mentioned that in the case of smallpox and, perhaps, as Deputy McGilligan mentioned last night, bubonic plague, the question might arise of having that person isolated.  In that event, is the chief medical officer empowered to employ some private doctor to examine the patient with him such as might happen in the case of certifying a lunatic where a second doctor is employed. Is the chief medical officer empowered to employ another doctor and guarantee a fee to him?  It would facilitate the position if that was the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If necessary he could employ a second man and he would be paid by the local authority.  I do not think that position will arise.  If the situation arose in a county district the district dispensary doctor would be the first man to deal with the case and the chief medical officer would fortify his decision if he thought fit.  If it occurred at the airport presumably the doctor at the airport would be the first to deal with it.  If the chief medical officer is there first on his own he can send for a doctor and say: &ldquo;Your fee will be all right.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask a further question on the section?  We go back to the Principal Act of 1947, Section 38. This is a very long section and it deals with many matters.  However, the position does arise that in the event of a case becoming dangerous the person is detained and is put under the jurisdiction of what is known as the commitment officer.  The Minister will find that in the Principal Act.  It says that the commitment officer will be the medical officer who made the Order. Then it goes on to deal with a vast number of sub-sections which I do not propose to read here.  It specifies the conditions under which the person may apply for release, and so forth, and it gives certain authority to the commitment officer.  As I said, the commitment officer is the chief medical officer whose opinion is reinforced by that of <Col N="2011" /> any registered medical practitioner. Does the case then arise that the commitment officer is in sole charge? Has the other practitioner who signed the detention certificate in this case jurisdiction as well?  In any appeals for a release does he come into the consultations that may subsequently take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The commitment officer would be in sole charge from the time the person is committed to isolation. As the Deputy knows, the Minister may immediately say that it is not necessary to detain this man or he may say it is necessary.  If it is agreed that he must be kept, he is detained until the case is reviewed again and the Minister gives his decision.  If the Minister gives no reply, the person is automatically free to leave after 21 days.  If the Minister says: &ldquo;I do not agree&rdquo; then it would not be necessary for the man in charge to consult again the doctor who agreed to put the person in.  He could on his own responsibility look after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position in the case I have cited?  The actual detention is an emergency measure. The Minister is giving the safeguard of introducing another practitioner, which I appreciate, but it is subsequently, when the person is detained and his relatives and friends appear on the scene, that the difficulty will arise.  He may consider it is unnecessary to detain the person any longer.  That is an occasion on which a difference of opinion is more likely to arise as to whether it is necessary to continue the period of detention or not.  Therefore, surely the registered medical practitioner who has been consulted by the authorities and has signed the order for detention ought to be in a position to have a say in the matter.  I admit that the Minister must have the final say for the protection of the community because it would be a very serious matter if anybody were allowed to go at large who would be a danger to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will see the point is a reasonable one.  The Minister is providing safeguards in the <Col N="2012" /> first instance by allowing a private practitioner or any other practitioner to have a say in the detention of the person.  I maintain that the real dispute will arise subsequently.  Nobody likes to be detained when it is unnecessary. The medical officer of health, as the commitment officer, may say: &ldquo;I consider it necessary to detain Mr. X for a longer period.&rdquo; Soon the friends and relations of Mr. X may come on the scene, or by that time he may have contacted his own medical adviser who considers that it is not necessary to detain him any longer.  The Minister says that if the Minister agrees it is not necessary, the person may be released, but in the event of the Minister agreeing that it is necessary to detain him and if the medical officer of health maintains it is necessary, surely the practitioner should at this stage come into the matter again, be consulted and allowed to give his opinion for what it is worth. That can then be reviewed.  I admit that in a case like this the Minister must have the final say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This power is not likely to be used except in case of great emergency.  I do not think it will be abused because everybody knows that if there was an attempt to abuse it there would be a very serious row over it.  It works, I think, somewhat on the lines of mental hospital procedure. Two people put a person in but the R.M.S. may come to the conclusion that the person should be let out again.  There is an appeal to the Minister.  There is in the mental hospital case also.  The Minister sends down his medical inspector and gets a report.  If the medical inspector says: &ldquo;I quite agree that the man should be kept&rdquo; the Minister says: &ldquo;All right.  He should be kept&rdquo;.  If the medical officer says to the Minister: &ldquo;I think it is not necessary&rdquo; the Minister is likely to say: &ldquo;I am not agreeing to the detention of this man&rdquo; and he is let out.  Let us say that it was a dispensary doctor who first suggested to the chief medical officer of health that the person should be put in.  I do not see how he could be brought into it again.  It would only lead to confusion.  He might say: &ldquo;I <Col N="2013" /> think he should be let out&rdquo;, and the chief medical officer would say: &ldquo;No, he should not&rdquo;, and there would be that sort of disagreement between them.  It is better to leave it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will agree that the case he cited of the conditions that obtain in a mental hospital would hardly be parallel with these instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is exactly parallel but it is something the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think here the freedom of the subject arises.  That is why I want to make the point.  I cannot see that there would be any particular objection, if it was decided in consultation that the man should be detained to have a further consultation subsequently. It is often very difficult to make a decision like that.  As the Minister has stated, if a person were detained unnecessarily, naturally, there would be a row about it.  I have in mind the protection of the State officials concerned.  The State officials are bound to be charged with overState interference and we should have all possible safeguards against State control in any shape or form.  For the protection of the Minister and officials, it would be quite easy to have the medical practitioner through whom the case could be subsequently appealed. It would not be a question of his being there on the spot all the time.  It would be just a question of the person detained or his representative or guardian in the case of a minor, saying: &ldquo;I consider that Mr. X. is now sufficiently detained and should be released.&rdquo; It would be in the intesests of the State personnel to call the doctor subsequently into consultation.  It is assumed that when two doctors get around a table to discuss the case they are reasonable individuals and would see each other's point of view.  It is really a question of principle that is involved here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You must remember that when the person is put into the hospital the R.M.S., that is the man in charge of the fever hospital, would be the person looking after these people. The R.M.S. of the fever hospital would <Col N="2014" /> be in charge.  So, you have two men there in consultation&mdash;the R.M.S. and the chief medical officer of the county &mdash; and the two, in a case like that, would be consulting every day practically because we are dealing with an emergency.  If the R.M.S. were to say to the chief medical officer, &ldquo;I think there is no danger in letting this man out,&rdquo; the chief medical officer would give his opinion on the case also.  I am not sure, but I think the R.M.S. could let him out without consulting the chief medical officer if he thought there was no danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the ordinary procedure and practice, though.  If, however, this man thought he had a grievance, again, as the law stands, I think he would have a perfect right to ask his own medical attendant to come and see him and give his opinion.  I do not think anybody could object to that.  If the private practitioner first suggested that the man might be a probable source of infection and the man was brought in and detained, that private practitioner or dispensary doctor, as the case may be, would have a right to come and see him and would have a right, naturally, to suggest to the R.M.S. that he thought there was no further danger as far as this man was concerned&mdash;he would be speaking for his own district, and so on&mdash;and in fact, you would have that form of consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister says but we must remember that we are legislating for the future. It is quite true, as the Minister says, that the private practitioner could go and see the case, if necessary, in consultation with the R.M.S., but the commitment officer would be the chief medical officer of health and he would still be the controlling factor and he would have the official &ldquo;say&rdquo; in the matter.  He is the State official concerned and this may be a state of emergency.  We are legislating for the future.  That is why I want to get it clear.  If any evidence was subsequently transmitted to the Minister for his jurisdiction in the matter the <Col N="2015" /> evidence of the private practitioner need not necessarily go forward.  He can go in and register his protest and say: &ldquo;I consider that my patient is being detained unnecessarily in this institution&rdquo; but it is not necessary for the chief medical officer or the resident medical officer&mdash;I do not say he would not do it&mdash;to submit that evidence to the Minister and, for all the Minister knows, he just gets the information that X is detained in such and such a hospital because the State doctor concerned considers it necessary to do so.</P>
      <P>It is not necessary for him to put forward to the Minister any evidence or advice he may have received from the private practitioner.  If the private practitioner is given joint responsibility in the matter, both sides of the case will be put before the Minister. There is a perfect safeguard for the Minister, which he should have, if this is a case of emergency because he is the overriding factor in the case.  He would see both sides, instead of one. I am not saying that he might not be given both sides but, without embodying in the Bill the right of the practitioner associating with the medical officer, he would not have any official status or it would not be certain that his case would be put before the Minister.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 34.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 53:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Section 44 of the Principal Act shall be construed as authorising the making of a payment for domestic help where a married woman is undergoing treatment for an infectious disease to the satisfaction of the chief medical officer of the health authority in whose functional area she ordinarily resides and her husband is unable to make reasonable and proper provision for the care of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is really a drafting amendment.  The meaning is not very much changed but it is bringing it into <Col N="2016" /> line with the ordinary wording of the Act.  The making of payment for domestic help is in line with other provisions of the Act rather than the payment of a domestic help allowance and it is also in line with the 1947 Act. Treatment is to be to the satisfaction of the chief medical officer of the health authority.  That is also in accordance with Section 44 of the 1947 Act.  The effect is the same except that it is bringing it into line with the wording of the Act.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 54:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Sections 26 and 31 of this Act shall apply in relation to the service made available under Section 44 of the Principal Act in like manner as they apply in relation to the services made available under Part III of this Act.</P>
      <P>This amendment will substitute the provisions of Sections 26 to 31 of the Bill.  We discussed these sections last night, relating to notification of change of circumstances of eligible persons and penalties for making false statements to get the benefits.  This amendment relates these provisions to the provisions of sub-section (8) of Section 44 of the 1947 Act.  Sub-section (8) of that section is similar to Section 31 of this Bill, and it is considered desirable that the same provision should apply to the maintenance allowance services as to the new services to be provided.  It is really, if you like, bringing the penalties under this Bill into line with those under the 1947 Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask a question on sub-section (2) of Section 34, which deals with the question of domestic help in cases of infectious diseases.  I want to know is it possible that if a daughter or a relation of the person detained suffering from infectious disease leaves her post in order to go in to look after a family she will be able to receive the allowance which would be paid to domestic help under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the position is that a domestic help allowance is only payable where a person is employed for the purpose and that the daughter of the family would not come under that heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to consider this from a practical point of view, which has occurred on many occasions from my own experience.  I wonder would he reconsider it from the practical aspect that where a daughter leaves a job where she may be supporting or helping to support a family, a good job sometimes, to come home to look after the family, I would imagine that that would be in accordance with the best advice in relation to these things and that she should be facilitated in doing that because it is a rather difficult choice for her to make.  In many cases she has to give up a good job earning a fair amount of money which is a help to the family.  I know it will be a very difficult thing and that it is capable of abuse as it might be used as a sort of supplementary allowance for the infectious disease, but I know cases where it occurs, where a girl comes back from England or from a very good job and the family suffers the loss of that income and she carries out what I understand would be her natural duties in caring for the family in a time of stress.  It would be a much more natural and desirable thing if it were possible that a member of the family should take this position in a family rather than bringing in a complete stranger.  From every point of view it would be much more desirable <Col N="2018" /> if a member of a family could be encouraged to give up her job and come home to look after the others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure how the law stands in reply to the Deputy as to whether it could be done or not, but I know that it is not done in practice. It does, at first sight, appear rather anomalous to me.  I have certainly sanctioned in the past an allowance in more than one case to a sister-in-law, that is the sister of the woman who has gone to hospital and an aunt of the children coming in to look after them.  It has been sanctioned that she should get the allowance.  It may be hard to understand why that should be permitted and a daughter of the house would not rank for an allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure but I do not think that I am wrong.  I do not think there is anything in the law to prevent it, although it is not done in practice.  I would like to look into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that under the law there is power to give the allowance to a daughter who has come home where the mother is ill, suffering from infectious disease.  I know an example myself where an allowance was sanctioned when the daughter, a nurse, came home, but due to the means of the family, they were debarred from getting the daughter the domestic allowance which she would normally have got if the means of the family were lower.  I investigated the matter and found that there was nothing whatever in the law to prevent the local authority from giving the domestic allowance to the daughter provided the means test did not debar her in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy Dr. Browne that it is very desirable that the daughter should be in a position to receive this allowance if she is not already in that position because, in my experience, when it is a question of getting anybody to mind the family of a sick person it is desirable that a member of the family <Col N="2019" /> should be there when it is a question of a sick mother or parent.  In practically all cases it is the daughter who is sent for, and the daughter would naturally be the most desirable person to have in the house.  I suggest to the Minister that if legislation to that effect does not exist surely he might embody it.  It seems to me to be a very desirable suggestion to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that Deputy McQuillan may be right, because if the county manager interprets the Act in that way and has made the allowance it might not come to the Department of Health at all and we might not have heard of it.  I do not think that there is anything in the law to prevent it being done, but on the other hand I think the practice of the Department of Health has been not to allow that so far, so I must have the whole thing examined.</P>

We want this thing to work, and may I suggest that if you exclude from the benefit of this sub-section a daughter or even a daughter-in-law of the woman in most cases it will be found impracticable to work it at all, for this reason, that in the first case they have to be satisfied that the father of the house is not able to make provision out of his own resources, and secondly, do we not all know that nowadays it is very difficult, if not impossible, to employ casual domestic help in a town or city or a village, and that people who are available for that work and would be suitable, particularly in the country, are very reluctant to go into a house where it has even the name of having infectious disease in it and even though the patient has been removed? There is a further factor that would be against the chance of getting a person like that in&mdash;the size of the home, the accommodation in the home for outside help.  It seems to me that as we know circumstances in the country it would be very difficult, for a short period probably, to get suitable domestic help to accept a position like that, and I presume that the rate of payment would not be princely.  I think <Col N="2020" /> that the Minister would agree, from his own experience of conditions, particularly in country areas, that it may be almost impossible to make this sub-section work if you are to exclude from it the immediate relatives.</P>

      <P>Section 48 of the Principal Act says that where a district medical officer becomes aware that a child attending school is verminous he may serve a notice prohibiting the child from going to school.  It was found in practice that in cities at any rate the district medical officer was not the appropriate person or most convenient person to deal with this matter, that in a city the chief medical officer or his staff would be the people dealing with it.  This amendment makes it possible for the chief medical officer to serve the notice instead of the district medical officer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section and, to a great extent a very necessary one, but powers are being given to the Minister under it, <Col N="2021" /> some of which, at any rate, ought to be given only after the Minister has made a better case than has been made so far.  I am concerned at the moment with sub-section (4) of Section 36.  If Deputies will turn to it, they will see:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where any repairs, structural alterations or additions to premises are required by any authority enforcing regulations under Part V of the Principal Act to comply with those regulations &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the repairs, structural alterations or additions may be carried out notwithstanding any covenant, agreement or condition in any lease or other contract of tenancy under which the premises are held, . . . . . . . .&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very sweeping power.  In relation to business premises&mdash;or indeed to what could more properly be described as residential premises, with a very small part set aside for a shop in a small way, selling very few articles of food&mdash;we are giving the Minister power, in effect, to set aside any contract made between the landlord and the tenant or between the owner of the premises and the person to whom a lease of those premises had been granted.  They can, without his consent &mdash; without even looking for his consent, as a matter of fact, if this were strictly interpreted&mdash;make any change or alteration in his premises that the local authority calls for.  You can change completely the character of the premises, you can build an addition to the premises or to any part of the property adjoining the premises.  A building at the rear of a garden could under this section, in my opinion, be constructed or reconstructed or reconditioned to provide a slaughter house within the regulations laid down here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That seems to me to be an extraordinary power.  I do not know if there is any precedent for any such section in any legislation in this country.  By a mere sub-section in a section, the Minister is given power to set aside any legal contract entered into as between the owner of a property and his tenant or leaseholder. <Col N="2022" /> That is something we ought not to do.  I can quite see that the Minister is in some difficulty there, because if the premises have to be reconstructed to bring them into line with the regulations, you may meet, and you are likely to meet, a very unreasonable landlord.  Some of them are unreasonable to the point that even though their premises would be improved as a result of the reconstruction they would still retain their rights and refuse to agree to the removal of a particular covenant from the lease.</P>
    <P>There is a still greater objection and it brings us to something I hope we will be dealing with another day.  The tenant of the house, if he wishes to carry on his business of selling articles of food, must comply with the regulations laid down and must carry out the necessary reconstruction or improvement, alteration, additions and so on, in order that we may have our food sold and handled under proper conditions. Immediately he does that, however, the valuation people come down on him and up goes the valuation. That is tough enough on the tenant, but it must be remembered that the valuation of the particular premises may be increased here in the City of Dublin by from £50 to £150. That imposes a very considerable additional burden on the tenant or leaseholder, but it also has its effect on the landlord, the owner, because if the valuation of the premises is increased from £50 to £150 that reduces very substantially the capital value of the premises.  Remember that nowadays when your valuation is increased by £100 it means more than your rates going up; it means that your income-tax on the premises goes up also, and your E.S.B. charges if you are on the valuation rate, and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputies may think I am exaggerating when I say that the valuation may be increased from £50 to £150.  Indeed I am not.  As a matter of fact, I got particulars of a case yesterday and I hope to have an opportunity of bringing it before the House later, of a premises which I sold myself last autumn.  The valuation of those premises was £50.  They were being <Col N="2023" /> used as a nursing home.  Now they are being used as offices.  Nothing was done except that they were decorated and made more up-to-date.  The valuation was increased from £50 to £140.  In my own opinion, that is an outrage, but I am just mentioning it to confirm what I am saying, that under this section you are compelling people to make very costly alterations in their premises and on top of that you are going to put a perpetual blister on them.</P>
    <P>It is worse still than that.  The person who is being completely ignored and whose legal contract is being set aside, the owner of the premises, is affected also.  I see the difficulty that the Minister must have some power to deal with a person who is going to be utterly unreasonable, but at the same time I do not think we can go to the extent of giving, in a sub-section of a Bill like this, authority to set aside every legal contract in relation to a business premises in this country.  That is something the Dáil could not do in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points raised by Deputy Morrissey and I shall take the second one first, as I want to dismiss it by saying I cannot deal with the valuation question.  We may have sympathy with what Deputy Morrissey says, but I think it should not be dealt with in this Bill.  There are motions before the Dáil to deal with the matter of valuation and it would more appropriately come up there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but I do not think we should deal with it in a Bill like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was only giving it as an illustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be in a Bill dealing with valuations.  I may say that the first part of it gave rise to a great deal of consideration and thought.  At first, it struck me that a man might come along, say, to Ailesbury Road and take a house there and start a shop in it, and then get the local authority to compel him to reconstruct <Col N="2024" /> the house and put up a proper shop.  If there is a covenant in the lease against a shop then we cannot compel him.  All that we can say is: &ldquo;Close down; you have not a proper shop.&rdquo;  It must be visualised in this that there is nothing against a person having a shop in the lease.  However, the covenant might prevent him for, say, extending backwards for ten feet or it might prevent his putting on another storey, or anything like that. At any rate, the covenant might prevent him from making certain extensions. In that case, if the notice is served, he can say: &ldquo;Landlord, your covenant does not hold here.  I intend to make these alterations.&rdquo;  If he is not prevented by covenant from having a shop, I think it lessens to a great extent the unfair advantage that can be taken of the ground landlord or the landlord who is letting his place.</P>
      <P>I must say that I cannot imagine anything very bad happening under this section, looking at it from that point of view.  However, I would not be unsympathetic to some sort of amendment that would make sure that a person could not take an unfair advantage of, let us say, a landlord by buying a house with the intention of setting up a shop and then getting an order to produce something quite different from what the landlord had agreed to at the beginning.  I am afraid an amendment of that sort is going to be extremely difficult, but if the Deputy has any amendment to suggest I am quite prepared to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a power that we should not give and a precedent that we should not establish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking of all these Fresh Meats Acts, and certainly it is in the Pigs and Bacon Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably the legal people&mdash;if any of them are present in <Col N="2025" /> the House&mdash;would know more about it than I would.  However, it appears to me to be an extraordinary power to give and an extraordinary precedent to establish.  If it can be done in relation to business premises or shops selling food, then, at a later stage, if it is thought necessary, it can be done in relation to any other type of property. The answer we would get to any objections we might raise at a later period on a different type of Bill would be the same as the one which the Minister has given us just now in instancing the Fresh Meats Acts.  We would be told that such power is contained in the Health Bill and that it was accepted by the Dáil without question.</P>
      <P>I think the House should not agree to this sub-section.  I think it is conferring very great powers indeed.  The fact of the matter is that we do know that in certain parts of the country, and certainly here in the city, tenants or leaseholders, without the knowledge of the lessor, or in defiance of a covenant in a lease, open up in a very small way&mdash;it may even be what we would describe as a huckster's shop &mdash;selling food, either in bottles or in cans but not loose, just like selling a packet of cigarettes over the counter. A person like that would be brought under these regulations.  The local authority would have to make the regulations and apply them to that particular person.  Then such persons could get the protection of this sub-section and become legalised in spite of the owner of the property, in what they are now doing in defiance of the contract as between themselves and the owner.  I feel that this section should not be passed.  Certainly, it should not be allowed to go without being fully discussed and understood by the members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect to this matter on which I am not quite clear.  In so far as the paragraph quoted by Deputy Morrissey is concerned, it seems to relate particularly to the covenant or agreement or lease or contract as between the owner and the lessee and the question of the tenant's being relieved from any restrictive clause in that covenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2026" /> I am concerned, however, with another aspect of the question.  For a considerable number of years past, in Dublin and in other cities, we have had the problem&mdash;particularly local authorities&mdash;of having to find accommodation for tenants who are forced out because the owner or the tenant of a particular premises desires to extend the business portion of his premises in a particular direction and take over portion of the premises that are being used as a dwelling.  The Dublin Corporation have taken the view that it is not their responsibility to house families who have to move to suit the convenience of a business concern.</P>
    <P>As the paragraph stands, it may not appear, for example, that if an individual acquires the lease of a house and then lets flats or rooms in that house to families, and later opens a small shop and sells food there, and if an order is made by the local authority requiring him to make certain alterations, he will then be enabled to secure possession of the portions of the house occupied by families.  If that is so, then we are opening up very wide gates indeed so far as Dublin is concerned because that particular possibility will be exploited.  While it is not clear in the paragraph at the moment, it seems to me that it would not be difficult to interpret it that way.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, if the Act is going to give power to the tenant to void all the provisions of a covenant or agreement or lease because an order has been served on him by the local authority, it will not be difficult for him to say that he is equally entitled to dispossess a family who hold a sublease of the premises.</P>
    <P>If that is a development, it can become quite a serious problem in the big cities.  We know that there is continuous pressure by business firms and so forth, to utilise every advantage they can to dispossess families occupying portion of their premises as dwellings, their excuse being that they require those portions of the dwellings for alteration, reconstruction and extension of their business premises. So far, it has been possible to restrain <Col N="2027" /> them from doing so by obliging them to provide alternative accommodation. Now, they will be able to say that they are compelled to do this by an order of the local authority and that the Dáil, in principle, has accepted that they are entitled to void their contract. The Minister should consider these points in addition to those made by Deputy Morrissey.</P>
    <P>The difficulty we have already experienced in regard to the victualling trade is that these orders are dependent on the inspection&mdash;the reports made by the inspectors and the requirements which they advise should be made upon the particular individual. So far as I am aware, there is no provision at the moment for appeal against the demands formulated by that inspection.  Some of the requirements put down by these inspectors, and which have to be met by businessmen, are completely ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The only justification is that the inspector says it has to be done and that is the end of it.  From that point of view we should bear in mind that we are dealing here, so far as this section is concerned, not with a situation which will arise after very careful and long consideration and the affording to both parties of equal opportunity of putting forward their viewpoint and their arguments for and against the requirements that may be made in the regulations, but with a situation in which an order has, in fact, been made and which, so far as the requirements are concerned, is mandatory.  In addition you are now creating the position, as Deputy Morrissey said, of undermining the whole position as between the tenant and the owner in respect of leases and covenants.  You are creating a situation in which we are going to give a very excellent weapon to many unscrupulous business interests to dispossess ordinary working-class families from private dwellings on the excuse that they have to comply with orders, and that will create a position in which an additional burden will be thrown on the local authority if this type of dispossession takes place.</P>
    <Col N="2028" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Larkin has raised two points.  I need hardly say that there is no intention of giving the person on whom notice is served an opportunity of dispossessing a family who might be occupying rooms behind the shop.  I do not think that it could possibly be construed in that way. However, I will get legal opinion on that again and make sure that it could not be construed in that way. Anyway I want to examine sub-section (4) from the point of view raised by Deputy Morrissey to see if we could safeguard in any way against what you might call an outlandish interpretation of the section.  It will not be an easy matter to do but we will examine it.</P>
      <P>The second point raised by Deputy Larkin is in regard to the inspector's power.  In the great majority of cases the inspector discusses the matter with the shopkeeper and they agree and you do not hear any more about it; the thing is done.  In some cases, however, the inspector's demands are considered by the shopkeeper to be too harsh or too severe and the shopkeeper may make an appeal to the Minister against the inspector's demands.  I find that these appeals have been very carefully considered by the officials of the local authorities and I think you may take it that an unreasonable inspector will not get away with his demands because the officials of the local authority will advise the county manager that they are too severe and he will not agree to them.  So that there is a certain amount of screening done before they come to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I have had a dozen appeals altogether since the Act came into operation almost a year ago, and in these cases I think no reasonable person would say that the business should be carried on.  They were mainly small catering businesses and the conditions were really frightfully bad.  There was no running water in some cases.  There was only an ordinary basin and they boiled a kettle to do the washing up and the waitress had to wash her hands in that way.  There was no sanitary accommodation and so on.  They could not be permitted anyway to be used as catering establishments. That is the only type of <Col N="2029" /> case that comes up to me on appeal. You may take it that where a man is carrying on a business in a reasonable way and is asked to make some small alterations he will agree to that.  I think that the number of cases in which shopkeepers would claim that they are asked to do something which they should not be asked to do would be very few.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now raised a point with regard to certain amenities and the grievance that the occupier of a shop might have if he were asked to carry out certain alterations dealing with amenities of that particular kind which may be costly to him.  But we are dealing here with the Minister's proposal under which a man would be allowed to override part of his contract and the Minister ought to give us some kind of a picture of the difficulties that have arisen, where on the departmental or the local authority side they came up against things that were not satisfactory from the point of view of food handling and against stipulations in a covenant in an agreement which would prevent alterations being carried out.  That is really the problem which the House has to deal with.  We are asked to pass legislation to override a covenant in an agreement. I take it that nothing has happened in the operation of the Health Act of 1947 up to the present that has actually overridden in a forcible kind of way any part of an agreement.  What is the experience in that particular line then that drives the Minister to ask for power now to override part of an agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot remember any case that was put to me, but I think any Deputy will see that it might happen.  Coming to the point raised by Deputy Morrissey, I want to make it clear that if there is a covenant in a lease preventing a man starting a shop, then of course, this clause does not enable him to start a shop.  This clause only deals with a covenant in a lease which prevents alterations being made that might be considered necessary by the local authority.  We must presume, therefore, that the man has power to start a shop.  Let us go a little further. <Col N="2030" /> Suppose a man says he can start a shop and spends a certain amount of money in getting the shop going and building up the business and the local authority say: &ldquo;We cannot permit you to continue unless you make certain alterations&rdquo;, from the point of view of the shopkeeper there would be a great hardship if he was put out of business under the food regulations and not permitted to make the alterations he would like to make on account of some covenant in the lease.</P>
      <P>We have to deal with that from the point of view of both parties.  Undoubtedly it is a very difficult matter. I will examine the matter further and see if we can do anything more&mdash;I am very doubtful if we can do anything more&mdash;to safeguard the position of both parties.  I think Deputies will agree that we will have to consider the position of the owner of the shop. It would be very unfair to put him out because he was not permitted to make some alteration owing to an unreasonable restriction on behalf of the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by the Minister, take the case which is very common in cities of a small two-storey house occupied by a family and they turn a parlour into a shop and live in the other rooms of the house. That is very common in Dublin.  They are not concerned as to whether it will be used as a food shop or a newspaper shop; it is just a shop.  As the law stands at the moment, a person may come along and take a lease and open a food shop and everything is quite in order.  When we pass the Bill, regulations come into force and I am told that in order to comply with the regulations I may have to get another five or six feet on to the shop, and the only place I can get it is from the private family.  As it stands now, I can insist on going ahead with those alterations and taking in the five feet. It may be argued that the owner of the house, which is a small house of the ordinary middle class family type, took the chance and put the shop there, and did not do it for the purpose of complying with the regulations which had not been made.  He decided to open an ordinary small shop and <Col N="2031" /> then these regulations were made and because the owner of the shop cannot comply with the regulations unless he takes an extra five feet, it is not the owner of the shop that is told he has to get out of the shop, it is the family who have to give up one of their rooms in order to accommodate the shop-owner. The position can quite easily arise, and particularly here, with small shops having limited accommodation. They may require additional space without the regulations made being in any way unreasonable, and that can produce a very peculiar position in regard to the owner of the small house who perhaps had a few pounds to spare and decided to turn the front parlour into a shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say to that is that I do not think the clause as it stands could be interpreted in that way.  I do not think we could override whatever Act it is&mdash;I think it is the Landlord and Tenant Act they call it&mdash;where the person who is occupying rooms has the right to stay there and to secure themselves.  I do not think anything here could be construed as overriding that.  I will have it examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the present position so far as I understand it, is this: taking the man the Deputy has in mind and supposing that man, as the Deputy said, has a small house and turns the front parlour into a shop, and suppose after that he lets the rest of the house to a family, and suppose he is keeping on the shop&mdash;if we serve an order on him saying you must extend, I do not think that will override the law that safeguards the family in their tenancy. But I will have the matter examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but would it override the owner of the house if he happens to live in the house himself? Suppose I own a house and make a shop in the parlour and then go and live in the back and the first floor. Then, when there is additional space required for the shop, this paragraph refers particularly to the lease or the contract under which the premises are <Col N="2032" /> held, and apparently to the owner.  I grant that the sub-tenant occupying rooms may be covered and I merely raise that for information but it is quite clear in the case here, the shop is held by the owner.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question about it.  In so far as the local authority will have to enforce regulations they cannot take into account any question of living conditions.  They are concerned only with the business side of it and if in their opinion it has to be extended by five or six feet, irrespective of what effect it has on the residential portion of the premises or those who reside there, that regulation must be carried out or they will not get their licence. It is also clear that if the tenant, leaseholder or owner has the tenancy, lease or agreement for the premises and is using only the shop portion of the premises for himself, having sublet the residential portion, and if it comes again to a question of an extension of the business premises into the premises which at the moment would be occupied by the people living in the residential portion, then, notwithstanding whatever contract there may be between the people who occupy the residential portion and those occupying the business premises, their agreement goes by the board, and if the residential <Col N="2033" /> accommodation is entered upon to an extent that makes it no longer suitable for their requirements they have to go, no matter what agreement there is.  It seems that is absolutely clear under clause (a) of sub-section (4).</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with the Minister that this is a difficult matter and I agree entirely that the tenant or leaseholder of the house or business premises must be protected also.  I do not want anybody for a moment to think I am here as defender of covenants in leases.  Nobody knows much better than myself how unreasonable &mdash; utterly unreasonable&mdash;a great many of those covenants or restrictions are, particularly in the light of present-day conditions.  These covenants or restrictions were made maybe a century ago and in conditions entirely different and the whole character of the area, say, in this city, where restrictions were first thought necessary or desirable, has completely changed.  But still the ground landlords are only prepared to waive or amend these covenants or restrictions&mdash;if at all&mdash;on payment of a pretty heavy fine by the leaseholder. Do not take me as defending that. But there is a very big principle at stake here.</P>
    <P>This is not confined to contracts between ground landlords and leaseholders, or to ground landlords and tenants.  It applies to any contract whether it is the main lease or the sublease, whether the main tenancy or the sub-tenancy.  Any contract that is entered into, if it is considered necessary to change the business portion of those premises, all those contracts are set aside by virtue of Section 4.  I think that is too sweeping, but I agree it is a difficult matter and I agree entirely that it would be a grave hardship, and even a grave injustice for a local authority to be imposing conditions on the tenant, or on the leaseholder of a business premises, which he was not in a position to fulfil and to which the only alternative for him was to get out of that type of business. May I say again to the Minister that the mere fact that there is a shop owner on the premises does not safeguard him?  Deputy Larkin has given one type of business here which is <Col N="2034" /> common in the City of Dublin.  Let me put it this way; somebody has been carrying on business for 40 or 50 years, just an ordinary tobacconist-newsagency business alone, and to meet the current popular demand he decides to get into ice-cream.  That immediately puts him into a different category. Or if he decides to keep a couple of dozen bottles of sauce and a few tins of cocoa or coffee on the shelves&mdash;that simple fact immediately changes the whole character of the place and brings it absolutely within the section we are now dealing with.</P>
    <P>I have to admit that I am not in a position to suggest to the Minister a form of words that would give the protection to a businessman that he is entitled to as between his landlord and the local authority and that at the same time would safeguard the principle of a legal contract but I do want again to urge in the House that it is entirely wrong that by a sort of side-wind, by a sub-section in a clause of a sub-section, to take powers to set aside legal contracts as between landlord and tenant, as between tenant and tenant. and as between leaseholder and tenant. I think it is wrong and it is a principle to which the House should not commit itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that everybody will sympathise with the Minister's efforts to introduce regulations governing the proper handling of food.  I think the fallacy in this matter is that the section proceeds on the basis that if there is a clause in the covenant which forbids the opening of a shop then we should have sympathy with the owner of that shop and that where there is no such covenant and where the shop has been opened then the owner has got to face up to the present position.  I think the weakness in this case is that the Minister has taken it for granted that at the time the owner agreed to the shop being opened, he knew that it was going to sell food. Therefore we proceed on the basis that having made that decision, he has got to take the consequences because he has agreed to allow his premises to be used for the manufacture or sale of food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2035" /> As Deputy Morrissey has pointed out, how many countless cases have we got of shops that were opened as tobacconists shops and because they have gone into selling ice-cream and other foods they must now come under this section.  That frequently happens. Then without any decision on the part of the owner, these regulations will need to be applied.  That is why I say that there is a weakness in the Minister's approach because he has taken it for granted that at some point the owner was in fact in a position to make the decision: &ldquo;Well, I am going to have food sold in the shop and I am prepared to face up to what the consequences are.&rdquo;  That is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point put forward by Deputy Morrissey is very important.  I want to put this to the Minister.  Suppose a shop-owner desired to extend the portion of the premises used as a shop so as to include part of the living accommodation, the shop-owner, I take it, would have to go to court to obtain an order against the tenant.  Would the Minister not consider leaving it to the court to decide which was the greatest hardship in that instance?  There may be a case say where a man had been able to make a good living as a tobacconist but he wanted to open a restaurant in addition and required to take over the living accommodation of a family for that purpose.  Assuming the man was able to carry on as a tobacconist, it would be unfair to take over the living accommodation of a family in the same premises but where there was no hardship in taking over the living accommodation the court might decide in favour of the shop-owner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That appears a fairly good suggestion, that the aggrieved party might have an appeal to some court if he thought he could establish that the hardship was greater on him than on the other party.  I shall consider some provision like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether that will meet it, but I would certainly prefer it to the position in which we are at the moment.  There <Col N="2036" /> is no doubt we are in a difficult position. I realise fully that the Minister is in a difficult position, but I do suggest very seriously to the Minister that the principle here involves the taking of power in effect to set aside, not in one, but in thousands or tens of thousands of cases, existing legal contracts. We are doing that by a sort of side-wind here.  In a great number of cases that power will have to be enforced.  We have been talking about the City of Dublin.  These covenants and restrictions are more common here and perhaps in Cork and Limerick than they would be in towns and villages of the country but even in the ordinary towns of the country you will find them in contracts.  Of course, the older the contracts are, the more covenants and restrictions there are in them.  You do not get so many covenants in the modern contracts.  The older the contracts are and the older the premises themselves, the heavier will be the outlay on carrying out the alterations laid down under the regulations.</P>
      <P>May I direct the Minister's attention to sub-section (5) of the section which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In Sections 56 and 57 of the principal Acts, the word &lsquo;food&rsquo; shall be construed, in addition to referring to any individual food, as referring to any class whatsoever of food.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have not seen a definition of &ldquo;food&rdquo; but does that sub-section embrace animal foods as well as foods for human consumption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister assures me, I accept that although, as I say, it is very sweeping.  &ldquo;Any class of food whatsoever&rdquo; would seem to include all food, whether for human or animal consumption.  Of course, if that is so, every food for animal consumption can be brought in under this. That could create infinitely greater hardship on the persons concerned.</P>

      <P>The difficulty I find about the discussion here is that we are concerned with microbes or other disturbances in food that might be injurious to the public health.  I do <Col N="2037" /> not know whether under this section we are supposed to be elephants trampling down difficulties and obstructions that are in the way of getting at the microbes in the food or whether we are doing just a little bit of preparatory crystal gazing to decide whether we want elephants at work to trample down these things.  The Minister does not seem to offer any very great prospect of not having to use elephants in trampling down covenants and agreements in leases and contracts that exist at the moment.  We have not been given any idea of cases in which a specific provision in a lease or covenant created difficulties in the administration of the 1947 Act up to the present.  I doubt if we can pass a measure as sweeping as sub-section (4) without scheduling even certain types of provisions occurring in convenants and leases for the removal of which we want to use the power of this section. This compulsory wiping out of agreements is unreasonable.  I do not think it ought to be necessary. I should like the Minister to say whether there has been listed in any way either definite terms or provisions or any class of restrictions in any leases up to the present with which this clause is intended to deal.</P>

I do not know whether, before the passing of Section 55 of the 1947 Act, it was necessary for a person with a shop selling food to get a licence or have it registered in any way, or for persons engaged in the distribution or sale of food to license or register. Could the Minister say whether it is necessary for a person who wants to open a shop to sell food, before doing so, to be registered or to get a licence, and whether it is necessary for persons employed in that shop for the sale or distribution of food individually to get a licence and to be registered?

There is no question at all about that, but I want to be clear on the point that we may be laying down here in law and creating a position wherein a person in order to engage in, either as a member of the staff or as a member of a family running a shop, the sale, manufacture or importation of food will or may after the passing of this Act, be subject to a medical examination and subject to that examination for the purpose of discovering whether or not such person shall be able to continue in that business.</P>

      <P>This throws a rather starting light on Section 36 and I would like to know from the Minister where, under Section 36, it is suggested that there is power to make regulations requiring persons engaged in the manufacture, preparation, importation, storage, distribution and sale of food for human consumption to produce evidence as to the condition of their health at all.  Where in this section or in anything resulting from Part V of the Principal Act to which this section refers is there any such evidence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;Regulations under Part V of the Principal Act may provide for all or any of the following matters&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Where in that phrase is there anything that would suggest that these regulations can deal with matters affecting the person's health or the licensee's health or the health of persons registered under that section?  I merely ask the question from the point of view of the implication of the law in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the certain amount of concern caused by such a proposition.  Obviously, the certificate would be given <i>bona fide</i> by the doctor in his effort to protect the public interest to the best of his ability. Is this not an extension of the powers we already have in connection with typhoid carriers?  We can refuse to allow a typhoid carrier to engage in the handling of food.  I think that is so.  This is an extension of that medical protection which, unfortunately, is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to Deputy Dr. Browne, it is dismissing the matter rather lightly to say that this is merely an extension of something which he thinks obtains for the moment.  Let me carry the matter to its logical conclusion.  If this regulation is made under this piece of legislation, <Col N="2046" /> then it must apply to every person in the State.  We are not just dealing with the Cities of Dublin, Cork or Limerick but with the whole of the State.  Let me imagine&mdash;as many of the Deputies can&mdash;a shop at a crossroads selling, as many of them do, anything from a needle to an anchor, including food both for human and animal consumption. That shop has to be registered. The shop is probably run by a man and his wife as shops are.  Either or both of them may be suffering to some degree from T.B.  I understand from medical men that there are many degrees of T.B.  Because of that, the regulations may compel the doctor to give a certificate that will make it impossible for those persons to be registered and have a licence issued in respect of that particular shop.  That is what can happen.  That is what we have got to visualise.  We have got to understand that we may be doing that here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the doctor is covered by the phrase &ldquo;a probable source of infection&rdquo;.  I think this gives the average doctor a fair amount of discretion to decide whether the type of person was a probable source of infection before he would put him out of business.  Deputy Morrissey quite rightly suggested that he could put him out of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The position now is that any person selling food in any part of the country in any shop may be required to register and may even be required to be medically examined.  Is not that the position?  I do not think that is reasonable.  As Deputy Morrissey said, some type of food is sold in practically every shop in rural Ireland.  There is no shop that would not sell something, if only a few biscuits. Reference was made to typhoid carriers.  As a rule, it is difficult to determine who a typhoid carrier is and <Col N="2047" /> Deputy Dr. Browne would agree with that.  It seems to me that these regulations would be all right if they applied only to persons solely engaged in selling food.  As it is here, the State can step in and force anybody selling any type of food&mdash;and that includes practically every shopkeeper in Ireland &mdash;to register if necessary and to prove he has a fair bill of health to enable him to go on selling food.  That is an extreme power.  The Minister may say that they will not be enforced in a great many cases.  Nevertheless, it seems to me that it is unnecessary to go to such an extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Dr. Esmonde.  To be effective at all, these food regulations must be extremely wide in scope.  The small shopkeeper almost invariably sells loose milk and a great deal of damage could be done to the community if the milk were contaminated.  Loose milk may be the only food item such a shopkeeper sells.  Nevertheless, if the milk were contaminated, the most appalling damage could be done to everybody's health in the district where the milk was sold.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely essential so far as the protection of public health is concerned that the scope of the power should be extremely wide.  In this particular case the power must be very wide.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde says that these people should not be examined medically but nurses, for example, are examined medically.  He knows that all nurses in hospitals have to be examined.  They must be X-rayed.  I think we must, in the interests of public health, have power to examine and I think the ordinary person would have a very strong view on that matter.  Imagine the distress of a mother of a family to whom it could be proved that her children had contracted T.B. as the result of the contamination of a local shopkeeper from whom she bought loose milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll stated the majority of shopkeepers down the country sell milk. I would not agree.  I live in the country and there are always a couple of dairies in a district.  It is unreasonable <Col N="2048" /> to introduce legislation whereby anybody with a shop of any kind&mdash; and that covers practically every shop in Ireland&mdash;should be subject to inspection and have to have a certificate showing a clear bill of health.</P>
      <P>I do not think that we have had any serious epidemics in this country. We have had sporadic outbreaks of typhoid fever in parts of rural Ireland from time to time but these have been considered to be due, in the majority of cases, to a carrier, though it has not been actually discovered who the carrier was.  As I say, I do not think that we have had any serious epidemics.  Therefore, I do not think any State control is called for.  I agree that there ought to be reasonable safeguards in the case of anyone primarily concerned with the selling and handling of food.  Practically every shop in rural Ireland at any rate is concerned in a small way with the sale of food.  This legislation tends to give power to the Minister to make all the shops in Ireland register for food purposes. I think that this is unnecessary State interference and nothing else.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned at the moment with the merits of any proposal, but I am concerned with the rather startling suggestion that Section 36 does contain power to apply medical tests to persons engaged in the sale and distribution of food.  I am asking where, either in Part V of the 1947 Act to which Section 36 refers or in Section 36 itself, there is any contemplated power to apply a medical test in relation to any person engaged in the manufacture, preparation or sale of food.  That is the net point at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, I do not think this section is going to do that.  I may be wrong in that.  There may be power in the 1947 Act, though I am not sure&mdash;at any rate it will be some time before we reach that point&mdash;to deal with the personnel of these shops. If we have that power in the Principal Act, it must be covered by regulations and these regulations will have to be laid on the Table.  It would possibly have to be preceded by legislation, although I do not know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> Deputy Dr. Esmonde suggested the words &ldquo;a person mainly engaged in the sale of food.&rdquo;  I think if we were to adopt a definition of that sort we would encounter a good deal of trouble.  Clery's Restaurant, for instance, and Switzer's Restaurant, would be exempt under that definition. I think it would be a bit dangerous even in the case of a country shop where all sorts of goods are sold&mdash; drapery and everything else.  But, if these shops sell milk, which may be only a very small part of their business, then it might be potentially very dangerous if the person distributing the milk was a typhoid carrier or was suffering from T.B.</P>
    <P>Suppose we had the power to deal with personnel it might not be exercised very much.  If a person were to go to the medical officer of health in some provincial town and say that the person distributing a lot of milk in a shop there was undoubtedly suffering from T.B.  I do not think that at the moment the medical officer of health can do anything about it.  If, however, the power was there he could.  I am not sure that we have the power at the moment.  If we have it might be some time before we reached the point of dealing with the personnel.  Before exercising the power, we would have to proceed either by bringing in legislation or, if the legislation is there, by making the necessary regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister undertake to make inquiries and make a statement on the matter as to whether there is power in any legislation that exists to prevent a person or persons engaged in any particular type of occupation from doing so by reason of the fact that they suffer from some particular illness or disease?

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should remember that we are legislating for the future.  The position is generally <Col N="2050" /> accepted by members of the House that, when this legislation is enacted, it will give the Minister power, or the health authority in this case, to enforce licensing regulations on any shop in any part of Ireland that is selling any type of food, no matter how small.  I take it that its inspectors will have power to see that this provision is enforced.</P>
      <P>If the medical officer of health has this power already, as I believe he has, then I think that this section as it stands is unnecessary, and that wider powers than are necessary are being sought by the Minister.  May I say again, that I do not think that the Minister's officials are going to abuse these powers, but again we have to remember that we are legislating for the future?  The principle is again being raised that here we are going to have total State interference.  The question is, whether we are to have that total State interference, or whether the rights of individuals are to prevail.  That seems to be the point at issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is intended to deal with radioactive substances.  Section 54 deals with radioactive substances and it is was necessary to amend the definition of &ldquo;substance&rdquo; in Section 65 of the Principal Act in order to make Section 54 operative.  Now, the definition of the word &ldquo;substance&rdquo; is: &ldquo;a natural or artificial substance, whether in solid or liquid form or in the form of a gas or vapour, including a preparation or manufactured article or article which has been subjected to any artificial treatment or process&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was necessary to amend that definition so that radioactive substances could be dealt with as visualised under Section 54.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will know that we are here dealing with amendments to the <Col N="2053" /> 1947 Act and the amendment of Section 65 of that Act is one of them. Sub-section (b) goes on to the enforcement of the regulations.  It is necessary to have the powers again conferred for the enforcement of the regulations that may be carried out by the officers of the Minister, by health authorities and their officers.  Sub-section (iii) provides for the enforcement of the regulations &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance, by officers of Customs and Excise.&rdquo;  Sub-section (iv): &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, by officers of that Minister.&rdquo;  We may in some cases be dealing with the manufacture of these substances as a by-product or perhaps as part of the operations of a larger factory.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would be the more appropriate authority to deal with some of those cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we had some discussion already in this connection on the Financial Resolution.  I appreciate that radioactive substances are a new discovery and I am in agreement that there should be some control with regard to them.  A parallel case arose in Britain and legislation was passed empowering the Minister to control these substances.  We divide radioactive substances, as far as I know, into two different varieties.  There is the medical type of radioactive substances which is used for a particular form of treatment.  It has been discovered to be of some benefit in obscure blood diseases for which previously there has been very little treatment.  It is possible that these substances may be required to be distributed to the medical practitioners and medical officers in the hospitals for the purpose of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a second variety of radioactive substances which is concerned with the discovery of defects that might exist in propellors of aeroplanes and ships.  Of course, that would not be the concern of the medical faculty but of the commercial side.  These substances in connection with which the Minister seeks powers under this section, powers which, of course, he is entitled to seek, are new and distinct, perhaps, from what we were discussing the other day, cortisone.  It is a comparatively <Col N="2054" /> recent discovery and very little is known about these substances. They should be in the hands of experts.</P>
    <P>In Britain the particular Minister sought these powers in the House of Parliament and got them.  Having got them in relation to the medical section, that is in connection with isotopes or radioactive substances used for treatment, he delegated these powers to the medical research council, and in the case of the commercial product he delegated the powers to the scientific research council.  I would like to ask the Minister if it is his intention to control these powers himself&mdash;of course, he will officially control them&mdash; or if he intends to delegate them to the particular societies I have mentioned, the medical research council in the case of isotopes or other medical products, and the scientific research council in the case of the commercial products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a case like this I would certainly consult the medical research council because in my Department we do not claim to know very much about these substances and I suppose the only authority we could consult is the medical research council.  If they have not got the necessary information themselves, they would get it for us. I do not think the Deputy need have any doubts about that.  They would not, of course, administer that themselves.

It enables local authorities to take part in the enforcement of Section 66 of the Principal Act which deals with the restriction of the importation or manufacture of certain articles which by their use cause serious risk of injury to health or body.  In many of these sections in the Principal Act&mdash;this is one of them&mdash; prosecution, and so on, will be in the hands of the Minister.</P>

There is one particular type from which a particular type of infection originates.  Is that what is in the Minister's mind?

    <P>(10)  The quorum for a meeting of the National Health Council shall be one-third of the members, or, if the number of members is not divisible by three, one-third of the next <Col N="2058" /> higher number which is divisible by three.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all dealing with the Health Council.  It is hardly necessary to go into it in great detail. The whole object of these amendments is to give more powers of discussion, at least, to the Health Council.  There are various changes being made.  Perhaps I should mention the principal ones.  In the first place, when the Health Council is being formed in the future, at least half of the members will be appointed directly by professional bodies, the Medical Association, Dental Association, Nursing Association, etcetera, any of the professional bodies.  They will have a nomination of at least half and the remainder will, of course, be appointed by the Minister. They will meet at least quarterly and they can meet at other times by requisition to the chairman.  There is a limit, however, to the number of meetings that can be called.  The number of meetings can be limited to three in any particular quarter.  All regulations will be submitted to them for their comments and the only exception to that is that the Minister reserves the power, where a regulation must be made with all due speed, that he can make a regulation of that kind and afterwards submit it to the council for their comments.  The council will arrange their own procedure.  They will have their own chairman and their own secretary and they will issue an annual report.  I think that covers the amendment.  It puts them on a basis of independence, at any rate, but I want to make it clear that they are still only advisory because in our system of Government a Minister must take full responsibility for his Department. It was not possible, therefore, to accede to the request that they should have any executive function <Col N="2060" /> whatever.  They can only advise and the Minister must take a decision in the end, whatever decision it may be. Their only remedy, if they feel the Minister is unreasonable in not accepting their advice, is that they have the annual report in which they can draw attention to that and members of the Oireachtas, the Dáil and Seanad, will have an opportunity of reading these annual reports and will deal with the Minister in their own way if they think he is unreasonable.</P>

      <P>The Deputy perhaps knows the difficulty here about getting every party represented.  You must get to a fairly high number before you can give proper representation. Even among practitioners of medicine they may want mental diseases represented. You would naturally want the hospitals represented as well as private practitioners, general practitioners, and so on.  Then you go to the other professions, the dental side and the pharmaceutical side.  They are at the moment represented and the veterinary profession is represented.  All these have to get representation so it is then a matter of sitting down and adding up how many are on the commission.  That is half, and the whole is so and so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I think the bigger the advisory council the Minister has in contentious matters such as health the better and this is a step in the right direction.  They are to meet not less than every three months and if a majority of the council decide that they wish to meet oftener they are entitled to do so.  The Minister says that they will be supplied with a secretary from the Department.  Where are they going to meet?  Are they going to have a secretariat and so on, or are they just a body who will meet now and again with the assistance of a secretary and disband again?  Surely they would want some headquarters somewhere.  Can the Minister qualify that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health will provide them with premises in which to meet.  In regard to calling the meetings it is provided that the meeting may be called at the request of the Minister.  It is obvious that if he has regulations to put to them he must have power to call a meeting.  A meeting can also be called on a requisition of one-third of the members of the council itself, but there is a limit put to that, that they may not demand a meeting under that subclause more than three times in the quarter or in fact that the total number of meetings must not be more than three in the quarter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  After all the best way to judge these things is by good <Col N="2063" /> faith in the past.  We have had this in the past.  We already had representatives of local authorities and recently we brought in the trade unions and the Employers' Federation or I think it is the Chamber of Commerce. The local authorities must be on it, the trade unions will be on it and the employers also or some organisation representing them, and by the time you get representation from them all it will be fairly bulky, but it cannot be helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>If you are going to have a big body like this the Minister will appreciate that it will not be just a question of having a meeting and making a representative advice of views to the Minister.  They will probably have a great many factors before them that they will wish to study and it will not be only a question of meeting for two or three hours and disbanding and returning to their different unions.  Surely they would want an extended discussion among themselves if they are going to be of benefit as an advisory council to the Minister&mdash;they would want to discuss a thing fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that for that purpose they should have a secretariat and somewhere to meet.  I appreciate that this is a great step.  The Health Council we have had before met three times in four years or something like that.  Now it is envisaged that we are going to have an Advisory Health Council and it is my opinion that all the facilities possible should be made available for them.  It is not a question of just coming together in a small hall somewhere, meeting and disbanding again.  The Minister might accommodate them in some way, giving them a secretariat and a permanent secretary as well.  If they are going to serve a useful function they will have a lot of work to do.  I do not say this in an acrimonious spirit at all or in any spirit of criticism, but there is no doubt about it that over the health service we have had a good deal of controversy during the past couple of years and <Col N="2064" /> there is considerable controversy still. There is a lot in this Act that we do not approve of, and we hope that out of this advisory council the Minister may be brought to see the light in certain cases.  We ourselves have been discussing these amendments and these sections over the past few days and I think it is true to say that we have had the greatest difficulty in understanding a lot of it.  I do not see how diverse sections of the community are going to come in, just have a meeting and put up to the Minister certain proposals and disband again.  That does not seem to me to be reasonable.  I think that they will need extensive discussion if they are going to be effective in helping us to procure the best health service. You have therefore to provide for considerable discussions.  Would not the Minister consider it reasonable that they should be provided with a secretariat and an establishment where they can meet and fully discuss all these matters which they are entitled to so as to assist in advising the Minister in every way possible?</P>

I think the Minister ought to consider the appointment of a secretary for them and a place for meeting and that they should meet regularly and give advice to the people generally.  I am thinking of the local representatives on that committee having to bring back recommendations to the finance office of the municipal authority of which they are members.

      <P>I still feel that the Minister is not making sufficient facilities available for this consultative council.  I, personally, place great value on it.  It is a pity we have not had one in the past.  We had one in recent years but made very little use of it.  It would be necessary for the council to have considerable discussions. It is to be created partially by election and partially by the Minister.  It will be a pretty big body which is going to discuss this Health Bill or matters appertaining to health. If necessary they will refer to the Principal Act and to this Bill to get information on the facts and an appreciation of the health services offered to the country.  It is quite impossible for a diverse body of men and women as this will be to come together with just a secretary.</P>
      <P>The suggestion is that a civil servant will come in from the Department of Health and act as secretary.  It would be impossible to discuss these things by meeting for three days a month.  If they are to carry out their function fully they will have to meet for days on end.  They should have a separate secretary and staff.  It may mean the creation of more civil servants and may mean having some buildings where they can meet to discuss these things. With regard to any advice they may offer to the Minister, I would not say they should be running every day of the week to him with advice; but it may take at least a week for them to get a grip on things and for any points they want to make it may take the best part of a week to prepare them. Unless they have somewhere to meet and some secretariat they could not serve the function for which they are being brought together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point that arises later.  Deputy Byrne makes a very good point there.  The point I am on is whether they are being put in a position to go into a matter fully and advise the Minister.  These people will come together from all over Ireland. We accept the fact that these health services have caused a lot of trouble.  By this council you are going to ease the trouble and create a better atmosphere straightway and make it easier for the Minister in health legislation as a whole.  I do not think that the facilities under this section are sufficient or that the position is clarified enough.  I do not see how they could serve their full function as set out and I think the Minister should meet the point and consider establishing a secretariat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must provide a secretary.  How often more am I expected to make that statement?  That is a secretariat.  If the secretary comes to me and says he wants a typist and a writing assistant to help him, he will get them, but in my opinion he will not be fully occupied at all.  The Deputy wants a week to meet and a week to prepare the advice.  I have met the consultative council three times within the last three or four months&mdash;so it is not true to say they have not met for four years, although they did not meet for a long time previous to that&mdash;and I found it impossible to get them to agree to come back after lunch.  They were all very busy people, they met in the morning and continued until 1.30 but that is as much as they were prepared to do.  I can understand that these men have to do a day's work as well and it is very hard to expect them to give a whole day.  They gave a half-day but were not prepared to come back in the afternoon or the next day.  If we get these men to meet as laid down here or as visualised here, about once a month, it is as much as <Col N="2068" /> we will do.  I do not think the secretary will have full time work.  I do not like to see a civil servant put into a job like that, a nice cushy job where he will get as little as two hours a week.  I am just going to try this out and allow a civil servant to do that work.  If there is full time work, he will be allowed to do it and will not be asked to do anything else.  If he says he is not able to do the work and wants an assistant, he will get one.  I will have to find out how much work there is in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a body which is to advise the Minister on these matters must have a discussion on them?  I quite appreciate that the Minister is providing a secretary.  This body could not have a meeting and then adjourn for a whole month, as they could not possibly cover all the facts.  There may be other points brought up which they would wish to discuss.  If there is some secretary in residence in some particular place where they could go, they could communicate the facts to him and they could be brought up at the next meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The health legislation is very complicated and it is difficult for people to carry these things in their minds.  A member of this advisory council may be told a point by somebody, a point he thinks should be put before the Minister.  We are all prepared to take advice from everybody&mdash;that is democracy. If they have had a meeting in the previous week and are not going to meet for another month, there should be some establishment with a secretary in residence where they could go and put the point.  The secretary could take note of it and bring it before the next meeting.  This is the only way they can function efficiently. I do not suggest that this advisory council should remain in perpetual session, but I do suggest they should have some headquarters.  Every business establishment or secretarial concern has an office or headquarters of some sort, if it is to be efficient and function as an efficient body.  This council must have something on those lines.  Otherwise it will be just a whole lot of people coming to a meeting.  It <Col N="2069" /> is a very good thing to have people of diverse views coming together&mdash;and I fully agree with Deputy Kyne that the trade unions should be represented, just as the chambers of commerce and other sections of the community should be represented&mdash;but it would be impossible for these people to meet every day.  There will be a lot of executive work that will have to be done behind the scenes on their behalf if they are to function properly.  They cannot do that under the present arrangement. I suggest that the Minister is only creating a committee that will meet now and again and that they will lose interest after a bit.  I do not want that, and I am sure that nobody in the House wants it.  I am sure we all agree that we should try and even out our differences in our endeavour to give the people what they require, that is, improved health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I did not make myself clear.  The secretary will be at their disposal all the time.  If a particular member wants something put on the agenda for the next meeting and either writes or calls to the secretary then the matter will be available and the The secretary will be available and the member can discuss it with the secretary.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, I would say that this council will probably have an executive committee and that that executive committee would meet often to prepare the agenda, to procure the necessary data which would be necessary for the members in their consideration of any points that might arise, and so forth. One of their biggest jobs for some time to come will be to consider the regulations under this Act.  These regulations will be in their hands for a considerable time before they meet and when the regulations come they will be in a position to discuss them. I have no objection to their meeting oftener if the great majority of the committee want to meet oftener.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (5) of Section 98 of the original Act provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas and to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, pay to the members of the National Health Council or any consultative council established under this section or of any committee of such council:&mdash;</P>

You cannot have a council of that kind without very concentrated machinery at the centre as a secretariat even for the purpose of concentrating their own ideas and suggestions and making them available in documentary form.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spoken rather with a touch of gloom of a subversive third element.  He rather lightened the gloom by saying how busy most members of the council are and that they will have hardly any time to be subversive. What he has said with regard to that reminds me that, under Section 7, not less than half of the persons to be appointed on the council shall be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of bodies which, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of certain things.  I take it from what the Minister says about the possibility of subversive elements creeping in on the council that the Minister has no intention of refusing nominations of certain bodies on the grounds that they might turn out to be subversive?</P>

Tá breis agus 40% den Mheastachán glan don Roinn Tailte curtha in áirithe do na fo-mhírchinn seo chun easnaimh áirithe i gCiste na mBannaí Talún a shlánú.  Leanann na heasnaimh seo as dhá leath a dhéanamh de bhlianachtaí, sin suim £667,400 sa bhliain seo, agus as cabhair eile ón Stát chun talamh a cheannach, e.g., ciste costas agus bónas reachtúil do dhaoine a dhíolas eastát de bhreis agus de bharr ar an bpraghas is iníoctha ag na tionóntaí a cheannaíos iad.</P>
    <P>Na híocaíochtaí a déantar i leith úis agus ciste fiachmhúchta is muirir aisfhillteacha iad agus, do réir mar bhéas socrú na talún ag dui ar aghaidh, cruthnaítear muirir nua a bheir méadú i bhfo-mhírchinn H 1 agus H 3; meastar go dtabharfaidh roínnt na mblianachtaí £8,900 de mhéadú i mbliana i bhfo-mhírcheann H.</P>
    <P>Fo-mhírcheann I&mdash;£615,000: Faoin bhfo-mhircheann seo soláthraítear cistí chun eastáit d'fheabhsú agus de ghnáth is gá chuige sin foirgintí d'athchóiriú, bóithre, claíocha, silteáin, etc. a dhéanamh.  Is é an fo-mhircheann seo is fearr a léiríos an méid oibre atá á dhéanamh maidir le socrú talún.  Toise a bhfuil á dhéanamh chun an cúngrach i gcúrsaí talún a laghdú trí dhaoine d'aistriú agus trí ghabháltas d'athshocrú, bíonn costas mór ag baint leis an bhfo-mhírcheann seo, go háirithe ar fhoirgintí.  Anuraidh méadaíodh an vóta bunaidh, £480,000, trí £80,000 sa bhreis a sholáthar agus caitheadh é go léir is é sin £560,000; sin an méid is mó a caitheadh riamh ó 1939/40 i leith agus níor sáraíodh an tsuim sin ach sa bhliain sin agus sna trí bliana roimhe. I mbliana táimid ag brath ar thuilleadh fós a chaitheamh agus tá méadú £55,000 sa bhfo-mhírcheann chuige sin.  An méid atá dá iarraidh, £615,000, is ionann é beagnach agus an tríú cuid den ghlan-Mheastachán don Roinn.

Is ábhar eiscithe atá faoi chúram na gCoimisinéirí cinneadh méid aon aisce den tsórt sin a chinneadh.</P>
    <P>The House will notice that the net Estimate of £1,918,930 for lands for the current year shows an increase of £117,460 over the total amount&mdash; original and supplementary&mdash;voted last year.  The increase arises mainly under sub-heads A and I.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A&mdash;£553,669: Under sub-head A, for salaries, wages and allowances, the increase is £20,968 on the amount originally voted last year or £35,463 on the net Vote after savings had been applied for other purposes in the Supplementary Estimate.  This increase is chiefly due to normal incremental increases in salaries and wages. There is also provision for seven additional inspectors to replace officers seconded for other work; these inspectors will be appointed as speedily as possible.  To fill vacancies 22 inspectors were newly recruited during the past year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head B&mdash;£37,000: An increase of £5,000 under sub-head B is due to higher rates of travelling and subsistence allowances authorised some months ago and to increased outdoor activity following the recruitment of additional inspectors.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E&mdash;£9,500: Sub-head E provides for the incidental legal expenses of the solicitor's branch including costs of owners and tenants payable by the Land Commission in proceedings for the acquisition and resumption of land.  The current year's Estimate shows a reduction of £500 on the total provision made in last year's original and Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads H (1), H (2) and H (3)&mdash; £800,500: More than 40 per cent. of the <Col N="2078" /> net Estimate for Lands is allocated to sub-heads H (1), H (2) and H (3) for making good certain deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund.  These deficiencies arise from the halving of annuities, amounting to £667,400 in the current year, and from other State aids to land purchase, e.g., costs fund and statutory bonus to vendors of estates over and above the price payable by the tenant purchasers.  The payments in respect of interest and sinking fund on land bonds are recurring charges and, as the land settlement programme proceeds, additional charges are created which result in increases in sub-heads H (1) and H (3); the estimated increase this year in sub-head H (3) for halving of annuities is £8,900.</P>
    <P>Sub-head I&mdash;£615,000: Under sub-head I funds are provided for the improvement of estates and generally this involves the erection and reconditioning of buildings, construction of roads, fences, drains, etc.  This sub-head, more than any other, reflects the extent of land settlement activities.  Concentration on the relief of congestion by migration and rearrangement involves heavy expenditure under this sub-head, particularly on buildings.  Last year the original Vote of £480,000 was supplemented by a further provision of £80,000 and the total of £560,000 was fully spent; this expenditure was the highest since 1939/40 and was exceeded only in that and the three preceding years.  This year a still higher target is aimed at and the sub-head shows an increase of £55,000.  The amount sought, £615,000, represents almost one-third of the net Estimate for Lands.  The improvement works, however, not only form an essential part of land settlement operations but also provide a substantial amount of employment in the congested districts.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K&mdash;£500: Sub-head K provides for deficiencies which arise when State claims are met in land bonds at the full nominal value of bonds which are sold at a discount.  Last year a few large claims met in this way necessitated an exceptional provision of £2,000 under the sub-head.  The Estimate of £500 for the current year therefore shows a reduction of £1,500.  As Deputies are aware, the Land (No. 2) <Col N="2079" /> Bill, 1952, now before the Seanad, is designed to secure that future series of land bonds will remain at or near par for a reasonable time after their creation.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N&mdash;£5,840: An increase of £5,532 in the capital sums to be advanced for the establishment of funds for the maintenance of embankments and other works is provided for in sub-head N.  Expenditure under this sub-head is non-recurring and the requirements fluctuate from year to year.  Two important funds which are expected to be set up this year account for the increased provision.</P>
    <P>Sub-head Q&mdash;1,300: Certain deficiencies in funds such as the Local Loans Fund and Land Bond Fund are made good out of sub-head Q.  These deficiencies arise on the termination of payments charged on lands taken over by the Land Commission and destined for such funds.  The payments terminated are replaced by new annuities on the lands.  The charge to sub-head Q is recurring and cumulative and an increase of £650 is expected this year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head R&mdash;£20,000: The sum of £20,000 provided last year under sub-head R, for the purchase of land at auctions and by private treaty, proved to be in excess of requirements and an estimated saving of £5,000 was deducted in connection with the Supplementary Estimate; this amount is being restored for the current year.  Last year 11 holdings containing 328 acres were purchased bringing the total since the passing of the Land Act, 1950, to 16 holdings containing 519 acres.  This source of land for Land Commission purposes is not proving as fruitful as originally expected.</P>
    <P>Sub-head S&mdash;£2,500: Sub-head S shows an increase of £500 over last year's net provision for the payment of gratuities to persons displaced from employment by Land Commission operations.  Gratuities amounting to £2,288 were paid last year to 18 ex-employees. From the passing of the Land Act, 1950, to the end of March, 1953, 50 persons had been awarded <Col N="2080" /> gratuities amounting to £5,904 which represents an average of £118 per person.  The determination of the amount of any such gratuity is an excepted matter reserved to the commissioners.</P>
    <P>Other sub-heads: The amounts being provided under the other sub-heads of the Vote vary, if at all, to a small extent from last year's figures.  As these sub-heads do not seem to call for any special comment at this stage, I shall pass on to deal, in a more general way, with the activities of the Land Commission for the completion of land purchase and land settlement.</P>
    <P>Vesting: With a view to accelerating the completion of land purchase by vesting in tenants and allottees, the Vesting Branches of the Land Commission were reorganised within the past seven years.  Holdings, allotments and rights of turbary vested in the meantime exceed 100,000 which represents almost half the total vesting output of the past 30 years.  As a result of this very creditable progress, the number of outstanding cases has been reduced to about 55,000 (including rights of turbary).  Unfortunately, a large percentage of these cases require rearrangement, improvement, or clarification of title and settlement of boundaries before vesting.  As the elimination of these obstacles will prove tedious, vesting cannot in future be expected to proceed with the same rapidity as in recent years.  Last year's vestings numbered more than 13,300, made up of 7,257 holdings, 4,315 parcels and 1,801 rights of turbary. For the current year it is expected that the vesting output will exceed 10,000 cases.</P>
    <P>Land Settlement, 1952/53: In the sphere of land settlement, the Land Commission are concentrating on the relief of congestion and particularly the rearrangement of intermixed holdings in the scheduled congested districts. With a view to making land available for these purposes, preliminary reports were obtained during the year ended 31st March last in respect of 42,000 acres of land while detailed inspections and valuations were made of 47,900 acres.  Inevitably, considerable areas proved to be unsuitable or unavailable <Col N="2081" /> for Land Commission purposes. Acquisition or resumption proceedings were initiated for 23,800 acres and at the end of the year the Land Commission had proceedings in respect of 61,000 acres.  During the year the Land Commission took over 28,800 acres of land for allotment purposes and allotted an area of 25,300 acres to over 1,700 allottees.  Of these 1,700 allottees about 1,000 were smallholders who had their holdings improved by enlargement and a further 400 tenants had their holdings rearranged and enlarged into compact working units.  An additional 144 were migrated to new holdings in non-congested areas.  Thus during the past year some 1,500 congests were provided for.  Were it not for the inability of some contractors to complete buildings before the end of the financial year and the last-minute refusal of certain selected tenants to migrate, a further 47 holdings comprising about 2,000 acres would have been allotted to migrants last year; most of these have since been allotted.</P>
    <P>Migration is a difficult and slow process but it is an essential feature of land settlement as there is little untenanted land left in the congested districts for the enlargement of the smallholdings there.  The solution of the problem in the congested districts lies therefore in the acquisition of land in non-congested areas, the striping of the land into economic holdings, the equipment of each holding with a dwelling, out-offices, fences, water-supply, access, the migration of tenants from the congested districts to such holdings and finally the utilisation of the migrants' surrendered lands for the enlargement and rearrangement of adjacent smallholdings, which, in turn, generally require improvement of buildings, etc.  None of these stages can be speedily completed; land acquisition has to proceed under statutory provisions with due allowance for objections and appeals.  The circumstances of uneconomic holders and others affected have to be carefully investigated.  Buildings take time to erect.  In fact, all stages of the work require competent and tactful handling from beginning to end. Inevitably, in the lay-out of any congested townland there are &ldquo;key&rdquo;<Col N="2082" /> holdings, the acquisition of which by the Land Commission would greatly facilitate rearrangement and give general satisfaction, but these holdings can only be secured by migration as a general rule.  Consequently, before migrants are selected from an area, it is necessary to establish which are the &ldquo;key&rdquo; holdings and this entails careful inquiry as well as the framing of tentative proposals to discover how resettlement can best be effected.  If the tenant of a &ldquo;key&rdquo; holding is willing to migrate, well and good, but if he is unwilling, alternative selections may have to be made, involving the recasting of proposals and, unfortunately, this often leads to disappointments, misunderstandings, and unmerited criticism of the officials entrusted with this difficult work.</P>
    <P>In some congested townlands if the &ldquo;key&rdquo; holdings become available, conditions can be remedied simply by providing enlargements, without the need for rearrangements at all.  Where this is possible so much the better. The primary consideration in the selection of a migrant must therefore be the use which can be made of his surrendered lands but it will be obvious that the personal circumstances of the migrant and his family will also be of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>Sub-division: The principal cause of the acute congestion which exists in some areas is the excessive and uncontrolled sub-division of holdings which took place in the days of the landlords.  Not alone were small holdings sub-divided among members of families but individual fields were divided to give each member a portion of the good as well as the poor land.  Extreme sub-division resulted in the condition of unfenced intermixed plots known as rundale.  To prevent the creation of further congestion in this manner, the Land Commission were empowered to control the sub-division of holdings and this branch of the non-productive work of the Land Commission is of the utmost importance. Were control not carefully exercised, there would be the anomaly of the Land Commission relieving congestion at considerable expense while further congestion was being created without restraint.  In fact, if sub-division <Col N="2083" /> were unrestricted, holdings created for the relief of congestion could be broken up into several uneconomic or congested holdings which in turn would require enlargement and perhaps rearrangement.  By the judicious exercise of their power to refuse consent to sub-division, the Land Commission every year prevent the creation of many uneconomic holdings; it is essential that this control should be continued.  Applications for consent to sub-division in 3,289 cases were dealt with last year and 70 were refused.</P>
    <P>The position as regards the collection of annuities continues to be highly satisfactory.  The arrear at the 31st March last was £152,000 or .3 per cent. (point three of one per cent.) of the total amount collectable since 1953.</P>
    <P>Before passing from this review of the Land Commission activities, I should like to pay a tribute to the inspectorate staff.  A Land Commission inspector's job is no sinecure.  His duties are many and varied, requiring technical knowledge, skill, patience and tact.  He must be competent to value land, define boundaries, frame schemes of resettlement, plan and estimate for all types of improvement works and carry out delicate negotiations with cautious and often recalcitrant tenants.  His is the impossible task of trying to satisfy everybody. Anxiety to carry out his duties as effectively and satisfactorily as possible often leads to long hours of arduous work.  The good progress made by the Land Commission in the work I have outlined, is largely due to the ability and industry of the inspectors in the field.</P>
    <P>Deputies will realise from this brief survey that very satisfactory progress was made last year in all spheres of Land Commission activity.  Much still remains to be done for the relief of congestion and, for the current year, we all look forward to solid and sustained achievement.  The importance of the work needs no emphasis.  The necessary funds are provided in the Estimate which I now recommend to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the unavoidable absence of Deputy Blowick, I move <Col N="2084" /> that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.  I want to say first of all that I endorse the concluding remarks of the Minister with regard to the inspectorate staff.  It was a tribute I had intended to pay myself. I know that the outdoor staff of the Land Commission are a highly competent body of men, thoroughly reliable and trustworthy.  Frankly, I think that the division of whatever land is available in the country might be safely left in their hands.  However, I am afraid that the energy and the activity which the members of the outdoor staff put into their work have not been fully availed of by the Land Commission at headquarters.  Every day I am an eye-witness of these inspectors going around inspecting lands which are available for acquisition and reallocation. I have no doubt that the Land Commission files will prove that there are several thousand acres of land in this country lying derelict which could be in full production if given to suitable allottees.  In every county&mdash;I am talking about the West of Ireland; I am not acquainted with conditions in other parts of Ireland&mdash;there are several thousand acres of deserted or abandoned holdings&mdash;small, I admit&mdash;which could be taken over by the Land Commission and given to people who would be glad to have and to use them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate of the Department of Lands is one of the most important the House could consider because it affects vitally and intimately the three most serious evils the country is suffering from at present&mdash;emigration, unemployment and the high cost of living. It has a very definite bearing on these three matters.  Every year we have young people emigrating from the West, men who would make excellent farmers if given a chance but who see no hope of ever becoming holders of lands, men who were born, bred, reared and trained on the farm.  When it comes to the point at which one member of the family wishes to marry, the others must get out, and no matter how we may bend our energies here to developing the secondary industries, until we place the maximum number of people on the land we are labouring in <Col N="2085" /> vain.  I do not want it to be understood from that that I decry or belittle in any way the importance of developing the manufacturing arm, but it is not the way to begin.  You must begin with the land and place the maximum number of people on it.  You must build up production, and in order to do that you must give a man an interest in his own holding and let him throw his energies into it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned here recently that I thought it a pity that this country would not adopt the system in operation in Denmark.  I understand that, in Denmark, if a man wants to settle down on land, he goes to the appropriate Government Department and says: &ldquo;I am anxious to marry, to settle down and make my livelihood on land. Will you provide me with a holding?&rdquo; They have a panel of holdings from which a man may make a selection and he repays an annuity over 50 or 60 years.  He settles down and becomes a good husbandman and an asset to the country.  Should we not operate in this country something on a similar basis, enabling a man to go into the local Land Commission office and select his holding from a panel of holdings available there&mdash;and the land is available if the Land Commission would take it over&mdash;and repay the Land Commission over a long term? Is there not there one remedy, one solution of part of the problem of emigration?  The best possible type of people you can have are the young farmers' sons who would settle down and become good citizens rather than emigrate to seek a livelihood elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister for the fact that that system does not operate, but it is a matter which I seriously suggest he and the Land Commission should consider, because I think there is there scope for dealing with this very important problem.  I am not suggesting that all farmers' sons would make good farmers&mdash;I refer to those who have an aptitude for it, those who have a liking for life on the land&mdash;and if one were to compute the amount of food that would have been produced by the number of farmers' sons who have emigrated in past years, <Col N="2086" /> one would realise how much the country is losing through the loss of these people.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission would be wise to get notice of intentions to sell in advance.  I do not suggest that I want any interference with the private sale, with free sale by a farmer of his land, but it would be desirable where it is the intention of a farmer to dispose of his land that he should indicate, in the first instance, to the Land Commission his intention to do so, because I know of many cases where lands were offered for sale which would have been very useful and necessary for the Land Commission had the Land Commission known in advance that these lands were to be sold.  While it might be a dangerous precedent to establish to make it a condition that anybody intending to dispose of his land should acquaint the Land Commission, it would be very desirable if, without bringing any force to bear, the Land Commission would indicate generally that they would wish to know in advance from any farmer who intends to sell his land.</P>
    <P>I can readily understand the reluctance on the part of some farmers to give this indication, because I do not deny that in the past the Land Commission paid very poor compensation for land.  In some cases it was more like confiscation than compensation, but those were the days when land was not as valuable as it is now.  I do know, however, that efforts are being made to frustrate the Land Commission in the acquisition of land. In some cases, the Land Commission negotiated for the acquisition of land and found on appeal that they could not acquire it and subsequently these lands were disposed of, to the great disappointment of local congests.  The machinery does not work well for the reason that, when a man appeals against the decision of the Land Commission is not represented at the appeal, so that the appellant can put forward excuses and objections which are not always accurate.</P>
    <P>To illustrate what I mean, I know an instance in which the Land Commission proposed to acquire 50 per cent. of a man's holding.  He appealed <Col N="2087" /> against that decision, and, when the appeal was heard, he alleged that the particular portion the Land Commission proposed to acquire contained the only source of water supply on the land.  That was not a fact at all, but it was accepted by the Appeal Tribunal, and the appeal was upheld.  Would that not be a case where the Land Commission would be entitled to be represented by an inspector acquainted with the holding to refute a suggestion of that kind?  It is most unfair, or, at any rate, unwise, that only one party to a dispute should be heard, and it is a matter that will have to be put right.</P>
    <P>We know, too, that fictitious values have been put on land by the Appeal Tribunal.  The result is that the Appeal Tribunal fixes a price which the Land Commission is not prepared to pay and they withdraw proceedings. If these things are permitted to continue I do not see much hope of the Land Commission acquiring land.  Even where the Land Commission has come to a decision to acquire land, the owner promptly puts his land up for sale by public auction, obviously with two objects in view: he either hopes to get a fictitious value placed on his land since he knows quite well the land cannot be sold, but he hopes to get a very high value placed on it so that when he goes before the court the court will accept that as evidence of the market value of the land and will fix a price which the Land Commission cannot afford to pay and they will withdraw proceedings.  Therefore, he has two chances: he will either get abnormally high compensation or proceedings will be withdrawn and he will be left his land.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is very disheartening to the outdoor staff of the Land Commission, who are genuinely anxious to settle this problem, to be defeated of their object in that way and frankly I sympathise with them in their efforts. I am sure the Land Commission must be fully aware of the artifices that are being resorted to and I think it is high time steps were taken to combat such artifices for otherwise there is very little hope for these people who have been waiting in many cases for years <Col N="2088" /> and years for the acquisition of land so that they may be relieved of congestion.</P>
    <P>I have heard long debates here as to what constitutes an economic holding. I do not think we will ever be in a position to say what an economic holding is because varying factors have to be taken into consideration and much depends upon the type of agriculture pursued.  A small holding will suffice for one particular farmer.  Another farmer will want a much larger tract of land.  In the vicinity of a town a man may be able to make a relatively good living out of a very small holding.  In a remote district he may find it very difficult to eke out a livelihood.  The size of an economic holding is not important.  What is important is the placing on the land of the maximum number of people and wherever and whenever that can be done it should be done.  There is no reasonable hope of settling the land problem in the congested areas within the congested areas although much can be done to relieve the situation by utilising the deserted holdings to which I have already referred.  Much could be done to enlarge and rearrange holdings in that connection but there is not enough land available to solve the problem in its entirety.  I have no doubt that with the increased compensation which the Land Commission is now paying, a considerable amount of land could be acquired in the congested areas.  I do not stand for one moment, nor does any member of my Party, for the victimisation of any landholder in any way.  I believe the man from whom land is taken should get the full market value for that land.  That is his right.  Even if the Land Commission or the taxpayers were to lose on the resale price of that land&mdash;lose to a considerable extent&mdash;in the national interest it would still be a good investment. Any man from whom land is taken by the Land Commission is entitled to its full value.</P>
    <P>I believe a reasonable amount of land is sufficient for anyone.  It is not a good practice to take a man from a tiny holding and put him into a very large one.  A man can be completely swamped like that.  Many people think <Col N="2089" /> that no training is needed for living on the land.  That is one of the greatest fallacies ever propounded.  A man working on the land is learning every day and will continue to learn as long as he remains on the land. There is always something new to be learned on the land.  Believing that the one with the least brains is the one to put on the land is the greatest mistake that can be made.</P>
    <P>Where there is a townland with a large number of congests and one or two comparatively large landowners, the Land Commission inspectors should approach these large landholders and ask them to migrate to a better holding elsewhere so that their lands can be utilised for the relief of local congestion. Those who have been accustomed to working fairly large holdings will be able to work larger holdings elsewhere.  It is a mistake to take the man with £10 valuation in the West of Ireland and put him into County Meath on a £100 valuation holding. That achieves no purpose.  Indeed, I doubt if such a man would be able to make a livelihood.  I believe the best solution is to get the larger farmers in the congested areas to migrate and divide their lands for the relief of local congestion.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission has acquired land there is very often a long delay before the land is allocated.  I can understand delay in the acquisition of land because questions of title are involved.  I can understand that matters like that require the greatest care and the widest possible search.  But when the Land Commission has acquired land, is there any justification for the Land Commission turning itself into a landlord and letting that land out in conacre for eight, ten or 12 years at fabulous rents?  That is one thing I cannot understand at all.  I know the Land Commission to hold land for 17 years in my county.  I know land in my county that has been held for 12 years and the local congests are waiting all the time.</P>

      <P>At a good price, £5 per acre.  If they buy their meadow at £10 <Col N="2090" /> an acre, they have to graze the lighter cattle at £5 an acre and the heavier cattle at £7 an acre.  They are paying a very good rent to the Land Commission. I can only see one reason for it, whether I am right or wrong, and that is that the Land Commission would lose money on the allocation of this land and they, therefore, hold the land for this period in order to lessen the loss.  If that is not the reason I do not know what is, and if it is the reason I do not agree with it.  If the land was allocated a man would pay a rent for it and the amount he would pay to the Land Commission for the grazing of two cattle would more than pay the rent for any additional land he would get.  The one acre of meadow which he buys from the Land Commission will cost him more than any additional land he will get.  I cannot see how the Land Commission in that particular matter can claim to be anything better than the much defamed landlord of old.</P>
      <P>I also found that in many cases when the Land Commission acquired land they said it would be provided with a water supply but they did not say when.  In many parts of my county the people got land but it was land without water.  Land without water is not of any use.  If a man has to cart water, seven, eight or ten miles to his cattle, or if he has to drive cattle that distance, land is not of much value to him.  I understand that some time ago the Land Commission realised the seriousness of this and provided themselves with up-to-date equipment for the boring of pumps or wells.  In fact, I understand that they interviewed some applicants to work that machinery.  What has become of that?</P>

      <P>There are none operating in the West anyway.  It is absolutely essential that there should be a water <Col N="2091" /> supply convenient to the land.  In parts of my county practically the whole summer is wasted with people having to bring water to their cattle.  Much store has been set by the Minister and by other Ministers, too, on the rapidity with which vesting is proceeding.  From the ordinary landholder's point of view that is not of vital importance to them at all.  It is not a thing to which they pay particular attention. What is important is that once a tenant becomes vested the Land Commission finishes all responsibility for him.  Matters which should have been attended to by the Land Commission and which are not attended to before investment cannot be attended to at all.</P>
      <P>I understand that the staff is being augmented to deal with vesting.  If they concentrated their efforts on the more speedy acquisition and allocation of land when required it would be of far greater service to the community. I appreciate, of course, the importance of making a tenant the vested tenant but for ordinary everyday purposes it is not an important matter.  What is important is to place the people on the land.  I would ask the Minister to have the Land Commission examine and deal with what must be almost endless numbers of holdings which are being worked by nobody except the local neighbour who might happen to have them on the 11-month system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether members of the House realise exactly what I am talking about.  Let me make myself very clear.  Where a man for economic reasons finds that he cannot make a living on his land and emigrates to England or even to America for two, three, four or five years to accumulate a bit of capital in order to work his holding more efficiently I do not suggest that the Land Commission should come along and acquire his land.  I would be opposed to any such suggestion. I am talking about the holders of land where the owners have been forgotten. There are many such where nobody can precisely say who was the last real owner of that land.  Such holdings should be dealt with as readily as possible.  I know what the view of the Land Commission may be.  They <Col N="2092" /> may say: &ldquo;It is so small that it would not make any difference.&rdquo;  I grant you that the individual holdings are small, but small as they are they could be turned to use and the cumulative size of them is by no means small.  It would reach a very big total in acreage.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to get his Department to look into that question.</P>
    <P>I would also ask him to insist upon the Land Commission abandoning the idea of holding land over a considerable period.  Once they have acquired the land and are in complete possession of it they should immediately set about dividing it.  If a system could be devised whereby intending vendors of holdings of land would indicate in advance their intention, I think that the task of the Land Commission which, I admit, is very difficult and oftentimes impossible, might be lighter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Finan has hardly given a real justification for referring this Estimate back.  He was critical of the Land Commission. Every normal person is critical of the Land Commission no matter what Government is in power.  Deputy Finan talked a lot of sense, but he also indulged in a lot of vague generalities which appeared to me to be out of touch with reality.  For example, he said that every farmer's son who wishes to be a farmer and who wants land should walk into the local office of the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say every farmer's son.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the implication, that every farmer's son should do so.  I suppose if one son on a farm went looking for land all the sons would do likewise.  In the same way, I do not think you could rule out an agricultural worker's son, and so you would have a very large number of people applying to the Land Commission for land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question is how to satisfy the demand and provide the necessary quantity of land.  The Land Commission do not make land, unfortunately. <Col N="2093" /> Perhaps in some cases they tend to unmake it, but certainly they do not create land, and they have no source from which to obtain land except by acquiring it from individual owners throughout the length and breadth of the country.  There is not one patch of land, one acre of land, in the country that does not legally belong to somebody and the Land Commission have to find that somebody and acquire the land from them.  The matter is not as simple as Deputy Finan has suggested. He made the matter even more complicated by suggesting that, while everybody who is entitled to land and in need of land should get it, he is not concerned so much about the size of the holding.  Surely, if you have a limited amount of land and an almost unlimited number of applicants, you must be concerned, to a certain extent, about the size of the holding, because the policy that would suggest itself to the Land Commission is that if they want to supply the greatest number out of a limited area of land they must find the minimum and not the maximum amount of land that a family can live on.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the problem is not one of suggesting how much land a person may be able to work, but rather what is the least amount that it is worth while to give to a family to set it up.  That is the question that has to be resolved.  I believe that the Land Commission should go cautiously in this matter.  It would be a dangerous thing if they were greatly to enlarge the minimum in order to satisfy certain demands, and then find that they were only able to supply a lesser number of people.  I think that the minimum size of a holding is that which a family can make a living out of by working it as efficiently as possible. It does not really matter where the farm is situated.  If a family is going to live on a comparatively small holding, it must work the land intensively. Intensive work means extensive tillage and the raising and feeding of the maximum number of live stock on the farm.</P>
    <P>I have not any serious criticism to make of the Land Commission in <Col N="2094" /> regard to the size of the holdings which they are allocating.  I have a good deal of praise for the Land Commission in regard to the kind of homesteads which they are creating.  They are building good houses and providing reasonably good out-offices.  People, of course, will always complain that things are not perfect, but if a man were to attempt to build the same house himself and provide out-offices he, I think, would not be so hard to please if he had got to do it himself. So far as that is concerned, I think rather decent homesteads are being provided by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The size of the holdings is a matter about which there could be a lot of discussion.  I think that what we have to aim at, as the guiding factor, is the minimum number of acres that a family can live on and make a lecent living out of by working that land intensively.  I would say that, if land is reasonably good, 25 or 30 acres would provide a decent living for a family, provided the members of it are industrious.</P>
    <P>I think that the real criticism of the Land Commission is not the quality of the work they are doing but, perhaps, the quantity.  The Land Commission, as we know, is both a judicial and an administrative body, and I suppose it is difficult to disentangle its administrative from its judicial functions. A body that tries to be judicial is not always the best from the administrative point of view.  For example, if the members of the Supreme Court were to take over the management of an extensive business in this city I do not know that they would be able to run it very efficiently. Therefore, if a body like the Land Commission tries to perform judicial functions and at the same time tries to do administrative work, it is, at least, likely to go slow.  I think what is really needed in the Land Commission is more drive, more speed and more energy.  You want somebody, for example, of the type of the managing director of the Irish Sugar Company, someone with vigour, vision and determination, somebody who is determined to see that every bit of waste and derelict land in the country is acquired <Col N="2095" /> and utilised to create a number of decent holdings out of which deserving people may be enabled to make a living.</P>
    <P>There should not, I think, be any question in regard to the area of land to be acquired.  No holding that is derelict or waste should be passed over because it is small.  Neither should it be passed over because it appears to be too large to handle.  Any land that is neglected, or is waste, or that has been sub-let for a number of years, and that, perhaps, has been inefficiently managed, is a dead loss to the nation.  I know of one farm in the Minister's constituency which has been sub-let for 50 years.  People in the parish do not know for certain the particular family that owns it.  It is a comparatively small farm, but the fact is that it would either provide a decent holding for one migrant or one family or a couple of parcels of land for adjoining small uneconomic holders. So far nothing has been done about it.  I suppose the Land Commission are investigating quite a number of similar holdings, but their investigations take a long time.  I think they ought to realise that while, I suppose, time is unlimited, it is always a little later than we think.  The nation's population is dwindling and dwindling rapidly as far as the rural areas are concerned.</P>
    <P>The creation of decent homesteads on land which is, to a great extent, waste is the most urgent problem of the present time.  The Land Commission set out as their policy the acquisition and division of land amongst uneconomic holders, but they seem to specify that the personality or the individuality or the quality of the applicants is not a matter of great importance.  It is thought that the real matter of importance is whether the applicant's holding is uneconomic or not.  I do not think that is entirely desirable.  The attitude of the applicant for the land, his efficiency in the management of the land he possesses and his general qualifications to make a good farmer are matters that ought to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>I suggested last year and I would <Col N="2096" /> like to repeat the suggestion, that there ought to be a certain pool of land provided by the Land Commission as a reward for young men who prove their efficiency in farming operations, young men who take advantage of modern technical training and education in agriculture and who by their qualifications make themselves desirable holders of land.  If a number of those young men with such high qualifications were given holdings by the Land Commission, not perhaps as complete owners but if holdings were leased to them so that they could prove that they were good farmers, I think that would be a step in the right direction.  These established holdings would become in their areas model farms and the young men would be setting a headline for other farmers in the district.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission sets out to divide very large holdings into economic holdings with houses erected on them.  That policy provides parcels of land in the neighbourhood for people who have uneconomic holdings.  However, while the Land Commission are creating more and more economic holdings, at the other end of the scale economic holdings are disappearing always.  One farmer will acquire one, two or three holdings to add on to his own and the result is that the work of the Land Commission in creating new holdings is being undone.  It happens in many parts of the country, including places where the land is not of the highest quality.  One individual will acquire an additional holding, then another and another until he has accumulated a very large amount of land. That, I suppose, is inevitable as long as we have complete freedom of ownership and freedom of sale, but the effect of it is that homesteads disappear.  I have seen houses built by the Land Commission 30 years ago steadily falling into ruin by reason of the fact that the holdings, having become vested, were purchased by a person living outside the country.  In the same way I have seen homesteads and dwelling-houses that have been reconstructed since reconstruction grants became available, becoming unoccupied and falling into ruin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2097" /> That is not a state of affairs that should be allowed to continue.  The Land Commission should take action in that regard.  As far as land that is acquired and distributed by the Land Commission and not yet vested is concerned, the Land Commission have very definite functions.  They can prevent the house from being unoccupied and they can prevent the land from being sub-let.  Where land is vested in the tenant-owner, the Land Commission has no function at all.  Sooner or later this nation will have to consider the Land Commission as having some function in that respect.</P>
    <P>In a general way, of course, they have a function there because they can acquire any land which is being continuously sub-let.  They should also have regard to the whole position of purchase and sale.  They do operate to prevent the sub-division of small holdings but they have never taken any action in regard to the merger of a number of economic holdings or large holdings into one very large one. Sooner or later they will have to consider that aspect of the matter.  It is a depressing thing to travel through the country and see what are known as non-residential holdings and holdings upon which the homesteads are being allowed to fall into ruin.  You will find the walls around the houses and quite a number of the old boreens leading to the houses completely overgrown with weeds.  It is one of the most depressing sights in the country.  I do not think it exists in Denmark or in many of the continental countries.  It is really a matter of going all-out to deal with the problem, and it must be tackled soon.</P>
    <P>We hear people saying that the work of the Land Commission is drawing to a close, that all the land available has been sub-let or sub-divided and allocated.  I do not think that is entirely true.  There will always be arising problems for the Land Commission to deal with in regard to tenure, the size of holdings and the allocation of holdings.  We accept the general principle of security of tenure for the farmer.  That security of tenure is, of course, subject to the proviso that the land must not be <Col N="2098" /> abused.  There is the question of user that arises and the principle is accepted by people on all sides of the House.  Nobody will object to a farmer in temporary difficulty sub-letting his land for a short time.  Nobody objects to a widow, who has a farm on her hands, and whose family is not grown up to work it, sub-letting that land. However, when you have cases of holdings being continually sub-let for many years over a very long period and, in some cases, with no owners living in the district at all, I think it is the duty of the Land Commission to take steps to ensure that the maximum amount of use will be made of the land, the maximum output secured from it and the maximum amount of employment given on those holdings.  That is almost a permanent function of the Land Commission.  It is a problem that will be always there to be dealt with and most people would like to see the Land Commission dealing with it quickly, energetically and efficiently. There are bottlenecks or administrative delays.  They ought to be removed.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I should suggest it on this Estimate or not, but there is need for some progressive body which would acquire the poorer land that is to a considerable extent waste, requiring extensive reclamation. There should be some body to acquire such land, to determine the acreage that can be reclaimed for agricultural purposes and perhaps lease it to the energetic young men, the farmers of the future and turn the remainder over to the Forestry Division. That work requires to be done. Everywhere, particularly in Wicklow, the Forestry Division acquire holdings on which, in many cases, there are residences, holdings which have been worked as agricultural land for years. They plant, not only the hill portion, but a considerable amount of the agricultural land.  Some section of the Minister's Department or some body must fight the Forestry Division in regard to the user of land.  Inevitably, anybody in charge of the Forestry Division would like to plant as much of the land as possible, would like to plant the better type of land because there would be a better return from it <Col N="2099" /> and it probably could be done at less expense than the planting of mountain land.  It is not in the national interest. Timber is very valuable but not as valuable as ordinary agricultural crops, and it is not socially desirable that an acre of land which can be used to grow such crops should be turned over to timber.  The Minister must realise that he, or somebody else, must keep a close eye on this particular aspect of the matter.  Inevitably, having acquired a holding, the Forestry Division will tend to plant as much of it as they will be allowed.  By planting as much as possible of the better type of land they will have more to show at the end of the year.  They will have a bigger acreage under timber, and very probably the timber will do better on good land.  That is not the supreme consideration.  The supreme consideration is that land is used to the very best advantage and land that is suitable for agricultural purposes should not be allowed to be taken over by the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter on this particular Vote because either the Minister or somebody in the Land Commission must take it upon himself to watch this aspect of the matter and to see that land suitable for farming is not devoted to afforestation.</P>
    <P>Taking everything into consideration the Land Commission are doing a reasonably good job but I feel that they are not doing enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want, again, to raise my hardy annual, the problem with which I am faced in County Dublin, namely, Land Commission roads.  The Land Commission have a method of road making when they divide a holding. The county council will not take it over.  After two years, the Land Commission give a further grant, the land is vested and the tenants are left to do as best they can.  Could some co-ordinating machinery be devised whereby roads would be put into proper repair, say, handed over to the local authority to be kept in repair? In County Dublin a number of farmers are trying to get heavy machinery along a number of roads that are not <Col N="2100" /> suitable.  I have mentioned the matter frequently and have received very sympathetic consideration from the present Minister but he has no machinery at his disposal.  I raise this matter to ask if some co-ordinating machinery could be set up to deal with this very urgent matter.</P>
      <P>Only this morning I received another letter from a number of people who are living in an estate not very far from Dublin, the Nevinstown, Cloghran area.  There is a very bad road into that land.  It is one of the many roads to which I have already referred.  I could refer to many of them again but do not wish to go into them in detail.</P>
      <P>The solution to this problem is long overdue.  Although the rural improvements scheme is in operation it is very difficult sometimes to get people to carry out this work.  Five tenants may agree and the sixth may not agree to contribute to the repair of the road. I would be grateful if the Minister or his Department could find some way of dealing with the improvement of Land Commission roads.</P>
      <P>There is a problem in County Dublin which is not so acute in any other constituency.  It arises from the fact that there is a large number of conacre farmers in County Dublin.  The Minister and his Department are definitely doing a very good job in relieving uneconomic holdings.  In County Dublin there are men who have no land but who, from nine to 15 years, possibly, have been taking land on the conacre system.  They are not in a position to buy land and are just carrying on from month to month and year to year, buying machinery, tilling the land and paying heavy conacre rent.  When the Land Commission have acquired all the land that will be divided in the county a number of these people will be pushed out completely and their livelihoods will be gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem in getting the Land Commission to consider conacre farmers.  In making that suggestion I am travelling on rather dangerous ground.  I know that there is not very much land to be divided.  The Minister's first duty is to relieve, as far as possible, the uneconomic holders. <Col N="2101" /> Nevertheless, there is a problem in my constituency that very few Deputies have in their constituencies.  It arises from the number of reasonably successful farmers of the conacre type who are getting land from the owners of large estates.  Directly the Land Commission buy the holdings these men will find themselves without any land or any hope of buying land.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July, I decided that the indefinite continuation of the practice of engaging foreign conductors for very short term contracts would be bad for the orchestra and to the disadvantage of young Irish players.  Milan Horvat has now been engaged as principal conductor for a three year period from 25th August, 1953.  Owing to his obligations on the Continent he will conduct here for eight months only in each year <Col N="2104" /> during which periods his fee will be £250 a month.</P>
    <P>He will conduct the symphony orchestra and will also assist in the training of young Irish conductors. The position for an Irish assistant conductor, who will be permitted to travel for part of each year has already been advertised.  One of the assistant conductor's specific duties will be to foster the recruitment and advanced training of Irish musicians.  The engagement and dismissal of players is a matter for the administration.</P>
    <P>Mr. Horvat is of Yugoslav nationality. He has been for some years conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra in Zagreb and professor of orchestral conducting in the National Conservatoire of Zagreb and has conducted symphony orchestras in London, Paris, Warsaw, Vienna and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Mr. Horvat was here previously for three separate periods and is at present with us as a guest conductor. Because of the excellence of the performances under his direction, generously recognised by the musical public and his conspicuous enthusiasm and hard work I am satisfied that he is one of the most outstanding of our guest conductors and highly suitable for the task of building up an orchestra which will justify the assertion that we are a music-loving people.</P>
    <P>As a fee-paid person under a contract, a conductor's engagement is not subject to the provisions of the Civil Service Regulation Acts.  The situation of conductor has in any case been scheduled under the Acts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was found that the standard of demand for the personnel in St. Andrew Street Post Office varied very widely and rapidly.  There has been an increase in the staff to meet the position, but if the Deputy knows of any very recent complaints in regard to queues or any other difficulties I would be very glad if he would communicate with me, because I am given to understand that the number of persons coming there has now become fairly regular and staff is provided to meet the ordinary requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>At least five hatches are available for stamps, but my information is that only two people are attending at the counters in the evening and there is congestion there so that people have to walk out and go to Dame Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of persons attending at any particular time varies, but officers engaged in other duties are brought into the hatches when the number of persons increase and they can be brought in at very short notice. In all main post offices throughout the country hatches can be closed at certain times of the day.  Again I want to say that I am very anxious to provide the highest level of service in that <Col N="2106" /> very splendid post office and I would ask the Deputy to let me know of any recent complaints, because we have had none.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to question the Minister again as to the personnel of the consultative and advisory council. He agreed that not less than half should be nominated.  The Bill says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Not less than half of the persons who are appointed to be members of the National Health Council shall be appointed by the Minister on nominations of bodies which, in the opinion of the Minister, are representative of the medical and ancillary professions (including particular branches thereof) and of persons concerned with the management of voluntary hospitals.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On further discussion this morning, the question was mentioned by Deputy Kyne as to whether there would be trade union representation.  I then asked the Minister if that was proposed and the Minister, I think, agreed with that.  It was agreed that those representatives other than the medical and ancillary professions would be the elected voice of that particular representation. I have been looking through this amendment and the Principal Act in the interval.  The Minister said that would be the case, but I cannot find anything in this to substantiate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It says: &ldquo;Not less than half of the persons ... shall be ... representative of the medical and ancillary professions ....&rdquo; I do not say the Minister will do this, but there is nothing to stop him appointing as the other half Custom House officials. There is nothing in this to suggest that the other half of the council will be representative of anybody.  There does not seem to be brought out clearly here the idea Deputy Kyne mentioned regarding trade union officials.  I would think it desirable <Col N="2109" /> to have someone representative of business interests, possibly the chambers of commerce, and other societies might be represented also.  There is nothing in this amendment to show that that is the intended programme.</P>

      <P>The answer the Minister gave this morning, with the best will in the world, was those elected would be representative of the interest concerned.  There is nothing to guarantee that that will be so.  It brings us back to the point that we have not got a clear picture of the personnel of this body.  I place great stress on this council because, as I said this morning, I believe it will dispel all the friction there has been over the improvement of health services over the years here.  It is necessary to have a clear picture as to how it is going to be formed.  At present there is nothing to stop the Minister choosing Custom House officials.  The medical and ancillary professions and those associated with the voluntary hospitals will constitute one half.  The rest could be Custom House officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir, there is another point, if the Minister does not care to answer the last one.  Deputy Byrne raised it this morning also.  In discussing the question of the report to be issued by this advisory council, it was agreed that it would be made available to Deputies.  It would be possible to discuss it on the annual Estimate for Health, but that is only once a year.  An occasion may arise in between in which the council may have advised the Minister on a certain point and it may have come to the notice of certain Deputies that they considered that a good point.  Will it be possible for Deputies, if they raise this as a parliamentary question, to be referred back?  Can the Minister say he has no function in the matter, one way or another?  It should be possible to raise it in that way rather than wait until the Minister's Estimate comes around again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2110" /> If such is not the case, if the Minister does not see his way to accept this as being a reasonable proposition, it means that the Health Council could be in commission for a period of 12 months and we would have to wait for the result of their findings before the nation as a whole could develop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has any point like that, or if he thinks the Minister unreasonable, he has only to put down a question and ask if it is true that such and such an opinion was given by the consultative council and the Minister has not accepted it.  How can I say that is not my function?  It is my function to listen to the advice, though free to accept or reject it, and the reasons can be given in the Dáil. All these consultative councils have been chosen by the Minister, in all the years since the State was set up, and this is the very first time in the case of any consultative council over the last 30 years&mdash;there are 40 or 50 of them going now, so hundreds must have been set up in that time&mdash;that it was ever laid down that even half would be chosen by another person. If we are going half way, it is far enough for the present; let the Minister choose the other half.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 56:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 39 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 103 of the Principal Act is hereby amended:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the substitution of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Minister for Local Government&rdquo; in sub-section (1), and</P>
      <P>(b)  by the addition to the section of the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The amount standing at any particular time borrowed by a health authority under this section shall not exceed such sum as may be fixed in respect <Col N="2112" /> of that time for that health authority by an Order made by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Local Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Since the Department of Health was set up, in laying down the division of the two Departments, Local Government and Health, certain powers were given to the Minister for Health and certain powers were retained by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>Amongst the powers retained was the power of borrowing, which was retained entirely by the Minister for Local Government.  Since then, of course, we have had time to consider the matter and both the Minister for Local Government and I agree that the sanctioning of borrowing for any particular item should be within the power of the Minister for Health, as he knows more about what a particular item may be and what the justification for it is.  On the other hand, it would perhaps be dangerous to have two Ministers with power to authorise unlimited borrowing by the local authority.  The compromise in this is that the Minister for Health must consult the Minister for Local Government in regard to the total amount of borrowing allowed to any local authority, but within that total the Minister for Health would have complete freedom with regard to the sanctioning of any particular project.</P>

      <P>I think that in theory and, I should say, in practice up to this, the Minister for Local Government is regarded as the Minister who keeps an eye on the general finances of the local authority. He deals with all these things with regard to rating, and so forth.  He is supposed to watch the total indebtedness of the local council and, where necessary, to draw their attention that they are going too high.  That principle is maintained&mdash;the principle that the Minister for Local Government should watch the general situation of the council.  He would then have to agree with the Minister for Health with regard to the total burden that might be permitted for health purposes. I suppose that, logically, Deputy Dr. Browne is right in saying that the Minister for Local Government should consult the Minister for Health with regard to borrowing for local government purposes.  The Minister for Local Government being there all the time as the guardian of local authorities in this respect, we think that perhaps that should remain.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 64:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 41 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A health authority shall, upon the coming into operation of any section of this Act, establish a health committee which shall perform such functions in respect of the provisions of this Act as the health authority may from time to time delegate to it.</P>
      <P>(2)  A health committee appointed under the preceding sub-section shall consist of the county manager, the medical officer of health for the county; the county surgeon; the matron of the county hospital and not less than eight members of the council of the county.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's introductory speech on the Second Reading of this Bill, when explaining the approach to the question of devising an improved health scheme, the Minister dwelt very strongly on what he regarded as one of the outstanding features of the Government's scheme as embodied in the present Bill&mdash;that is, that the machinery to operate the Bill had been selected by the Government in the form of the democratic machinery of local government and that it was through that democratic machinery that it was proposed to operate the provisions of the Bill, when it became law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to clothe the Minister's words in flesh and to give to what is, in effect, the only democratic form of local government&mdash;namely, the elected members of local authorities&mdash;the machinery not to <Col N="2115" /> operate in detail the provisions of the Bill but to control and direct its general operation.</P>
    <P>For that purpose, the amendment proposes that a health authority shall, upon the coming into operation of any section of this Act, establish a health committee which shall perform such functions in respect of the provisions of this Act as the health authority may from time to time delegate to it.  The amendment then goes on to indicate the manner in which the health committee shall be appointed:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A health committee appointed under the preceding sub-section shall consist of the county manager, the medical officer of health for the county, the county surgeon, the matron of the county hospital and not less than eight members of the council of the county.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the health code, two factors, to our minds, arise. The first factor is that, no matter how good a code of health legislation may be, if it is to operate for the utmost benefit of the citizens, it must have a humane atmosphere and it must be removed as far as possible from what we generally regard as the cold-blooded routine approach of permanent officials.</P>
    <P>It is true that, in local government, as far as the localities are concerned, we have two divisions of authority. We have the county manager, with the powers given to him by the Managerial Act, and we have the elected representatives. The general experience is that, in so far as the functioning of local government is concerned, from the point of view of the ratepayers and the citizens, the closest and the most direct approach between the citizens and the ratepayers is that between them and their elected representatives. While accepting, for the sake of argument, the argument in favour of the retention of the county manager, it still remains that the purpose of the county manager is to ensure efficient administration, but that the purpose of the elected representatives is to afford the ratepayers and the citizens in their localities control and direction over their own system of <Col N="2116" /> local government.  That is given expression to in the form that the final control is vested in the elected representatives in so far as they have the power to raise the necessary finance through rates.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, we are setting out to amplify in many directions the existing health services of the country.  Many of the services are new altogether. Much of the machinery proposed has not hitherto been utilised in this country.  This machinery, if it is successful, will, in time, come to play a very important part in the ordinary life of the people of the country.  It seems to us essential, even from the point of view of the Minister and the Government, to ensure that that machinery devised by the Government and passed by Dáil Éireann is used for the purpose behind it&mdash;to benefit the citizens and to improve their health standards&mdash;and that, in the local health councils, there should be those elements of Local Government whose primary concern is not so much with merely efficient administration, not so much with merely conforming to regulations and the dictates coming either from the Department of Local Government or the Department of Health but that the ratepayers and the individuals who constitute the families in the locality will be afforded the utmost benefits that can flow from this new machine.  That is, in fact, the purpose of the amendment&mdash;to make available, and enlist behind the whole purpose of the Bill, the active and the intelligent and the local initiative of the elected local government representatives of the citizens so that the general application of the health measures being devised in this Bill and in conformity with the regulations made by the Minister from time to time will so operate under the direction and control of the elected representatives that the ordinary people will receive the utmost value.</P>
    <P>If the whole administration of the health scheme is to be left completely in the hands of officials, many of us have this experience&mdash;I have repeatedly defended both local and central officials in this House and I am not proposing now to criticise them&mdash;that no matter <Col N="2117" /> how good the official is there is always the difficulty that he is still an official and there is a world of difference in many cases between his approach to the human needs of the ordinary citizen and that of the men or women who regard themselves as the elected representatives of the citizens and who have a direct responsibility to the individual citizens.</P>
    <P>So far as the practical nature of the amendment is concerned, it is confined, first of all, by the fact that the powers of the health committee are to be such as are given to it by the health authority and, therefore, the whole council in a particular area will in the first instance determine exactly within what limits the health committee should operate and to what extent authority should be delegated by them.  Secondly, the health committee will combine in itself all the elements of local government from the county manager down through the medical officer and including the elected representatives, and they will all go to constitute the actual functional part of the local machinery.  A noteworthy feature is that in the formation of the health committee a majority of the members are to be members of the council and you, therefore, retain the control which the elected representatives of the citizens should have, in our opinion, both on the council and on the health committee.</P>
    <P>If the Minister will consider the matter from the point of view of ensuring that, not merely will central machinery be available for the operation of the Bill, not merely will local machinery in the person of the county manager and the medical officer be available, but, more important still, that tied into the whole machinery of the Bill will be control directly by the representatives of the citizens who have got, in the last resort, the greatest concern, the greatest interest and the greatest need for making the machinery in the Bill a success, then I think he will find, as he said in his Second Reading speech, that if we are to operate a satisfactory health scheme it is essential that it be based upon a democratic organ of local government, <Col N="2118" /> and the only democratic organ is that composed of elected representatives, and not the county manager or the other officials. The test is applied so far as this amendment is concerned, and I trust the Minister will see his way to accept it and, therefore, add what, in our opinion, would be a valuable adjunct to the machinery already set out in the Bill as drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I look on the matter very differently from Deputy Larkin.  To commence with, I look upon the law as it is there at the moment, and the law as it will be affected when this Bill is passed.  It gives the local authority certain powers and puts certain obligations on them to provide facilities of all kinds for various classes of the population.  They also have the obligation, of course, of looking after public health and these other health functions applicable to a local authority.  It is the local authority, that is the county council composed of the elected representatives, who have all these powers.  The county manager has certain executive functions it is true, and the county council may delegate certain other functions to the county manager if they so wish.  But, in the administration, the policy to be pursued, and all these other matters, it is the elected members of the county council who will have the say.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to leave to the county council with its full membership all matters of that kind.  At the moment the county councils are carrying out all the health functions and I believe a good part of the time of council meetings is devoted to health matters.  That will continue when the Bill goes through; in fact more time may be given to them.  I think every member of the county council would like to be present when these things are discussed and that they would not like to delegate any part of their functions to a committee composed of members and some officials as set out in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing an amendment, No. 66, but that provides for an advisory committee to advise the <Col N="2119" /> county manager in whatever executive functions he may be asked to perform. I would ask Deputy Larkin to consider whether it is not a better proposition to leave all the policy and all the big administrative details of our health scheme to the full council.  They may hand over to the county manager executive functions, and there will be a small committee to advise the county manager on these particular executive functions.  The composition of the committee is much the same in both cases.  There is no great difference, except perhaps that in my case there are fewer public representatives proportionately than is proposed in the Deputy's amendment.  That is a matter that can be made right if the Dáil feels very strongly about it.</P>
    <P>I am advocating that the scheme outlined by me, both in this section and in the amendment put down by me, of leaving all policy to the full council and the executive functions to the county manager, as delegated by the full council and carried out on the advice of a committee of this kind, is better than what appears to me to be going back somewhat to the old system of the board of health which was found on the whole to be impracticable.  It may be that the board of health system was a good system, but it was found at the time to be impracticable and all health matters went back to the full council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very high regard, generally speaking, for the civil servants.  It is not necessary to go into it, but I think they did very fine work in this country in many spheres.  I do, however, agree very much with the views put forward by Deputy Larkin.  From my own limited experience of a local authority, particularly a local authority responsible to a large population such as you have in large cities, I feel that the great danger is that the ratepayer or the citizen is dealt with by a very minor official of the local authority who is, in turn, responsible to a more senior official, and so on, the result being that the members of local authorities who deal with the public tend to be very limited in the authority they have. <Col N="2120" /> There is the danger that officials dealing with members of the public in these matters may be less human and rather harsh on account of the system under which they operate than, say, somebody who has wider powers.</P>
      <P>I have noticed again and again that the really principal function which members of a local authority fulfil is to add the human touch to these problems. Where a system is administered by the county manager and rules and regulations laid down and passed through a series of officials, it does often mean that the minor official who eventually deals with the public does so in a rather harsh and inhuman way. I see the point of the Minister's amendment that the members of a local authority, as a body, should be, as far as possible, associated with the working of sections such as we are discussing, but I think where you have a local authority with a vast amount of work to do&mdash;and that work is increasing out of all proportion to their resources&mdash;it is not possible for each member to be in contact with all the details of the different types of schemes for which the local authority is responsible.</P>
      <P>I feel that these committees of local authorities dealing with big matters like health and housing, are not really practical on account of the many other committees which members have to attend.  That is why I feel that the suggestion of Deputy Larkin, that there should be a small number of members of the local authorities who would be associated with the experts in medical and administrative ways, would mean you would have a group of people in much more intimate touch with the actual working of the scheme.</P>
      <P>There is a danger in local authorities where the manager has such responsibilities that most of the decisions are already made before they come before the manager, and that the ordinary members would have to delve through a long series of regulations and Acts and negotiations and so on, to get down to the human side of all this. I think, certainly so far as the larger group is concerned, the suggestion put forward by Deputy Larkin is the more practicable one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's method of debating is very clever.  I asked for machinery to ensure that the elected members of the local authority would have an opportunity of dealing with this problem of health and he meets me by saying: is it not far better, Deputy Larkin, to ensure that all members of the local authority are in that position?  In other words, he offers me perfection.  That is true in theory but not in practice.  It just does not work out that way.  If you have a good official, he is good and if you have a bad official he is a terrible pain in the head, and when you have a bad official under the present system there is no remedy.</P>
      <P>Whatever may be the argument in favour of leaving the interests of the ratepayers and the citizens in the hands of the manager and his officers so far as the whole range of local government activities is concerned, I do not think anybody in this House will argue that that should be the position in regard to health where one of the most important factors is the human approach.</P>
      <P>I am not a member of a local authority but I do know that in Dublin where we have a very excellent city manager, so far as he is personally concerned, and many good officers, that where we want to deal with the problem of one man or one woman, and we go to the top, we find that the top is too high.  They are not even aware of the mass of the citizens. When we go to a lower official, we find he is so near to the mass that he is afraid to do anything.  Time after time, the only way you will get things done is to go to a member of the corporation and get him to act as an intermediary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that happens outside Dublin, too.  It is even more important from the public health point of view, in so far as all the members of the health authority desire to interest themselves and concern themselves in connection with policy and broad administrative questions.  It will be the members of the health authority who will define the powers and functions of the committee. They can limit the committee very strictly or give it an unlimited <Col N="2122" /> field, and that will meet the question as to whether or not members find it possible to interest themselves or concern themselves in the multifarious questions now devolving upon them.  If they want to place the whole field of administration and policy in the hands of the health committee they can do it in defining the functions of the health committee.  If they find they cannot devote, individually, time&mdash;particularly where this expanded health system is coming into operation&mdash;they can hand over the majority of functions to the health committee.  They will be handing over not merely to their own colleagues but to people who will be experts in a sense on such questions.</P>
    <P>I cannot find anything in the amendment of the Minister to justify his rejection of my amendment.  His other suggestion is that I would accept the position as being met in regard to amendment No. 66.  But amendment No. 66 merely proposes to set up the committee to advise the county manager.  There is no indication as to whether the county manager is bound to accept that advice.  There is no indication whether he is even bound to give information on which they can base advice.  Again, it is a question that where you have a good manager there is no difficulty in working with him, and where you have a bad manager the whole system of democratic local government becomes impaired. All of us have experience of both sides.  That is why I am more impressed with the approach in our amendment rather than that of the Minister.  The argument is in favour of a type of machinery as proposed in my amendment rather than that of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The other question is the rough division of functions between the manager and the council.  At the moment the city manager concerns himself with executive functions, but it is executive functions that bring policy through a scheme of administration and bring it actually into the individual lives of the people who are going to benefit from the scheme.  A decision by the health authority on some question of policy or the application of services set out in the Bill has <Col N="2123" /> no effect on the individual ratepayer or on members of a family.  It is merely on paper.  But it is when that decision is translated into actual care or attention or service that the manner in which it was reached makes it of particular importance not merely in the eyes of the individual who has to have recourse to the service, but equally in the eyes of the elected representatives. I am particularly concerned that the elected representatives of the people will be directly associated with the function of ensuring that this health legislation has that human approach which is the basis of successful functioning of any kind of health legislation. If we remove that, we might as well do without health legislation altogether.</P>
    <P>I feel it is necessary to ensure that the machinery and the members who staff the machinery from the county manager down are at least kept in contact with the more human or, if you like, the broader forms of the social and health legislation.  It is an entirely different position from that of an advisory committee who may find themselves faced with difficulties in obtaining the requisite information to consider a problem and, having got through that procedure, find that they are told by the manager that he does not propose to accept their advice. That does not bring us very much further.  We will find that these consultative committees will tend then to become moribund.  It is to avoid that position and to ensure that what the Minister stated in this House will be realised, that this health code will operate through a democratic form of local government that we have set down this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Larkin sets out that this committee shall discharge such functions as the health authority may delegate to it&mdash;in other words, such functions as the elected council can delegate to it.  The elected council can delegate to it only such powers as they have themselves.  They cannot delegate any power they have not got.  It is all nonsense, therefore, to suggest, as Deputy Larkin did, that you are giving this committee some powers which the <Col N="2124" /> health authority have not got.  You propose to give them only the authority that the elected representatives as a whole have and nothing else. What advantage can be derived from such a committee apart from that available under the full health authority? We shall take a county council in which you may have 21 or perhaps 30 members.  If you take eight of these members, that is one-third or one-fourth of the whole council, to form a committee, they cannot perform any function that the whole 30 cannot legally perform.  I cannot for the life of me see what advantage it will be to have the county medical officer of health, the county surgeon and the matron of the county hospital on the committee.  I suggest that the matron of the sanatorium, a very important health institution, might as well be included. I can see no way in which that would help.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin must be aware further that the health authority is the council of the county.  They have power to set up committees and to delegate portions of their functions to them. Many of these councils do set up committees under the County Management Act and under previous Acts.  There is no necessity to provide in this Bill powers to enable them to set up a committee if they think well of it, because it gives them no powers that they have not already.  I remember working for a dozen years on a board of health. Because we were only one-third of the elected representatives of the county, the other two-thirds discovered they had a grievance because, as they said, they were not aware of what was going on at the meetings of the board of health.  If problems do arise in carrying out the provisions of this Bill I think it would be much better to have the whole council as a committee. Later on, when the times comes fully to implement the Bill, the council, if they think that there are some small problems arising in the functioning of the Act, can set up a committee from amongst their members to deal with these matters.  The power is there under previous Acts to do that, the very same power as they would have under the amendment of Deputy Larkin.</P>

      <P>Not being a member of a local authority I cannot speak with any great knowledge of the duties of local authorities but I would ask the Minister to give careful consideration to the basic point involved in this amendment.  I cannot quite see Deputy Larkin's point that the development of our institutions and services is such that you are up against the question of the bad official.  I have heard of the bad official and I know that the bad official can destroy all our attempts to set up democratic machinery which will provide a good health service.  That is why I think the whole question is a very serious one indeed, but I am not clear in my own mind as to the way in which the Minister should proceed in attempting to ensure what Deputy Larkin says he would achieve with this sub-committee of the health authority.  Of course from my point of view, in so far as I am a firm believer in this type of service, it is very important indeed that there should be no bureaucracy, that inhuman soulless bureaucracy to which Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll and Deputy Larkin referred and of which I am also aware.  I believe that is something which many officials in their approach to the people with whom they deal, have learned from the time when people took things as charity, charity in the worst sense of the word.  They tend to carry that attitude over into our public services when the people are getting whatever they are getting from these services as of right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main interest here is that the Minister should seriously consider the question as to how he is to get the flexibility so necessary in health services.  Of course it is absolutely essential to the powers at the disposal of the executive advisory authority, whoever they may be, to allow them to deal in a reasonably broad way with the thousand and one problems that will come up for consideration under this health legislation.  I do not know that Deputy Larkin's amendment meets that.  I simply could not say whether it does or not.  Equally I think that leaving the matter to the county council, the health authority and the manager, could not meet it either because the responsibilities that <Col N="2126" /> will be placed on all of them in the next five years, in the earlier years of the expansion of the health service, will be rather too big.  Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, who has considerable experience of the activities of local authorities, has made the point that it is generally the most active members of local authorities who are called upon to sit on the health committees.  The result is that the best of them cannot get round to all the committees and frequently you have no action taken by virtue of the fact that it would be a physical impossibility for these members to do all the work.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the point raised is a very important one.  I really do not think that the advisory part of the suggestion made by the Minister would meet the case.  My own acceptance in relation to the National Health Council in a much broader way was largely due to the fact that it was purely advisory.  Being purely advisory, my view was that it was largely useless, but I do not want to pursue that point at the moment.  It certainly would not interfere with the extension of our health services.  Where we are dealing with democratically elected committees, whatever we do we should do <i>bona fide</i> with a real intention to see that whatever powers we give to the authorities are effective powers.  I do not think that advisory powers are going to be effective powers.  Their effect on the health services would, I should imagine, be largely illusory.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of the necessity of the authority having all the power, in so far as it is a democratically elected body, I would concede that the members who are mentioned in the amendment have a right, by virtue of being employees of the health authority, to take part in a sub-committee of a democratically elected body, quite contrary to our acceptance in relation to, say, a voluntary hospital board which is not democratically elected but which will spend a lot of our money under this health legislation.  I think that some sort of middle road should be considered in relation to this section and the point raised by Deputy Larkin.  You may pay lip service to <Col N="2127" /> democratic usage by saying that they all consider it, but most of us are more interested in getting the work done, in making the service effective and ridding it of any chance of its being bedevilled by bureaucracy.  This, of course, is the contention of the opponents of this kind of health legislation.</P>
    <P>There is some substance in their charge, I believe, at present, but my explanation is that that has arisen out of the fact that most of the officials administering our public assistance services&mdash;I do not wish to attack officials, because I think it is the most cowardly form of dialectics or behaviour in a public man&mdash;through environment or their general attitude in the past, have the feeling that what they are giving out is something of their own rather than something which is the recipient's right as a ratepayer or taxpayer. Until that atmosphere is completely got rid of in our social services generally, we will tend to have the bad official, the autocrat and the petty tyrant, but, as time goes on, and as the local health authorities, the local authorities, democratic councils, explain to the people that what they are getting is theirs as a right, that they are beholden to nobody for it and that they must receive the attention they would expect to get from an employee, as the health authority official is, no matter whether in high or low rank, I feel that we will get rid of the red tape, the bureaucracy, the inflexibility and the inhumanity which, to a certain extent, still prevails in some of our health services.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give very careful consideration to this particular part of the legislation, because upon it, I believe, hinges the whole success or failure of the scheme, and on it are centred our hopes, and the hopes of Deputies on the other side&mdash;probably that is an over-statement and I should say &ldquo;the beliefs of Deputies on the other side&rdquo;&mdash;that our health legislation cannot succeed because it will be ultimately bedevilled and destroyed by the bureaucrat.  I do not think that is necessary.  Other schemes have been tried in other countries and have worked.  I believe this scheme will <Col N="2128" /> work as well, but I think that much of the likelihood of its being a success depends on the administrators and the executive authority.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister seriously consider the amendment, that he take what is good out of it and incorporate it in a proposal of his own, to ensure that this principle will be very carefully constructed and that the evils and dangers to which Deputy Larkin and Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll drew attention will be avoided.  Would it be of any help to Deputy Larkin if the Minister considered the substitution of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;?  That might destroy the whole amendment.  However, that is only a small point&mdash;the main principle is there and is very important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy Browne that this aspect of the entire legislation is most important and I agree also with Deputy Larkin that we want, as it were, the human touch rather than the official touch in this whole system, but I think that Deputy Allen has dealt very effectively with his arguments.  The idea Deputy Larkin has in mind can be put into force by the local authority without any legislation at all&mdash;perhaps not in relation to the personnel but in relation to the idea.  Deputy Larkin had in mind that the individual who is looking for a certain benefit and perhaps fails to get it deserves sympathy.  I agree.  On the other hand, the Deputy thinks it is a great pity that he should have to go to a member of the local authority in order to get that benefit.  That is one of the greatest difficulties we have in relation to social legislation generally. We go to great pains to publish social welfare regulations, to set out what people are entitled to and so on, but still there are people who are entitled to these things but who do not get them because, for some reason or other, they do not apply in the proper way.  That is a very difficult matter to get over and what happens is that some local person decides that this person has a grievance and writes to a T.D., who gets on to me.  I get on to the officials and am told: &ldquo;Yes, that person should have got that benefit, <Col N="2129" /> but, through a mistake, he did not get it&rdquo;.  The result is that Deputies are dragged into these things unnecessarily, if you like, but I suppose until we all become better educated that will go on.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Allen pointed out, the local authority will have power over policy and the raising of money.  In other words, they will decide that a certain benefit should be given to a certain class of people and then, roughly speaking, it is the county manager's business to see that it is implemented.  In all legislation so far, since the county managers were set up, it has been an accepted principle that the individual benefit would be decided by the county manager and not by the council.  That is not just my idea but an idea which has been held by every Minister before me, on both the social welfare and local authority side.  When I speak of the social welfare side, I refer to home assistance.  Even when the last Government were bringing in a Bill to amend the County Management Act, they specifically provided that the chief executive officer, as they called the county manager, would be the authority for giving decisions on individual health functions, so I think it is fairly clear that any Minister who may be there, whether Fianna Fáil or Labour or anything else, will come to the decision that an individual health function must be decided by one man and cannot possibly be discussed by a committee.  People would not like to have their cases discussed by a number of people, whether it be the whole council open to the Press or a committee of that council at which the Press is not present.  Prospective patients would not as a rule like to have their cases discussed by a number of people. They would much prefer to have one person decide without any publicity or anything of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to this at any rate all Parties were of the opinion that the new health function should be a function for the county manager.  Bearing that in mind and bearing in mind also what Deputy Allen pointed out, that this committee proposed by the majority could only have whatever function was delegated to it by the full council, it really shows that at both ends, as it were, it will not achieve very much and for that <Col N="2130" /> reason I am still opposed to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point to which I should have referred. So far as the doctor is concerned under this Bill and so far as the health services are concerned the Minister proposes a considerable unification and centralisation.  The Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council will, it is envisaged, come together as one health authority.  That in itself will separate the ordinary members of the Dublin Corporation still further away from the intimate problems of the working of the health services in Dublin, quite apart from the considerable extra administration which the Dublin Corporation and the Dublin County Council will have to shoulder as a result of these extended services.  From the point of view of personnel and accommodation duties will be involved which they will, in some instances in my opinion, have very great difficulty in carrying out. For that reason I would ask the Minister, since we are all anxious to try to avoid this rather inherent danger in building up a scheme like this, to consider as far as possible integrating the members of the various local authorities at various levels into the health services.  There will be 45 members on this health authority for Dublin City and County.  It does not need much imagination to see how very remote a member of that central authority will be from the complaints or problems arising in connection with a patient perhaps in Grangegorman Mental Hospital, a patient in St. Kevin's or someone with a grievance in connection with tuberculosis services.</P>
      <P>I might again remind the Minister that it is envisaged that a number of existing boards working under the Dublin Corporation, such as the board of assistance, will eventually be abolished.  Centralisation of control is envisaged in so far as Dublin City and County are concerned.  I think it is vital that the greatest consideration should be given to this question of endeavouring to integrate elected representatives in so far as possible at all levels of administration in health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly there is a point there in relation to Dublin City and County because these will require a very, very big board.  It is, however, visualised that many sub-committees will be appointed for local purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>No one has suggested that the individual application of health services should be dealt with by all the members of the health authority or by a committee.  The Minister has merely put up something in order to knock it down again for the sake of argument.  I see here a difference in principle between the Minister and not only myself but other members of the House.  We want to ensure that not merely are the health services properly administered and made available to those citizens in need of them but we want to have associated as far as possible with the actual administration and executive carrying-out of these functions representatives of the ratepayers and the citizens.  That is why the committee suggested here is made up, not merely of elected representatives, but also of the county manager and his experts.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for Deputy Allen to say that all the members of the council might prefer to deal with health questions.  Of course, they may, but how many in practice will concern themselves in detail?  I have been a member of a local authority.  I know what happens very well when there are 20, 30 or, as in the case of Dublin Corporation, 45 members dealing with the question of health.  First of all, not all of them find it possible to attend every meeting.  Not all of them find it possible to read the minutes and reports made available.  Not all are as deeply concerned with health as they may be with housing or some other aspect of local authority work. On every council, however, there are always individuals who take a particular interest in one particular aspect of the functions of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my concern to ensure that the elected representatives are closely associated with the officials and medical experts, not in determining whether John Murphy will get a particular service, but whether the manner in <Col N="2132" /> which John Murphy, and many hundreds of John Murphys, are dealt with and treated by the officials administering the service is satisfactory.  I want to ensure that John Murphy and his fellow-citizens will know that, having applied for a particular service whether hospital, institutional or any other form set out in the Bill and having been given the particular service sought and found that it is not satisfactory and not meeting the purpose for which it was intended, will then have some other recourse other than an official.  Remember, it is not to the county or city manager he will go.  It is to some minor official and if he gets no satisfaction from that official he will be told that it is a matter for the county manager.</P>
    <P>The particular official cannot do any more and by the time John Murphy reaches the county manager he will probably require to go into hospital again.  The officials are recruited from amongst the people; they are known and in direct contact with them.  Any feeling of uneasiness that may be aroused in the minds of ratepayers can immediately be brought to the attention of the elected representatives. They will not then be sitting as a general council meeting, dealing with the multiplicity of local functions, but as a council specifically concerned with health.  They will be in direct association with the leading officials carrying out the executive and administrative functions as laid down by the health authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen says local authorities can already appoint these committees. Possibly they can.  When it comes down to actual power we all know it is the county manager who is the official authority.  I think we will find that will be the position in the future as it has been the position in the past.  He also made the point, and so did the Minister, that the committee cannot have more functions than the health authority itself but if the health authority has the functions and jurisdiction that the Minister apparently suggests he is giving it under this Bill, that is sufficient for me.  If he is not giving the health authority these <Col N="2133" /> functions and authority, then we know where we are.  In fact, the whole scheme will be administered by the county manager.</P>
    <P>I am not asking for any more for the health committee than is given in the Bill to the health authority.  All I am suggesting is that the committee will be little more than an advisory committee dependent upon the goodwill, patience and tolerance of a particular county manager as to whether he will listen or not.  I am suggesting that we should establish the principle of directly associating so far as health is concerned those who represent democracy in local government with the actual function and executive control of the health services.  That is an entirely different principle from the one embodied in the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes an advisory council which has no life unless somebody puts a spark into it.  My amendment is in terms of a properly established committee given definite powers by the health authority to go ahead in association with the experts and provide the services set out in the Bill in such a manner that they will be appreciated by the ratepayers and the citizens and which will function on a broad human basis far removed from the cold official atmosphere.  There is an issue of principle involved between the two principles and I feel that I have to stand by mine.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister nothing further to say?  Is it his intention to steamroll all his own views through the Dáil?  He has heard Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll give their wholehearted support to the view expressed by Deputy Larkin.  I give it my wholehearted support in the light of my experience of the work of public health committees in Dublin Corporation over the past 40 years.  I know it is essential to have sympathy for the man who has a grievance outside.  I knew many cases where an aggrieved person came to a member of the council who was a member of the committee.  The case when taken up appeared to be hopeless and it was turned down by the <Col N="2134" /> officials.  But after some time and when the matter was given attention, some redress was given to that aggrieved person.  I think that the suggestion of Deputy Larkin is one which the Minister ought to meet in some way.  Is it the Minister's intention to completely steamroll his own views through the Dáil, especially when the medical men in the Dáil are directly opposed to his views on this section?</P>

He said that policy and big administrative details belonged to the full council and he implied that executive functions belonged only to the manager.  Now he indicates that whatever powers the council have themselves can be transferred to any kind of body they desire, <Col N="2135" /> including a body such as Deputy Larkin suggested.  Will the Minister indicate where in this Bill are any powers that are reserved functions for the local body?  If there are no reserved functions for the local body, will he say what aspect of policy other than the policy of accepting this Act and arranging to have it put into force remains to a council in this case?  The Minister indicated that he was not going to bring pressure to bear on a council in the matter.  He was apparently going to wait until a certan number of councils accepted the policy enshrined in this measure and go ahead with it and then he would enforce it on the others. Assuming that the policy of this measure was accepted by a council and gone ahead with where in this Bill in connection with a decision on anything is the local elected body to come in with any powers?</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy is really ignorant or trying to make a point.  Surely the Deputy realises&mdash;he was a Minister for a long time&mdash;that we are not dealing either with the local authority or the county manager in this Bill.  In this Bill we say that the local authority must provide so-and-so or we compel the local authority to do so-and-so but the County Management Act lays down what the local authority will do themselves and what the county manager will do.  I am not interfering with that system.  There is a County Management Act coming before the Dáil and the matter can be dealt with at that stage. This Bill is not changing anything in the law.  It would not be appropriate that it should do so.</P>

In respect of every section practically the local authority will decide whether they will adopt it or not.  It will be the local authority and not the county manager who will decide.  The law remains as it was as between the local authority and the county manager. The Government of which the Deputy is a member did bring in a Bill which purported to take some of the functions from the county manager, but you would have to have a microscope to examine what they were.  The Government of which I am a member are drafting a Bill on the same lines.  I do not know how far they will go, but they will go as far as the previous Government went in that direction.</P>

      <P>The Minister has implied that I am criticising the county managers.  I am asking for information as to how this Bill will be worked, and the Minister has attempted to say that the elected councils have power themselves to do certain things.  He has implied, without stating it exactly, that they have power to set up a body such as Deputy Larkin is suggesting, and power to give it certain functions to discharge.  I am saying that, as far as the law is concerned, there is no power given in this Bill to a local authority that will not be absolutely one to be discharged by the county manager except that power is a reserved function specified either here or described as a reserved function in the County Management Act.  The Minister tells us that he does not know anything about what is or is not a reserved function, and goes so far as to say that he does not know whether the reserved functions are those ascribed to the county manager or the county council.  I think that, at least, we ought to get a clear expression of opinion from the Minister as to what are the powers provided in this Bill that are expressly those of the elected body, and that are a reserved function of the local body.</P>

      <P>I think that the question Deputy Mulcahy is on does not arise on Deputy Larkin's amendment which proposes to have a new section inserted.  I fail to see how, on this stage of the Bill, we should traverse the whole business of county management <i>vis-à-vis</i> health services.  While I would be in agreement in principle with Deputy Larkin, I would like to say this, that if the county councils can operate as a public health committee as well as we are doing in the City of Dublin there will not be any cause for complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine they can have their public health committee in the same way as we in Dublin Corporation have one.  In spite of what Deputy Byrne has said with, as he has said, his 40 years' <Col N="2140" /> experience, I should like to give my experience extending over the last 20 years.  As chairman of the Public Health Committee of the Dublin Corporation, I do not know of any person, with any grievance, who has not found an outlet for it.  There are 45 members on the Dublin Corporation.  The public health committee we have is representative of these 45 members.  The quorum is nine.  Sometimes it is difficult to get one.  I can say this, that any person who is aggrieved or feels that he or she is not getting a particular allowance, or proper service under the Health Bill, has his local representative to go to.  The matter may then be brought up at the public health committee.  It will be brought up and will be thoroughly investigated to the satisfaction of the member who raises it or to the satisfaction of the committee.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to hospitals and sanatoria.  The hospitals are not under our control, but the sanatoria are.  In connection with these, we have a system of visiting.  I suggest that is a most practical system.  It could also be employed by the county councils. Let the county councils appoint a public health committee, and let that committee appoint visitors to visit the hospitals or sanatoria under their control. That is what we do.  No objection whatever has been raised in any way by the city manager.  Indeed, if every county manager in Ireland were as good as the city manager in Dublin in the way he co-operates with the members of the council and listens to everything we have to say, there could be no complaint.  Indeed, he is largely directed by us even in regard to matters which are his functions.  I should like to say that for him, that he is most democratic in that way. Personally, I do not see any necessity really for this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have been in on these discussions from the start, and I certainly <Col N="2141" /> can make a case for this out of my own experience.  So far as Dublin is concerned, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll need not worry about the unification of health services when they come about Councillor Denis Larkin made the point, in the corporation and in consultation with the Minister, that we wanted specifically these local committees together with the big committee.  It will not be 45 members as Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll suggested but it was suggested that there should be 18 from our body and half that number from the county council.  The Minister said: &ldquo;We will leave that to another day. We do not have to decide now what number of people will be on this unified health authority.&rdquo;  One thing he has conceded and on which he agreed immediately was that the system of local committees which operated under the Balrothery Board of Assistance and the other bodies that were abolished will be instituted under the proposed new scheme in Dublin and county. Personally I do not see what all the argument has been about.  Deputy Larkin is a man who takes a very keen interest in local matters but I do not think he fully understands the system as it works under the corporations and the county councils.  The elected representatives have in effect the power to appoint these committees, to visit or supervise and investigate claims by aggrieved citizens.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCann is in the unfortunate position of being a member of the Dublin Corporation and I have already pointed out that the experience of elected representatives in Dublin is much different from that of elected representatives in other parts of the country.  So far as this amendment is concerned.  while it was put down in my name, its origin is in the minds of members of the Labour Party in this House who are members of local authorities in other parts of the country and in Dublin.  Possibly, if every member of the councils throughout the country had the same experience as Deputy McCann has had and as I had years before in regard to the Managerial Act in Dublin, maybe this amendment would not be <Col N="2142" /> down.  But then the experience is not common to everybody.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt at all as to the relative functions of the county manager in regard to this Bill.  I can accept what the Minister says that there are certain services which he listed that it is the function of the county council to decide whether they are going to put them into effect and provide the money, but it is the function and authority of the county manager to determine the character of those services in the final analysis. Everybody knows that that is what I am concerned with.  Possibly the Minister may feel that by a roundabout or by a back-door method I am trying to ease off the exceptionally impregnable position the managers have under the Managerial Act.  If he thinks that, he is quite right.  It is very important that it should be done in regard to the health question.  The question in regard to local government generally is a matter we can argue another day.</P>
      <P>As far as health is concerned, even though the local authority decide, for example, that they are going to provide a scheme of medical care for mothers, decide the broad principles of that scheme, have an estimate from the county council and medical officer as to the cost and decide to provide the necessary finance, at that point the matter must be taken over by the county manager and the experts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county manager determines the type of building, the employment of the persons who operate the scheme and all the factors that go with the provision of services, and as to the women who will have recourse to the services concerned.  The county manager determines the character of that scheme in these important aspects.  It is no use kidding ourselves in this connection. If there is anything wrong with the way in which the scheme ultimately operates the members of the county council may object and they may question the county manager, but there is only one way they can bring him to heel and that is by saying that they are not going to provide any further money to carry on the scheme. We know it does not work that way, <Col N="2143" /> get away with his point of view except when he comes across a very stubborn member of the local authority, and that does not always happen.  In the meantime the individual woman or man depending on that scheme is suffering because the scheme is not the type the members of the local authority originally wanted.</P>
    <P>I agree that it might be desirable to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may.&rdquo;  That is a matter that could be seen to as far as the amendment is concerned.  However, I see in this a question of principle, and the principle I am concerned with is the division of authority between the elected representatives and the manager. If each section of that divided authority stand upon the powers given to them under the Managerial Act then we can have a very unfortunate position so far as the ordinary citizen is concerned.  There is no remedy for it unless the local authority decides to invoke this final and absolute authority in regard to finance.</P>
    <P>We know very well that the experience in Dublin has been quite the opposite and I accept what Deputy McCann has said, that the thing has worked smoothly and there have been practically no complaints but Deputy McCann will recall that on the occasion when the managerial system started to operate in Dublin the first city manager said that he intended to work in co-operation with the council and that has been the practice carried on by his successor since.  If that had not been the case and if he had the experience in Dublin that has been met with in other counties he would not feel so happy about it.  Deputy McCann has a keen interest in health matters and knows the position well because of the fact that he is chairman of the health committee in the Dublin Corporation and because of his assocciation with Dublin hospitals, but if he had the experience which elected representatives had outside of Dublin he would be pressing this amendment just as much as I do.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Larkin and other members here must be framing in their minds things that <Col N="2144" /> have never occurred.  In my experience, both in the Cork Corporation and the county council, I have never come across any situation such as they envisage.  In the Cork County Council we have three health authorities.  I am a member of one of them attached to the central area.  We have the same committee there for health as for housing and sanitary services, and that includes all the elected representatives for that particular area.  On the occasion of the meeting the county medical officer attends.  The officials who are responsible for administration and the assistant county manager attend.  The health items on the agenda are first dealt with in the presence of the county medical officer of health and all the officials concerned.  Matters of administration or of individual complaints are dealt with at the meeting. If complaints are not decided at that meeting they are referred for further inquiry to the county medical officer of health and his officials for further consideration and a decision in accordance with the regulations and the law.</P>
      <P>If that is not carried into effect the matter goes to the next meeting and is dealt with.  In the meantime, the public representatives will have their say and will perhaps appeal from, perhaps, the Minister, misinformed, to the manager, better informed, and perhaps get a more favourable decision in consequence.  When health has been dealt with, housing and sanitary services, which are associate services, are dealt with in the presence of the county medical officer of health if he is required.  He is released if there is nothing on the agenda requiring his immediate attention.  In the working of that system complaints have arisen but it never has been my experience that these complaints have not been dealt with to the satisfaction of all concerned when they are properly investigated.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacCarthy is speaking in all honesty in relation to Cork.  Could he tell me what other county council in Ireland is in the same happy position as Cork, having a separate health authority?  I doubt if he could name another.  There are, as Deputy Larkin says, 25 others, but He is in a strong position and he can <Col N="2145" /> they are not in that happy position. In County Waterford, there is no health authority as such.  The county council meets and in a general discussion one has the right to bring up a question of health but there is no assurance that the medical officer will be there or anyone attached to his department and you will get a very offhand reply and be told to communicate in writing with the manager.  You will probably get the reply but it is not dealt with in the way the Labour Party think it should be dealt with.  They think that the whole code of health should be taken by a special committee detailed to sit with the county manager and that the county manager should be a member.  The county manager, when he deals with an advisory body, can always listen and just refuse to answer, if he so wishes.  Our experience has been that there are county managers like that.  They are not all as co-operative as the gentleman who operates in Dublin or even the man in Cork.  Take a typical case.</P>
      <P>In Cork, the county manager, receiving a certain document from Dublin thought fit to put a copy before each member of the health authority. Our county manager, getting the same document, believed it was confidential and refused us the right to see it. That is a typical instance of different interpretations.  I can prove that.  I got a copy that the Cork County Manager thought the members should have.  Our county manager thought I had a document improperly, that it was confidential between him and the Minister.  From a point of view it was.  It illustrates the point.  If the county manager were a common member with those selected by the public representatives, we would have as much information as he would have and we would be in a position to question him on matters and get an answer. There is a question of principle in our amendment.</P>

      <P>Are not we operating the same laws and was it not up to the public representatives in Waterford or any other county to appoint a separate health committee to deal with this matter?  If they consider it advisable <Col N="2146" /> from their point of view to let the county council deal with it, who had a lot of other business to perform on the same day, I do not think the county manager or anybody else is to be blamed.  It is the public representatives who did not make their decision and their request to have a county health authority appointed as a separate committee.</P>

      <P>We are dealing here with the making of a law.  I contend that the local authority in respect of the law that it is proposed to pass here will have no authority in the world except in so far as they can control it by the striking of the rate, and that their position is not so much that they can willingly acquiesce in accepting putting this Act into force but that the Minister can tell them some day or another to put it into force and, if they say that they will not strike a rate for it, the Minister can instruct the county manager to strike the rate and to collect the rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned with what are reserved functions.  In view of the gloss that the Minister has put on the powers of local authorities here in his comment on Deputy Larkin's amendment, I find it necessary to draw the attention of the House to the position with regard to local authorities and their reserved functions.  It is imperative that in discussing what we are discussing here we would advert to that because, when we are discussing the position of the county manager and his powers and the powers that the elected local authorities will have, we cannot know where we stand unless we refer to the County Management Act, 1940, and Section 16 and the Second Schedule to that Act, where reserved functions are defined.  The elected representatives have no power of a statutory kind except in so far as there are reserved functions defined here and they will have no power with regard to this Bill unless there is enshrined in this Bill a statutory provision that certain aspects of the Bill are reserved functions.  In order to help the House generally to be clear as to the position, I shall read out Section 16 of the County Management <Col N="2147" /> Act, 1940, and the Second Schedule thereto.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the County Management Act (12) of 1940 deals with the reserved functions.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  Neither the council of a county nor any elective body shall directly exercise or perform any power, (other than a power which is vested by law (including this Act) in such council or body and is by this Act expressly made exercisable by resolution of such council or body), function, or duty of such council or body, in relation to the officers or servants of such council or body, or the control, supervision, service, remuneration, privileges, or superannuation of such officers or servants or any of them.</P>
    <P>(2)  Subject to the provisions of the next preceding sub-section of this section, every council of a county and every elective body shall directly exercise and perform the powers, functions, and duties (if any) of such council or body in relation to each of the several matters mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act.</P>
    <P>(3)  Save as is otherwise provided by this section, the Minister whenever he so thinks proper, may by Order, direct that the powers functions, and duties of every or of any particular council of a county, or of every elective body of a specified class, or of any particular elective body in relation to any matter specified in such Order (not being a matter mentioned in the Second Schedule to this Act) shall be exercised and performed directly by such council or such body, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Minister, whenever he so thinks proper, may revoke or amend any Order made by him under the next preceding sub-section of this section or any Order (made under this sub-section) amending any such Order.</P>
    <P>(5)  Whenever and so long as an Order made by the Minister under this section is in force, the powers, functions, and duties specified in such Order shall be exercised <Col N="2148" /> directly by the council or councils, or the elective body or bodies in respect of which such Order is made.</P>
    <P>(6)  No Order made by the Minister under this section shall extend or apply to any power, function, or duty to which the first sub-section applies.</P>
    <P>(7)  Every appointment by the council of a county of a rate collector for a rate collection district lawfully established in such county shall be made by such council directly by resolution, but no such appointment shall have effect unless or until approved of by the Minister.</P>
    <P>(8)  Every power, function, or duty of the council of a county, or of an elective body, which is required by this section to be exercised directly by such council or body shall, for the purposes of this Act, be a reserved function of such council or body, and the expression &ldquo;reserved function&rdquo; shall in this Act be construed and have effect accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule to the Act describes the matters in respect of which the powers, functions and duties are reserved functions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;1.  The making of a rate.</P>
    <P>2.  The borrowing of money.</P>
    <P>3.  The demanding under any enactment of the whole or part of the expenses of the council of a county or of an elective body from any other local authority.</P>
    <P>4.  The making, amending, or revoking a by-law.</P>
    <P>5.  The making or revoking an Order or the passing or rescinding a resolution by virtue of which an enactment is brought into operation in or is made to apply to the functional area or a part of the functional area of the council of a county or of an elective body.</P>
    <P>6.  The application to be made to any authority in respect of the making or revoking of any such Order as is mentioned in the next preceding paragraph of this Schedule.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> 7.  The powers conferred by the Borough Funds (Ireland) Act, 1888, or by that Act as extended by any subsequent enactment, in relation to promoting or opposing legislation or in relation to the prosecution or defence of any such legal proceedings as are mentioned in Section 3 of the said Act and the application of public funds or rates for any of those purposes.</P>
    <P>8.  The making under Section 9 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, of regulations in respect of the admission, detention, or discharge of patients to, in, or from a mental hospital or in respect of the conditions as to payment or accommodation under which private patients may be admitted to or detained in a mental hospital.</P>
    <P>9.  The following matters under the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934 (No. 22 of 1934), that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the passing of a resolution under Section 18 of the said Act for the constitution of a planning region;</P>
    <P>(b)  the making of an application for an Order under Section 21 of the said Act extending a planning district;</P>
    <P>(c)  the consideration and the making of a decision under Section 26 of the said Act to make a planning scheme;</P>
    <P>(d)  the making and submission of a planning scheme under Section 29 of the said Act.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I again submit, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that for the purpose of showing in the clearest and most systematic way that there is no reserved function to any authority in relation to any aspect of a Public Health Bill, I am entitled to read to the House five more points in the Second Schedule to this Act, and I submit that if discussions here are going to be informed by fact&mdash;and we are dealing with important matters&mdash; one of the most important things we should discuss in relation to this Bill is the extent to which a local body shall have power under it.  No. 17 deals with the nomination of a person to be President of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Paragraph 21 deals with the granting of superannuation allowances.  Paragraph 22 concerns &ldquo;the exercise of power which is vested by law (including this Act) in the council of a county or an elective body and is by this Act expressly made exercisable by resolution of such council or body.&rdquo;  With that evidence in front of us, I submit that there is no power there.  First and foremost, there is nothing in this Act that gives any local authority reserved powers over any aspect of the public health legislation.  Here in this Bill there is no specific statement that would give to a local authority as a reserved function any power within that Act. Unless there is such a provision, the terms of the statute that I have read out preclude the local authority from <Col N="2155" /> having any power in relation to the Bill in front of us now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was reading out certain things that can be done under this Bill and which we are telling the local authority should be done.  I read out several of them.  Take, for instance, the provision of hospital accommodation for certain types of people, providing services for women in the case of maternity, providing for schools' medical examination.  Take it that the county manager and the local authority are not agreed.</P>
      <P>If it is the case that the county manager wants to do it and the local authority do not want to do it, the local authority can say: &ldquo;We will not give you the money,&rdquo; and the manager cannot do it, since under that very long list of things read out by Deputy Mulcahy it is laid down specifically that the local authority provides the rate and if they do not provide the rate the county manager cannot do it. If the converse is the case, that the county manager says he does not want to do it and the local authority say they do, what happens?  According to Deputy Mulcahy, the council cannot do anything, but I will just proceed where he stopped.  The last thing he read was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The exercise of a power which is vested by law (including this Act) in the council of a county or an elective body and is by this Act expressly made exercisable by resolution of such council or body.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Go back to Section 29 of the County Management Act:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Any council of a county or any elective body, at a meeting specially summoned for the purpose under this section, may by resolution proposed and passed in accordance with this section require any particular act, matter, or thing specifically mentioned in such resolution and which such council or the county manager for such county or such elective body or the manager for such elective body (as the case may be) can lawfully do, to be done in exercise of performance of the executive functions of such council or body.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" /> There is no doubt that when we pass this Bill it will be lawful for either the county council or the county manager to do the thing.  We need not bother about it now, because this section says that the elected council can pass the resolution, and if it is lawful or either the council or the manager to do it, it must be done and that is the end of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Or they can suspend the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be illegal if he did not do it.  So you can add that to the reserved function under Section 29.  We are not dealing with the county manager but with the local authority.  We are telling the local authority in some cases what they must do and in other cases what they may do, and it is a matter for them to decide whether it is their function or the county manager's.  That is decided by the County Management Act.</P>
      <P>At any rate, any service that we say in this Bill the local authority ought to provide must be provided.  It is quite plain that the county manager cannot stop the local authority from doing it if they want to do it.  That is certain, anyway.  We need not put it into this Bill because it is in Section 29 of the County Management Act.  There is no doubt about it.</P>
      <P>Going back to Deputy Larkin's amendment, which we got a long way from in the meantime, the Local Government Act of 1925, Section 58, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A county council may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as they think fit for purposes connected with the exercise or performance of any of their powers, duties, and functions which in the opinion of the council would be better or more conveniently regulated or managed by or through a committee.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Sub-section (3) provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever a county manager receives any such notice as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section, he shall as soon as possible send a copy of such notice to every member of the county council or elective body concerned and a special meeting of such council or body shall be summoned for the date specified in that behalf in such notice at the usual hour for meetings of such council or body.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (4) provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;When a resolution of which notice has been given under this section has been proposed at the meeting of the county council or elective body concerned summoned for the purpose under this section, such council or body and the county manager concerned shall consider such resolution and, if after such consideration such council or body passes such resolution and the number of members voting for such resolution exceeds either half the total membership of such council or body or two-thirds of the members present and voting, such county manager shall, if and when and so far as money for the purpose is or has been provided, do in accordance with such resolution the act, matter, or thing which is required by such resolution to be done.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that is quite reasonable.  The county council could not expect the county manager to pay it out of his own pocket.  The county council would naturally have to provide the money. Sub-section (5) provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A resolution passed under this section shall not ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;these are all the exceptions I mentioned&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  apply or extend to the exercise or performance of any power, function, or duty of a county council or an elective body generally or to every case or occasion of the exercise or performance of any such power, function, or duty or to a number or class of such cases or occasions so extended as to be <Col N="2159" /> substantially or in effect every case or occasion on which such power, function, or duty is exercised or performed, or&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;I hope you all understand that.&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b)  apply or extend to the exercise or performance of any power, or duty conferred or imposed on a county manager by or under this Act in relation to the officers or servants of a county council or an elective body or the control, supervision, service, remuneration, privileges or superannuation of such officers or servants or any of them, or</P>
    <P>(c)  require a county manager to give or to withhold public assistance to or from any particular individual, or</P>
    <P>(d)  require a county manager to prosecute or to refrain from prosecuting any particular person or to discontinue any particular prosecution.</P>
    <P>Any resolution purporting to be passed by the council of a county or by an elective body under this section which contravenes this sub-section shall be void and of no effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (6) provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every dispute which shall arise between the council of a county or an elective body and a county manager as to whether a resolution passed by such council or body (as the case may be) under this section does or does not contravene the next preceding sub-section of this section shall be referred to the Minister for decision, and the decision of the Minister thereon shall be final and conclusive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the whole of Section 29 of the County Management Act, 1940.  I think nobody will argue that it does not apply absolutely to this Bill&mdash;that if a particular service is provided under this Bill and the county manager is slow or reluctant or refuses to apply it to a particular county, the county council can call a special meeting, pass a resolution and compel the county <Col N="2160" /> manager to adopt the scheme.  There is no way out of it under the County Management Act or anything else.</P>
    <P>Now I come to the Local Government Act of 1925.  I pointed out already that, under sub-section (1) of Section 58 of that Act, a county council may from time to time appoint such and so many committees as they think fit for purposes connected with the exercise or performance of any of their powers, duties, and functions which in the opinion of the council would be better or more conveniently regulated or managed by or through a committee.  As was pointed out by Deputy Allen, that would enable a council to appoint a sub-committee and to delegate to that sub-committee all or any of their powers.  Sub-section (2) of the same section provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A committee appointed under this section may be either a general committee empowered to exercise or perform powers, duties, and functions in relation to the whole of the county or a local committee empowered to exercise or perform powers, duties, and functions in relation to a limited portion only of the county.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every committee appointed under this section shall consist of not less than three members, and may be composed either wholly of members of the council or partly of such members and partly of other persons.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Sub-section (4) provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The acts of every committee appointed under this section shall be subject to confirmation by the council save that the council may with the sanction of the Minister empower any particular committee to do any act (including the institution of legal proceedings) within the authority conferred on the committee by the council which the council itself could lawfully do.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next sub-section concerns the quorum, procedure and so forth.  It provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The quorum, procedure, and place of meeting of any committee appointed under this section and the <Col N="2161" /> area (if any) within which any such committee is to exercise its functions, shall be such as may be appointed by regulations to be made by the council with the approval of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The last sub-section provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Save as is authorised by this section or otherwise by law it shall not be lawful for a county council to delegate any of its powers or duties to a committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, I think, makes very plain what Deputy Allen pointed out&mdash;that a county council could appoint a committee, as outlined by Deputy Larkin, under this section of the Local Government Act and could delegate whatever parts of its powers it likes to that committee and then the committee may meet as often as it wishes.  I think the powers are there so far as Deputy Larkin's amendment is concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not want to misrepresent the Minister in any way and I assure the Minister that, when dealing with the Second Schedule, it was not deliberate.  I want to be quite clear now as to the Minister's reaction to my remarks as far as the law is concerned.  I understood the Minister to tell me now that&mdash;there being no arrangements to make any aspect of this Bill a reserved function under the County Management Act&mdash;the council, for the exercise of their will, must rely on the operation by them of Section 29 of the County Management Act to take any power in regard to the implementation or the operation of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the advantage of having the County Management Act before me.  However, listening to the Minister's statement, I took it to mean that the county council have the power to delegate whatever authority they have to a sub-committee, or a health committee or whatever you like to call it.  But what authority have they got?  I understand, from this discussion, that the authority they have is to strike the rate and provide the money.  As I read it, the manager has the executive authority to implement the different sections of this Act as it applies to the local authority.  The function of the county council, if they <Col N="2162" /> disagree with the manager, is to say that they will not supply the money. They can appoint any committee they want to appoint but will that committee have any function other than the function which they themselves have of providing the money?  After that, the health authority decides what happens.</P>
      <P>I am not going to try to put words into the Minister's mouth.  Let us try and be practical about it.  During the discussion on different sections of this Bill we heard a lot of talk about the payment of a subvention.  It was categorically stated here yesterday that the county manager would decide what subvention would be paid.  Is it seriously suggested now that the county council would have control over the county manager and that, if they did not agree with him about the payment of a subvention, they would have the power to say: &ldquo;We will not strike the rate&rdquo;?  That is nonsense. What authority does it give them to control the executive authority of the county manager?  In my opinion, first, last and all the time, the health authority is the county manager.  He has to have the power.  As far as I can read it, the elected representatives of the people have no authority other than that of collecting the rate and providing the money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion of this matter has certainly covered a fairly wide area.  We have been discussing the County Management Act on a health matter.  I think that a certain amount of misrepresentation is taking place in relation, particularly, to the functions of the health authority and the manager.  It seems to me that the manager is quite obviously the managing director and that the directors are the health authority.  The health authority decide policy and the manager is <Col N="2163" /> the executive.  There must be one executive and the manager is the executive, but he can only operate within the general policy decisions of the health authority.  That is perfectly understandable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of sub-committees of the council, not only the Dublin County Council and the Cork County Council, of which I was aware, but all the county councils have power to delegate their functions, and their functions are policy functions, to sub-committees of the council.  As far as I can see, that meets to a large extent the suggestions put forward by me.  How far it will be effective is for the future to decide.  At any rate, the <Col N="2164" /> manager must have certain specific functions of an executive kind and the county council have the power of making the policy decisions.  I do not see how they can have anything else or ask for anything else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 65:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following sub-sections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(9)  The Minister may by Order revoke any Order made or deemed to be made under this section, and the revoking Order shall contain such provisions as the Minister thinks necessary or expedient consequential on the revocation and in particular where the Order to be revoked relates to a joint board, may make provision for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the dissolution of the joint board and the transfer of the property, rights and liabilities thereof to a health authority or to two or more health authorities or to another joint board or to two or more other joint boards,</P>
      <P>(b)  the preservation of continuing contracts made by the dissolved joint board,</P>
      <P>(c)  the continuance of pending legal proceedings,</P>
      <P>(d)  the transfer of the holder of any office under the dissolved joint board to a similar office under one of the health authorities who appointed the members of the dissolved joint board or under another joint board whose functional area is coterminous with, includes or is included in that of the dissolved joint board.</P>
      <P>(10)  Where, under an Order under sub-section (9) of this section, the holder of an office under a joint board is transferred to another office, the first-mentioned office shall, for the purpose of any enactment relating to superannuation be deemed not to have been abolished.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to cover the case where a joint board is dissolved under Section 41 of the Bill.  It follows the usual lines and sets out how to dispose of the property and also to see that legal proceedings will be carried on and any contracts taken over and so on.  There is nothing in it, except that where the joint board is dissolved, all the usual procedure takes place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a joint board being dissolved&mdash;the ordinary board has already been dealt with&mdash; we want to cover that matter.  It covers the usual lines and the property is transferred over to the new board or to two new boards, as the case may be, and existing contracts are carried on by the new board.  If law proceedings are there, the new board takes on the law proceedings, etc.</P>

      <P>I understand this amendment gives the Minister power so that when he acts under Section 41 he can undo the act, if he wishes.  But, perhaps, it would be more satisfactory if the Minister could explain what he proposes under Section 41 first?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 41, first of all, replaces Section 101 of the Health Act, 1947 which authorised joint action by the two boards&mdash;or two authorities I should say&mdash;in the performance of any function given them under that Act. The main change which is made between Section 101 and Section 41 of this Bill is that the board set up under Section 41 will be a corporate body. That would mean that, for instance, it would have power to borrow, which it had not before.  Sub-section (5) of Section 41 enables the Dublin Board of Assistance and the South Cork and Waterford Boards of Public Assistance which function in the areas of two health authorities to carry out joint action for their constituent health authorities.  These are the only changes from Section 101 of the Principal Act. They are, if you like, important changes.  Now we come along, and in order to implement, as it were, any dissolution&mdash;in order to follow up the dissolution of a joint board&mdash;we lay down what becomes of the property and the contracts, etc.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is simple.  Section 42 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The Minister may by Order authorise the Balrothery Board of Assistance or the Rathdown Board of Assistance to perform any functions of the council of the County of Dublin under the Principal Act or this Act and, for that purpose, may apply to such a board any provisions of the Principal Act or this Act or of any regulations thereunder and may so apply such provisions with any specific modifications or limitations.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 42 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An Order under this section applying to a board the provisions of Section 103 of the Principal Act shall not be made save with the consent of the Minister for Local Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 103 of the Principal Act gives the power of borrowing and it is laid down here that where a sub-health authority is set up in this way by the Minister, or given functions by him, he cannot give them borrowing powers except with the consent of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that certain changes were brought about in the City and County of Dublin recently.  Is it the intention that the Balrothery Board of Assistance, the Rathdown Board of Assistance and the Dublin Board of Assistance will continue as three separate bodies?</P>

I had certain negotiations with the various bodies concerned&mdash;that is the Dublin Corporation, the Dublin County Council and these three bodies &mdash;with a view to having a unified health authority.  Under the scheme that was put up, after the health authority is unified, it was intended that these boards in some capacity or other would be continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This enables the local authority to make certan agreements with the urban council, say, within the <Col N="2169" /> area.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 66:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 44 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The council of a county (other than Dublin, Cork or Waterford) shall by resolution appoint a consultative health committee to advise the county manager on general matters (other than conditions of employment of officers and servants, the amount or payment of grants or allowances or the making of any service available to an individual) relating to the exercise of the functions of the council in relation to the operation of the Principal Act or this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  An appointment under sub-section (1) of this section shall be made by the council of a county as soon as conveniently may be&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  after the commencement of this section, and</P>
      <P>(b)  after each election of the members of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  A consultative health committee <Col N="2170" /> shall consist of ten members, including&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  not less than four members of the council of the county,</P>
    <P>(b)  the county medical officer for the county,</P>
    <P>(c)  the county surgeon for the county or, if there is no such officer, a senior medical officer in a health institution maintained by the council of the county,</P>
    <P>(d)  two other registered medical practitioners residing in the county, each of whom is nominated by a body which, in the opinion of the council of the county, is representative of registered medical practitioners practising in the county.</P>
    <P>(4)  A consultative health committee shall meet&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  when requested to meet by resolution of the council of the county or by the county manager,</P>
    <P>(b)  subject to sub-section (5) of this section, at such other times as the committee may determine, and</P>
    <P>(c)  subject to sub-section (5) of this section, upon a requisition to call a meeting of the committee signed by not less than four members of the committee, being presented to the county manager.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where meetings of a consultative health committee have been held on six or more days in any year, no further meeting shall be held in that year save at the request by resolution of the council of the county or at the request of, or with the consent of, the county manager.</P>
    <P>(6)  Every meeting of a consultative health committee shall be held in private.</P>
    <P>(7)  The foregoing sub-sections of this section shall apply to the Limerick City Council as if they were the council of a county, with the following modifications:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any reference to the county manager shall be construed as a reference to the Limerick City Manager,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2171" /> (b)  the reference in paragraph (b) of sub-section (3) to the county medical officer shall be construed as a reference to the Limerick City Medical Officer.</P>
    <P>(8)  The Minister shall by regulations provide for the establishment of a consultative health committee for each of the following areas:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the county borough of Dublin and the county of Dublin,</P>
    <P>(b)  the county borough of Cork and the county of Cork, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the county borough of Waterford and the county of Waterford,</P>
    <P>and any such regulations shall provide for the application to the committee of the provisions of sub-sections (4), (5) and (6) of this section with any modifications which the Minister thinks fit.</P>
    <P>This deals with the local consultative committee to which I referred already. As I have said the local consultative committee will be purely advisory to the county manager and it will be appointed by each local authority. Roughly speaking, it will consist of at least four members from the elected members of the council, the county medical officer of health, the county surgeon, if there is such an official as the county surgeon&mdash;in some counties there are no county surgeons and in that case he will be replaced by another medical officer&mdash;and two representatives of the county medical association. That makes eight.  Then if the county council likes to appoint two other people of their own choice they can do so.  The committee, of course, will be purely advisory to the county manager&mdash;not to the county council&mdash; and the manager will have his functions, whatever these functions may be.  The committee will have the right to meet at certain times.  They will have the right to call a meeting or to have a meeting called at certain times, subject to certain limitations, but the county council can have a meeting of this advisory commitee called at any time they like.  If they think that anything should be investigated or that any of the actions of the county manager require to be investigated or <Col N="2172" /> considered, then they are in a position to make a report to the county council on anything they may find.  I should mention that we exempt from this provision Dublin City and County, Cork City and County and Waterford City and County.  An advisory council will be appointed by regulation in these cases.  The reason for that is this: we have just been talking about Dublin City and County and the three boards of assistance.  It would be so difficult to know how we could get representation distributed amongst these councils that we thought it better not to do it by a specific provision in the Bill but to have it done by regulation.  It will have to be done by regulation and that regulation will be laid on the Table of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

It is considered that if there are four members of the county council on this body and if they think that the county manager <Col N="2174" /> has been unreasonable, or if you like, impertinent or in any way offensive to the committee, of course they will naturally raise the matter at the county council meeting and they will ventilate any grievance they may have there.  I do not think it will be necessary to do anything beyond that.</P>
