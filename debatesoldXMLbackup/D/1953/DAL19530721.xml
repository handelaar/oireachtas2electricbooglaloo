A reduction of 3d. in the price of the 2-lb. loaf, with a corresponding reduction in flour prices, would cost an additional £6,480,000 which could only be made available by heavy increases in taxation and which it is not proposed to introduce.</P>

      <P>It is not correct that C.I.E. are about to import a quantity of railway coach bogies and fittings from the U.S.A.  About 12 months ago, C.I.E. informed me that they proposed to import from Britain 200 fully fabricated bogies to avoid the dislocation of their carriage construction programme. Following discussions, this proposal was not proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board have informed me that they have arranged to import from the <Col N="4" /> U.S.A. 200 steel castings which form the main frames of carriage bogies. The board state that these castings could not be produced in this country and that their importation, in accordance with the board's timetable makes it possible to avoid the disruption of its new coach-building programme and the temporary laying off of members of its coach-building staff.</P>

      <P>I have at present under consideration the future of public transport in County Donegal in view of proposals of the existing transport operators to terminate most of the railway services in that county in the early future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of public transport in County Donegal is complicated by a number of special features which do not apply in other parts of the State and account will have to be taken of them <Col N="5" /> in arriving at decisions as to how best to meet the needs of the areas.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made in the examination of the matter, but final decisions will not be taken until local interests have been afforded an opportunity of expressing their views.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna-Questions.   Oral Answers. - Shannon Fishing Regulations.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to resolutions passed by the Limerick City Corporation and the Clare County Council concerning the imprisonment of Mr. Seán O'Carroll of Castleconnell and if, in view of Mr. O'Carroll's age and splendid national record, he will use his good offices to secure his release and suggest to the Electricity Supply Board that Mr. O'Carroll be given a special permission to fish with a rod in the River Shannon or be compensated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention has been drawn to the very considerable resentment aroused among the people of Limerick City and County against new regulations made by the E.S.B. forbidding citizens to fish with rod and worm in the River Shannon and, if so, if he will suggest to the E.S.B. that these regulations be relaxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to answer Questions No. 8 and No. 9 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Shannon Fisheries Acts, 1935, and 1938, the E.S.B. is charged <Col N="6" /> with the duties of managing, conducting and preserving the Shannon fisheries and I have no function relating thereto.</P>
    <P>With regard to the latter part of Question No. 8, I am informed by the E.S.B. that, subject to conditions laid down by the board, members of the public are allowed to fish in certain stretches of the river adjacent to Limerick and that if he wishes Mr. O'Carroll can avail himself of these facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that, having regard to Mr. O'Carroll's age, to his national record and to the fact that he was a member of the Second Dáil, certain representations should be made to the E.S.B. to secure his release?  It does seem outrageous that an old man of 78 with that record should be in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite certain the E.S.B. will consider any representations made to it.  It is, however, an impossible claim for any individual to maintain that he should be allowed to fish at any time at any part of the river irrespective of the regulations the board may make for the preservation of the fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister looks further into the question I am sure he will be satisfied that there are special circumstances applicable to Mr. O'Carroll's case.  The fact that he was in jail and on the run at certain crucial periods is one of the factors that is probably responsible for the present impasse.  Would the Minister not make representations himself to the E.S.B.? He would only be doing what the House would like him to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if Mr. O'Carroll considers that he has any claim for compensation under the provisions of the Act.  I know he has made no such claim.  My understanding of the position is that the E.S.B. secured an injunction against him and others for fishing in the river in 1937 and that Mr. O'Carroll obeyed that injunction for 16 years, from 1937 to 1953, but that he decided to disobey it this year, and did.  I am sure the <Col N="7" /> E.S.B. will be anxious to deal with this matter in any way which does not infringe their authority as custodian of the fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the advisability of making an inquiry into the sanity and common sense of the E.S.B. in the wild machinations they have adopted recently against the fishermen of Limerick whereby these men, paying the E.S.B. for licences and permits, are deprived of their right to fish because of the insane and vexatious measures introduced by them and alleged to be in the interests of the protection of the fisheries?  The Minister ought to have it examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a separate question. The issue to which Deputy Keyes is referring is completely separate and distinct from that to which Deputy MacBride has referred.  It does not concern the case of Mr. O'Carroll. It is a question of a regulation made by the E.S.B. to prohibit a certain type of fishing.  I was not consulted by the E.S.B. about that regulation.  I do not know what the justification for it is but I am quite certain that the E.S.B. did not make it without good cause.  So far as I am aware the protest against that regulation is supported only by a very small minority of the Limerick Anglers' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any evidence whatever of the common sense attached to the proposal to ban the worm on the Shannon since it can be fished in every other river in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to make any judgment on the merits of that contention.  I know the E.S.B. have said, by way of information to me which I pass on to the Deputy, that unless they made this regulation the Shannon fisheries would be destroyed.</P>

    <P>The Vote on Account for the current financial year, which was passed by the Dáil in March last and implemented by the Central Fund Act, 1953, provided funds for the carrying on of the public service until about the end of July, which is the normal date by which the Dáil would have completed consideration of the Estimates for the year and the Appropriation Bill would have been enacted.  This further Vote on Account becomes necessary because many of the Estimates for the 1953-54 are not likely to be passed before the existing provision for the public services is exhausted. The further sum required on the account is the sum set out in the Resolution, and this sum will cover another four months up to about the 30th November next.</P>
    <P>As the House, no doubt, understands, this second Vote on Account <Col N="25" /> is a procedural arrangement to enable the Dáil to consider the Estimates still on the Order Paper without any suggestion that discussion might be curtailed by the time factor which would otherwise necessitate the conclusion of the business at the end of this month, while, at the same time, it ensures that the public services are not brought to a standstill about that time for want of funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all there is to the £32,000,000 which is necessary to carry on the State for another four months.  The Minister is very anxious that the House should get time to deliberate on the Estimates without telling the House the real reason for this Vote, which is that the Government depends on the support of five or six associates who normally would likely feel the strain in the next few weeks. They would feel the strain of standing on guard in this House if the debates had to be prolonged over the month of August.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would like to go on for a couple of years if only the population would allow him, but he will avoid the population.  The Government do not dare risk continuing the debates in this House through the summer months because, although their own hard-pressed people may obey the Party Whip, the others could not be relied on to exert the same diligence as the members of the Party. Signs are that the loyalty of these associates is wearing thin.  Yesterday, one of them, who comes into this House and votes against subsidies and votes for all sorts of proposals of a finance type which bring about the situation of misery and destitution there is in the country, goes to the corporation to prepare schemes for the alleviation of the misery which his vote in this House has helped to bring about.  When statistics are quoted to him he says: &ldquo;You can use statistics for many purposes; look out the window there&rdquo;&mdash;that was his pungent observation&mdash;<Col N="26" />&ldquo;and you will see the truth.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. Deputy McGilligan has no right to tell an untruth&mdash;that I made any such observation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is possible for me to speak in this House without alluding to Deputy Peadar Cowan. The Deputy's conscience should not prick him into a recognition that he was responsible.  But Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll said at the corporation the words that I have quoted: &ldquo;Look out of the window if you want to see the truth.&rdquo;  A look out the window, of course, showed, presumably, some of the representatives of the unemployed marching on the street.  That has now become almost a feature of city life, so we are to carry on for another four months.  The country is to carry on under staggering taxation. It is to stagger on until the end of November, by which time, possibly, we will have an opportunity to discuss some of these Estimates.  Possibly, by that time, we will have a Supplementary Budget, and possibly we may have another Vote on Account, and again stagger on for another couple of months if the associates cannot be relied on.</P>
      <P>Let us, in any event, see what we are being asked to continue.  We are asked for a Vote for the services that are in the Book of Estimates.  The old car needs more petrol, more drivers and more oil.  It needs repairs.  As a matter of fact, in the couple of contests it entered recently it met with a few collisions and a few obstacles on the road.  Its teams of drivers and helpers have proved to be unpopular in the country.  The Government know what is required, new entrants and a new car, because they cannot attract support with the same old policy that was instituted through the 1952 Budget, and carried over by this year's Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us have a survey of the results of that policy.  I have quoted in this House over and over again with what the House must regard as nauseating repetition the phrases that marked the <Col N="27" /> bright prospects this country was to enjoy when Fianna Fáil became a Government.  They got into power in this House in 1932.  That is 21 years ago.  The children just born then are now reaching manhood.  Those who were adults then are now middle-aged people.  Three times, with the mystic number of seven years, a Fianna Fáil Government had control in this country.  This was a Government that was concerned only with one evil&mdash;unemployment. In the phrase of the Tánaiste, there need be no unemployment in this country.  There was some system to be put into operation which would give us the answer to the problem of unemployment to a greater extent than that of any other country. The Taoiseach was grieved to see young men and women leaving the country, and promised us that not only would emigration be ended but that there would be a return tide of emigrants, and that under his auspices there would not even be enough people to man the posts which the Government was going to create.</P>
    <P>The 21 years have rolled past.  The babies have become young men, and the adults of that time are now coming into their middle years.  During that period, at least 500,000 of our people have been forced to emigrate, 500,000 people of a population that was to have been increased back to the figure of the old famine days.  That was the Taoiseach's hope&mdash;getting back to a population of 8,000,000 people.  We cannot even sustain the 3,000,000 people that we have.  We could sustain only part of the community by forcing 500,000 out of the country in the last 21 years, and by breaking the spirit and destroying the temperament of another number who have remained.  These represent what is called the hard core of unemployment throughout those years.  The average number on the unemployment register over the years has not been less than 60,000 people. As well as the 500,000 who had to leave, these 60,000 who remained had to drag out whatever life they could on what is called the dole.  Some may have been fortunate enough to get employment at some time during those years.  For the <Col N="28" /> unemployed the only provision made was unemployment insurance.  That was to help them when unemployment could not be avoided.</P>
    <P>This country might have on the birth records a population of 3,500,000 people.  We were told that that was nothing too much to expect the country's resources to stand but hurriedly, we have shifted 500,000 of those and a turn-over of 60,000 through the years have been forced to live idle lives, to live at a rate which, according to the statistics, does not suffice for the sustenance of the human person.  While all that is going on over the years, the value of our currency has slumped, our cost of living year by year has risen, with a corresponding decline in the value of the moneys that people earn by trading in their services.</P>
    <P>Unemployment and emigration were phrased here by the Tánaiste recently as representing a painful process of lowering living standards.  Three years ago he said that whether that took the form of rising unemployment or increased emigration, higher prices or higher taxation, it would represent the defeat of all our hopes for the future of the country.  Whether it took one or other of these forms it represented the defeat of our hopes.  Is it not the quintessence of defeatism that we should have all four&mdash;rising unemployment, increasing emigration, heavier taxation and an increase in the cost of living?</P>
    <P>Last year, when the Minister came before us with his finance proposals, from the House, with the exception of those who were in his own Party and his bedraggled associates, the warning came that there was no necessity for these proposals of his and that, whether there was a necessity or not, the situation at the close of the year would be worse than that when he entered on it. That advice was neither heeded nor taken.  We pointed out that the Minister was working under the thrall of the bankers, that he apparently had been terrified by what they proposed to him with regard to the international balance of payments.  We advised him, knowing the course that events were likely to take, that there was no necessity for any such terror.  We told him <Col N="29" /> that a change in the terms of trade was coming and that in itself would alleviate the difficulties.  We told him that, under the control of Deputy Dillon in the Department of Agriculture, agriculture was on an up-surge and that agricultural exports were bound to rise.  We said they would cross the £100,000,000 mark in the year and we thought we had general agreement that, if they did, there was no necessity for any panic with regard to the balance of payments.</P>
    <P>Those two things fell out as we had foretold.  Notwithstanding that, we had the penalties.  The people were too well off.  Personal earnings had increased by more than the increase in the cost of living and the Government had decided that, under those circumstances, food subsidies had no place and the subsidies were cut.</P>
    <P>We foretold that that would mean that those who had power through their industrial control, through their unions, would seek an increase in wages, as they did.  We asked was there going to be much difference to the community if heavier costs were put upon the business community and removed from the State's Budget. Again, as it was clear it must, that happened when the workers went to the Labour Court and those who had no resort to Labour Courts suffered for a while but again made their strength and their presence felt and they all got the increase that they were bound to get in justice for the increased cost of living that had been forced upon the people by the simple cut in the subsidies of 1952.</P>
    <P>We pointed out that the other exactions that were being made had not the object of trying to put people off the commodities that were being taxed.  There was no case made in this matter that people were consuming too much either in the way of intoxicating liquor or tobacco.  We pointed out that even the Budget hopes would be falsified if those who did consume these things consumed them in less and less quantities because then the revenue would fall and the chief aim of the Budget would have been brought to nought.</P>
    <P>At first it was received with <Col N="30" /> scepticism when we pointed out what the real aim of that Budget was, and that was, the expectation that people would still spend the dearer money that was required for whatever they took in the way of beer, stout or spirits or tobacco and that if these things cost them more and if wages were reduced there was certainly going to be less in the pockets of the workers for expenditure on things like clothes, all types of apparel, the furnishing of the house, the things that people living in family life need and enjoy.  That was clearly demonstrated to be the aim of the 1952 Budget.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, have the result, satisfying to bankers, that if people had not the money in their pockets to call for these goods, then such of these goods as were imported would no longer be imported and so the import list would fall and the balance of payments might in that wrong way be rectified, but a necessary consequence of that was certain to be, as we pointed out, that if people had less money to spend there certainly would be a recession in business and, if there was a business recession, those who served in the shops were likely to go either on unemployment or on half-time wages and that movement can easily continue until one gets from recession to really desperate slump.</P>
    <P>How anybody could have believed that £15,000,000 or £17,000,000 could be exacted from the people of the community without there being the results of less spending and therefore less business activity and therefore more unemployment and possibly more emigration it is hard to believe.</P>
    <P>In two years these results have shown themselves to such a point that the Government are now preparing relief schemes and those who support the Government, who helped to bring that about by their votes here, career off to their various local authorities to try to mend their hand and, by relief schemes, which would possibly be more costly but less useful to the country, try to put an end to the menace, the menace that terrifies even those associates of the Government, the menace of the marching unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> Two years only it has taken the Government to get back to the policy that they ran for their 17 or 18 years&mdash; relief, relief to tide over the lack of ordinary employment, the only difference this year being that the deficit in the way of ordinary employment was brought about by direct Government action, deliberate as far as the members of the Government are concerned, accepted in folly by those who support the Government and did not realise what was on.</P>
    <P>During the two years it has taken them to bring this country back to the old rut that was here from 1932 until 1947, we have had the grudging handling of the financial resources of this country, the fear that the banking channels would not permit a better disposal of the country's financial resources towards plans for development, the reluctance to embark on these plans because that system was not understood by members of the Government. When that system was started and they got their chance to interfere with it, the interference came sharp and sudden and the results have followed just as quickly.  Is it right that this Government, which has clearly lost the confidence of the people, should get money to carry them over another few months?  This is a policy, a relief policy in contradistinction to the policy of development started by those who immediately preceded them.  High taxes, high cost of living, increased unemployment and increased emigration; these have been the bogies over the year, and the Minister, in looking for an extra £30,000,000, might at least have said that there are movements outside which we have to recognise.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Deputies have told the local authorities, the local authorities have told the Press, and the Press have carried it through the country that the Government have plans for relief schemes which will at least carry us over until the end of summer and autumn and maybe bring us to the early winter.  By that time we will have a breathing space and we can have plans for development, plans of a long-term type which fit again into <Col N="32" /> the scheme developed here from 1948 to 1951; plans that might, although hurriedly thought out, lead to some alleviation of the present situation and give the people hope that these conditions of depression brought about deliberately by Government action are over and that a new system will be adopted and tried, even with all the little understanding that the present Government have of that particular type of work.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, one immediate difficulty facing the Government. When this Government have been long forgotten, one thing they have done will be remembered, and that is their attitude towards the technical matter of finance.  I have spoken in this House more than once of the situation that faced the inter-Party Government in 1948 when, having negotiated a £12,000,000 loan, they found that they had not a penny piece of that to spare for the plans they had ahead; that every shilling of that had been mortgaged and that it had all to be spent on meeting the debts the Fianna Fáil Government left behind in 1948.  We did float other loans, and then we were beaten.  When the present Minister came to his office he found, instead of debts, money.  He also found commitments there, but he knows that in the last Budget I was permitted to bring in, I indicated that the policy of the Government I belonged to was to have a new National Loan that year and with that new National Loan, so far as it went, to finance the schemes we had ahead and, so far as what we got from the people was not sufficient, we would skim off, as we did before, some of the sterling equivalent of the American money which had been got and which the Taoiseach described as Mr. Marshall's unparalleled generosity.</P>
    <P>Having arranged one conversion loan at a lower rate of interest, the bankers I approached before these arrangements were made advised me that the better way to do things was to run the conversion loan at one point of the year and the new National Loan almost immediately afterwards on its heels. <Col N="33" /> The present Government so frightened the people with their speeches through that year about the bankruptcy ahead, about the depths of insolvency into which we were going to slip, about how production was down, and everything that was frightening was raising its head, that they could not possibly go to the country for money, and with what was called hectic or reckless Marshall Aid spending, the Minister spent £24,000,000 of the money that he found to his credit.</P>
    <P>When later he did go to seek money from the people he still remembered his old frightening speeches through the country and he had to establish a rate of interest for us here that had its repercussions on the housing plans, the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act loans and everything financed out of public moneys.  He is going to the country this year again.  Will he tell us before this House rises for the summer recess the rate of interest at which he will repay the new loan?  Does he not know well that if, instead of the trick vote of confidence, he brought in proposals for a loan at 5 per cent. or anything more than that, even those people who associate with him in ordinary matters of Government would refuse to pass or applaud that?</P>
    <P>This House will go into recess and when there is no chance of criticising, no chance of discussing, no chance of putting another point of view before the people or the Minister, the terms will be arranged.  The terms will, no doubt, be high.  The Minister, in offering a 5 per cent. loan last year, said that every succeeding loan must give better terms to those who lend than the previous loan.  He has to pay something better than 5 per cent. then.  He must get the money, because there is no longer a fund of the type we had and which we had so cautiously used.  That has been scattered to the winds.  As there is no fund of resources of that type from which £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 might be skimmed off to meet whatever deficiency there might be between the demand and what the Minister might risk asking for, the moneylenders will do better this time than they did even last time and for another period <Col N="34" /> of years this country will be faced with a repayment on extravagant terms of moneys that never should have been borrowed at a 5 per cent. rate and could have been got at something equivalent to 3 per cent. if the Minister had moved in 1951.</P>
    <P>That mark, however, has been left. The Minister disbursed those funds which were a great safeguard and which gave a Minister for Finance the confidence which enabled him to approach the people on terms that the bankers would not advise.  These moneys were there and there was no question of blackmailing the Minister for Finance into accepting a higher rate of interest than he thought should be given, because there was always that safeguard in the moneys which were preserved.  Those are now gone.  The Government that succeed the present one must face that as reality.  They must know that their plans for capital development will have to be met and the financing of these achieved in some way.</P>
    <P>The group that I worked with as a Government had their plans that they would deal in a constructive and in a forthright way with this problem of finance.  No matter what was done propaganda of a scarce type could be used against what was proposed.  It was necessarily a slow process to get the finance houses and the banks to agree that certain views were old-time and that certain forward methods had to be used. Their education was not completed but it had at least started. Again, I have told this House of the time when members of the last Government met a group of bankers of this city in connection with a loan for the corporation&mdash;a loan of £5,000,000. During many hours of one day there was argument as to the difficulty the banks would have in advancing any money for the Dublin Corporation because it was not a worth-while stock and because quotations were hard to get.  And when one considers the £5,000,000 in conjunction with the relatively vast amounts of money that these houses had to invest there was an unanswerable argument that the banks were not straining their resources <Col N="35" /> very much by filtering in £5,000,000 even if it was for the Dublin Corporation loan.</P>
    <P>One of the great arguments that morning, and one of the points that was to be considered, was the disruption that was going to be caused in what was described as the &ldquo;careful mosaic&rdquo; of the banks' investments. To pick out one would upset a balance &mdash;a balance that was a nice association of profit and, of course, the matter of liquidity&mdash;and it was something that required a lot of thought.  The heaviest investment considerations were involved and there was danger ahead if this particular loan was forced upon the banks.  In the end, they agreed that the £5,000,000 loan should be given.  And when it was suggested that certain discussions might take place to see whether the Government had any point of view as to the securities in the portfolio that might be sold to be replaced by a fraction of the Dublin Corporation loan, the last word of the bankers was that it did not matter. They said: &ldquo;We will sell no securities. It only means an entry on both sides of the account.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those in this House who have gone through the debate on the Central Bank Bill know that many hours were spent on that point as to whether the banks had it in their power to create credit or whether they merely took in the customers' money and loaned it forth again.  Even on the morning that argument was conducted about the necessity for selling, in the end the confession was made: you do not need to sell, it is simply an entry on both sides of the books.</P>
    <P>The present Minister may take this credit to himself that he at least has done part of the development.  Any new Minister for Finance must get money for the development that must take place in the country.  When a new Minister for Finance surveys the scene he must make up his mind that certain things are called for.  In this House years ago when the Central Bank was in dispute, one of the points that divided the House was this question of credit, particularly the question <Col N="36" /> of whether export credit could be created, and who was to control it. Secondly, who was to say what would be paid for the resources that were manufactured?  And thirdly, who was to allocate among the different sections of the community whatever credit of that type could be provided?  In certain parts of this House certain people claimed all the time that there was a public duty there, and that it should be in the hands of public representatives. Certain more conservative people claimed that that was dangerous and that this was clearly a function of the banks; that it always had been their function and should be left to them.  I doubt if hereafter there can be any discussion on that point.</P>
    <P>In the trade union document sent out this morning, from the discussions at Killarney and from the other trade union there emerges one point in common, that one of the things that has helped to devastate this country over the last year and a half was the restriction of credit operating in two ways&mdash;the restriction to which the Minister gave in and which forced him to pay more dearly for what was called money than what he should have; but more particularly the bank money and bank credit was harmed and was very rigidly restricted.  In particular, there appears to have been a set on the building industry in this country, and many builders who had not their plans complete found themselves cut short in their operations and found themselves with insufficient credit to carry their schemes to completion.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Government was behind that restriction of credit, that they advised it, and if they did not, then the banks have done it on their own.  But hereafter there should be no dispute on these matters.  That should be a public function, and it should be possible hereafter to pin the responsibility on the Minister for Finance in all matters affecting credit.  In these days of somewhat advanced economics, it is completely wrong that a group of private proprietors should own such a thing as the credit of the country, that it should be in private hands either to restrict or to extend, and <Col N="37" /> that it should be a matter for private judgement to decide in whose favour it should be extended and against whom the restriction should operate. If&mdash;I do not believe this can be the fact&mdash;the banks this year have done that, they have certainly given the people justification for action.</P>
    <P>The bankers control the credit of the country and the Government will tell you they do not interfere.  I think they did interfere in their own way.  But with relations not firmly established and certainly not publicly known, it is not possible to bring the Minister for Finance to book for what has happened in that connection.  But if the banks have done it, the banks stand condemned by the public opinion in this country for what they have brought about.  Even if relief is to be granted in the form of relief schemes it is still the duty of the Government to see that whatever money is used in this way or for that end is not dearly bought and the Minister should not tolerate or accept the fact that the banks are merely lending out customers' funds and because they have got to pay the customers for those moneys they therefore ask to be paid some addition of remuneration based on that theory.  Again, those who were in the House when the Central Bank Bill was discussed will remember the argument as to whether it was right that bankers should be allowed to have any rate of interest at all on money that was not backed by savings deposits.</P>
    <P>Again, one group took the view that they should not and the conservative view, accepting the bankers' point, made the opposite case.  Will anybody here argue soberly that when the bankers have £1,000,000 of what is called real money in their possession, and extend that to £10,000,000 credit, which they do, that they are entitled to charge on the £9,000,000 which they manufacture a rate of interest which they can argue to be appropriate to the £1,000,000 which they have got from their customers?  Yet that is the banking performance and that is the banking system to which the Minister has agreed over the years, only adding to <Col N="38" /> it this extra, that under their persuasion he gave even for that accommodation, a rate of interest that was in no way justified even on bankers' theories.</P>
    <P>We have now at last reached the point where development in this country is regarded as essential.  The only question now is at what rate is that development to proceed?  How is it to be financed?  We cannot go on in the old way.  The results of the old way are clear&mdash;that resources are not developed, that people are not employed while resources are undeveloped, that even the drain-off of emigration does not stop hardship to the 50,000 or 60,000 people who formed in this country over the years the hard core of unemployment.  There is required a radical change.  There is no sign of any change, radical or slight, in the proposals that have come before us.  There were few pivotal or basic or seminal things in this country since 1922.  There were some, however.  This country in the early days saw the sugar-beet industry established.  It is now regarded as a natural growth in this country.  The disappearance of the sugar factories would now be regarded with dismay.</P>

It had lasted up to the present but it is to disappear soon.  It is simply collecting certain institutions of a type that were in competition with the co-operative creameries and it was thought right to hold these until they could be disposed of to the co-operative societies in the neighbourhood.  It was derided too.  The Shannon scheme drew from the then Deputy de Valera the criticism that it was a grandiose scheme, that when the country was being bled white by emigration was no time for it.  He told us that capital would be sunk for a considerable time in it and that it would not benefit the purpose of keeping young people at home.</P>

      <P>I am coming to it. These were what I call seminal things in the old days.  Another seminal things in 1948-49 was the development of what was called the capital Budget and the appreciation that more money had to <Col N="40" /> be spent on development in this country, that that development was not to be narrowed to what might be economically justifiable, that there were certain projects like housing which were desirable, if not on economic grounds, certainly on social grounds.  We gathered together a vast amount of money in comparison to what had previously been applied to these things.  We developed a system of the better division of what was called the supply services as between the ordinary services and the capital ones.  How was that hailed?  The sign of the pawnbroker was put on the hoardings throughout the State.  The nation was in pawn!  The schemes for which money was being asked were derided.  Then the Minister arrived and the question arose: was he going to borrow for these things or how were they to be financed?  Of course the people rebelled at the thought of these being financed out of ordinary taxation. The alternative was which of these was to be dropped and none of them could be dropped.  That was the pivotal thing in the last three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This State previously had moved through the industrial relations legislation to the industrial court, the Labour Court.  From that there was excepted State personnel; the Civil Service, the Guards, Army, and teachers had no resort to that court. Again&mdash;a thing which we regarded as pivotal&mdash;the people with whom I was associated in Government had always urged on some form of arbitration for State personnel.  We established that too.  We know how that was received, &mdash;with allegations that it was unconstitutional to remove the disposal of State funds and put it under the control of an arbitration body.  We know how arbitration was dealt with this year.  We know how State personnel have been deprived of the arbitration board, the chairman of which was agreed to by the Minister.  These were seminal things initiated by the people with whom I was associated in the Government.  I mention these to show the way they were received and how they were criticised.  When I hear now boasts of the progress being made with regard to rural electrification, I sometimes wonder why that was not started <Col N="41" /> earlier because both the original Siemens-Schuckert scheme and the experts' report drew attention to the fact that other countries had gone very far ahead with electrical development in rural areas.  One got a hint of a reason later.  Electricity, so to speak, was something that was tinged with the Cosgrave Government and any development of it would be likely to redound more to the credit of that Government than to Fianna Fáil.  So rural electrification was left over until the war had started and of course it was impossible to get equipment, and even when it was started or the pretence of starting it was made it went along sluggishly until 1948, when we speeded it up and when we also approved of another system of financing it, another system which would permit of still greater speeding up and still greater expenditure year by year on that very valuable advance.</P>
    <P>These are the things that were despised. These are the things we had to put into operation.  In particular we had this system of finance which gave this country three good years which if followed could give this country still good years without any hardship, without any trace of economic difficulty, and that system will be put in operation again, and this country will get the ease that it deserves until its development has been brought further on and until that development begins to yield results as it has even yielded results this year in an increase in agricultural production and therefore an increase in agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>The plan that we see in process of development looking back over the years from Fianna Fáil was that they found this country a naturally agricultural one, but they proceeded to a haphazard and ill-thought system of industrialisation.  They were warned that if that was done at too rapid a pace or in too expensive a way reactions on the agricultural industry were bound to be felt, and they went on.  One side of the Government takes credit here on many occasions for the number of people put into industrial activity, and we will agree that there have been many thousands <Col N="42" /> so occupied, but since 1932 I think it is right to say that there has not been an addition of 100 people to those who were employed in this country, because what has been gained in industry has been lost in agriculture. Agriculture is suffering now from the artificial prosperity of the towns, and the towns are now suffering from the fact that agricultural prices are beginning to catch up on town prices, and the agricultural prices have been raised to such a point that with the exception, I think, of live stock and its various branches there is little or no export for agriculture or industry of this country after nearly 21 years of Fianna Fáil control.</P>
    <P>There is the old rhyme about &ldquo;ill fares the land where wealth accumulates and men decay.&rdquo;  That was our earliest problem&mdash;certain moneys gathered up in this country and invested outside it and men decaying, made take the way out, made follow the money that was made in this country, made go into the production that was financed by the moneys that were made here and were sent abroad.  The phrase has been used that time has reversed the rôle in the rhyme because now the situation is that &ldquo;Ireland's doom like judgment day sees men accumulate and wealth decay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have more men over the years than we can employ even with the drain, the steady drain year after year, across over to America or to England, and we have now men accumulating and the wealth, the potential wealth, certainly that they could produce, not being forthcoming.  We have got the worst of both worlds. At the start it was pulling men from the countryside in the hopes of putting them into industry.  Now while the stream still runs on, the stream of emigration, we have the marching unemployed and at the same time we have the resources of this country channelled into the banks and by the banks channelled into the investing houses in England and by them channelled into the production that our people have to meet in competition; that is the system that Fianna Fáil have developed without change over 21 years and that is the system presumably <Col N="43" /> they intend to continue with. Apparently there is no halt in their pace because 500,000 people have left and because there has been the heartbreak through the years of the 50,000 or 60,000 people trained to be idle while there is work waiting to be done if it can only be financed by the moneys that are being made here and should be invested in this country if there was a proper policy aiming at that.</P>
    <P>The last resort of all this of course is, as well as doles, something that is connected with doles, the Welfare State.  For weeks, we have been discussing the Health Bill.  After the dust of those discussions has cleared away, when it settles, people will see what the reality of that measure is.  As far as what is called the lower element of the community is concerned there is no change, so the Minister told us&mdash;no change from the old red ticket system. As far as the middle income group is concerned, people in that group are invited to avail themselves of the public ward at a cost in respect of certain maternity services.  They are going to be charged &ldquo;an appropriate sum&rdquo; to the amount of not less than 50 per cent of the real cost when that cost is discovered.  For the purposes of the Health Bill an investigation was made and revealed that in the lower group of the people there is lodged 1,000,000 of the population&mdash;one third of our 3,000,000&mdash;who are now grouped under the defination that they cannot by their industry or other lawful means provide themselves with any part of necessary medical services for themselves or their families.  We are going to keep that 1,000,000 on the old system, something like the red ticket; and for the other two groups of roughly 1,000,000 each it is &ldquo;all aboard for the public ward&rdquo;; for the second of the three groups it is for the public ward on the payment, and for services that they have never asked for, never requested and will probably never use.  At the end of 21 years it is a poor result.  One third of the people are discovered to be in a position where they cannot earn enough money by industry or other lawful means to provide themselves <Col N="44" /> with whatever medicines or medical aid they require.</P>
    <P>We have other suggestions of welfare, welfare which costs money, which costs more money than the service itself is worth because heavy administrative expenses are added to the preliminary and basic costs.  Again, there was a proposition in this House for years that even thought this type of dole and other services might be required for a period the aim should be different.  The aim of this Christian community should be to improve conditions by way of wages so that people would have some incentive to work and to produce and to save and that they would be enabled to provide for themselves and their families the things that are now more dearly provided for them by State intervention.</P>
    <P>Presumably, that progress, if it is to be called progress, is still to be maintained. We just tolerate emigration. If the unemployed do not stop us, we will take patiently the unemployed. We can look forward to a further period in which the cost of living will rise and therefore the real value of our money will decline.  Although we have seen the new process of shifting taxes from under Government control to the rates, as between the two the burdens are going to be raised, as the rates will increase while taxes will certainly not go down.  For all that, we have in return an agriculture that has been on the decline since 1932.</P>

      <P>Apparently, the artificial aid given to industry is to be continued.  The community has paid so dearly for that development that it would be criminal to do anything to stop it, but there are many excrescences and many excesses which the people are aware of, and these should be approached boldly and the community's distress lightened by an attack upon defects.  We cannot continue the old programme.  The change that was made in 1948-51 cannot be forgotten.  It is impossible to get the people back into the mood of 1947&mdash; and I know how despairing that mood was.  In this very House, I heard the Taoiseach on his Estimate in 1947 say, when he was challenged about agriculture: &ldquo;For years we have put into operation what plans we could conceive for agriculture and if they have been a failure what can we do?&rdquo;  He appealed to the Opposition: &ldquo;If you have any plan, tell it to me and I will give it a run.&rdquo;  On a challenge with regard to emigration, pretty nearly the same phrase was used.  He had been aided by the description of the Irish as being &ldquo;an adventurous people, who would always, to some degree, go abroad.&rdquo;  He swept that aside and said that would naturally account for only a small number of those who went away.  He again appealed to the House to assist him in getting some plan to stem the terrible tide of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Party was at the end of its tether; certainly, it was at the end of its policy, if it ever had a policy, in 1947.  No one can claim that it has recovered any ground since.  It is merely holding on, and it can hold on, with certain associates' aid.  While it holds on, certain more people who might be saved will drift into the ranks of the unemployed and unemployable. Certain people who might have been allowed to live at home in some sort of comfort will go abroad and those who remain at home, whether occupied or unemployed, however they are living, who might have had their cost of living kept at a certain point or reduced, will suffer <Col N="46" /> in the months that are to come, no matter how few they be.</P>
    <P>That occurs because the present Government, with its discredited policy, still hangs on.  It seems fatuous, with all these things so clearly displayed to the people, that nothing has been learnt by the Government and that they should come here and ask, after the £42,000,000 they got some months ago, for an extra £30,000,000 to continue on the lines that have brought us nothing but the miseries of which I have spoken.</P>

      <P>Listening to Deputy McGilligan brings me back one more to remind the House that in May, 1951, the Government&mdash;it was on the advice of the Minister for Finance, so presumably with the consent of the Government&mdash;made a report on the financial situation at that time, which was a perfect miniature forecast of the Central Bank report that was published later, during the latter part of the year.  In his Budget statement, there was no suggestion that he had conceived some novel method by which emigration could be ended or by which the nation's economic level could be advanced.  His report was dismal in the extreme.  He said that under his Government the sale of foreign assets was being used to lever up consumption, and that it could not go on.  He used a phrase which came out of an economic text book but what it really meant was that in Deputy McGilligan's opinion the people were consuming too much and consuming it through the sale of capital.  He made all these dismal statements.  He foresaw the result of his own Government's failure to control the economic situation.  At the same time, as I have said, he and his colleagues during the whole of their years in office showed no sign that they wished to make any of these fundamental changes in the bank structure about which it is so easy to talk glibly once one is in opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan had a conversation with the bank representatives, we understand, when he was Minister for Finance, over certain capital issues, in exactly the same way as the Government <Col N="47" /> before his had from time to time such conversations.  The last Government made none of these extraordinary innovations in economic policy.  All they did was to break every modern rule of finance, as conceived by a Socialist Government in any neutral country in Europe, or by a Socialist Government in Britain, or by any Liberal Government to be found anywhere in Western Europe.  He made no innovations; he simply broke all the modern rules as we know them and left us with an embarrassing situation to face.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan always talked as if he had the theories of the late Lord Keynes by heart, as if he knew all about how to stimulate trade and industry; but if he were to bring in a major text book written by that famous financier, on which all the talk of modern finance is based, he would not find a single chapter which would recommend the doing of any of the things which were done by the Coalition Government during its régime. He could not find any suggestion that when there is a stockpiling boom in evidence it was wise to borrow huge sums of money from another country and fling them around among the population.  He could not find the late Lord Keynes recommending that in the middle of a stockpiling boom the Budget should be unbalanced.  He would find that all those measures were advocated in a period of precisely the opposite condition. Measures for stimulating credit, such as promoting external loans, or a temporary unbalancing of the Budget, or any of the other things he did, he will find recommended at a time of intense depression when prices are falling. They talk about it as though they did something new.  In fact, it was nothing but financial mismanagement of a kind which has been seen all over the world and which we had to correct. The results for the time being were extremely painful.  Nevertheless, the correction had to be carried out by any Government which was honest and which had the future welfare of the country in mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has not made any <Col N="48" /> real suggestion in the speech which he has just concluded.  He has talked vaguely about the strangulation of credit, about teaching the banks their business and of what their attitude should be to the issue of credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>During the three years of the Coalition régime&mdash;when they had the opportunity to do so, if they wished&mdash;no efforts were made in regard to what might be called a fundamental examination into the credit structure of the country either by way of an inter-departmental commission or any other form of an advisory committee. No evidence was given by the Coalition Government that they were really sincere about changing the system.  All they did was to mismanage the national finances, to leave the country in debt, to swell immensely the adverse balance of payments, and leave to their successors the obligation of correcting a serious situation and balancing the Budget. Nevertheless, nothing stops Deputy McGilligan from talking as though his. Party were due the credit for all the new ideas associated with the development of this State.</P>
      <P>We heard references to the Shannon scheme and to the fact that, at the time, certain members of this Party criticised the engineering plans. Deputy McGilligan did not tell the House that during the three years of the Coalition régime no proposal was made for any extension of electric power in this country with the use of native fuel but that, within a year of the resumption of office by Fianna Fáil, projects for six power stations, using native fuel, were promoted.  I wonder why there was this reluctance on the part of the Coalition Government to continue the development, on what was the very latest and most up-to-date basis, of the use of native fuel and the avoidance of foreign fuel whenever possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan talked about the sugar factories as being yet another example of Fine Gael initiative.  He did not refer to the fact that all the <Col N="49" /> extensions of the sugar factory system were promoted by Fianna Fáil and that, during the three years which the Coalition Government were in office, no effort was made to extend the machinery in the three new factories which the Fianna Fáil Government had left to them but that now Fianna Fáil have promoted the extension of machinery in these factories to provide greater quantities of sugar.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan talked about the invention of the &ldquo;capital Budget&rdquo;&mdash; the separation of the capital items from the current items in the Book of Estimates&mdash;as though it were a major invention on the part of his Government. He gave the impression that all the projects that arose from that purely book-keeping device were also part of the fertile imagination of his Government.  A &ldquo;Capital Budget&rdquo; is purely a book-keeping arrangement.  We have indicated clearly what items are for capital development.  Any member of the House or any member of the public can obtain at this very moment a full indication of the exact items which are being borrowed for and are not provided for by way of taxation.  Virtually all the schemes for which this book-keeping change was made were schemes which had been promoted by Fianna Fáil.  Most of them had been put into operation before the Coalition Government took office.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, despite the book-keeping change that took place at that time, a great many of the schemes were delayed and, in spite of all the boasted advances, did not proceed as fast as we intended them to proceed.</P>
    <P>Rural electrification, housing, arterial drainage, native fuel power projects: all of these were Fianna Fáil plans and all of them were promoted by Fianna Fáil.  In the case of Bord na Móna, considerable delay took place before, at last, that company was permitted to increase its expenditure.  Schemes in connection with harbour works, shipping and aviation were either discarded or pigeon-holed during the Coalition period of office.  One of the schemes about which there was magnificent advertisement by the Coalition Government was the land rehabilitation project. In actual fact, Fianna Fáil have <Col N="50" /> spent many times more on that project than the Coalition Government did in their last full year of office.  That scheme has been amended to the point at which we believe it will work very much better and quicker in view of the expenditure now sanctioned.  It is not very easy for the Fine Gael Party to advocate to the public that they invented national development works in this country but I mention these facts lest there should be some foolish people &mdash;particularly those who are employed on those schemes&mdash;who might have some lingering idea that the construction of one sugar factory and the promotion of the first electric power scheme give Fine Gael the right to talk as though they were the progenitors of national development.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan then talked as though the flight from the land&mdash;which has been a universal feature of most Western European countries&mdash;is something peculiar to Fianna Fáil Government.  During the Coalition period, if the figures were examined&mdash;I cannot give them exactly &mdash;they would show that the flight from <Col N="51" /> the land was to some degree more rapid than it had been in the previous three years.  There was no change. People were leaving the land more quickly than ever.  Deputy McGilligan talks as though emigration were invented by Fianna Fáil, but about 100,000 people emigrated during their period.  He spoke as though there were some connection between the fact that moneys from Great Britain had been invested here and the policy of Fianna Fáil and emigration, as though the three were linked inextricably together.  During the Coalition Government's régime, this country lost £120,000,000 of foreign assets and lost also 100,000 people.  The average number of unemployed from the beginning of their régime to the end, taking the year as a whole, was about the same.  I am not saying that they as a Government were responsible for anything like the whole of the £120,000,000.  It was due partly to post-war changes and to many other factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I should follow Deputy McGilligan too far along the ground of using figures simply to make a political point.  Since he started to make a political point, I am at least entitled to reply to him in his own vein.  A sum of £120,000,000 was repatriated from the Great Britain to this country and nevertheless 100,000 people left the country.  It did not seem to have any effect, so far as we could see, on the problem of emigration, and I should like to repeat now, for the twentieth time in the past two years, that, looking back on the difficulties we have had in solving this problem of emigration and realising that there have been four administrations, I automatically brand as dishonest any Deputy, regardless of the Party he stands for, who makes use of emigration, blithely and glibly, to justify the policy of his Party or to criticise the policy of another.  No one has succeeded in solving that problem.  I am glad to say that we in Fianna Fáil have not rushed around the country promising that there would be no more emigrant ships leaving the country, as was done by some of the Parties who supported Fine Gael, because we are <Col N="52" /> aware that it is a difficult problem to solve and one which cannot be solved overnight.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan gave us the usual kind of vague hint that, if he had a chance of administering the national finances, something would be done about the external assets, but he never goes into any further detail, nor does any member of his Party.  During the course of the recent by-elections, vague statements were made that it was essential to repatriate foreign assets for national development, but the Opposition never faced up to answering one simple question.  In relation to the net foreign reserve of this country representing the difference between the many millions which we owe abroad at present&mdash;something in the neighbourhood of £250,000,000&mdash; and what we are owed by other countries abroad&mdash;a sum which is reckoned to be approximately £120,000,000&mdash;they have never faced up to saying how much more of it they are going to spend than was spent last year, whether they want to spend a higher proportion of that amount and how they would set about doing it.  All we know from their published statements is that they are going to do something about it, but they do not say what, nor do they give any indication of what is to be the position of this country, if they increase enormously the rate of repatriation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the figure known to us is approximately £120,000,000.  The gross amount is not what has to be considered in calculating the sum which we maintain abroad for trading purposes to ensure that we can negotiate purchases of goods from every country in the world where sterling can play whatever part is possible under existing financial circumstances. No economist has ever seriously suggested that you should count the gross sum, the money we have invested abroad, without considering the fact that we owe abroad some £250,000,000. I have not got the exact figure, but it is of that order&mdash;between £200,000,000 and £300,000,000.  Nobody has ever suggested that the net sum is much larger than £120,000,000.  We went into debt and sold foreign <Col N="53" /> reserves to the tune of £61,000,000 in 1951.  In 1952, the sum was about £9,000,000 and one could make a rough estimate and say that £9,000,000 could be regarded as money used for the purchase of capital machinery and equipment for productive use.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil, if it is possible to do so, are perfectly prepared to liquidate more foreign assets for capital productive purposes which will result in an increase in our exports and a decrease in our imports.  We never hear any specific proposals from the Opposition in regard to how that should be done; we never hear the Opposition say they would like to make a proposal that we should produce the £20,000,000 worth of food we are importing at this moment, that they would like to see the Government spending some of these foreign assets, the result of which would be a certain reduction in the import of that food which is still being imported unnecessarily and which could be grown here. We never have any succinct and definite proposal for a definite method by which we could make use of foreign assets to extend our exports.  We only hear vague and woolly talk about these assets being repatriated, if, by some means or other, they ever have a chance of administering the country.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil knowing that the repatriation of assets is something which proceeds by a most tortuous method&mdash;it takes about ten minutes to describe the elaborate processes by which deposits are created in banks and goods returned&mdash;and knowing the difficulties of directly stimulating the repatriation of foreign assets in a way which we can be certain will do actual good to the country, simply prefer to say that we have every intention of making sure that there is an adequate trading reserve, of maintaining that reserve for our trade and that we would look forward to seeing any method of spending foreign assets which would result in increasing the productive capacity of the country.  That seems to me to be not in the least conservatives&mdash;a thoroughly up-to-date and modern concept in regard to this matter. <Col N="54" /> I do not believe in being unduly conservative, nor unduly wasteful in regard to the consideration of our foreign investments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the exact sum has ever been computed.  I do not think the Coalition Government ever stated what would be required during their term of office.  If, however, the Deputy wishes to have an example, it is that, if to most European countries we sell only £1 worth of goods for every £10 worth of goods we import, and if we have continually and perpetually to go to the British banking authorities, to the mercantile authorities of Great Britain, and say: &ldquo;You are going to pay the balance of £9,000,000 for us in one form or another, either by making use of a surplus of trade between ourselves and Great Britain or by using the interest on our foreign investments for the purpose&rdquo;, and if that has been the position for years and is going to be the position, the reserve must be considerable.  I have never yet made up my mind as to what the minimum reserve should be, but a year's imports at present bears some relation to £120,000,000 and indicates that the reserve should at least be of some magnitude, if we are to ensure our being able at all times to request the British banking authorities to carry out these transactions for us and to ensure that we will not have to go to them and say: &ldquo;We want you to lend us £10,000,000 to finance our imports from a whole group of countries in Europe to whom we sell practically nothing.&rdquo;  That is the position we wish to avoid and I should like to think that it is a matter about which there should be no difference of opinion in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say a few words to dispel once again the atmosphere of gloom that has been created by the Opposition in regard to present day economic conditions.  We have said repeatedly and we now say again that economic conditions are improving.  The <Col N="55" /> adverse effects of the stockpiling boom and the subsequent recession are passing away as far as we can see from all the evidence available to us.  We have noted an increase in agricultural exports in 1952 and, again, in 1953. We have noted with very great pleasure that the volume of transportable goods produced shows an increase for the first three months of this year compared with the first three months of last year.  We are glad to hear that there has been a real increase in the national income in 1952 in spite of the many difficulties through which we passed and in spite of the misrepresentation of the financial position which might by itself have been calculated to contract business even more than seemed inevitable as a result of the stockpile.  We have noted that the agricultural income increased considerable in 1952 and that the income of workers was increased during that year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We see evidence of improved economic conditions.  The Government's policy of balancing the Budget, of ensuring high capital expenditure and of going ahead more rapidly and more efficiently with the many Fianna Fáil projects which we left to the last Government in 1947 are having the effects we predicted.  We still face a measure of excessive unemployment which is now having the very special attention of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> Some of this unemployment is due to stockpiling and prevailed everywhere in the world.  Some is due to the fact that people believed prices would go down and that the prices of raw materials would be reduced as a result of the ending of war tension and they hesitated to buy.  Unemployment arising from that position has been diminishing but it is still with us.  The prices of many of the raw materials that went up as a result of the Korean war have not gone down as much as it was expected and some of them which went down temporarily have recently been going up for reasons absolutely beyond our control&mdash;commodities imported for whose prices we have no responsibility.  All we can do in that respect is to make a rough forecast that, unless there is some international situation which we cannot predict creating tension and if the £ is not changed in value, prices, we believe, will be reasonably stabilised and it will not pay anyone in this country, whether consumer, retailer, wholesaler or manufacturer to delay purchasing raw materials and help to set the wheels of trade still more in motion than they are at the present time.  Evidence of that is shown by the fact that the volume of transportable goods produced by our industries for the first quarter of this year shows an increase&mdash;it is a small but very desirable increase&mdash;over that for the first quarter of last year.</P>
    <P>We are doing our best to face this question of unemployment.  Extensions of industries and new industries are being promoted which should employ a number of workers.  We have noted something which apparently was never examined by the last Government that some fluctuations in Dublin building apparently are inevitable from time to time and while more people will be employed and are being employed by the Dublin Corporation there are inevitable fluctuations.</P>
    <P>We have noted that in a very considerable number of local authority areas county council building and urban council building are either being completed or have reached completion. With a view to combating unemployment in connection with <Col N="57" /> building under those heads, we are doing what we can to advance the coming into fruition of public works schemes financed by Government moneys.  We are examining every scheme with a view to providing some reasonably secure employment for those who are unemployed in the building trade and who have been unemployed partly as a result of fluctuations in Dublin building and partly as a result of the completion of local authority housing projects.  In addition to that, the Government is also examining the promotion of special schemes to solve the unemployment problem in particular areas, where the normal run of Government public works is unable to do so.  It will also be essential for the Government to examine any unreasonable hindrances that exist in connection with private building.  If those unreasonable hindrances exist in my opinion they will have to be dealt with in a courageous manner.</P>
    <P>I think it is essential to maintain as high a level as possible of private building, particularly of the bungalow small type of private house which can be built for about £1,800 because local authority building is diminishing in many areas and the problem of unemployment must arise.  It is difficult, naturally, to promise that the whole volume of building labourers in any one district engaged on local authority schemes will necessarily be employed in that district.  That might be beyond the capacity of any Government. We will see what we can do to maintain as large a volume of building of one kind or another as is possible in relation to the national economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan talked a lot about monetary conditions, banking structure and the conditions of credit. Looking back on the very difficult conditions which we faced, first of all, during the war depression and economic dispute with Great Britain and later during the world war and during our very short period of office following the world war when we were preparing plans for making use of materials that were not available for a number of years, I should not say that up to now the monetary conditions <Col N="58" /> over which the Government have no immediate control ever prevented us from giving greater large scale permanent employment to workers in this country.</P>
    <P>The flight from the land is a thing we regret but it is a thing which affects practically all countries.  Even in Denmark, where the population of Copenhagen is 1,200,000 people as compared with the country's total population of 4,200,000 there has been an exodus of workers from the land.  As a result farm machinery has been introduced to a greater degree.  In so far as employment in industry or Government works up to now is concerned, the present Government has been able to provide and find money for credit without making any fundamental changes in the monetary structure of the country. Should monetary conditions ever demand our departing from the present system and should there be new conditions and should the effect of the world war or the effect of changes taking place in Great Britain affect this country, as one who has made a fairly extensive study of credit in a general way, I should have no hesitation in insisting on our taking such action as is required to change the credit system.  My own belief is that other members of the Government are fully in accord with that idea, that if it should prove even now essential to make a change, the change must be made in the interests of the people of this country.  We can be perfectly certain that any change will be accompanied by some adverse circumstances; most changes of that kind bring bad as well as good results.</P>
    <P>We have always managed to gain co-operation from the authorities concerned with credit, in providing capital for public works and in stimulating industry. At least we did not do what Deputy McGilligan did.  We do not talk vaguely on the matter, make vague proposals that are never substantiated and in fact make no real changes at all. We have not done what Deputy McGilligan has done&mdash;talk again vaguely of these matters, at the same time remaining in office for three years without trying to form a small economic committee, even with a few personal friends or supporters of his <Col N="59" /> own to make the many searching inquiries that would be needed before taking any grave step in regard to changes in the credit structure.</P>
    <P>As all intelligent members of the House know, we cannot make changes of that kind simply by putting forward a memorandum at a Government meeting and then deciding within two or three weeks to make the change.  It requires deep study and I think myself the attitude of Deputy McGilligan in talking as though he were full of fancy ideas is hypocritical in the extreme.</P>
    <P>I should mention in connection with our programme for dealing with the unemployment problem that the Government never at any time gave any orders to the banks to restrict credit.  No such instructions were given to the banks.  Bank advances at the present time are something in the neighbourhood of over £100,000,000.  During the term of office of the Coalition Government, when stockpiling was at its very maximum and when everybody had borrowed all the money that he could, when every firm had borrowed all the money it could to purchase raw materials believing they were going to go higher in price or perhaps believing that there might be a war, the bank advances were something not much more than £20,000,000 above that figure. That is the position.  I have no knowledge of what the immediate effect of bank credit has been upon the employment-giving agencies here.  All I know is that if at the very height of stockpiling the bank advances were something in the neighbourhood of £120,000,000, the present figure does not indicate that we have given orders of a kind that would suggest economic strangulation or that we have given any orders whatever to the banks.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already our various schemes for dealing with the unemployment problem and, of course, I should mention again, in passing, the fact that our capital Budget is very much higher than that of the Opposition.  It totals some £40,000,000 already for the current financial year, compared with £24,000,000 over the last two full years of their term of <Col N="60" /> office.  In connection with that capital expenditure in practically every single aspect of development, a great deal more work is being done at the present day than was done in the year 1950, their last year of office. Whether it is the number of consumers who have joined the electricity network, or the number of acres of land reclaimed, the number of houses completed by local authorities, the production of machine-won turf, shipping development or the amount that is being spent on harbours, no matter what scheme is examined, it will be found that more work is being done.  For example, in 1952, 120,000 acres of land were reclaimed as compared with 26,000 acres in 1950.</P>
    <P>I mention this because we are doing all we can to expand agriculture which is, of course, the long-term method of creating purchasing power and solving the unemployment problem. It is important to point out what is being done specifically to aid farmers to improve production.  We have provided greater facilities for the purchase of machinery.  The deposit is now only one-tenth of the cost, and in regard to the amount of money that can be obtained by any one borrower for the purchase of machinery based on two good sureties, the limit has been increased to £750.  The farm buildings grants have been increased from 25 per cent. to 66 per cent. in respect of the amount that can be granted for any one specific type of farm building.  Soil testing has been trebled in volume.  More staff and more facilities have been provided for that immensely valuable work.  The amount of limestone that has been put down in the country is six times greater this year than it was in 1950.  We have a very greatly increased number of cattle-breeding stations to aid in the breeding of better cattle.</P>
    <P>I need not now go into the various aspects of agricultural policy as I did at some length on the occasion of the debate on the vote of confidence.  In any event for every single type of scheme to improve agricultural production, more money is being provided and the facilities have been improved <Col N="61" /> by the present Government in the hope that farmers will have the confidence to go ahead with long-term schemes for increasing output.</P>
    <P>That is a fairly detailed account of the many measures that have been taken by the Government to deal with the unemployment problem that exists and which was a heritage from the conditions we found on taking office in 1951.  I have also indicated that so far as all the figures tell us economic conditions are improving this year and the recession period which was common to all countries in Western Europe, even to neutral countries, is so far as we can see passing away at a speed which gives us confidence in the future.</P>
    <P>As I indicated when I started speaking, it would be essential for us as long as this House exist to combat the kind of propaganda which suggests we are not a Party with initiative and inventiveness.  I would like to end on that note.  Deputy McGilligan made a valiant but hopeless effort to give the idea that Fine Gael in some way or other were the people with imagination in public life, whereas in fact most of the schemes which they administered were our schemes.  With one or two small exceptions, practically everything that was being done by the Government of this country to foster prosperity, to bring about an improvement in the workers' interests, to increase production and to diversify employment and make this land a better place, most of the great projects, most of the invention, have always sprung from the minds of the people on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>In ordinary circumstances I would not think it necessary to speak on this second Vote on Account for the present year but in view of certain difficulties that exist in the country we in the Labour Party think it is necessary that again the attention of the Government ought to be brought to these problems.  I rather expected that in the introduction of this Vote on Account the Minister would make some specific proposals, hints of which seem to have been leaking out in the past few weeks, with regard to what the Government intends <Col N="62" /> to do with the very difficult unemployment situation.  I do not think there is much use now in making any comparison, especially a comparison to score a political point, between the numbers that were unemployed in either of the last two years with the numbers unemployed during the three years of inter-Party Government, or even with the years during which Fianna Fáil were in power up to 1948. The important thing is that at the moment we have some tens of thousands of people who cannot find employment.  One may quote statistics and try through the medium of figures to disprove the fact that a certain situation exists.  The evidence is all around us, as every Deputy must agree.  The evidence is not alone in Dublin ; it exists also in our own constituencies whether we represent the big towns or the small towns, or just a rural area; but unemployment seems to be especially prevalent in Dublin.</P>
      <P>Whilst certain people may criticise the actions of some of those who are unemployed in Dublin and try to disclaim responsibility for unemployment by alleging Communism, or some other &ldquo;ism&rdquo;, against the people who demonstrate, we must all agree that there is a problem and that it is a problem which must be faced by the Government, in particular, and by Parliament in general.  It may be unfortunate that the people who are unemployed and who demonstrate provoke ill-feeling amongst some in this city.  That is a sad state of affairs but the demonstration in itself is a symbol that unemployment has reached unusual dimensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to score any political point in relation to the numbers unemployed in Dublin or in the rest of the country.  I merely want to bring home to the Government the seriousness of the situation and to elicit from the Government what solution it has to alleviate the present situation.  It must be a matter of concern to the Government to know that the numbers of unemployed have increased by 55 per cent. over the last two years.  I take the last two years not for any particular significance but because I am addressing my remarks to a Government <Col N="63" /> that has been in office for that particular period.  That increase must give cause for alarm.  In May, 1951, the unemployment figures stood at 49,000 ; in May, 1952, they had risen to 61,000 ; and in May of this year the number of unemployed had risen to 76,200.  I agree right away that a small proportion of that 76,200 can be explained away by the fact that the Social Welfare Act, 1952, brought more people within the number of those who register as being unemployed.</P>
    <P>The fact is that there are these tens of thousands of people clamouring for work all over the country.  I said on a former occasion&mdash;let me repeat it now &mdash;that some of us hoped that the promise given by the Government that Government policy would be designed to reduce unemployment might have shown results after a certain period. We find, however, that despite the Government's endeavours, whether they be their worst or their best, the situation has not become any better but has, on the contrary, worsened. The Government must have come to realise by now that they will have to take steps to combat this problem.  I think they are beginning to realise that and the evidence at the moment goes to show, especially in Dublin, that the Government are trying hurriedly to formulate some sort of proposal, or proposals, as an expedient to give some consolation to those people who find themselves out of work.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to analyse the position and to see actually where the unemployment is and where suitable schemes of work can be started and to what particular areas and sections the Government can give assistance from that point of view.  In April of this year there were registered as unemployed 36,500 in the urban areas.  In the rural areas the figure was 47,500.</P>
    <P>To-day I listened to references on both sides of the House to what has been done since 1922 and 1936.  I think it is a shocking reflection on all the Governments we have had to say that there are a mere 12,000 more people in employment to-day than there were in 1926.  I think all of us must take some share of the blame <Col N="64" /> for that situation whether we be Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, Labour or inter-Party, or even Independent.  I do not think we can say we have made much progress in view of that situation. Neither can we take any consolation from the fact that over that particular period practically 500,000 Irish men and women emigrated, mostly to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I would deal with the unemployment position as it has been and as it now is after two years of Fianna Fáil administration. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs laid the blame to-day on the inter-Party Government.  He said the policy pursued by that Government was responsible for unemployment in 1951 and 1952.  His argument is wearing a bit thin for 1953, but he still persists in laying the blame at the door of the inter-Party Government because of the policy pursued during its régime.</P>
    <P>A break-down of the unemployment figures will not substantiate his argument. The numbers unemployed in the manufacture of food or the processing of food in April, 1951, stood at 2,173. In April, 1953, it had increased to 3,319.  I blame that on the budgetary policy enunciated by the present Minister for Finance in April, 1952.  The fact is that that budgetary policy at that particular time meant that our people from that time onwards could no longer spend what they had been in the habit of spending on foodstuffs. The numbers unemployed in the clothing industry in April, 1951, stood at 1,639.  In April, 1953, the figure had increased to 2,262.  The Minister may blame that on stockpiling but I think I read a debate here&mdash;if I am challenged I will get the reference&mdash;in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that stockpiling in the clothing industry would not adversely affect the clothing trade and that the unemployment that existed in the beginning of 1951 as a result of stockpiling could be resolved in a number of months.</P>

      <P>On the section, I should like to make a plea to the Minister that he should extend the scope of it to embrace the widows of persons who are in receipt of service pensions or of persons who are in receipt of either special allowances or disability pensions.  I regard the Bill, on the whole, as being pretty generous. As far as I am concerned, it is more generous than I had anticipated. One can appreciate the many difficulties the Minister had in bringing it in, but at the same time I would make a plea to him to extend this section to include the payment of pension or allowances to the widows of pensioners, irrespective of the date the latter died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us appreciate the fact that those who were in receipt of pensions, special or disability allowances did trojan work for this country during what we now describe as the troubled times.  We must also appreciate the fact that, in many cases, their wives also did trojan work for the country. They suffered a great deal during the troubled period from 1916 to 1922. They engaged in activities which were publicly recognised.  Many of us can <Col N="66" /> call to mind examples of that type of widow.  I think that, if the Minister could be persuaded to do what I suggest, he would not only be showing a recognition of the services which were rendered by the husbands of these widows, but also a recognition of the part which they themselves undoubtedly played in the struggle of that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that decision is going to bring us all back to a difficulty which most of us feel is there.  We all appreciate the efforts which the Minister has made in this Bill.  Yet, I think we feel that this decision will only lead to further complications.  I think it would be well, in the interests of the Bill itself, that the Minister might consider, between now and the taking of the Bill in the Seanad, widening its scope. Otherwise it is only going to lead to a succession of individual hardship cases being brought forward.  It is going to lead to a continuation of the inevitable trek of Deputies interested to the Minister or his successor in the hope of getting these hardship cases ameliorated.  We all know that there are such cases.  Even though the amendments have been ruled out, the Minister, I think, might give consideration to the spirit in which they were put down.  It was to facilitate dealing <Col N="67" /> with these cases generally while at the same time trying to exclude, as far as humanly possible, differentiations and distinctions which might lead to hardship in certain types of cases.</P>
      <P>I am sure that the Minister is more than sympathetic to the type of appeal that has been made to him by Deputy Corish.  We are all aware that many of those who made contributions to the struggle for liberty are unhonoured and unsung, and that a marathon part in that effort was played by many unnamed wives or other collaborators of those who fought at that time.</P>
      <P>I appreciate, as I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, the difficulty which the Minister found himself in apropos of a situation of economic stringency. I am urging this view on the House in the spirit of unanimity that prevails here in relation to all the people who made sacrifices to win for us the liberty that we now enjoy.  It is in that spirit that we should try to make the Bill wide enough in scope and generous enough in conception to give some rest to the unending quest of various organisations to the Minister to amend some special section of an Act so that it might embrace other cases.</P>
      <P>The Minister, I am sure, will appreciate that Deputy MacEoin, in putting down these amendments, did so in the spirit of one who has been very intimately associated with the different type of case in respect of which pleas have from time to time been made to various Ministers.  We have no desire to impede in any way the progress of this Bill.  We are prepared to give the Minister the co-operation that is required to expedite its passage through the House, but at the same time we would appeal to him to endeavour to widen its scope at some stage in the Seanad so as to ensure that no specific statutory date or no circumstances which might be described as fortuitous or gratuitous, would operate to prevent a worthy person from reaping some benefit under it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unless the Bill is made completely comprehensive the Minister can say to me that there will be cases where a line of demarcation will weigh heavily <Col N="68" /> against someone.  My own feeling on the matter may be generally summarised in this way: that, even if we were to err on the side of generosity, most of us in this House, in dealing with this particular class or section of the community, would prefer that our sin was one of generosity rather than of differentiation or niggardliness.  As regards the type of person affected by Section 3, I would urge the Minister, despite the fact that these amendments have been ruled out, to consider the position of all people affected by this type of legislation, and to appreciate, as he must, that anything we do by way of a generous contribution for that class, is going to be a diminishing charge.  He should take this opportunity of making this Bill an Act under which all barriers are swept away and through which all that a grateful nation felt it could give had been given to those who had been, as it were, the very foundation of its coming into being.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the request of the Mansion House Committee I want to say to the Minister that Section 3 of the Bill should deal with the relatives of all deceased persons.  As the section stands it provides for the relatives of deceased persons who died prior to a date in 1925 or, in certain cases, 1927, as a result of a wound or disability attributable to service.  These limiting provisions confine the benefits of these allowances to a very small number.</P>
      <P>The Mansion House Committee make the point that there is no reason in equity why these allowances should not be paid to widows and dependents irrespective of the date of death and they asked me&mdash;and I support their claim&mdash;to suggest that there should be no limiting date in the section and that the Minister between this and the next stage should consider removing the restriction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been made that a man can die at any time and that a widow should not be penalised because he lived too long.  That, in effect, is the position under the section, that a widow can be penalised simply because her husband lived too long.  I know, and the House knows, that there is no <Col N="69" /> such intention behind the section but that is the effect of it.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, between this and the next stage of the Bill, to reconsider the point which has already been made on the Second Reading.  He may find it possible, without any great difficulty, to remove that limitation.  I would very strongly press the Minister to consider it.  It is not simply an idea of my own.  It is an idea that has behind it the whole weight of the organised bodies of the Old I.R.A. who have come together in what is known as the Mansion House Conference for the purpose of endeavouring in every way they can to remove anomalies in the Acts and grievances as far as recipients are concerned in regard to pensions legislation.  I would strongly recommend that the limiting provisions of the section be deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have all the sympathy in the world with the point of view put forward by Deputy Cowan and other Deputies, I realise that no country in the world can do full justice to the relatives of the men who fought and died in a war of independence.  I feel that a four-year period, as expressed in this section, is rather short. From the fullness of my experience as a member of the Registration Board that dealt with the cases under the 1932 Act and bearing in mind the human story that is contained between the covers of the files of applicants for disability pensions, an unknown story of glorious heroism of the relatives, the fathers and mothers, sisters and brothers, of the men who fought for this country and who died for this country, I feel that we as a Parliament, through legislation, could never render the measure of justice that is due to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I wish to express my personal opinion in the matter.  I feel that this four-year period is rather short.  A man must have died within four years of the receipt of his wound on military service and as a result of that wound before the relatives can benefit under this particular section. In the case of a man who contracted disease, there is a limiting date, as has been pointed out.  How far one would go in extending that date is a <Col N="70" /> debatable point and whether it would be possible to include all persons under any legislation is a matter of doubt.</P>
    <P>If we take the Bill as it stands, as a measure of justice, and agitate in future, as far as we possibly can, for an extension to other classes of persons of the benefits conferred on the limited few in this Bill, we would be at the moment doing our duty by our people and by our comrades in the struggle for independence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it would be well for me to make this point clear on this section.  The Minister may recall that on last Thursday night it was because some of us were interested in the possibility of bringing in amendments that we did not agree to the measure going through that night or on Friday. We are as sorry as anyone else that we should cause any delay.  We accept the fact that certain amendments which we put down were ruled out of order, but I know the Minister will realise that we wanted to keep within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our anxiety is with regard to the position of the retired Army men who will be covered under this section in connection with pensions.  We all agree that undoubtedly this Bill is a step forward, and even more than a step forward in regard to consideration for the people who will come under it.  It is true, as the Minister said, that there are bound to be borderline cases. While, apparently, the Minister is confined within certain specific lines under the military pensions code, I think that the differentiation between the lower-grade pensioner and the higher-grade pensioner is rather complicated.  I can appreciate the Minister's difficulty and, because of that, I can see where he stands in this matter.  But we must <Col N="72" /> understand, also, that in the case of certain percentage increases being given to ex-military personnel, those from the rank of lieutenant upwards will undoubtedly gain an advantage under this section, because it is quite plain that just before an officer retires on pension he is promoted to a higher rank.  But the men who retired in 1947, whether they were corporals or sergeants, and who had not the advantage of getting promotion prior to leaving the Army, are undoubtedly at a disadvantage.  I am aware that the difficulties which arise in this matter under the code operating at present are not possible of being surmounted. I ask the Minister, however, in fairness to these men in the lower grades to take into consideration that the pensions they get and the increases they are getting are relatively much smaller.  Owing to the families which these men in the lower grade have to keep, as against the number in the family of some captain or somebody higher up who undoubtedly gets advantages under this Bill and other Bills which have not been given to the lower ranks in the Army, it is much harder on these men to exist on the small pension they get.  As Deputy Hilliard mentioned, all we can do perhaps at this stage is to hope that we may be near the day when legislation will be introduced to help those who need help and not those who are fairly well off.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister anything to say about amendment No. 10, in regard to which there was an anxiety on the part of Deputy MacEoin that he should take power which would give him the opportunity in a case of real hardship in which he might be anxious to exercise his discretion to do so?</P>

      <P>I want to deal with one small point in regard to this particular <Col N="73" /> section.  Sub-section (2) (b) says that the section will not apply in the case of a deceased person whose death was due to any serious negligence or misconduct on his part.  In the discussion of this matter my attention was drawn to the fact that there might be cases where in fact the death might be due to what might be termed misconduct, but that the misconduct might arise from the effects of wounds or injuries or the treatment for them.  It would be a matter of a very simple drafting amendment to provide that if the misconduct was due either to the effect of wounds or disease or the treatment for wounds or disease the relatives would not be deprived of the allowance.  I think the Minister will agree that it is simply a matter of putting in a form of words which would cover that.</P>
      <P>A case was mentioned to me of a person who, as a result of very serious injuries, was obliged to take drugs and, under the effect of the drugs, took more of them than he should have taken and in that way brought about his death, which could be considered death by misconduct, and the widow in these circumstances would not benefit.  It is a very simple amendment and I think the Minister will be able to meet the point, which again is put forward by the Mansion House Committee.</P>

      <P>I support the appeal made to the Minister from all sides of the House to make this particular concession with regard to the qualifying date.  I am not in a position to know, as I suppose the Minister is, what would be the cost of such a concession. But, whatever it is, I think the Minister should consider the case which has been put up by other Deputies and by the organisation of the Old I.R.A.  We are all anxious to see justice done in these matters.  I am one of those who hold that when legislation is going through providing for expenditure it should be accompanied by a provision for meeting the expenditure out of revenue.  Of course, unfortunately, the position is that at certain times we have legislation for increased expenditure and we are all in favour of it, but <Col N="74" /> at other times, when it comes to a question of raising the necessary money by taxation, we are inclined to oppose that increased taxation.  It would be a good thing if the two sides of the Bill could be presented to the House together so that those who advocate increased expenditure would also advocate the necessary taxation to meet it.  But if this concession which is asked for by all the Deputies in the House for the Old I.R.A. does involve increased taxation I am sure no member of the House will object.</P>

      <P>While I thoroughly agree with Deputies Cowan and Collins and the last speaker, it would be well for the House to remember that between 1948 and 1951 the only pensioners in the State who received no increase were the Old I.R.A., with the exception of the small increase in the disability pension.  I remember putting down a question to the Minister for Defence at the time asking what it would cost to increase the special allowances by 25 per cent., and I was told £250,000 and that the Minister had no intention of doing that.  It would be well to bear that in mind.  I think the Minister has gone a long way to meet appeals from all sides.  While we would all wish him to extend the scope of the Bill&mdash;and I would especially like to see widows of deceased persons who are drawing special allowances getting something, because those people are really the people that I am most interested in, these people who are destitute and incapable of looking after themselves.  But it would be well for the people who are speaking to view the picture as it existed between 1948 and 1951.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to postpone a final decision on this Bill and to give Deputies a further opportunity of handing in amendments to it.  The Minister, I am sure, will agree that it is a very difficult Bill for the layman to peruse and to find out the true meaning of each particular section and amendment.  I think it is <Col N="75" /> only after a good deal of consideration that Deputies will realise that there are some snags in it that could be, I believe, remedied without any great increase in taxation.</P>

      <P>Even if it is an increase in taxation I believe the nation owes it to those who are disabled and to those who have died and to their widows.  After 700 years, the I.R.A. was the only successful army in this country.  It regained the nation's freedom and I doubt if there is even one man in this country who would honestly believe that increased taxation was not fully justified.</P>
      <P>Some men now find themselves in the position that their lives have been cut short because of the abnormal activities and abnormal hardships they went through in the days of 1920 and 1921 and later periods.  I doubt, as I said, if there are any people who would object.  I think the House as a whole appreciates that the Minister has been going a certain distance but, unfortunately, this Bill does not cover many deserving cases.  I take the opportunity of mentioning the case of the widow of Jim Stapleton.  No man gave greater service than he gave. His wife is now an invalid and depending, possibly, on the meagre earnings of some relatives.  I do not think that any other nation in the world would allow the widow of such a man as Jim Stapleton to live in impecunious circumstances &mdash; a man of so many activities, many of them individual, to his credit.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to try and take into consideration the granting of a decent allowance to Jim Stapleton's widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said the Bill is intricate.  It has been very difficult for the ordinary layman to deal with.  Deputies with legal knowledge, like Deputy Collins and others, are naturally able to interpret it and find out where many little snags are.  I think, therefore, we should have a postponement of a few days with the agreement of the Minister to give further time to consider <Col N="76" /> amendments, or perhaps the Minister would bring them in himself.  I do not think it would hold up the Bill unnecessarily. I think the Bill could be dealt with in a few hours next week, and it would give the Deputies a greater opportunity of making a better case for the many deserving cases that they now find confronting them.  We must always try as far as we can to have equality in so far as old soldiers of the I.R.A. are concerned. Making fish of one and flesh of the other is bad.  I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter.  After all, some of these amendments may not cost the State very much&mdash;I hope they will not&mdash;but even if the State or posterity in a few years' time were faced with a little extra bill, I do not believe that posterity would be so ungrateful as to demur in the smallest way at meeting their just obligations to the soldiers of the Republic who gave their blood for this country or who shortened by many years what in the ordinary way would be a very long life by the abnormal hardships they went through.</P>
    <P>I believe the country as a whole&mdash; and it is a good thing to feel that&mdash; would welcome at all times any benefits that would be conferred either on the soldiers who obtained freedom or on their widows who might, perhaps, be living in impecunious circumstances.</P>

      <P>Therefore, one has to rely on the known generosity and the goodwill of the present Minister in a matter of this kind.  I confess&mdash;and other Deputies would not, perhaps, like to confess&mdash;that I am not sufficiently well acquainted with the administration of measures of this kind to know what type of individual case could or could not be covered by the measure as it exists now.  I was surprised to hear from Deputy Davern that the case of <Col N="77" /> the widow of the late Jim Stapleton, whom I knew very well, cannot be covered by the measure as it now stands.  I join with Deputy Davern in asking the Minister to ensure that cases of this kind will be covered.  I knew the late Jim Stapleton a very long time, and his wife's people, although I am not as well acquainted with the great services he gave to the country as Deputy Davern and Deputy Dan Breen would be.  Suggestions were made on previous stages of the Bill and again to-day&mdash;I do not know whether it was intended to cast by inference or otherwise a reflection on Labour Deputies&mdash;that Deputies on this side of the House would always support appeals of the kind now being made but that we would not stand for the taxation necessary for that purpose when proposals for taxation are brought before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan hinted at it in the brief remarks he made a few moments ago.  I have no hesitation in saying that it should not be necessary to raise additional taxation to cover the kind of cases that have been mentioned and which it is desired to bring within the scope of this Bill.  I was chairman of the Public Accounts Committee at one time and was a member of that committee for a considerable period, and in that capacity I had an opportunity of examining the Defence Estimates for a number of years.  Is there anybody in this House, who knows the framework of the Defence Estimates, who could not say that, even this year, savings could be effected without endangering the security of the State which would ensure that every case of the kind mentioned here would be met out of existing taxation? It would be possible to take a big slice off the amount provided under the sub-head for warlike stores which would make ample provision for the isolated cases mentioned here by Deputy Davern and other Deputies. Out of the provision made for warlike stores, it would be possible to make savings more than sufficient to provide for every class mentioned here and <Col N="78" /> there would not be the slightest danger to the security of the State by doing that.  It would be quite easy to cut the provision for warlike stores by 25 per cent.  Deputy Cowan, I am sure, has a more intimate knowledge of what it is necessary to provide for warlike stores than I have, but I think he will agree that it would be possible to take a slice off the expenditure proposed under that heading which would be more than ample to cover cases of the kind which he has in mind.  I support the appeal made by Deputy Davern in regard to the cases he has mentioned and I hope the Minister will be in a generous mood&mdash;and he is usually in a generous mood&mdash;and try to meet the few appeals that have been made to cover cases of the kind mentioned.</P>

In this particular case, I am merely asking the Minister would he consider the substance of an amendment that would give him discretionary powers to deal with individual cases such as have been referred to here?  We want him to consider between now and the time the Bill goes to the Seanad, the introduction of some kind of saving section that would enable him to deal with specific cases of hardship.  As to whether that is helping these cases or not, I am <Col N="79" /> certainly not taking any directions from the gallant little captain.</P>

      <P>I should like to say, first of all, in reply to Deputy Davern that, so far as I am concerned, it is a matter of indifference how long the House wishes to spend on the debate on this Bill.  If Deputies wish to discuss the Bill at very great length they are entitled to do so.  Perhaps a longer debate might add considerably to the knowledge of the Bill possessed by those outside who are interested in it. I have not attempted to push the Bill through the House but appeals have been made by several Deputies that the House should not hold up the Bill or delay its passage and giving as their reason for these appeals the fact that a large number of people would benefit by the Bill and that the sooner it was through the House the sooner would the benefits reach these people. Deputies had since last Thursday to put down amendments.  Any Deputy who was sufficiently interested in the Bill could have put down an amendment in that time.  I can see no reason why any Deputy who is sufficiently interested in any particular type of case or in any section dealing with a particular type of case did not put down an amendment.</P>

      <P>The House has so far dealt with this Bill in the way one would expect Deputies to deal with it. They have dealt with it in a nonpolitical atmosphere and that is what we want.  If we can continue along that line, I think we shall make more progress.  I want to say that the Bill represents the long considered views of the Government.  I am not objecting to the statements made on this stage appealing for increased provision under various aspects of the Bill because these statements more or less reflect the views which I myself expressed when I was discussing this measure with the Government but I want to say that the Bill represents the considered views of the Government and, so far as I am now aware, there will not be any advance beyond the few amendments which I propose to introduce in the course of the Committee Stage which will produce some amelioration for certain classes of people mentioned in the Bill.  Beyond that it is not possible to go.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin referred to possible savings on warlike stores which I presume he meant could be utilised in bringing relief to these people.  By coincidence this particular year, every penny earmarked for warlike stores is actually spent and all we await is the delivery of the stores for which the money is earmarked.  When they come the warlike stores sub-head will actually be completely exhausted.</P>

The position to which Deputy Cowan has referred has appeared in every Act of this kind and I have no doubt it appears in other Acts as well.  The particular type of case to which the Deputy has referred can be dealt with in a humane way, and with a full realisation of the conditions that brought about the situation which he mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Again I would like to say, in reply to the appeals. which have been made to me and to the somewhat sentimental references that have been made to particular cases, that if a case comes within this Bill it will be dealt with, and dealt with sympathetically.  If it is outside the Bill, there is nothing we can do about it, nothing anyone can do about it.  It is outside the Bill and that is all there is to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> I think myself that the Bill represents a reasonably generous effort on the part of this Government to meet the needs of the Old I.R.A.; and as I said on the Second Stage, this Bill need not necessarily represent the last effort of either this Government or any other Government which may follow it.  Whenever another Government succeeds us there is no reason why it cannot introduce a Bill and provide amelioration in the same way as we have done; but I have to say that this represents finality as far as we are concerned at the present time, taking all things into consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendments to which Deputy Seán Collins referred, I must say that Deputy MacEoin was not himself getting rid of what he is objecting to, because he was imposing a time limit to the right of the persons to apply as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>After January, 1954, his amendments would rule out applications, too, so that in effect he was only attempting to get in people up to a certain date.  The main purpose of Part II of this Bill is to give increased benefits to dependents of deceased persons who were killed during the 1916-1923 period, and with the dependents of those who were killed are linked the dependents of those who, although not executed or killed outright, died within four years from wounds received or disease incurred during the period in question.  In other words, death within four years is being equated with having been executed or killed outright.  That idea was also apparent in, for instance, the Acts of 1927 and 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the same position under Section 25 of the Bill in relation to members of the Defence Forces where, if a person is killed outright on duty or dies within four years of wounds received on duty, the normal allowance payable to the widow and children will be increased by 33? per cent. or whatever it may be.  What Deputy MacEoin wishes is to give enhanced allowances to the widows and children of all persons who died as a result of wounds or disease attributable to service during <Col N="83" /> the 1916-1923 period irrespective of when the person died.  The persons to whom the Deputy refers are not unprovided for.  They are eligible for the allowances already laid down in the Acts as proposed to be increased by the appropriate sum&mdash;50 per cent. in most cases&mdash;under this Bill.  Furthermore, in case there may be widows and children who might not be covered at present by reason of the date of marriage that date is being extended up to the 9th December, 1932.  The enhanced allowances now being provided for the first time in Part II of this Bill are, however, intended as a special recognition of those who were actually killed or executed during the 1916-1923 period and of those who are regarded as being in much the same position because of the fact that they died within four years from wound or disease.  All other cases will be dealt with under the existing Acts as applicable up to the present, rates payable being, of course, increased in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>This section provides for a limitation to a period of 12 months after the passing of the Bill. In many Acts this 12 months' provision has been made and when we come to amend them we extend the period for a further 12 months.  Here we are dealing with applications for the grant of an allowance and I would recommend to the Minister&mdash;this is again a submission and a claim by the Mansion House Old I.R.A. Committee&mdash;that the limitation in date should be deleted and that a person should be entitled to apply for an allowance at any time, provided that person is entitled to it under the provisions of the Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not accept that, for the simple reason that a particular person, a sister, for example, might apply and nobody else might apply within the period of 12 months. A widow might not have known of the particular section and the result would be that she would be out, as there would already have been somebody who would have applied.  We could not accept it, from that point of view alone.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider that, in the event of death, there will be one person dependent on the deceased, or who could be considered as dependent on the deceased?  I do not think the difficulties the Minister envisages would occur in fact.  The real person who would be entitled will make the claim within as short a period as possible, but if a claim is not made within 12 months it should not be turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned on the Second Stage the <Col N="86" /> case of a widow of an army officer who retired.  She was not aware that she would be entitled to a pension and consequently she was ruled out.  I think this section will bring her in.  It could occur in the future that for one reason or another some other persons will omit to make a claim within 12 months&mdash;which is a very short period &mdash;and in those circumstances they would be debarred, although genuinely entitled to the allowance.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the opposition to the section, on behalf of Deputy Seán MacEoin.  I know that the spirit which actuated the opposition to this section revolves inevitably around the question of the time barrier.  When the last Pensions Bill was going through, I recollect that the Minister was inclined to the view that he would not put in a specific time limit at all if the House felt that a date was not necessary.  I feel we have arrived at the stage where we should not have any limit of 12 months.  As properly referred to by Deputy Cowan, we inevitably find ourselves passing Bill after Bill providing for further extensions.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that extensions from now on will be of little avail to most of the recipients, as with the march of time the number of likely applicants will become fewer and fewer.  The Minister might be serving a better purpose by leaving out the time factor altogether.  If anybody is entitled in justice to get any benefits under the scheme now designed by the Minister, it ill behoves us to put some artificial barrier, such as a date, to debar them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are circumstances under which people quite genuinely may not become aware of their right within the 12 months or may not be in a position to make a claim within 12 months and, for the sake of words and words only, the Minister might remove the specific 12 months' period altogether.  It was on that basis that Deputy MacEoin wished to oppose the section and if the Minister is prepared to give an undertaking to reconsider this between this and some further stage of the Bill, either <Col N="87" /> here or in the Seanad, we will be perfectly satisfied to accept his undertaking so to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy MacEoin's point of view that a person should be able to claim his entitlement whenever he likes, without being tied to any time limits.  The arguments are not, however, all on one side, and where a pension or allowance is payable from a particular date, it is essential that the Department should know its maximum commitments as soon as possible.  If a person can come along with a claim at any time, and his entitlement, once established, can go back over a large number of years, obviously there can be no certainty, for Estimate and similar purposes, as to the provision which should be made. Furthermore, it is now so long since the period to which these pensions and allowances relate that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find witnesses and establish evidence, and with every year that passes, the position will become worse in that regard.  That is another argument in favour of a time limit.  In the instance to which the Deputy's amendment refers, there are even more compelling arguments.  The people who may claim under Part II of this Bill are widows, parents and sisters of deceased persons.  Only one allowance can, however, be paid in respect of any deceased person, and if more than one relative claims, the Minister has to decide the relative to whom the allowance will be given.  It is essential, therefore, in cases such as these that there should be a time limit. Indeed, if only a sister claimed within 12 months, and if, in the absence of any other claim, she were granted the allowance, there would be no possibility of adjusting the matter if later an application was received from a parent or the widow or a sister more dependent on the deceased person than was the sister actually awarded the allowance.  The allowance would have been awarded to the first sister and nothing could be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the foreging reasons, I feel that, on balance, there should be a time limit where a question of entitlement to a pension or allowance is involved. <Col N="88" /> There has never been any great difficulty, where genuine cases have arisen, in extending the time limits by later legislation.  If there is any particular case of an outstanding kind, there is no reason in the world why a Minister who would examine it and see some good cause for it should not have the date extended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister intends to leave it to his ministerial successors, then we should be involved in greater cost in the preparation of a small Bill such as this than in giving substantial benefits to the people who require them.</P>
      <P>I must confess that the Minister's argument, in the initial stages, does not commend itself to me.  I think it might best be described as departmental tripe.  I do not think we should allow the question of departmental difficulties in estimating whether the amount will be, say, £2,000 or £3,000, to operate as a serious argument in relation to a time limit.  Departments have, to our knowledge, been out millions of £s&mdash;never mind the question of the few paltry £s that might be involved here.</P>
      <P>The second part of the Minister's argument commends itself to me much more readily than the first part but I do not think it is proper for a Minister, with the goodwill and sympathetic approach to Army pensions which the present Minister for Defence can boast of, to try to bolster up Civil Service Estimates.</P>

      <P>There can be no doubt but that Deputy Collins is obsessed by the Department.  I want to assure him that the argument I have advanced is based on a complete and thorough examination of the situation by myself, along with my experts.  To describe it as &ldquo;departmental tripe&rdquo; is not correct.  It represents my own views after, as I have said, consideration. I should not like to find myself in the type of position which I have just outlined, where we had awarded an allowance to a person who, after examination, had seemed to us to be the person to whom it should have been awarded and, having done that, to find later on that some other person <Col N="89" /> was better entitled to it.  I think that my suggestion is a very simple way of getting over the difficulty.  The matter of expense is almost nil.</P>

I believe that the people concerned will not let 12 months or even one month pass&mdash;and they will be right.

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only form of appeal in this Bill is contained in this section.  This section empowers the Minister to ask the Military Service Registration Board for a report on the findings in a particular case.  The Mansion House Committee and other persons who are vitally interested in matters of pensions&mdash;which includes everybody entitled to a pension&mdash; believe that the appeal should be to some other party, and that the Minister should obtain power in the Bill to set up an appeal board composed of persons who are qualified by their knowledge and experience and their participation in the fight for freedom to be a competent appeal board.</P>
      <P>I request the Minister to consider the establishment of such an appeal board to deal with the type of appeals that he considers should be referred to the Military Service Registration Board.</P>
      <P>There is another point in the section with which I should deal at once.  Section 9, sub-section (3) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, on the grounds that evidence not available prior to the issue of the certificate has since become available...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is suggested that that should be altered to read: &ldquo;new evidence has become available,&rdquo; because persons experienced in the matters of pensions find that the interpretation of &ldquo;evidence not available prior to the issue of the certificate&rdquo; may narrow down and restrict it in an unfair way.  If the Minister would agree to that suggested alteration, it would enable cases to come up on appeal which would be ruled out on the present wording of the sub-section.  I gather that the Minister would have no objection to the substitution of these words for the words &ldquo;evidence not available prior to the issue of the certificate&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The difficulty about this section&mdash;it was discussed on Second Reading&mdash;is the difficulty of trying to ascertain on what these increases are based.  The increases range from 50 per cent., in certain cases, down to 28 per cent. and they fall short of what was very strongly recommended.  I do not want that to be taken as indicating that the effort made with regard to the increases is not appreciated as being generous.  I am wondering if the Minister could explain how, in some cases, there is a 50 per cent. increase and, in others, a 28 per cent. increase, with varying percentage increases down along the line.</P>

I know that nothing I can do here can bring about any alteration now and any reference back of the section for examination by the Minister, in the light of anything anybody says here, would unduly delay the operation of the Bill.  I simply repeat what I have already said, that we should have a parliamentary committee to examine into all this legislation, particularly in regard to the basic amounts paid, because at one stage, when the Acts were originally introduced, there was a rather niggardly approach to the matter of pensions.  The result, therefore, is that the basis of pensions has been all wrong all the time. Although there have been generous increases on a percentage basis, justice has not been done and cannot possibly be done to <Col N="94" /> everybody by that form of percentage increase.  As I say, this could not be dealt with now on this stage and I will content myself by simply saying that there is a good case for the examination of this and other sections in regard to the basic amount and the percentage increases.  We can at an early date endeavour to have a parliamentary committee established to inquire into it and make recommendations to the Minister and the House.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is to be commended upon accepting the suggestion in this regard that was made to him by Deputy Major de Valera on the Second Stage of the Bill.  This section provides for payments to the dependents of an officer or a soldier.  While undoubtedly the 50 per cent. increase in the case of an officer's widow will be a substantial amount, unfortunately, in the case of the widow of a soldier the amount is not a very considerable one.  I have been furnished with particulars of the widow of a sergeant-pilot who was killed on duty and in circumstances that would entitle her to be paid a pension under the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">

      <P>Section 27 would deal with it also but Section 25 deals with the dependents of an officer or a soldier serving in the forces and who receives a wound from which he dies. That section now provides for an increase of 50 per cent. for the widow of an officer or a soldier instead of 33? per cent. as provided in the Bill.  In the particular case to which I refer apparently the widow receives a widow's and orphan's contributory pension.  The widow's pension is £1 4s. and the orphan's pension is 7/&mdash;a total of £1 11s.  She gets an Army modified pension of 16/6, making up a total of £2 7s. 6d.  This is a case where the operation of the percentages does not, in my opinion, do justice.  If the widow of that sergeant-pilot is entitled only to £2 7s. 6d. for herself and a child, I think the Minister ought to consider this on the basis of that payment.  Undoubtedly, I think the House will agree that a pension in those circumstances, including the widow's and orphan's contributory pension of £2 7s. 6d., is inadequate. I would make a strong appeal to the Minister to consider the facts of that case in conjunction with the section because I do think there ought to be a bigger percentage increase in the case of the widow of a sergeant or a private soldier.</P>

I would say that that particular case is even more aggravated by the fact that the untimely demise of this sergeant-pilot took place at a time when he was <Col N="96" /> about to be commissioned and had a very short time elapsed his now unfortunate widow and child would, in fact, be reaping the benefits set out for a commissioned officer.  This case merits reconsideration by the Minister and his experts because two circumstances have operated very harshly against the widow.  In the first place, her husband was taken from her untimely and, in the second place, the circumstances were such that at the time he was in the in-between period between losing his status as a flight-sergeant and becoming a commissioned officer of the Air Corps.</P>
      <P>We are up against the difficulty that we have not got basically any fundamental basis for pension assessment and it is very difficult to press the Minister to take each individual case on a question of adequacy.  I think the Minister can take it that this percentage basis, where N.C.O.s and men are concerned, is not operating to alleviate the sufferings of the widows and children of such personnel to anything like the extent that the percentage goes to alleviate the sufferings of the widow and children of the commissioned group.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister can at this stage do anything about it but I feel that with the goodwill of the House and with our anxiety to give him as rapidly as possible all stages of the Bill he might take the opportunity, between this and the Report Stage, of trying to adjust the situation with regard to N.C.O.s and men more on the basis of the adequacy of the increase than on a flat percentage.</P>

      <P>May I intervene at this stage to say that I had this matter under consideration?  The position now is that the widow concerned will get the 50 per cent. increase and that, whereas hitherto the widow's and orphan's pension was taken into consideration, I have now secured agreement that it will not be taken into consideration in future.  The result will be that the widow we all have in mind will be receiving a sum of £3 9s. 7d. a week.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a particular case that has arisen.  It is not covered at the moment and I doubt whether the Minister will be able to do anything about it.  It was the case of a man in the professional public service whose son, intended for the professions, joined the Army during the emergency and due to the premature explosion of a bomb during training, lost his life.  His father has since died suddenly and his mother is now a widow.  Nothing much was said or expected at the time owing to the fact that the father was in good employment, and so on.  The mother would now be largely dependent on this young man were he alive.  I do not know whether the Minister could bring into consideration that or any other such cases that would arise.  I just mention it for that purpose.</P>

      <P>There is one point I would like to stress in approaching this section, that this section has now a provision which we had not got before in the nature of an insurance provision for fatal accidents, but we should not confuse that with the provisions of Section 27.  Deputy Cowan has raised a point with which I must express some sympathy, but I do happen to know that the Minister had contemplated dealing with the particular difficulties that arise in these cases.  There is no need to go into them now, because the Minister is completely cognisant of them and has indicated that some reductions in pensions payable would now be got over, but in my view it would be better to meet that in principle under Section 27 rather than under Section 25.  Of course that does not mean that some adjustment in Section 27 might not be desirable.  However, we can deal with that on that section.  I think the Minister and his officers have shown great willingness to try to meet this problem, and it is an improvement on the section to increase the percentage as the Minister has done.</P>

      <P>I think the House will be glad to know that the Minister has been so concerned about particular cases that he has in fact been in touch with the Department of Social Welfare, as a result of which there will be an increase in this particular pension.  However, where you have a widow and one child, perhaps the sum of £3 9s. 7d. would not be considered an adequate sum to enable that woman to buy clothes for herself and the child, to pay rent and to purchase food, that is, leaving out any of the other amenities of life.</P>
      <P>I am not pressing it any more than this, that I do think the Minister should consider, notwithstanding what is provided in the section, the question of a minimum pension which, in my view, should be something higher than the amount mentioned.  I would ask the Minister to consider that, and I certainly would like to express my appreciation of the humane and sympathetic way in which he has dealt with these cases.</P>

I do not know in what way the Minister could provide for it under this particular section but it would be apropos of this section that anything would have to be done. I do feel the matter raised by Deputy MacCarthy will receive consideration from the Minister and only adds further to my belief in relation to the request that Deputy Cowan has made both on this stage of the Bill and on the Second Reading, that the time has come when there should be some kind of parliamentary committee set up to investigate, not only such anomalies or cases of hardship that my arise under the code but this particular case referred to by Deputy MacCarthy, which is within my own knowledge and which does lead to hardship that could not reasonably be anticipated.  I think the Minister may agree that the life lost in the circumstances of that untimely explosion could in normal circumstances reasonably have been <Col N="99" /> accepted to be a very large contributing factor to the support of the now widowed mother.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11b:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), at the end of the new Part II of the Seventh Schedule to the Act of 1927 set out therein, to add the following new paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  Repayment of amount proved to have been in fact necessarily and properly expended in educational fees but not exceeding £30 in any one calendar year in respect of any one child.  This allowance is additional <Col N="100" /> to the allowance stated at No. 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On this amendment there is a question of the amount of the allowance and, of course, there is no question of substantiating the claim.  That must be done in any event but on the wording of this section it is necessarily and properly expended in educational fields.  I think the original interpretation of that would mean that it would be a reimbursement in connection with fees in the nature of school fees actually paid.  A difficulty does arise in certain cases where there is necessarily involved in the education of the children certain additional expenditure required to keep the particular students on a status commensurate with the institutions in which they are being taught. One can conceive of a case where a child is being taught in a particular school at a reduced fee and the actual outlay in fees may be less than the actual sum provided for in this particular draft.</P>
      <P>At the same time when one considers the matters of clothes and certain other incidental expenses directly, and I am assuming probably, associated with education, the sum might exceed the actual amount of the fees but still be within the limit of the sum provided here.  That suggests that a certain elasticity is needed in regard to such expenditure and a certain latitude of interpretation will be required by the Minister in order to interpret what may be properly expended in educational fees.  I am wondering whether the draft could not be altered in some way to give the Minister and his Department the kind of discretion that seems to be necessary.  I would be very happy to leave that discretion in the hands of the Minister and his Department because both have shown themselves to be very sympathetic in this particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I would strongly suggest to the Minister that in relation to education there should be no difference between the child of an officer and the child of a soldier. Fees have to be paid and they depend to a large extent on the brains of the <Col N="101" /> child and not on the type of bar the father wears.  I suggest there should be no difference.</P>
      <P>Secondly, there are cases in which 18 years of age would not be sufficient. Consider the case of a boy who wants to study for the priesthood and his father dies.  Very considerable expenses can be incurred in connection with that, expenses which in the ordinary way would continue until the boy reaches 25 years of age or so. There may be the question of a university degree involved or some other kind of education which does not finish at 18.  The Minister should have discretion in such matters to continue until the normal educational period has expired.  I appeal to the Minister to consider those aspects of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there should be any differentiation as between the child of an officer, an N.C.O., or an ordinary soldier when it comes to education.  Deputy de Valera has made a reasonable case and I think he intends it to cover what I have in mind.  There may be cases in which special equipment applicable to a certain institution is required.  A child may have to get special nutrition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could cover the position by introducing some amendment or by giving some permissive power of interpretation in order to include what is normally chargeable in connection with an educational institution, and not limit it, as Deputy de Valera fears it could be limited, to the actual fees expended.  Tuition, books, the ordinary perquisites of institutional training whether it be through the medium of boarding school or day school in which certain meals may be supplied, should normally be included within the meaning of &ldquo;educational fees&rdquo;.  I think the Minister would be well advised to advert to the danger of a too rigid interpretation.</P>

      <P>I generally subscribe to the views expressed, particularly in regard to equality and so on.  One must remember, however, that this <Col N="102" /> situation has existed throughout the lifetime of our Army.  The £30 was payable only to the child of an officer. We have got that increased now from £30 to £60 and, at the same time; I have obtained the consent of the Government to do something for the children of the soldier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I would be doing something useful if I gave the soldier the £30 that the officer had formerly.  The Government agreed that the children of the soldier were entitled to something.  I take it the House will pass this amendment and I suggest that this matter might be discussed in the committee about which Deputy Cowan is concerned.  It is matters of this nature that would be properly applicable to a committee of that kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, there is a big discrepancy as regards the amounts for the children.  The Minister has stated that he got some concessions and, for those concessions, credit is due to him.  But, in the case of the child of a soldier, where the widow is to get 18/9 a week, the child is to get an allowance at the rate of 1/- per day, while the mother is alive, or 2/- per day after her death.  As against that, the child of an officer will get £27 per year while the mother is alive, and after the mother's death, £50 a year.  Therefore, during the lifetime of the mother, the child of an officer will get something over 10/- per week, whereas in the case of the child of a soldier, it is only 7/- per week or 1/- a day.  I think the Minister should investigate that.  One can appreciate his difficulties, financial and other.  Concessions are being given which will undoubtedly be beneficial to the child of the officer to get the advantage of a higher education.  We believe that the greater portion of the money under this section will probably be expended on the children of officers, but if a serving soldier leaves a widow and a young family, the widow will hardly be able, out of the amount of pension that is allowed to her, <Col N="103" /> to give the advantages of a higher education to her children.  I think that if possible the Minister should, in these circumstances, see that this section is equated more in favour of the widow of the serving soldier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points that I would like to come back to on this section.  I know, of course, that the Minister must feel that the more he gives the more he will be asked to give.  On the Second Stage, I drew attention to a certain disparity. I know it is not anything very much in figures, but still there is a £45 difference between the widow of a junior officer and a field officer, and a £35 difference between the widow of a lower grade field officer and a colonel. I would like to make this suggestion to the Minister, that he might consider adding £10 to the £90 for the widows of junior officers.  I want to put it to him that there will not be very many of these cases of widows without children. That widow may be regarded as having certain advantages from one point of view, but she has certain disadvantages, too.  I think it would be equitable to increase the amount to £100.  The widow, in this case, comes under Section 27 but not under Section 25.  I would suggest that this small sum&mdash;it cannot amount to very much in the case of the Exchequer&mdash; should be included.  I should not have said that because, of course, it would include all widows.  But, even so, in the case of a single widow the total amount involved would not be very much.  I make that suggestion for the consideration of the Minister.</P>
      <P>In regard to the cases of serving soldiers, I must say that, on principle, I find it hard to see why, in regard to the actual maintenance of children, there is such a big differentiation.  I would like to see the sum for children brought more into line with the officers' case.  With these remarks on the section, I think it will be agreed that the Minister has done quite well both in regard to this section and Section 25.</P>

I had intended raising it on Section 40&mdash;that is, in regard to the provision for allowances to the widows of those who died while in receipt of a wound or disability pension.  There is the limiting date, 10th December, 1932.  This same point was raised on previous sections.  I am raising it on this section and suggesting that this limitation of time should be deleted.</P>

      <P>The time limit in Sections 39 and 40 could operate very <Col N="105" /> severely against a number of people. I think that the Minister might review the date factor in general in relation to this Bill.  I suggest that he might give special consideration to the date as it affects this particular section, because it could happen that, by virtue of this date, tremendous hardship might be inflicted on a number of widows and orphans.  I am sure that would not be the desire of the Minister. I suggest that it would be the unanimous wish of this House that he would introduce a provision as a safeguard against any such possibility arising either under Section 39 or Section 40.  I think there is a meritorious claim for the abolition of the date limit in the Bill as it stands.</P>

On Second Stage I suggested to him that he should bring in this amendment and for a number of years I have been pressing this particular matter.  I am glad to see the Minister for Finance here because I understand he has been very sympathetic in regard to the section that has now been put in.  In a Bill like this, that is conferring benefits, there is no better benefit the Bill could confer than a benefit such as this which will ensure that the son or daughter of a man who signed the Proclamation of 1916 will not be left in want.

      <P>I oppose the amendment on one basis.  Here again is a discrimination that I do not like.  I would not differentiate in any way between the children of the Signatories of the Proclamation of 1916 and other people who are covered in other sections. My objection to the amendment is on the basis that, when the Minister made this gesture, which is more than welcome, he made the sum so inadequate.  I hear some kind of mutter from Deputy Cowan about it. I think £125 is a small allowance, particularly when, as we are all aware, the commitment under this particular section is terribly limited.  If it were the unfortunate situation that a daughter or a son of a Signatory of the Proclamation of 1916 was in fact in a position that he or she was incapable of self-support&mdash;as we know some to be &mdash;I do not think £125 could be deemed to be an optimum allowance for such a person.  I suggest to the Minister that it might be possible to make that a little more generous in view of the general attitude of the House to people associated with the early days of the struggle and in view of the general anxiety of the House to make this Bill more generous than other Bills have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I concur absolutely with the view expressed by Deputy Cowan, that it is a matter for commendation and earnest thanks to the Minister from the House, I do think for the sake of what might be involved, maybe £100 <Col N="108" /> or £200 in any one year, that the sum might have been made a little more adequate in the circumstances of the value of the £ to-day on the economic market.</P>

      <P>There is one point I wanted to make in connection with the percentages of disability increases. The matter has been raised on different sections in a general way and the Minister has indicated that it is the sort of thing that would be peculiarly suitable for a parliamentary committee. If there is a hope of a parliamentary committee being established at any time in the near future to look into the basis of all these pensions, all these schedules, all these percentage increases, then I would be prepared to agree that that would be the proper way of dealing with it.  I had quite a number of points to raise about what appears to be unfairness in regard to the schedules, but I realise that if the Minister were to agree to have these examined they would have to be examined not only in the Department of Defence but in the Department of Finance and the result would be a considerable delay in putting this beneficial Bill into operation.  Consequently, it is simply for the record that I am saying that I do not agree with the basis set up in very early legislation on which these percentage increases are now based.</P>

Take the case of an Old I.R.A. man who goes to St. Bricin's Hospital and who is in receipt of a 20 per cent. pension.  I ask the Minister to consider inserting an amendment whereby during the period he would be in hospital he would be paid 100 per cent. pension. The Minister will see the point.  If he is a month in hospital he is a month away from earning anything and he may be only in receipt of a 20 per cent. pension.  Similarly, in the case of a person who is not in receipt of any percentage pension at the time he enters the hospital I think the Minister should consider that he would be put on the 100 per cent. disability basis for the period he is in hospital; the idea being that if such a person was asked to go to St. Bricin's for a month for examination he might not feel that he could afford to go and consequently it would endanger him.  I ask the Minister to consider putting a section into this very comprehensive legislation to deal with that point.</P>

      <P>From the period April, 1951, to April, 1953, there has been an alarming increase in the number of unemployed in the general building industry, including house-building. Those unemployed in that particular category in April, 1951, amounted to 4,832, and in April, 1953, that figure had jumped to 9,159. It seems, therefore, that there has been a substantial increase in the number unemployed in the building industry. The Taoiseach, when speaking some two weeks ago, gave one reason for that, that the housing programme of certain local authorities had been completed or was nearing completion.  In reply to a parliamentary question to-day by Deputy MacBride, the Taoiseach gave a list of 45 local authorities who, he said, had satisfied their housing needs or were very near to satisfying their housing needs.  But there was a very significant part of his reply and that was that this information was given having regard to the housing needs of 1947.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the survey carried out in 1947 to determine the number of houses required for the country would not stand to-day.  I am informed, for instance, that in the case of the Laois County Council, which the Taoiseach says had satisfied its housing needs up to the 31st December, 1952, there are still many houses or cottages required in the Laois County Council area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also told in respect of Edenderry that the housing needs are not satisfied.  I do not blame the Taoiseach entirely, nor do I say that he alleges the housing <Col N="112" /> needs have been fully completed because, as I said, he did qualify that by saying that his reply was based on the figures furnished as a result of the 1947 survey.  The number of those unemployed in the house-building industry has increased very much in the last few years.  It is very difficult to understand how that position has arisen.  The Taoiseach himself said that he could not understand it and, perhaps, it was the fault of the local authorities.  I wonder what change has come over the local authorities since 1950, or for that matter since 1951, when we had a fair number of skilled and unskilled men working on house-building in this country.  There is no change in the political set-up&mdash; let us call it&mdash;of the local authorities. In the majority of cases, I think that the Government Party is very strongly represented and surely there would not be a reversal of policy so far as they were concerned.  So that I think it behoves a Government to carry out some strict investigation as to the causes of the slowing-up of house-building by local authorities.  Whether it is lack of money or labour content or administrative difficulties we have not been told yet, but the fact is, there is a substantial number of skilled and unskilled building-workers in the City of Dublin and elsewhere unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still a big demand for houses both in the city and rural and urban areas.  Under the heading of other constructional work such as roads there has been a decrease in the past two years of approximately 5,000 in the number employed.  Again, it is difficult to understand that when one listens to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs telling us that the amount provided by the Government for capital expenditure has not diminished this year.  In the rural areas&mdash;also in the last two years&mdash;there has been a substantial increase in unemployment. Coupled with that is the fact that approximately 14,000 men leave the land every year.  I think 14,000 was the figure for those who left Ireland between 1951 and 1952.  This is not unusual.  It has not been unusual since 1922, since the setting up of the <Col N="113" /> State.  Since 1926, 147,000 workers have left the land.  Since 1946, 72,000 have left the land.  That represents a drop from 1926 to 1951 of 53 per cent. of the working population to 41 per cent. in the year 1951.  The problem of employment on the land has always been with us.  Unfortunately it will be with us for quite a long time unless this House and the Government can devise ways and means of keeping people on the land.  We have all expressed our desire that the flight from the land should stop but none of us seems to have got the proper solution. It is so difficult to keep them on the land.  Many people have spoken from time to time about the lack of attractions, the lack of amusements, say, in the from of cinemas, parish halls and different other amusements you might find in the big towns or cities.  I do not believe that they in themselves are the causes of the flight from the land. The real cause is the fact that the types of work in rural Ireland at the present time are very limited.  As far as I know, in any case, the main types of work available to the rural worker at the present time are farm work, county council work, and in recent years, forestry work.  I think we could agree these are the main forms of employment for workers in rural Ireland. With the progress of time, with progress in the agricultural industry, farm work has diminished and that is something we cannot get away from.  The introduction of machinery as we have seen over the past few years means that farmers need less men.  Whether that is good or bad is a matter of opinion.  Many people in the House bemoan the passing of the horse for farm work; many others have bemoaned the fact that up-to-date machinery is being employed at the present time in farm work, but the fact remains whether good or bad that there is less use for the farm worker in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>As far as county council work is concerned, it is limited, and as far as one can see from present trends the amount of work that will be available under local authorities&mdash;in this case, county councils&mdash;will decline and has declined this year.  The signs are that it will decline next year and for many <Col N="114" /> years to come.  If there is to be anything done immediately to alleviate the unemployment position in rural areas the Government could well consider engaging again in the works under what were known as the local authorities' works schemes.  We may have had differences of opinion about the effects or the usefulness of these schemes, but I am convinced that apart from the fact that they gave good employment, they gave useful employment.  These works were described by members of the Government Party as works that did nothing but throw money down the drain. These local authorities' works schemes were introduced in 1949.  Granted the people who carried out these schemes in the way of local officials were not as experienced as they could be in the initial stages, but by degrees it was found that the money subsequently spent on these schemes gave useful results.  I was very pleased recently in a particular area in County Wexford when accompanied by two other Deputies from the county, to be told that land which had been drained as a result of one of these schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was done so very well that it was possible last year and this year to grow a crop of wheat on it.</P>
    <P>I may be told that is one particular case, but I do know also that these schemes linked up with the land reclamation schemes carried out under the Department of Agriculture, were considered by the local people and the officers of the Department of Agriculture as being very beneficial to the agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>We cannot regard the building of cottages in rural areas as being of a permanent nature.  It is true, as the Taoiseach said, that the cottage building schemes in many of the areas&mdash; especially in the rural areas&mdash;are completed or nearing completion, and those who are now engaged in building cottages in rural areas will come into the unemployment lists if we do not plan now and try to discover ways and means of keeping them in employment in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have paid much lip-service to the policy of decentralisation.  All of us <Col N="115" /> have been guilty of that.  It reminds me of the agreement we can get among ourselves in regard to the abolition of Partition in this country but we do not seem to be able to shake ourselves into doing anything about it.  Successive Governments for decades past have proclaimed a policy of decentralisation, but if any efforts have been made to decentralise industry in this country they have been puny efforts.</P>
    <P>Many objections are put up to the decentralisation of Government services. The main objection is that the seat of Government is here in Dublin and that the different officers and officers must be centred around Dublin to provide for smooth administration. There has been one solitary example of attempt at decentralisation so far as Government Departments are concerned, and that is in the setting up of the soil analysis section of the Department of Agriculture at Johnstown Castle, in County Wexford.  I would say that that small effort at decentralisation has been successful.  In that particular area many men have been provided with useful employment under that Government Department.  It may not be a perfect example of decentralisation, but I know if it were suggested ten or 15 years ago that such a section of the Department of Agriculture should be located 90 miles away from Dublin, there would be many objections to the proposal.  I know how difficult the problem is.  Building cannot be transported and there is difficulty in erecting new buildings or acquiring new premises all over the country, but I think the Government should make a determined effort to try to prevent people from rural Ireland or from provincial or small towns coming to Dublin by farming out, so to speak, as many sections of Government Departments as they can.</P>
    <P>If we want to provide work in rural Ireland, or if it is the intention or policy of the Government to promote the creation of industries outside Dublin in rural areas, I humbly suggest that these industries should be of a type different from the type of industry that has been set up in the <Col N="116" /> country for the last 25 or 30 years.  So far as I can see, many of the industries set up in the country are industries which are competing with countries from which we are purchasing the raw material for our industries.  The countries from which we are importing the raw material for our industries will certainly see to it that the advantage will be on their side.  Clothing industries, boot-making industries and industries of that type are all very well in their way, but we must remember that we are competing with our nextdoor neighbour, Britain, and that it is from Britain we import the raw materials for these industries.  There should be a determined effort on the part of the Government to encourage the setting up of industries that can be regarded as being peculiar to Ireland, industries of a specialised nature which would not require the importation to any great extent of raw materials.  The Government should also, through the Department of Education, try to educate young boys and girls, the future workers of this country, in the elements of some specialised industries, industries peculiar to the country.  I cannot, offhand, give examples, but we are afforded one good example by the manner in which Switzerland specialised in the watchmaking industry.  That is an industry peculiar to Switzerland and the workers there have specialised in that industry.  If we are to compete against countries from which we import the raw material for any particular industry, it will either mean that we shall fail or that the Government will be forced by legislative action and for the protection of the products of the Irish industry, to raise the price of these products.</P>
    <P>The Government could well&mdash;and I am sure their minds are bent in that direction&mdash;make stronger efforts to popularise the turf industry.  I have heard so many people from different parts of the country speak in this House about the necessity of encouraging the turf industry that I have often been tempted to ask them if they use turf in their own homes.  I reckon that if many of them were asked if they used turf in their own homes they would be forced to reply <Col N="117" /> in the negative.  So far as the prospects which that industry may hold out for providing employment in the rural areas are concerned, I would say to the Minister that many mistakes were made during the emergency period.  Turf became, to put it very mildly, very unpopular in the area in which I live and, I expect, also in the area in which the Minister lives.  In any of the areas that were regarded as being non-turf-producing areas, turf was, and still is, very unpopular. The Minister may be bursting to tell me all about the Coalition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I saw a glint in the Minister's eye, and I thought he wanted to jump in.  I am considering the present and the future of this industry irrespective of what might be said from any side of the House with regard to the past.  I suggest that the products of the turf industry can be popularised, that more efficient and cheaper methods of production, especially in the matter of transport can, and should be, devised. It is one of our biggest natural resources and turf should be produced in such a way that many more people would be willing and glad to use it as fuel.</P>
      <P>With so many farmer Deputies in the House, I do not propose to speak at length or in detail, because of my inability to do so, on the most important industry, as we all agree the agricultural industry is, in this country.  There are, however, many facts of which we should remind ourselves. In the first place, the industry provides work for about 500,000 of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the fact that 55 per cent. of our exports come from the agricultural industry and that we are absolutely dependent on it.  These are facts which have been stated here from day to day and week to week. Farmer Deputies, and even sometimes city Deputies here, deplore the fact that there has been no appreciable increase <Col N="118" /> in the volume of output.  Somebody interjected here some little time ago that there had been a 3 per cent. increase from 1951 to 1952, but appeals for greater production are becoming rather monotonous in this House.  We have had appeals from both sides.  It is not a subject into which I, or may I say other members of the Labour Party, wish to delve or intrude from time to time, but ever since I became a Deputy I have heard appeals for an increase in the volume of output. There does not seem to be any appreciable advance with regard to an increase in that respect.  We seem to be content with what we have.  We seem to be content with the fact that there is a market abroad for certain of our agricultural produce, especially the meat products and the dairy produce, but we have also got to ask ourselves will this demand remain as high as it is.</P>
    <P>It has been a very favourable time since the beginning of the war for this country as far as the export of agricultural produce is concerned.  That I take it is due to the fact that England and a big portion of Europe was ravaged by war and set back to a large extent but those countries, especially the ones in Europe that have a good knowledge of agriculture, are up and doing.  They are doing what the Irish farmers or the agricultural industry should be doing at the present time. They are finding out day by day, week by week, year by year, more efficient methods to enable them to compete with other countries in the export market.</P>
    <P>We will have to do the same, to find more efficient methods and to put the Irish agricultural industry in such a way that it can compete, or should I say that it can beat other countries, when it comes to the export of agricultural produce.  Most of our agricultural produce goes to Great Britain, and to some extent Britain is not very particular from whom she is going to get it as long as the price to her is acceptable.  If we do not devise more effective methods and increase the volume of output and to an extent, too, have keener prices not alone to compete in the export market <Col N="119" /> but to keep the price of those commodities at a reasonable level to our own people at least, the agricultural industry in this country will find itself out on a limb.</P>
    <P>I can only suggest what has been suggested by members from various Parties in this House, inadequate capitalisation of agriculture.  The restoration of credit has been a matter of controversy, as has been the land reclamation project.  These things should be intensified.  All of us are agreed that the land should be reclaimed and all of us bemoan the fact when we go through the country that there is so much land that is non-productive. If this Government can make greater strides than have been made in the past then it will have my support and the support of the Labour Party. It is not for me to quote Denmark or Holland or any of those near European countries in the matter of reclamation of land or the putting into production of waste land, but if we in this country can imitate their example in this land reclamation scheme, then I think we will be doing good.  But again might I remind the Minister for Agriculture that he would have a much easier task if he linked up the land reclamation scheme to the local authorities&mdash;if the county councils in this country were given permission, and of course, the most important thing, given the money, to engage in the type of work that they were engaged in over the last three or four years under the Local Authorities (Works) Schemes.  What makes people think in this country when they have regard to the numbers of unemployed here is that there is so much work to be done in the country. There are many schemes that could be undertaken&mdash;so many schools to be built, so many hospitals to be built and, as I have said before, so many houses to be built, so many harbours which need attention.  We have the money, or at least we have the men and we have so much work to be done but we seem to be held up for some reason or another.  The ordinary people's guess is that it is money.</P>
    <P>According to the speeches we have heard, the speech we heard here to-day <Col N="120" /> from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, we can only assume that as far as the Government is concerned it must be money that is holding up these schemes.  There has been a suggestion in the last few weeks that the Government, finding that its ordinary policy has not shown any results with regard to the decrease in unemployment, are considering, or at least have plans made, to put into operation many schemes which have been laying in the files or on the stocks of the different local authorities throughout the country.  Whether there is any truth in that suggestion or not, I do not know, but whilst we all agree that those schemes which are lying with the local authorities would be only temporary schemes and would only give men employment for a limited period something in the nature of public works schemes must be engaged in at the present time so as to come to the rescue of the 54,000 or 58,000 who now find themselves unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government have a responsibility for the unemployed in this country.  There is no doubt in the world about it that the fundamental right of a worker in any democratic country to-day is that he should be provided with work.  As I have said, there is so much work to be done in this country that the tens of thousands now unemployed cannot understand why they are not allowed to go ahead with that work.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Government's responsibility for the unemployed in this country I also suggest that local authorities, not to the same extent as the Government, have their responsibility as well.  It is true to say this, that theirs is not an absoulte responsibility, but as long as a local authority has the responsibility of providing houses, as long as a local authority has the responsibility of providing water and sewerage schemes and roads, as long as it has the responsibility of providing different amenities for the people of a county or for its particular functional area, it in turn, I suggest, has a responsibility to those people who are unemployed in those counties and who are willing and able to go to work on those particular amenity schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> I would not dare to jump in between Deputy McGilligan and Deputy MacBride in their detailed discussions on finance and credit restriction, but it does seem peculiar that we boast so much about the rich natural resources that we have in this country in the land, in the water, in the potential of the country for afforestation.  We proclaim to the world that we are one of the richest countries in the world with regard to natural resources, but still we find ourselves with 12 per cent. of the working population of this country unemployed.  I am not for borrowing for what the Taoiseach described as the day-to-day expenditure, but I would be for borrowing for building the country, for doing capital work, and I would say that no country could have greater security in borrowing than the richness of our natural resources. There is a difference of opinion, and there would be a difference of opinion, I agree, with regard to rates of interest.  Five per cent. is exorbitant, and the lead given by the Government in paying 5 per cent. for money borrowed is merely an incentive to other people, to the banks, to increase their rate of interest on loans as well, thus sending, apart from the cost of living, up the price of money, an all-important factor in the building or the general running of this country.  If the Government can induce people who have money in this country to invest it here, that is a good thing; but surely it is &ldquo;a sitting bird&rdquo; for those who have money lying unused or lying in the bank at 1½ per cent. to put it to work here at 5 per cent.?  It is &ldquo;money from America&rdquo; to give people who have such unused money 5 per cent. to do the work of building up the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs spoke of the airy fairy talk that has gone on about the repatriation of external assets.  Many speakers on the Government side from time to time have asked how one repatriates external assets, how one brings back so many millions from Britain to put them to work here.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs told us to-day how it was done last year and the year before, but he hung his criticism of <Col N="122" /> Opposition speakers on the fact that in their speeches during the last two by-elections they did not say how much money should be repatriated.  He himself said that the amount would be the amount that was required over and above what the Government could ordinarily get for capital development. Surely that would be the reply of any political Party?  It seems peculiar that the people have not got any reasonable explanation of the fact that the Central Bank has £71,000,000 invested now in Britain and that Government Departments have £41,000,000 in the same way.  People cannot understand why £110,000,000 of Irish money is working in England at between 1 and 2 per cent. when it could be working here to do work urgently needed since the British Government went out.  They regard this with a special sense of frustration when they know there are so many tens of thousands of unemployed&mdash;who are unemployed, to all appearances, merely through the lack of money.</P>
    <P>Also, we should not discount the effect of Partition on the economy of the country.  It has been stated quite often that we in the South are mainly in the agricultural end of the country and that the six partitioned counties in the North comprise the industrial area.  It always has been difficult for us to have a balanced economy, because that industrial arm of the country is cut off.</P>
    <P>We all agree about Partition, that something should be done about it. There has been general agreement amongst Ministers for External Affairs in the different Governments for many years past that the general policy they have pursued has the approval of the House, but we have not got any place. I am not suggesting that we could get any place in a short time, but we should always, when we have any shortcomings, remember that since the country was partitioned we have been labouring under enormous difficulties. If that can be brought home to the friendly nations of the world and if the other facts involved in Partition can be coupled with the fact that our industrial area is cut off from us, we might have even a little stronger case <Col N="123" /> than we have at the present time.  If we are to show any progress, if we are to get away from relief schemes, if we are to get away from the position that over the past 31 years we have had unemployment reaching 60,000 to-day and 70,000 to-morrow, with no substantial decrease in the number, we must make a determined effort&mdash; all Parties in the House, with the Government of the day as the spearhead&mdash; to try to see that the question of Partition will be resolved once and for all.</P>
    <P>There is only one plea I would like to make to the Government, through the Minister.  It is a plea for those at present in receipt of social welfare benefits.  Apropos some remarks made to-day, I might say that while the Labour Party has always been in favour of social welfare schemes, the Labour Party has never regarded these schemes as a substitute for employment. We want to see these schemes there to provide for those who, through no fault of their own, cannot provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances, old age pensioners, widows and orphans, recipients of national health insurance, unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance, are surely due for some increase.  Some other day we will debate the proposed increases to district justices, High Court judges and Circuit Court judges.  The House has agreed to increases for civil servants, on the plea that the cost of living has gone up over the last two years.  Why we tolerate, as a parliament in a democratic country, the granting of only 21/6 a week to an old age pensioner I cannot imagine. Similarly, we have the widow getting £1 a week as a non-contributory pension, or a person getting 24/- a week from national health insurance, and a person who finds himself unemployed, in receipt of 38/- a week.  If the House by a majority agrees that district justices should receive an increase of £8 per week and that other judges should receive somewhat similar amounts, surely in all justice the House could see its way to give an increase on the 21/6 for the old age pensioner <Col N="124" /> and on the 38/- for the unemployed person?</P>
    <P>I do not want to bring any discordant note into this discussion, but those people whom I have mentioned and who are in receipt of assistance from the State feel very galled when they see a majority of the House approve of the expenditure of £250,000 on the purchase of a racehorse and when they see substantial increases given to judges and so on, having regard to their own position, with the cost of living as it is at present. Surely it is not unreasonable for them to expect that this House would in turn grant some sort of increase to them to provide for the increases in the cost of living?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance is asking this House to vote a further sum of money in order that the services of the country may be conducted for a further period.  Surely Deputies must agree that Deputy McGilligan struck the nail properly on the head when he said that the reason why the Minister is asking for this sum of money, as a further Vote on Account, is to save the Government the embarrassment of going ahead with the various Estimates that have yet to be discussed?  The Government is well aware of the embarrassment that is being caused to its own supporters by the carrying through of the various Estimates on the votes of a number of Independent Deputies supporting the Government.</P>
      <P>It is quite evident that the reason behind this move is to avoid the embarrassing position of a defeat on an important division which would very likely take place if the remainder of the Estimates were to be disposed of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No wonder the Government are ashamed of the slender majority they hold in this House.  If one examines Government policy closely over the past two years one must come to the conclusion that if a Government, having presented a policy of complete destruction, got a <Col N="125" /> mandate from the people to cause havoc, ruin, disaster and damage to the whole of the country's economy it could not have been carried out more effectively or efficiently than the present Government have done during the past two and a half years.  Every step they took caused severe damage to the economy of the country and inflicted severe hardship on some sections of the community.  Can any Deputy name one section of the community with which the present Government has not come into conflict during the past two and a half years? They got into handigrips with the doctors, the workers, the dentists, the farmers, the housewives, local government officials and local government pensioners.  They did not implement in full the terms of the arbitration award to civil servants.  They did not comply with the demand of trade unions.  They did not act in complete harmony with the teachers or even with the Bishops of this country. Every section of the community was taxed in some shape or form by the present Government since they took office.</P>
      <P>Listening to the speech which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs made here to-day, one would imagine that this country was flourishing, that our people were living in the lap of luxury and enjoying a very high standard of living.  Every Deputy knows that this country is faced with an unemployment problem of a magnitude which we have never before been faced with.  Never have so many people been unemployed in this country than there have in recent months.  No matter how much the Government may assert that there has been no restriction of credit, every businessman, every industrialist and anybody who is in any way connected with the provision of employment knows quite well that there has been a restriction of credit.  The agricultural community have been handicapped as a result of restriction of credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the deplorable position of the weaker sections of our people to-day.  The Government have devoted almost ten or 12 weeks of the precious time of this House to debating <Col N="126" /> the Health Bill and a week to debating a camouflaged vote of confidence. Yet not one five minutes was devoted to consideration of the problem of providing work for the unemployed or money for the relief of the unemployed and the difficulty which the housewife of the unemployed person experiences in trying to place a loaf on the unemployed man's table so that the gnawing hunger of his children may be eased.  I am sure that there are Deputies on the Government side of the House who will stand up here and say that there is no such thing as hunger in this country to-day.  I assert that there are people hungry in this country to-day.  Many people in this city are hungry.  With the high level that the prices of foodstuffs have attained in the past two years, how could widows, orphans, the blind, the sick, those in receipt of national health benefits those in receipt of 38/- a week unemployment benefit, or even the recipient of home assistance, be otherwise than hungry?  They are hungry as a result of the cost of living figures which they are compelled to face as a result of the direct policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>A short time after the Fianna Fáil Government resumed office, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is also the Tánaiste, came into this House and charged his predecessors in office, Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, with neglect.  In particular, he said that when he resumed office he found that this office was stacked high with files containing recommendations from the Prices Advisory Body to approve of increases in the prices of foodstuffs.  The present Minister for Industry and Commerce said that his two predecessors in office failed in their duty because they left those particular files without their approval.  Was it not only proper and right that any Minister for Industry and Commerce, realising his responsibility to the worker, to the housewife and to the poorer sections of the community, would pause and examine very carefully the pros and cons of every recommendation before he approved of it and made an Order increasing the price of essential foodstuffs?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> When Fianna Fáil resumed office two years ago, the Minister for Industry and Commerce lost no time in putting his pen to work and giving his signature to recommendations from the Prices Advisory Body to increase the price of foodstuffs&mdash;prices which, even at their then level, the poorer sections of the community were hard set to pay. Every Deputy is aware that butter has become a luxury so far as the poor are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>A great many of our people are now forced to eat margarine and to forget butter completely. How many of our people in this city join the queues at the various shops and the various butchers' establishments to purchase lard or dripping because, from the lard or dripping, they make what is commonly known as &ldquo;dip&rdquo;, and instead of butter it is &ldquo;dip&rdquo; twice a day and possibly margarine on the third occasion.  The majority of the housewives in this country whose husbands are unemployed or are faced with short time, due to the Government's present policy, cannot afford to purchase butter at its present price and have had to strike it off their shopping list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone has butter been struck from the shopping list of the labouring man's wife, but it has been struck from the shopping list of the lowly paid civil servant, particularly where there is a large family.  We all know well that 1.lb. of butter would disappear very quickly in the case of a family of from five to eight.  During the inter-Party Government's term of office, the housewife, at her ease, could purchase 1 lb. of Irish creamery butter for 2/10. To-day, she must pay 4/2, and not alone must she pay that price but she must pay it for 1 lb. of imported butter, of New Zealand butter.  For the first time in living memory, we saw an Irish Government in recent months making it an offence, by Order, for an Irishman in his own city to purchase 1 lb. of Irish butter.  We saw a regulation made some time ago under which, if the people of Dublin and Bray were not anxious to purchase the <Col N="128" /> imported butter, it was rammed down their throats by ministerial Order.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister for Health time and again urging that our people should be well and properly nourished and appealing to the poorer sections of the community to interest themselves actively in procuring milk, eggs and butter in ample supply for their large families.  Not so very long ago&mdash; I think it was at the official opening of some institution in the city&mdash;we had the Minister for Health saying that we cannot expect to have a healthy nation, unless the foundation is laid in the youth.  He was making an appeal to mothers and to parents in general to see that their families were properly nourished and that the younger generation were given a good healthy foundation. He appealed for the provision of eggs, of milk and of butter in the homes.  How butter can be purchased at 4/2 per lb. in sufficient quantities to meet the needs of a houshold, I cannot understand.</P>
    <P>We can remember the price of the loaf when the inter-Party Government was in office and it is no harm to reflect on these three very prosperous years&mdash;the most prosperous years this country enjoyed since Brian Boru was slain at Clontarf.  Deputy Burke and Deputy Cowan know, and it is well known in the country, that the three most prosperous years in the history of this country were the three years during which the inter-Party Government were in office.  It was a Government which represented the organised labour section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is no wonder, in view of the present Government's complete disregard for the cost of living, that they met with very serious defeats in the three recent by-elections.  The Government are making very sure, as are those who are hanging on to the tail of the Government, a few Independent Deputies, that there will be no question of a general election because they are afraid to face the people.  Everybody knows that the results of the recent by-elections were, in plain and simple language, a notice to quit to the present Government. They signified that the majority of the people desire a change of Government, but here we are asked to-day to vote to the Government a further sum of money so that they may continue a policy which the people have rejected. We know well that the people have rejected the Government's policy mainly because of the very serious position which exists throughout the country to-day, a position in which there is increased taxation, unemployment, a high cost of living and emigration. These are the four burning questions in respect of which the people have displayed confidence in the Fine Gael Party and in the Labour Party.</P>

They may carry on for another six months another 12 months or for two years.  They may even go as far as two and a half years but they cannot go any further.  When they get so far, they are finished.  That is one consolation <Col N="130" /> the people have&mdash;that whenever the next general election comes along, there will be a change of Government.</P>
      <P>We have heard the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and even the Minister for Finance saying that it was this Government who put agriculture into a very sound position.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance boast very loudly of the fact that there has been an all-round increase in live stock and they compare the figures to-day with the figures in the period before the inter-Party Government left office.  Everybody knows that the prosperity that exists to-day in agriculture was brought about as a result of the policy of the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon.  The farmers know that and they appreciate Deputy Dillon's interest in seeing that some assistance was given to the agricultural community to enable them to increase production.</P>
      <P>In 1939 we had in this country 255,000 acres of wheat.  In 1950 we had 366,000 acres of wheat sown.  In 1939 there were 536,000 acres of oats sown and in 1950, under Deputy Dillon's administration, 614,000 acres were sown.</P>

      <P>In 1939, under Fianna Fáil, we had 73,000 acres of barley sown.  Under Deputy Dillon, in 1950, 123,000 acres of barley were sown. There were 1,700 acres of rye sown in 1939 and in 1950, under Deputy Dillon, 3,968 acres were grown.  The total acreage of corn crops in 1939 was 867,000.  Under Deputy Dillon, in 1950, it was 1,109,000 acres.  We can see that from 1939 to 1950 there was a considerably marked improvement which is definitely due to the policy which the then Minister for Agriculture advocated.</P>

In 1950 there were <Col N="131" /> 113,800.  There were 170,000 cattle of three years and over in 1939, and in 1950 there were over 350,000.

That is very clear evidence that during the years of the inter-Party Government, agriculture was coming back to its rightful place.  It is as a result of the policy which the inter-Party Government pursued at that time that we have the position to-day with regard to the number of live stock.</P>
      <P>Deputy Killilea who is querying me on these statistics may be interested in the number of asses in the country in 1939.  In 1939 there were 147,000 asses and under Deputy Dillon in 1950 there were only 114,000.</P>

This evening Deputy McGilligan dealt with all the promises made by the present Government. There was a time when the present Government promised to bring back the emigrants and to give work to all. There was a time when the present Government stood for the policy of one man one job.  We on this side of the House remember the good old days when they were endeavouring to fool the people about the policy of one man one job.  Where is that to-day?  There was a time when Fianna Fáil condemned Cumann na nGaedheal very strenuously because in 1932 taxation was £28,000,000.  At that time the Fianna Fáil Government said that the country was living in the lap of luxury, that the people were living too high and that the Government were living too high and that they could run the Government for half of what Cumann na nGaedheal ran it.</P>

      <P>Yes, £1,000 per year was too much.  In 1932, when the present Government took office, taxation was £28,000,000 and it increased every year steadily.  In 1947, they increased it to £60,000,000.  Surely to goodness they cannot blame the inter-Party Government for the increases in taxation from 1932 to 1947.  There was no inter-Party Government then. Every time there is an increases in the price of a commodity the old song is sung: &ldquo;Oh, the last crowd put us in debt and we had to bring about increases&rdquo;. They tell us that taxation is being increased because the inter-Party Government had the country sunk in debt.  From 1932 to 1947 there was no inter-Party Government and taxation was increased from £28,000,000 to £60,000,000.  The taxpayers are very well aware of that.</P>

      <P>Those people went in search of work.  A thing which never happened before in the history of this country is that we have parades of the unemployed.  Some years ago we read about them carrying black coffins to Downing Street and tying themselves to the railings.  Here in our own city we have thousands of unemployed who have to resort to protest meetings to demand publicly what they are rightly and justly entitled to&mdash;work and wages in order that they might live and bring up their families in accordance with the full terms of Christian decency.</P>

      <Col N="134" /> It is the responsibility of the Government and the other members of the Fianna Fáil Party and a responsibility which those Independents who support the present Government cannot shake off their shoulders.  They also are responsible for the unemployment position.  That position has been brought about in the building industry by the Government's policy as far as the financing of housing is concerned, the rate of interest haveing been increased under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, which makes it impossible for people to borrow for the erection of their new homes because they know they will not be in a position to pay back at the new high rate of interest.  To-day we see that in the building industry alone there are 9,000 people unemployed.</P>

You have a number of C.I.E. workers on half-time, on short time and on two days a week.  You have over 1,800 workers unemployed because of the taxes on beer and spirits. Every Deputy knows that in the food and drink industry there are publicans in the city who had eight or ten assistants and who are now running their business with three or four.  In most provincial towns throughout the country&mdash;and most country Deputies are aware of this&mdash; publichouses are doing business perhaps for a few hours on a Friday night and a few hours on a Saturday night and for the remainder of the week publicans are standing idle. There is no question whatever of employment in the bars or in the food and drink industry which is the heading under which it goes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that there are almost 1,000 people unemployed in the mining and <Col N="135" /> quarrying industry and over 700 in the engineering industry.  There is no question but that the work is available in the country.  The present Government's policy is not by any means directed towards assisting in providing work for these people.

      <P>How many years are Fianna Fáil promising this type <Col N="136" /> of public works or schemes, whatever Deputy Cowan likes to call them?  A promise of work will not put food into an empty cupboard.  It is no use to the unemployed parading the streets of Dublin to-day.  A promise of relief schemes is certainly no encouragement for any worker, be he married or single, to remain at home in Ireland if he can get work elsewhere.</P>
      <P>We had the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs telling us that workers are coming back from England at the present time; the country is on a sound footing and there is nothing wrong. Everybody knows quite well that at the time the inter-Party Government left office you had the lowest number of unemployed registered since statistics were first kept here.  Last April you had over 85,000 registered unemployed; you surely had 10,000 that were not registered.  The unemployment position in my constituency&mdash;in the towns of Birr, Tullamore, Rathdowney, Mountrath and Mountmellick&mdash;was never as serious.  We blame the Government for that state of affairs and we charge the Government with the resposibility of providing work for these people.</P>
      <P>I do not know what arguments the Government may have for the following figures but I can safely say that in my constituency of Leix in 1950 we had £47,000 under the Local Authorities (Works) Act; in 1951, £70,000 was provided; and in 1952-53, £20,000.  For the County of Offaly in 1949-50 the provision was £12,000; in 1950-51, £13,000; and this year £4,000.  The good work that was carried out, as Deputy Corish properly referred to it, under the Local Authorities (Works) Act is being drastically cut down by the Government. Every county council and every local authority is, as the result of the cutting down of moneys by the Government under the Local Authorities (Works) Act faced with the position that the unemployment figures are at a very high rate and that these figures are continually increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish, in the course of his speech, suggested a number of schemes and a number of ways and means by which work could be provided.  Is it not true to say that thousands more <Col N="137" /> could be employed on schemes of afforestation?  Is it not true to say that we have thousands of acres of old, coarse, marshy land that would be suitable for afforestation?  There has been a reduction in the number of men employed in various State forests. Less men have been employed in the State forests in my constituency.  I venture to say that if the Government desired to embark on a very extensive scheme of afforestation very vast and increased numbers could be employed on forestry schemes.</P>
    <P>Turf production is exactly the same. One would not be exaggerating in saying that thousands could be employed on turf production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The workers in Bord na Móna are dissatisfied with their present wages.  The rates are by no means attractive.  Apart from that, some encouragement should be given to private producers to produce turf. <Col N="138" /> Everybody knows that in parts of this country it is impossible to find a market for hand-won turf at the present time.  There are ample supplies of turf in Offaly and the producers cannot find a market for it. There has been a good deal of talk about protecting Irish industries. Turf production is an outstanding industry and it deserves the sympathetic ear of the Government in so far as protection is concerned.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce advises people to cut and save turf; he asks private tuff producers to increase their output, but he will not guarantee them a market for their produce.</P>
      <P>Thousands more could be employed on the land rehabilitation project. The present Government says they altered that scheme in the hope of making it more effective and thereby getting better results for the farmer. I do not agree that that has been the result of the alteration in the scheme. The scheme has been butchered.  Endless harm and untold damage have been done to the scheme.  As the scheme operated under the inter-Party Government, untold benefits were accruing to the agricultural community. The inter-Party Government were right and wise in securing the necessary machinery for the carrying out of large-scale land reclamation.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy here can see the excellent work that has been done.  To-day, in any part of the country, Deputies can see wheat and oats and barley growing successfully on land that was hitherto covered with rushes, with furze, and with water for part of the year.  To-day, that land is growing bountiful crops for man and beast because of the work done under the scheme inaugurated by the inter-Party Government.  That scheme brought wonderful benefits to the agricultural community.  Within the past 12 months an announcement was made that some of the machinery secured by the inter-Party Government was to be sold, and some of it is now awaiting the thud of the auctioneer's hammer.</P>

      <P>The machinery is up for sale.  Thousands of men could be employed in the morning repairing roads, by-roads and culs-de-sac.  How many men could be provided with employment on road-making?  How many men could be put into employment on drainage?  Many requests have been made to the Minister for Agriculture in Kilkenny and Laois and in other affected counties for the carrying out of a comprehensive scheme of arterial drainage on the Nore, on the Corrib, and on the Suck, in the constituency that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance represents. These schemes would be of lasting benefit to the community.  It should be possible to carry out drainage schemes similar to those carried out on the Brosna, in Kerry, and in other parts of the country.  The machinery is there.  Why cannot a comprehensive scheme be carried out on the Moy, on the Suck, on the Corrib, on the Nore?  These rivers are causing severe hardship to local ratepayers and landowners because of flooding.</P>

I do not approve of that, no matter what Government is in office.  I do not approve of a husband working and a wife working.  In how many cases to-day do we find the husband in receipt of a good salary, one which would enable him to live decently, and his wife out also earning nearly as big a salary.  In the next house to that man one may find the head of a family with 38/-unemployment benefit, an old age pensioner with 21/6, perhaps someone with 10/- a week home assistance, vainly endeavouring to eke out an existence and meet the ever-increasing <Col N="140" /> cost of living, rates and taxes so ruthlessly and recklessly imposed upon him by the present Government.</P>

They would see that the one-time policy so ably advocated by the Taoiseach when he referred to the good old days of one man one job would be implemented.  I will not go into the question of the man in receipt of £1,000 a year.

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling.  As regards rural electrification, I think it could be carried out on an even more extensive scale and with greater speed than it is at present.  If it were, more men could be employed on these schemes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish referred to the thousands of people who were leaving the land.  These people felt that there was no future for them by remaining in rural Ireland.  It is no wonder, therefore, that the people are leaving the land in such vast numbers.  One of the reasons for that is due to the fact that small farmers cannot get the capital they require to work the land. Therefore, they are not in position to keep their sons or workers employed on the land.  If an Irish farmer were to go into any of our Irish Banks to-day to look for a loan to increase his production or to buy live stock, everybody knows that a gangster, with a six shooter in his hand, would be more welcome in the bank than the farmer looking for a loan.</P>
      <P>Everyone in close touch with the agricultural community knows that the banks are advancing no money to farmers to enable them to purchase live stock, to purchase implements, to increase production or to pay labour. We will be told by the Minister that the funds of the Agricultural Credit Corporation are available to the agricultural community.  The fact that our small farmers cannot pay labour, cannot put more land under tillage or buy additional live stock is having a serious effect on the economy of the country. If our small farmers particularly had more capital made available to them at reasonable rates of interest, they would be in a position to increase production and employ additional labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forms which farmers who apply for loans to the Agricultural Credit Corporation are asked to fill in have always been a source of amusement to me.  On these forms they are asked to give their names and address, to state their nearest railway station and &ldquo;How much money have you in the bank&rdquo;?  That does not sound common sense.  If they had money in the bank it is probable they would use it and <Col N="142" /> would not look for a loan from the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I think that body is not fulfilling a useful service to the agricultural community, first of all, because of the rates of interest it charges, and, secondly, because of the very difficult regulations which have to be compiled with before one can obtain a loan from it.  These regulations prevent the really deserving farmer and smallholder who require capital from getting it.  Serious consideration should be given to the establishment of a credit system for farmers similar to that in operation in Holland at the present time.  I believe that, if credit were made more freely available to the agricultural community, production would be increased and Deputy Corish would not have to complain that thousands were fleeing from rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The present Government know very well that their life is very short, that as far as the people are concerned their time is up.  I have often wondered at the speeches which the Taoiseach has made time and again of always believing in facing the country if the people find fault with his policy.  At one stage, he certainly felt that the people were entitled to a change of Government any time that they so desired a change, but in no uncertain manner the Irish people have now asked for a change of Government.  The present Government are in office to-day against the wishes of the people of this country. They are working a policy which the people have no confidence whatever in. They are remaining in office in defiance of the wishes of the people.  The people, business people, the farming community and every section of the people, are clamouring to-day for a change of Government, because they know that a change of Government will not only bring about a remedy for the unfortunate state of affairs that exists to-day, but that they will get some relief from the unnecessary burdens of taxation which the present Government have placed on their shoulders.  That has been proven in no uncertain manner as a result of the victories of the Fine Gael Party in the last two by-elections.  There is outstanding proof, as far as Fianna Fáil <Col N="143" /> are concerned, that they are a Party of the past.</P>
    <P>I sat in this House for a number of years as an Independent Deputy.  I expressed my views as an Independent Deputy on matters of Government policy and of Opposition policy.  I voted as an Independent Deputy in accordance with the dictates of my conscience, but I was so impressed by the co-operation that existed between all Parties during the three years of the inter-Party Government, and so impressed in the country with the results of it, that I came to the conclusion that, as far as I was concerned, whatever contribution I could give as a Deputy in this House I would give it to the largest Party that formed the inter-Party Government, to the biggest Party, to the bitterest Party to Fianna Fáil and to the Party that was most likely to replace Fianna Fáil.  That is why I have the honour to-day of being associated with the good work that is being carried on in the ranks of Fine Gael.  I believe that, to-day, the majority of the people are clamouring behind the Fine Gael Party in the hope that, through the strength and co-operation of our colleagues and friends in the Farmers' Party and the Labour Party, we may be able to give the people an alternative Government to the set-up that they have been suffering under during the past two years, and particularly the past 12 months.  With all respect, the workings of the present Government may be looked upon with disgust and disgrace during the, past 12 months.  The people feel now, and are convinced, that that is why the present Government are not anxious to face the Irish people, because they know that there is an alternative to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>There is an alternative now.  There is no such thing as racing.  away to dissolve Parliament.  There is no such thing as declaring a general election and saying: &ldquo;The people have not confidence in us&rdquo;.  That was very fine tactics when there was not a Party big enough to beat Fianna Fáil or to form an alternative Government.  To-day, <Col N="144" /> thank God, a spirit of co-operation prevails between Fine Gael and the other Parties that comprised the inter-Party Government.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and others, time and again, have asked why the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party were so anxious to co-operate to oust Fianna Fáil.</P>

The leaders of that Party have time and again challenged the Government to go to the country, to face the people at a general election. We are satisfied that if they do, we will have a change of Government which will bring about relief in taxation, which will create work for the unemployed, reduce the cost of living and provide a decent and a better standard of living for the working-class people.</P>
      <P>When the Irish people are anxious to have such a Government, I fail to understand why the present Government should stand in the way of the people's demands.  We can only hope and trust that the people may continue in their attempts to rout the present Government from office, particularly, to rout Fianna Fáil with all its roots, branches and brambles.  Remember, the next time they go, they go for ever.  There will be no such thing as replacement after the general election.</P>
      <P>Let us hope and trust that there will be some relief of the present economic condition.  Let us hope and trust that work may be found for our people, that business may be restored where business has been deliberately damaged by the present Government's policy.  We can only hope and trust that in the months ahead we will have a new Government that will endeavour to repair some of the enormous damage that has been done in the past one and a half years.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in introducing this Vote, pointed out that <Col N="145" /> it was due to the fact that several Estimates had not been reached.  He was followed by Deputy McGilligan who gave as a reason that the Government did not desire to have debates on Estimates during the summer. Deputy Flanagan followed on the same lines.  One does not need to have an overflow of intelligence to realise the real reason for the introduction of this Vote on Account.  The real reason is the despicable tactics of the Fine Gael Deputies on the Health Bill.  They fought it, line by line, and delayed the House a great deal.  That is one of the main reasons for this Vote.  People outside realise that and all the gestures of Deputy O. Flanagan and Deputy McGilligan will not get away from that fact.  Perhaps one of the reasons why they adopted the tactics they did adopt on the Health Bill was so that they could come along now and try to convince the people that Fianna Fáil did not want to debate their Estimates.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan was quite definite that we did not want to debate our Estimates.  I do not think that we will follow the style of the Coalition Government.  They just skipped out. They got out before anyone got a chance of even debating their Budget or their Estimates.  Deputy Flanagan wanted to know when are we getting out, why do we not get out now?  He had a say in the last Government and they did not wait to be put out.  They left.  They never told us the reasons for it.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Flanagan were quite definite as to how far private house-building had been set back by the increased rate of interest.  In Dublin, as any member of the Dublin Corporation here will bear out, we have never received so many applications for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act as we have received in the last year.  I discussed the matter with Deputy McCann, who is a very active member of our housing committee, as I am, but he has greater experience than I have.  I found from him and from the corporation that of the recent £5,000,000 loan floated by the corporation, £350,000 has been allocated for small dwellings alone.</P>
      <P>During the last week our housing director told us that we would need a-further £3,000,000 to meet our obligations under small dwellings acquisitions. That does not confirm the tale of woe that we heard from Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Flanagan. These are the facts in Dublin and they cannot be denied.  How can it be said that the increased rate of interest is slowing up applications under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, it would have some effect.  I also admit that that £3,000,000 is required by Dublin Corporation to meet the added area <Col N="147" /> taken over from Dublin County Council. I want to approach this in an honest manner.  £1,000,000 of that £3,000,000 is required for our normal needs but £2,000,000 is to meet the obligations taken over from the Dublin County Council.  Even at that, it is Dublin alone&mdash;city and county.  We have never got as many applications as we are getting at the present time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hickey said: &ldquo;Surely it had some effect&rdquo;.  It had and we in Dublin Corporation are doing our best to meet that.  The increased rate of interest did increase the repayments of loans but the £275 grant from the Government and the £137 10s. additional grant from the Dublin Corporation will offset the increased charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>They are paying the new rate of interest now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The £137 10s. and the £275 brings the total State and local authority grant to £412.  That is a considerable amount off the price of any house.  If you buy a house for £1,800 the net price is £1,400.  Certainly that is meeting the increase in the rate of interest.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Cowan mentioned, the works committee set up by the Dublin Corporation have certain plans which I do not propose to go into now.  We in the Dublin Corporation are doing our level best to provide work with the number of houses we are building and the amount of other work we have in hands.</P>
      <P>I can say that there is delay in the Department of Local Government in dealing with plans or recommendations. The Minister for Finance and his colleagues should keep a closer eye on the Department of Local Government to see that plans or recommendations from local authorities will be handled more expenditiously. There is certainly reason for complaint about that both on the part of builders and local authorities. Builders will tell you that it is almost impossible to get a grant from the Local Government Department.  No matter what the Minister may tell us, every Deputy can produce concrete cases where there has been delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> I am not advocating that there should not be control by the Local Government Department with regard to the proper construction of houses or proper planning because that is necessary, but you can go too far with that, especially with a body like the Dublin Corporation who have a record of house building second to none.  We have first-class architects, and our planning officer is a first-class man. People from foreign countries who are interested in housing and who have come here have paid compliments to the Dublin Corporation for their work in connection with housing.  When a scheme goes to the Local Government Department from the Dublin Corporation it should get much speedier attention than it is getting at present. There is a fault there, and the Local Government Department should try to remedy it.</P>
    <P>As far as the Dublin Corporation are concerned, we are not so foolish as to go in for relief schemes which will only provide work of a temporary nature. As some Deputies have said, the provision of public works is the solution for this problem and that is what we should aim at in the city of Dublin.  I cannot speak with any authority about the position in the country.  Some Deputies mentioned about the work of Bord na Móna in Deputy Flanagan's constituency.  As a Dublin Deputy, I fail to see why Bord na Móna should have to publish big advertisements in the newspapers for workers while there are people in Deputy Flanagan's constituency saying they cannot get work.  These people have more experience than Dublin men in the cutting of turf.  If a Dublin man is sent down there, he knows very little about the work and it is not possible for him to earn a decent wage in any form of piece work because the work is new to him.</P>
    <P>As to the question of employment of provincial and Dublin workers, I will repeat what I said in the Dublin Corporation, that there should be a residence qualification for any such works commenced in the future.  If a person wants to get a Dublin Corporation house he must have been living in Dublin for five years in order to be <Col N="149" /> eligible.  That is only right.  I think in connection with works carried out by the Dublin Corporation there should be a stipulation that Dublin men should get priority.</P>

      <P>I will not be drawn into that.  I will not be referee between Dublin and Cork.  I have done it before and it was a tough job. There should be that stipulation in connection with Dublin Corporation work.  It is only reasonable that Dublin workers, especially building workers, should get priority, and, when they are absorbed, other workers can get a chance.  If there is a school being built in any part of the country there is a stipulation in the contract that local labour should be employed.  I do not see why the same thing should not apply to Dublin.  If a hospital is being built in Galway or a school in Navan, there is a stipulation that local labour must be employed.  That is a very wise stipulation and I should like to see it applied in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan to-day stated that there were 60,000 unemployed nearly every year since the return of the Fianna Fáil Government.  A reply which I got to a parliamentary question to-day shows that even during the period of the Coalition Government there were 60,000 unemployed.  In 1947, when the Fianna Fáil Government left office, the number was 55,623; in 1948, it was 61,203; in 1949, 60,606.  It is only fair to state that in 1950, when the Coalition were on the way out, the number came down to 53,415.  That was not a great achievement and I do not think they should boast about these figures.  When Deputies attack the Government they should mention what happened during their own term of office as well.  That was the position and the people should know that it was not as rosy as Deputy Flanagan would have us believe, as there were 60,000 unemployed. <Col N="150" /> Several reasons have been given for the increase in the number of unemployed, including the change made by the Social Welfare Act.  It is a pity that we have so many unemployed and every effort should be made to alleviate the position.  We in Dublin are doing our best in that connection.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan gave a list of unemployed people in various sections of industry and mentioned the number unemployed in the transport industry. I remember Deputy Flanagan going into the Division Lobby to vote against the provision of money needed to pay the C.I.E. losses.  If that money had not been made available there would be far more unemployed in C.I.E. Perhaps that is what Deputy Flanagan wants so that he can make a speech here which will impress himself and himself only.  The Opposition may consider it a grand thing to be able to shout about the number of unemployed, but Deputy Flanagan and other Opposition Deputies voted against the provision of money for meeting the C.I.E. losses.  If the Fianna Fáil Government had not made that money available there would be far more people unemployed in C.I.E.  I do not think it is fair that Deputies should approach things in that way.  Deputy Flanagan has been here longer than I have been and he should have a proper outlook on things like that.  When Deputies quote figures, they certainly should mention what happened previously.  I have given the figures for unemployment during the Coalition period of office. Deputy McGilligan made a great harangue about food subsidies and the increase in the price of food.  He did not tell us that Fine Gael will restore the subsidies.  If they do restore them, the question is where are they to get the money?  I think we should hear these things.  When a man of Deputy McGilligan's standing says that we should not have reduced the food subsidies he should tell us whether he will put them back and put a tax on beer and cigarettes and so on to get the money.</P>

      <P>When they broke up we found they were not happy at all. They were pulling against each other like tug-o'-war teams and I think the best Taoiseach in the world could not keep them together.  We had talk about co-operation.  God forbid, if Fine Gael were to get back.  How could there be co-operation there when you regard the Labour Party's and the Fine Gael Party's attitude on the Health Bill? You cannot have co-operation there.  I <Col N="152" /> do not see how that kind of co-operation could last.  I would say there are more Labour-minded Deputies on this side of the House than on the Fine Gael side.  I always had Labour associations in the City of Dublin and I am not ashamed of it.  I found the Dublin workers as good as you get anywhere. I know the Dublin workers want this Health Bill.  Fine Gael do not.  Labour do, and rightly so.  We hear all this talk about co-operation and what is going to happen, but I do not see how with their conduct it would be possible to have co-operation. These three and a half glorious years were anything but glorious or happy. They may have been happy in the sense that they had the Marshall Aid money.  I did not hear Deputy McGilligan speak of this.  I do not think he referred to it at all unless he did so when I was out of the House&mdash; or Deputy Flanagan either.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flanagan when he mentioned the Prices Advisory Body said the Minister found files on the floor from the Prices Advisory Body recommending increases in prices and the two Ministers for Industry and Commerce at that time, Deputies Morrissey and O'Higgins simply put them there and left them there.  They remind me of Margaret Mitchell's book, <i>Gone with the Wind.</i>  In that book there was a character named Scarlett O'Hara who when she had any problem to decide said: &ldquo;I will think about that to-morrow.&rdquo; He told us himself they were on the floor and he painted a vivid picture such as Deputy Flanagan can paint.

      <P>I think you were.  If you look up the records of the House you will find the bills were there.  I am speaking for myself.  I do not think one in public life should get up and give a lot of figures that one cannot back up.  I do not think that is right. It has been said that if you cannot get honesty in public life, democracy is a farce.  As a new Deputy, not long in public life, it shakes your confidence when you hear lots of people talking about figures that you know in your heart and soul are not true and about three and a half glorious years which proved anything but glorious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were returned to power in 1951 they came at a time when the economic and financial position of this country was gravely threatened.  There is no doubt about that and all the talk by Deputies McGilligan and Flanagan will not get away from that.  They got out because their current Budget was unbalanced and they had an enormous adverse trade balance and it was caused by excessive imports of consumer goods and insufficient exports.  Those were the facts at the time and nobody can deny that.  They cannot say that Budget was balanced.  What did we do?  We tried to put the country back on a sound financial basis.  It may not have been popular, but we had to do it for the good of the country as a whole. We had not this Marshall Aid money to squander.  I claim that the Coalition Government scandalously misused that. People on the opposite side may smile about that, but the facts are there. With what was left to us we had to <Col N="154" /> meet the bills of the Coalition and to pay them, and try and get out of the gloomy position in which we found ourselves.</P>
    <P>I do not think the three and a half years were glorious.  I do not think it was honest effort at all for this country, and I think that the people in the long run were glad it was ended. Since we came back in 1951 we made a very good effort to balance our Budget.  We made a big effort to get rid of the gap in the balance of payments and certainly a brave effort to get more money used for capital development. We tried to increase exports and reduce imports.  The facts are there.  They have been told several times in this House that that is the position.  Since we have been in office more goods have been exported and less imported.  I do not claim to be an expert on the Department of Agriculture, as I said on the Estimate, but I have been told that agricultural production has certainly improved a good deal.  I have also been told that the farmers have got increased prices. Deputy Flanagan, on that score, did not mention the farmers getting increased prices.  He simply went on the lines of increased prices for milk and butter.  You cannot have it both ways. Would he go down to the farmers of Laois-Offaly and say: you are not going to get increased prices for your products&mdash;you should not get them? But it is a grand thing to come up here or to a meeting in Bray and talk about increased prices for butter and milk. Fianna Fáil tried to be fair to every section of the community, and while I do not agree it is right that Dublin should pay such prices for butter and milk&mdash;well, I think a case could be made for the farmers.  As I said, speaking on the Estimate, it is about time that something was done to satisfy the farmers.</P>
    <P>I want, if possible, however, to get cheaper milk and butter for the people of Dublin, and I think any effort that can be made from any side of the House, especially by farmer Deputies, with that end in view will be appreciated. I think that Fianna Fáil have faced the problems left them by the Coalition in a courageous manner.  It was an unenviable task in many ways. <Col N="155" /> We had to balance the Budget, meet the debts that were due and try to put the finances of the country on a proper foundation.  It was a tough job and I feel we handled it pretty well, although we came in for a lot of abuse from the opposite side.  If they were in power there is no doubt that they would have to face the self-same job. They would have to pay these bills; they would have to give increases in salaries to the Civil Service, to the teachers, Civic Guards and Army, and find the money for all that.  They would have, as I said, to meet the self-same problems as those with which we have had to deal and they never told us how they would handle them.  Somebody mentioned borrowing but I think their efforts in that direction previously could never have been said to have been successful.</P>
    <P>There was criticism of the fact that we floated a £20,000,000 loan, and that we offered a fairly attractive rate of interest, but let us look at that from the point of view of the provision of housing.  There is no use in talking about housing if money is not available to finance it.  Most of that loan, more than 50 per cent. of it, I would say, went back into housing.  Somebody mentioned a figure of £12,000,000, but I would say that 50 per cent. of it, at least, went into housing.</P>
    <P>I would further suggest that the reason for increasing the rate of interest on the £20,000,000 loan was the fact that loans which had previously been floated by the Coalition Government were not by any means a great success.  I take it that Deputy McGilligan at the time he was Minister had the self-same experts and the self-same staff to advise him, as the present Minister for Finance has. I have heard many tributes paid here from time to time to the officials of the Department of Finance and they must have convinced the Minister that there was no point in going to the market looking for money at the old rates of interest, having regard to their experience in the three and a half years during which the Coalition Government were in power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has been argued by more able Deputies than I and I am sure that if Deputy Rooney were to look up the facts he would find that I am fairly accurate in what I say.  There would be no sense in going to the market for money at the old rate of interest because it would not be available.  If we want to get more money for housing and for other development schemes, an attractive rate of interest simply had to be offered and there would be no point in looking for it at a lower rate of interest.  Of the £20,000,000 we in the corporation got close on £5,000,000 and we made very good use of it. There is no use, as I say, in talking about housing or capital development if you have not the £.s.d. and we certainly used that £20,000,000 to good purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given figures in regard to housing in Dublin and in regard to the operation of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act.  We are certainly doing very well there.  By giving a supplementary grant, we have made every effort to meet the higher rate of repayments.  The Dublin people are not yet fully aware of the existence of that £137 10s. by way of supplementary grant, but the more people who know about it the better it will be for everyone concerned.  As I see it, all the experts on the far side of the House will tell you all about food subsidies and the great time the people had when they were in office, but they are prepared to make very few positive suggestions to meet the present situation.  We are plagued in the Dublin Corporation with members of that type who will come in and talk a lot of hot air, but when you ask them to go on a committee, on which they <Col N="157" /> can do some practical work, they are not so ready to give their co-operation.</P>

      <P>I agree, but there is no point in Deputies coming in here to tell us what is wrong without offering some concrete suggestions as to the manner in which things might be improved. The Fianna Fáil Deputies, who are dealing with the works committee in the corporation, know what is needed and we are not behind hand in telling the Government what we think should be done.  There is no use coming in here to make the poor mouth if Deputies are not prepared to tell us how they would deal with the grievances of which they complain.  Deputy Flanagan had a lot to say about rural electrification. Surely he does not think that the Government are open to any criticism on that score?</P>

      <P>They know well the progress made by the Government in rural electrification and industrial development generally.  I do not know whether I would be in order in referring to industrial development in the past, but Deputy McGilligan went back to the days of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government when he first held office as Minister.  He referred to some schemes which he said they initiated, but he simply glossed over them because he knew he was on very shaky ground.  He mentioned sugar beet factories, the Shannon scheme and the Dairy Disposals Board.  He did not tell us that they did nothing whatever, or practically nothing, to deal with the legacy of bad housing in Dublin which they had inherited.  They made a very small effort, a very poor effort, to deal with that.  Deputy Mulcahy, I think, was Minister for Local Government at that time.</P>

      <P>I had an idea that Deputy Mulcahy was there as Minister for some time, but there were so many changes of Ministers even at that time that it was hard to keep track of them. Later we know that they had Deputy Morrissey and Deputy Dr. O'Higgins. in turn, as Ministers for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>Deputy Liam Cosgrave was the only person who did any work there and he was not a Minister at all.  As I say, they did nothing to deal with the legacy of bad housing which they inherited from the British. We, in turn, inherited that legacy from Cumann na nGaedheal.  The Deputy made some reference to the unemployment that prevailed since Fianna Fáil came into power, but he did not mention the state of unemployment that prevailed when he was in power. He did not tell you of the thousands of young people&mdash;and I was one of them&mdash;who were unemployed at that time.  My father and my brothers were also unemployed, but there are very few Deputies on the other side who were ever unemployed.  I know what it is to be unemployed.  I was 19 years of age at that time and I found it very difficult to get a job.  I think it a pity that Deputies over there were not unemployed for even an hour.  If they were, they would learn a very good lesson.  I know, as I say, what it is to be unemployed.  I know, too, the hardship that was caused to old age pensioners at that time when they cut their pensions by 1/- a week.  I hope that if Fine Gael ever get into power in the future they will never do such a thing again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that they had nothing to boast about whatsoever.  Deputy McGilligar. to-day simply glossed over that in a very short manner.  It did not take <Col N="159" /> him two minutes to go into what they achieved in that time.  I think it would take him less to go into it over his three and a half years as Minister for Finance in the Coalition time.  It makes me sick at times to hear people talking like that.  If they were such great people as Deputy McGilligan thinks why then does he himself have always to fight for the last seat in Dublin North Central?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully suggest &mdash;well you should hear the speech of Deputy Flanagan.  It is amazing what he gets away with, but nobody over here can make any particular point at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean it, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in any such sense.  If I have made a reflection I gladly withdraw it.  If you think I am making a reflection on the Chair I withdraw it without question.  But there you have those people telling us of the glorious Government they were and will be when they get back into power again.  You have only to look at the records from the time the State was formed to 1932 and from 1948 to 1951. They were anything but bright periods in the history of this State.  I knew it at the time.  I was a young man and I saw what was happening in Dublin City and I remember it very well. I also know that during their three and a half years there you still had that 60,000 unemployed no matter what they say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures were there and you just cannot get away from it.  As I see it, and as I said before, we had to face big problems when we returned to power and I think the present Minister and his Government as well tackled them in a courageous manner.  There is no question about that.  They realised that the two Budgets they brought in were, from a political point of view, dynamite.  There is no other way to call it than that.  They realised <Col N="160" /> that, from a political point of view, it would be anything but popular, and they certainly had to do it.  It has to be said, time and again: do you think men like the Taoiseach and the present Minister would enjoy hurting the people of this country when you look at their record in the fight for freedom, every one of them?  Do you think that they were deliberately hurting the Irish people?  That is what Deputy Flanagan would have you believe.  As I say, look at the record of our men here.  Now, honestly, there is nobody on the far side of the House or in this country who would believe that men like the Taoiseach, Deputy MacEntee, Deputy Aiken and Deputy Jerry Boland would deliberately hurt the Irish people.  They just got this country back at the right time before it was knocked out completely.  It was groggy and they just got it in time.  They had to take the courageous steps they have taken because they are courageous men.  I think that they have handled the situation very well.</P>
    <P>We here now in Dublin would like to see butter and things like that at reduced prices, and we would like to see a little bit more work for the men who are walking around.  I interviewed those men, I interviewed the deputation from the Unemployed Association, and the first thing they told me was this: &ldquo;We do not want any political Party to make capital out of our situation.&rdquo; I think that a few of them, if they listened to the speeches &mdash;I exclude Deputy Corish from that &mdash;would certainly think they were trying to make capital out of that.  They gloried in the fact that there were men walking the streets of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is right that anyone should be proud of the fact that there are 60,000 or 70,000 unemployed.  One of the complaints made was that they were coming back at the rate of hundreds a week.  I say it is only right that they should come back to their own country.  It is better to see them here.  It would be a grand thing if we could provide work for every one of them.  It is the duty of the Government to make every effort to provide employment.  It was said time and again that Deputy McGilligan&mdash;I do not know whether it is true&mdash;made the statement that it was not the duty of the Government to provide work for everybody.  That has been denied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The other portion of Deputy McGilligan's speech was quoted.  I am including that, that it was not the duty of the Government to provide work for anybody.  I think it is the duty of a Government to try to get people in good employment, if possible.  We are trying to do that in this Budget in ways that were unpopular, trying to get the country back on a solid financial basis first of all, and then get people to work in a happier frame of mind.  If you know that you have the financial state of the country in a safe position you can then work in a better frame of mind. That is what, as I say, Deputy MacEntee, the Minister, had in mind in getting this country back first of all, in trying to repair the damage done by the Coalition and then getting down to work.  That is the position, and it is a grand time for the Opposition to try to have this urge for power, this desire for power, because they know that within the next year or so the fruits of this policy will come to a head and things will be looking brighter.  Now it is a grand time for Fine Gael, after we had cleaned up the mess, to try to get in. It is the right way to do it.  I take it is a political game, and when you see Fine Gael saying what they would <Col N="163" /> do if they only got a chance of getting into power it is only, I suppose, fair tactics and you cannot blame the Opposition for doing that.  It is part of the game, only I hope they would be able to clean things up instead of worsening our present position.</P>
