      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the earnings of Irish shipping companies and the payments to foreign shipping companies in the years 1951 and 1952 as computed for the balance of international payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh O Briain) (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>In computing the Balance of International Payments Statement for the country, a debit entry relating to imported goods, valued as in the official trade statistics, i.e., on the cost, insurance and freight (c.i.f.) basis is made.  Consequently the total payments in respect of freight made to all shipping companies are included implicitly in this entry.  To allow for the fact that a certain amount of the freight charges is paid to Irish shipping companies and to include any external earnings of these companies, a credit entry is made, equal to the estimated gross freight earnings from all sources of the Irish shipping companies less payment outside the State in respect of equipment, charter, hire, repairs, bunkers, harbour dues, etc. The amount of this credit entry was £1,410,000 in 1951 and (provisionally) £1,643,000 in 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For balance of international payments purposes, it is accordingly not <Col N="2" /> necessary to estimate explicitly payments to foreign shipping companies. Information is not at present available which would form a basis for a reliable estimate of this figure.</P>

    <P>*The content of the figures in 1953 differs from that in the earlier years due to the legislative changes effected by the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  While it is not possible to give a precise measure of the effect of the legislative changes in increasing the Live Register, an investigation made in February, 1953 indicated that the increase at that date was in the region of 10,000.</P>

      <P>The estimated percentage of insured persons on the live register at the middle of April, 1953 (exclusive of agriculture, fishing and private domestic service) was 12.0 per cent.  As I indicated in my reply to Deputy Kyne on 29th April, <Col N="4" /> 1953, this figure is subject to revision when the estimates of the current number of persons insured in the relevant categories become available. These statistics are not yet ready but the indications are that the effect of using the current data for the insured population will be to reduce the percentage by between 1/2 and 1 per cent.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the net tonnage of steam and motor vessels registered in the Republic of Ireland at the latest available date and in respect of such tonnage (a) the amount owned in the State; (b) the amount engaged in coastal, cross-Channel and other trade and (c) the amount on charter to foreign companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>At the 30th April, 1953, steam and motor vessels on the main Irish register totalled 42,240 tons net, including fishing boats amounting to 2,376 tons net. Vessels on the Irish fishing boat register, including some sailing vessels and the fishing boats which are also on the main register, amounted to 7,113 tons net.  This makes a total of 46,977 tons net of Irish registered vessels.</P>
      <P>Separate returns of vessels on the Irish register owned by Irish citizens or companies incorporated in the State are not compiled.  Considerable research would be necessary to establish this information but I understand that most of the tonnage on the Irish register is owned by Irish citizens or companies incorporated in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the total registered tonnage, 12,288 tons net was engaged on the cross-Channel and coastal trade; 19,468 tons net on the deep-sea and continental trade; 7,113 tons net on fishing and 8,090 tons net on miscellaneous <Col N="5" /> services.  It is not possible to give separate figures for vessels engaged on the cross-Channel or coastal trades as the same vessels usually engage in both trades.</P>
    <P>Irish shipowners are not required to furnish particulars of their vessels which may be on charter to foreign companies.</P>
    <P>Irish citizens and companies incorporated in the State are not required by law to furnish particulars of their vessels registered outside the State.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>The retail price of sugar which prevailed up to the 18th May was less than the economic price and was possible only because a levy was collected in respect of the sugar content of exported commodities.  Circumstances in the export markets have changed and as from the 1st July the two-price system will be discontinued. An adjustment in the retail price was consequently necessary as I was satisfied that Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann could not bear the loss of revenue involved.  The considerations affecting the export trade in sugar goods were known to my Department but would not normally come within the purview of the Prices Advisory Body.  Consequently I did not consider it necessary, quite apart from other considerations, to refer the case to that body.</P>
      <P>In fixing the new price I took into account the higher cost of beet, wages and freight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state what were the profits of the sugar company during the last three years and whether he took those profits into account when the increase in the price of sugar was determined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The accounts of the sugar company are published in the Dáil.  I am quite satisfied that they are not making excessive profits.  On the contrary, the sugar company are satisfied that their profits are not large enough to meet their own commitments. Might I mention also that the present price of sugar in this country is lower than the unsubsidised price of sugar in any other country in Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider that before increasing the price of an essential commodity such as sugar it would be desirable to have the matter investigated publicly by a body such as the Prices Advisory Body?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained, the circumstances were such on the export market that it was possible for us to levy 2d. per lb. On all sugar used in the manufacture of goods for export. That was possible because of sugar rationing in Britain.  Now that rationing restrictions have been greatly reduced in Britain&mdash;and it has been announced that rationing is going to end&mdash;it is no longer possible for us to operate the two price system and that export levy must stop, otherwise trades such as those engaged in the manufacture of condensed milk and chocolate crumb would be gravely affected.  These manufacturers produce these goods for export and must get an economic price. Consequently, the additional revenue which the sugar company was getting from the levy upon the export of sugar has ceased.  We now have to put all sugar on the basis of an economic price.  There is no question of any investigation by the Prices Advisory Body in that regard.  They are not familiar with the question of policy which made it possible to operate the two-price system in the past and which makes it necessary to terminate it now.  The only change that has been made is that we adjust the revenue of the sugar company to the loss of <Col N="8" /> revenue in relation to that charge&mdash;to the loss of revenue from the dropping of the export levy.</P>

The rate for the Six Counties in the same year was 78.</P>

In the meantime temporary arrangements have been made to reimburse insured persons any travelling expenses necessarily incurred by them in attending at the nearest centre at which an ophthalmic surgeon is at present available.</P>

      <P>With regard to the third part of the question, I may say that, irrespective of what may be the conditions governing appointments under other local bodies, I can see no good reason at present for the removal of the regulation in question, which in my opinion, continues to serve a useful purpose.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the action which, as indicated by the Minister for Finance in his financial statement on 6th May, 1953, the Government <Col N="23" /> propose to take in relation to the report of the Civil Service Arbitration Board presented to Dáil Éireann on the 18th February, 1953, namely, to give effect to the finding of the board subject to the modification that the increases shall operate with effect from 1st April, 1953.&mdash;(An tAire Airgeadais.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this motion adjourned last Thursday evening I was dealing with certain misleading statements made from time to time in regard to the Government's responsibilities&mdash;(1) for the appointment of the arbitrator and (2) for the time which had elapsed since the arbitrator had made his award.  I pointed out that it was quite incorrect to say that the arbitrator had been my sole choice. The scheme provides that the person to be nominated as chairman of the arbitration board is to be nominated by the Minister for Finance in agreement with the staffs and it was as a result of such agreement that I nominated the present chairman of the board and the Government appointed him.  I could not have made that nomination unless I had secured the agreement of the staffs.  In fact, the position is that the arbitrator has been the joint choice both of the staffs and of the Minister for Finance.  The next thing is that I pointed out that there has been no undue delay in dealing with the report of the board.  In fact, if we contrast the expedition with which the staffs' claim had been dealt with on this occasion with the manner in which their claim for increased remuneration had been dealt with in 1950 and 1951 it will be clear that we have been as anxious as they have been to have this claim of theirs dealt with at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important to bear in mind that the scheme does not compel the Government against its better judgment of what is in the best interests of the taxpayers and the community as a whole to accept the recommendations of the arbitration board.  On the contrary, both the scheme now in operation and the scheme which my predecessor agreed to with the staffs <Col N="24" /> provide specifically that the Government may or may not as it sees fit&mdash; and, as I have said and as I should like to emphasise, as the best interests of the community as a whole seem to demand&mdash;either accept or reject the recommendations in the board's report and may ask the Dáil either to reject these recommendations <i>in toto</i> or to accept any modification of them which the Government thinks it desirable to make.  Therefore, there cannot be any question of a breach of faith in a matter of this sort.</P>
    <P>What we have to consider is, on the one hand, the claims of the staff who naturally expect that the recommendations will be given effect to and, on the other hand, what is equally important in this country of ours, the capacity of the community and of the taxpayer to accept the new burdens.</P>
    <P>When this report was presented to me on 18th November last, the Exchequer position was even then clearly a critical one.  It was essential that it should be fully investigated before any decision could be taken on the report.  In that connection, I think it is important to bear in mind the terms of the agreement&mdash;because the agreement setting up the board does cover specifically the sort of situation with which the Minister for Finance was faced towards the close of the calendar year 1952.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of article 20 of Department of Finance circular 11/52 dealing with conciliation and arbitration machinery for the Civil Service reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) When they receive a report from the Arbitration Board on a claim for a general revision of Civil Service pay, the Government will, when presenting the report to Dáil Éireann, in accordance with paragraph 19 preceding, adopt one of the following courses:</P>
    <P>(a) Signify that they propose to give immediate effect to the findings of the board in full;</P>
    <P>(b) Introduce a motion in Dáil Éireann proposing the rejection or modification of the findings;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="25" /> (c) Signify (i) that they consider that it would not be possible, without imposing additional taxation, to give full effect to the findings within the current financial year, (ii) that they propose to defer a final decision on the report until the Budget for the next following financial year is being framed and (iii) to what extent, if any, they propose in the interval, without prejudice to the final decision, to give effect to the findings, the extent of the payment to be determined by the amount which can be met without imposing additional taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be seen that that article, and particularly sub-paragraph (c), covers exactly the situation with which we were faced in November, 1952.  It makes it quite clear that the Government is at liberty, without violating any part of the agreement, to state (1) that they consider that it would not be possible, without imposing additional taxation, to give effect to the findings within the current financial year, (2) that they propose to defer a final decision on the report until the Budget for the following financial year is being framed and, (3) to what extent, if any, they propose in the interval, without prejudice to the final decision, to give effect to the findings, the extent of the payment to be determined by the amount which can be met without imposing additional taxation.</P>
    <P>The report of the arbitration board was presented to Dáil Éireann on 18th February, last.  In presenting it, I took the opportunity of fully explaining the Government's position in relation to the recommendations contained in the report.  I pointed out that it would not be possible for us to give effect to the findings within the current financial year without imposing additional taxation and that we proposed to defer a final decision on the report until the Budget for the following financial year was being framed.  I explained that, in view of the Exchequer position, it would not be possible to meet any part of the award for the financial year 1952-1953.  When, in due <Col N="26" /> course, the Budget for the current financial year was being framed, it was then clear that we were going to have a deficit on the Budget of the preceding year.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that it is not the policy of this Government to borrow in order to provide the funds to remunerate any class of public servant. I think it would be quite impossible to keep the finances of this State in good and sound order and to keep the State solvent if we were once to abandon that principle, particularly in the circumstances in which we were framing the Budget for this year.  When the Budget was being framed it became clear that, provided we could secure the necessary economies in the public administration to enable us to do it, it would be possible for us to give full effect to the recommendations of the arbitration board and to apply these in general principle to the remainder of the public services and those services the personnel of which draw their remuneration in whole or in part from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing something to-day about taxation and we heard a great deal about it last week.  It seems relevant, therefore, to consider the extent to which self-denial has been enforced on the taxpayer by reason of the fact that the Government feels bound to give effect to the recommendations made by the arbitration board and to apply them over the whole body of the public services as I have indicated. The cost of applying the award to the Civil Service as a whole and of making a corresponding adjustment in pay of other persons remunerated in whole or in part from the Exchequer, including the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána and teachers, will be £2,400,000.</P>
    <P>For those who like to deal with these problems in the manner in which a Minister for Finance, an amateur Minister for Finance, might be expected to approach them, we can say that that £2,400,000 represents roughly a tax structure of this order: 2d. per pint on the beer duty; 1d. per packet of 20 cigarettes on the tobacco duty; and 1d. per lb. on sugar.  That would <Col N="27" /> bring in something in the order of £2,400,000, more or less.  If that particular tax scheme does not please, and you still want to find £2,400,000, you can increase the beer duty by 1d. a pint, still retain the increase of 1d. per packet of 20 cigarettes, and increase income-tax by 4½d. in the £.  Again, if you decide that the best thing would be to get the whole amount out of one tax, an excise and customs duty of 3d. per lb. on sugar would give approximately the £2,400,000, which it is going to cost the taxpayer to give effect to the award in this year.</P>
    <P>We should be quite clear in regard to this matter that it is not and cannot be a one-way traffic.  If we are going to recommend increased remuneration for public officers of any sort, we have to face up to the corresponding obligation of imposing taxation in order to secure that sum and I have roughly outlined the scheme of taxation which the finding of this £2,400,000 represents.</P>
    <P>We have considered this matter very carefully in the light of these figures. We would have been very glad indeed if we had been able in this year's Budget to grant some remission in taxation but we find ourselves committed to the arbitration procedure.  We have indicated that we were prepared to accept it and to work it and we are giving effect, therefore, to the award to the extent that we think it practicable and possible to do so, the financial circumstances of the State being what they are to-day.</P>

      <P>Deputies are probably aware that certain amendments to the motion proposed by the Minister for Finance appear on the Order Paper but have been ruled out of order.  It would seem that the procedure adopted by the Minister and the terms of his motion have been devised expressly and designedly for the purpose of preventing any motion which would be in order to express the <Col N="28" /> views which we desire to record, disapproving of the action of the Minister for Finance in failing to carry out the entire of the Civil Service award of the 18th November of last year.  I endeavoured to meet the situation, from the point of view of order in the House, by framing an amendment which would call upon the Minister to reconsider that decision, and I framed that amendment on the basis that justice and the public interest required the reconsideration of the decision.  We have no alternative now but to vote directly against the Minister's proposal. I propose on behalf of my colleagues to indicate our reasons, based upon the twofold reasons that were enshrined in the amendment that we endeavoured to put before the House, that justice and the public interest require reconsideration by the Minister of his action in reference to the arbitration award and that he should pay that award in full and honour its terms to the utmost.  We wish to get an expression from this House disapproving of the action of the Minister, while at the same time securing that there will be no further or undue delay in the payment of the moneys which are due to the public officials under the arbitration award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose, in the first place, to deal with the justice of the case which we put forward and which we ask the House to accept.  The Minister has stated that he and his colleagues in the Government decline to honour this arbitration award because of their solicitude for the taxpayers, and because, as I understand his statement, there were not sufficient moneys available last year to give full effect to the award and to secure to the public officials the payment of the amounts awarded as from 1st November last year.  He throws out the suggestion that a variety of taxes would be necessary to secure the full carrying out of the award.  I want to emphasise at the outset of the remarks I have to make that the entire justification for this award is based upon the results of Government policy, and is due entirely to Government policy and nothing else, because, had there not been such a fundamental alteration in <Col N="29" /> Government policy as to bring about a 20 per cent. increase in the cost of living, there would almost certainly have been either no application to the Government or resort to arbitration procedure to gain a further increase for Civil Service and other public remuneration.</P>
    <P>That is a matter that has to be fully realised at the outset and all the time &mdash;that the necessity for the application to the arbitration board and the decision by the arbitration board were due, and due entirely and solely, to Government policy, and there would have been no necessity for taxation or for any increased taxation&mdash;and, indeed, probably no necessity whatever for any application for increases in Civil Service or public remuneration&mdash;had not the cost of living risen to such an extent that the interest of these public servants and their families urgently required that they should get some alleviation in the way of increased pay. That is the justice of their demand&mdash; that it was because of Government policy that the purchasing power of their remuneration was so decreased that they were unable even to meet the cost of purchasing for themselves the ordinary necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>I want to insist and to emphasise that, in this arbitration award, there is really no element of retrospective payment.  In the award of the arbitration board given in the month of May, 1951, there was a recommendation, which was honoured, that the amounts of the award should be related back to January of that year.  In this case, there is no such retrospection at all.  It appears that the claim was made on behalf of the civil servants in July of last year and was considered at conciliation level between representatives of the staff and representatives of the Minister for Finance.  It was subsequently referred to arbitration, it not having been found possible for agreement to be reached.  The arbitration board sat on 3rd and 4th November and reserved their decision, which was given on 18th November. The recommendation in that decision is that payment of the amount awarded, the additional percentages on salaries, <Col N="30" /> should date from 1st November, that is, two days before the actual hearing before the arbitration board.</P>
    <P>The civil servants had asked that their claim should be granted as from a date in July.  The arbitration board did not grant that, but, in effect, granted it from the date when the arbitration proceedings were held and heard so that there is no element of retrospectivity in the findings of the board at all.  It might reasonably be said that if, as apparently was accepted on all sides, there had been, between the months of January, 1951, and the hearing in November, 1952, an increase to the order of 20 per cent. in the cost of living, merely to give compensatory payment or increase of salary to meet that situation from the month of November until the end of the financial year was really giving something which could hardly be said to be the entire demand of the civil servants, based upon the case they put forward.</P>
    <P>The cost of living did increase and, in mid-August, shortly after the claim had been made by the civil servants, the cost-of-living index figure rose to 122.  On 15th January, 1951, it was 102, and in mid-May, shortly after the previous award was promulgated, it was 109, so that, between May, 1951, and August, 1952, the cost-of-living index figure went up from 109 to 122.  The award was not promulgated until November, 1952, and then the award was only to be carried into effect as from 1st November.  As a direct result of Government policy, the taking away of the subsidies and thereby increasing the actual cost of the necessaries of life and the increased taxation, bringing about what was admittedly to be brought about and what certainly was an inevitable consequence of Government policy, an increase in the cost of living, that cost of living impacted very heavily upon the public servants of this State.</P>
    <P>That being so, and it being admitted that there was that increase in the cost of living, and it being further admitted that the very policy of the Government in withdrawing the food <Col N="31" /> subsidies, in, as they said, letting economic forces have their play, letting wages rise so that food and other necessaries of life should reach their economic level, that wages should bear some relation to realities and that food and other necessary commodities should be related to their economic price, wages all round were increased in other employments, in industrial and agricultural employment.  The result of the Government's decision, so far as it can be seen, is that the only salary or wage-earning section of this community who will not get any relief for the increase in the cost of living, due entirely to Government policy, during the entire of last year, are the public servants of the State. That is unjust and we say therefore that justice requires that in every respect this award should be carried out to the full.</P>
    <P>In the actual report of the arbitration board, what I have just been indicating is clearly set out.  The submissions on the staff side are set out and the submissions on the official side given in the same detail.  Paragraph 5 of that report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Neither at conciliation nor in their counter-statement had the official side attempted to challenge that an increase of 20 per cent. in the cost of living as reflected in the official index figures had taken place since January, 1951.  It is, therefore, to be inferred that the official side had accepted the fact and that there was no disagreement about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the position, that consequent upon and due entirely to Government policy, increased taxation and the withdrawal of food subsidies, the cost of living went up, from January, 1951, to the middle of August, 1952, by 20 per cent.  Now it would appear that the result of the Minister's action, which I assume to be the action of his colleagues as a whole in the Government, is that only portion of the award is to be carried out and that, while the justice of the civil servants' claim is recognised from this time on, nevertheless, because it is alleged that there <Col N="32" /> was not sufficient money to pay that amount of money from November until the end of March, the civil servants are not to get any compensation for the heavy increase in the cost of living that had accrued in the period I have mentioned. That is unjust.</P>
    <P>We do not believe for one moment that there were not available to the Minister for Finance moneys which could have been applied and which ought to have been applied for the discharge of this amount.  Deputy McGilligan in the course of his speech on the Financial Resolution indicated one particular source.  Deputies will recall that in the course of his Budget speech the Minister referred in detail to those funds which are variously referred to as till money, balances in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners and other appellations of that kind, and he gave the House the information that there was in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners on the 31st March of this year a sum of £2,500,000, unexpended moneys, accrued over a period of years, which had been allowed to accumulate.  He proposed, as part of his Budget plan, to apply £500,000 of that £2,500,000 for the purpose of warlike stores.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether they are called warlike stores or defensive equipment or by any other term the Minister had in his hands, according to his own statement, £2,500,000.  That sum, he had stated, had been around the figure of £1.9 million since about 1947 or 1948, and he rather suggested that £1.9 million was regarded as something normal.  At all events, £2,500,000 is available to him of moneys which had been kept in reserve and which could have been applied for the payment of the amount <Col N="33" /> due under the award from 1st November to 31st March and which would not have nearly exhausted or gone anywhere like nearly exhausting that £2,500,000.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has already in this House many times, I think, stated that while he was Minister for Finance it had been his intention that £1.9 million of cash reserve, or till money as I think the present Minister for Finance likes to call it, should be liquidated over a period of years, that he had plans to liquidate that amount, that there was no necessity whatever for keeping that big sum of money in reserve and he had arrangements made, had he continued as Minister for Finance, to liquidate that amount of money and to leave it aside from being that kind of hidden reserve which it has been for so many years. At all events, there was a hidden reserve of £2,500,000, and we say the Civil Service award could have been paid in full from 1st November of last year without adding one farthing of taxation to the already overburdened taxpayers of this country.</P>
      <P>There were other methods by which it could be done.  We do not believe for one moment that more revenue could not have been got in had the Minister for Finance been sufficiently astute and alive and alert, as he could have been.  At all events, we are quite satisfied that the £2,500,000 of reserve, which was not required and which really should not have been there to the extent to which it was there, was fully available to discharge a claim which was payable in equity and justice and in accordance with any of the standards of fair play which ought to have been extended by the Government to their State servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every single employment, agricultural and industrial, in this country was forced, as a result of Government policy and the rise in the cost of living, to give increases during the greater part of last year, to a greater or lesser extent, to meet the rise in the cost of living and the only section of the community that is to be allowed to suffer this injustice of getting no compensation whatever during that <Col N="34" /> very bitter year, last year, are the public servants of this State.  We see no reason in justice or in equity to approve of that situation but, in any event, we see also that there was in the hands of the Minister for Finance sufficient moneys available to him to discharge that debt which was due in justice to public servants long before there should be any question of buying a single gun or a single piece of defence equipment or a single warlike store for the defence of this country. We believe that justice to the civil servants comes before even warlike stores.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Even before defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Justice takes its place long before that but, in any event, the Minister for Finance has only taken £500,000 of that for defence and it only meant that he would have to borrow £500,000 in addition to what he says he intends to borrow for this defensive equipment in the course of the next year.  He could easily have borrowed that extra £500,000 and done justice to the Civil Service.  It would have been quite proper finance for him to do so.  If it was proper to borrow, as he says he intends to borrow, for this defensive equipment or warlike stores in the coming year to the extent of over £1,000,000, surely then it would have been quite equally defensible for for him to borrow the extra £500,000 and allow that to go, at least <i>pro tanto,</i> to the discharge of the just claims of the Civil Service under the arbitration award.  That is the case in justice and in equity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of the public interest the case is equally strong. We have fought, in this House and outside, many of us, in different Parties, for the establishment of the principle of arbitration for the Civil Service.  In May, 1948, a motion to that effect was carried in this House and the Minister for Finance stumped my constituency and he raised the hair and the fears of his constituents and my constituents with the appalling taxes that would be put upon the country if this iniquitous measure of arbitration for the Civil Service were put into effect.  We carried that motion <Col N="35" /> at that time and one of the first actions of the inter-Party Government was to see that our aims and our promises were carried into reality and the system of arbitration for the Civil Service was accordingly established. The Minister now has, not perhaps quite the same system, I think not as good a system as we established, but, at all events, there is now permanently established in this State for civil servants a system of arbitration between the staff side and the official side.</P>
    <P>There were sound reasons for the establishment of such a board, based upon the public interest.  It would hardly be relevant in this debate to go into them and I do not intend to do so. I do assert that it was and is in the public interest that civil servants should not be at the tail of any political Party, no matter what political Party that is, and that they should not be forced, in order to gain their just demand and proper rights, to have recourse to the usual sort of agitation, whether political or by way of strike methods, which is open to other sections of the community who wish to enforce increased wage or salary demands.</P>
    <P>It is in the public interest that there should be this system of arbitration. It is equally in the public interest that, unless in the very gravest and exceptional circumstances fully justified by the extent of the public finances, the arbitration award should be carried out in full.  There is nobody who suggests that the Minister has not under the terms of the arbitration award full authority to carry out the action which he is carrying out to-day. It is within the letter of the agreement, but we disapprove of the action not merely as not being within the spirit of the agreement but as being entirely unjustified by the facts and circumstances surrounding the making of the arbitration award.  It is in the public interest, unless there are very grave and exceptional circumstances, that the award of a board of this kind should be honoured to the full.</P>
    <P>It has been the aim of many people <Col N="36" /> in different walks of life to see that there will be some system for the pacific settlement of disputes between employer and employee other than the drastic method of either political or strike action.  It is giving a very poor headline for the State, which is always referred to as the ideal employer, to repudiate an award of this character coming from a board composed of representatives selected by the official side and by the staff side of the Civil Service and the chairman who, as the Minister rightly pointed out, is the joint choice of both.  It would be difficult to get a more impartial tribunal than the Civil Service Arbitration Board as constituted, the board which gave the award which is the subject of this motion.  It is an independent board, a board that heard and weighed the evidence put forward on both sides fairly and impartially.</P>
    <P>In the course of that evidence and the hearing of the submissions that were made to that board, all the considerations which are now being put forward by the Minister were put forward, based upon the taxable capacity of the people, based upon the prospective failure in yield of revenue, and based upon the fact that there would be no money available for the payment of that award.  All these suggestions were set forth on the face of the award, and the arguments put forward on behalf of the Minister were very ably put forward by those who represented the Minister, or, as it is called, the official side.  All these are set out on the face of the award and include all the matters, and very many more, that were put forward by the Minister in attempted justification of his action.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the fact that it was urged upon this independent tribunal that the giving of an award such as has been given would be beyond the taxpayers' capacity to pay, would be contrary to the public interest, would be something which the Minister could not carry out if it were awarded, the board, impartial as between the civil servants and the Government and the Minister for Finance, decided upon the not over-generous award which they did make.  In that state of facts, there <Col N="37" /> cannot be given to the Minister the same credence, nor can his argument be given the same weight, as would be given had these submissions not been made and made in an expert and extremely able way by the secretary and other officials of his Department to this independent board.  They had all these considerations before them, they had all the facts.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that the financial position as it was in November of last year and as it was anticipated it would be at the end of last year was borne out by the facts that emerged at the conclusion of the financial year.  Be it so.  All these matters were before this independent arbitration board presided over by a man who was the joint choice of both parties, and the Dáil must, and the country will, assume that the members of the board who decided on the award gave responsible and full consideration to all the matters that were urged upon them in the public interest.  Notwithstanding full advertence to all these matters and, in particular, to the consideration that there would be nothing to pay the award last year, the award is that the payment be made as from 1st November last year.  In these circumstances, there is no justification, I submit to the Dáil and to the country, for the action that has been taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have shown, and Deputy McGilligan has shown, where the money could come from, where it could be found.  I have no doubt there were other sources from which that sum of money could be found.  Economies are to be effected in the public services this year.  Why were they not made last year?  The Minister endeavoured to throw that argument aside in the course of his reply on the Budget debate.  Notwithstanding all that he said, we have not a shadow of doubt that there were economies made and that there could have been further economies made upon the expenditure proposed for last year.  Out of that, and out of these reserve funds, this till money which had reached the unprecedented sum of £2,500,000, the claims of the civil servants which are <Col N="38" /> based upon justice and equity, could have been discharged.</P>
    <P>After full consideration of all the matters that were put before them by both sides, and after careful consideration of all the facts relating to the public interest and the taxpayers' rights, this independent board made the award that they did make, and the public interest, therefore, requires that it should be carried out.  We are strongly of the view, therefore, that that award should be carried out to the full for reasons of justice and for reasons based upon the public interest. The award was necessitated, as I said at the outset, and as I insist finally, because of Government policy and because of nothing else and, in that state of facts, it behoves the Government, at whatever cost to themselves, to carry out that award in its entirety and to the full.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submitted two amendments to the motion introduced by the Minister for Finance, my desire being to give Deputies an opportunity of saying that they thoroughly disapprove of the terms of the Minister's motion and that this House, speaking in the name of the people, wanted to see the arbitration board's award honoured in full.  You, Sir, have ruled that both of my amendments are not in order and, consequently, I have not an opportunity of moving them.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to explain at the outset, so that the public generally can understand the significance of the motion which the Minister has introduced, that it would not be necessary for the Minister to introduce this motion if he were accepting the award. This motion becomes necessary only because the Minister, in defiance of the recommendation of the arbitration board, has decided to modify the award.  The effect of that modification is that these State officials, and particularly the lower paid officials, will now be cheated out of the 21 weeks' arrears of pay which was awarded to them by the arbitration board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with the general question of the arbitration board, its setting up and its award, there are <Col N="39" /> some matters I should like to refer to by way of preliminary comment on what the Minister has stated.  The Minister spent quite an amount of time last Thursday evening and again this afternoon discoursing on where the chairman of the arbitration board came from and how he came to be appointed. There is no question whatever about the chairmanship of the arbitration board and nobody desires to make any unfavourable comment on the chairman. In so far as he functioned as chairman of the arbitration board, he acted with great tact, great understanding, great courtesy, great kindness and graciousness to all who came before him.  Therefore, the chairmanship of the board is not in question at all.  The chairman was appointed because his name was one on a list of eight submitted by the Minister for Finance to the staff side.</P>
    <P>The staff side looked at that list and selected a particular individual; when that individual was approached he was not available.  The staff side was informed of that fact; they looked at the list again and they selected the individual who subsequently presided as chairman, and said they were prepared to agree on him.  That fact was conveyed to the Minister and the Government appointed that chairman.  That is all there is to it and nobody wants to make the slightest comment on the chairman.  The Minister was wasting his time the other night putting up his Aunt Sallys and engaging in the wasteful recreation of knocking them down again for his own satisfaction.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion the Minister made some reference to the procedure surrounding the previous claim.  He talked about there being dilly-dallying tactics in operation.  What are the facts in connection with the hearing of the claim before the previous board?  The position was that when the staff side raised the matter of an increase in pay before the General Conciliation Council an offer was made on that occasion by the representatives of the Minister for Finance.  The staff side did not consider the offer adequate at the time and they decided they would take the case to arbitration. <Col N="40" /> Before the case went to arbitration, however, the staff side decided they would avail of a provision in the previous arbitration scheme whereby they could seek direct negotiation with the representatives of the Minister for Finance and they asked the Minister to see them with a view to putting into operation this provision in the previous arbitration scheme, a provision which since has been deleted, and the Minister consented to the staff representatives meeting his representatives for the purpose of direct negotiations. These direct negotiations took place. They took some time but ultimately the situation was reached in which, even by direct negotiation, an offer satisfactory to the staff side was not forthcoming.  The staff side, therefore, decided to terminate the direct negotiations and take the case to arbitration.  They took the case to arbitration.  That case was duly heard before the arbitration board.  A report was made by the board on 24th May, 1951, and on the 13th June, three weeks later, the Government had decided to accept the report of the arbitration board.  I must mention here that, even if there had been some delay on the part of the staff side by deciding to engage in direct negotiations with the Minister's representatives, all that finally emerged to the benefit of the staff at a later stage because the award was made retrospective to the 15th January, 1951.</P>
    <P>The award was accepted in full, which is an entirely different proceeding from the one with which we are now confronted, wherein the Government has decided, having got an award on the 18th November payable as from the 1st November, they will hold up the award until the month of May and then announce that they will not pay the arrears which have arisen as a result of their own studied and deliberate policy of not giving effect to the award from the date on which it was recommended that it should be given.</P>
    <P>It is desirable in order to give the House a picture of the extent of the Government's repudiation of its obligations to review the background of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration. The scheme was established in <Col N="41" /> 1949.  It provided for a double-barrelled method of dealing with staff grievances.  Firstly, there was a General Conciliation Council and a variety of departmental councils. Matters could be discussed at these councils and, if agreement was not reached there, the cases could then be brought to arbitration.  That scheme operated from 1949 up to June, 1951. I do not think it need have been suspended in June, 1951.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is in error.  The scheme in question came into operation, I think, in June, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the formal signing of it took place then.  The Minister knows in fact the scheme was on the tapis from 1948 and it was only prolonged because of the staff side endeavouring to make the scheme as satisfactory as they could from their point of view and the Minister's Department, on the other hand, trying to ensure that the scheme was something that suited their needs.  It was that that necessitated the delay but, in fact, the civil servants knew they had arbitration from 1948.</P>
      <P>The scheme was suspended in June, 1951, and after prolonged negotiations from June, 1951, up to last year, with the Minister's representatives a new scheme of conciliation and arbitration was introduced.  While the staffs were engaged with the Minister's representatives and with the Minister to have the scheme of arbitration and conciliation restored the cost of living was rising and rising very rapidly.  The situation came to a head when in the Budget last year food subsidies were slashed to such an extent as to drive the cost of living up still more rapidly to a new high level.  It was in that situation that the staff side decided, as had organisations in other branches of the State service and organisations catering for private employees, to submit a claim to the Civil Service General Council for an increase in pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of the Minister's representatives on the general council making some offer to the staff side, as was done on a previous occasion, the attitude of the Minister's representatives, presumably acting under instructions <Col N="42" /> from the Minister, was that although the cost of living had gone up by 20 per cent. according to the Government's own figures and although told that wage increases were being granted to all staffs in private employment, was that they would not offer one penny: &ldquo;We will not offer one penny.&rdquo; That was the attitude of the Minister's representatives.  I do not blame them personally.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  They were acting on the instructions of the Minister for Finance, whose attitude then was: &ldquo;Not one penny; even though the cost of living has gone up by 20 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was not possible to reach agreement at the general council on the claim put forward by the staff side for an increase in remuneration as a result of the increase in prices and the claim was referred to the arbitration board. Where does the Government stand in relation to that board?  Firstly, the Government set up the board. Secondly, the Government appointed its representatives to sit on the board. Thirdly, the Government appointed the chairman.  Fourthly, the Government agreed that the claim should be heard and determined by the board.  Fifthly, the Government's representatives appeared before the board and used every conceivable argument they could find to convince the board that no award should be made.</P>
    <P>What was the claim?  The claim was that as the cost of living had increased by 20 per cent. so also should the wages and salaries of those who were represented on the staff side of the general council be increased by the same percentage.  In other words, the staff simply said: the arbitration board in 1951 awarded certain standards of remuneration based on a claim for increased wages heard by the board in that year; as prices have risen by 20 per cent. in the meantime the staff side simply ask that the purchasing power of the wages awarded by the arbitration board in 1951 should be restored.  They did not ask for an increase in real wages at all.  They merely asked that the purchasing power of the 1951 wage award should be restored.  That was the basis of the <Col N="43" /> claim which they took before the arbitration board in November last.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody will attempt to say that was an unreasonable claim. It was based upon the ascertained increase in the cost of living and it was a claim somewhat similar in character to the claims made by various organisations catering for workers in private industry.  The date upon which the cost of living increased to 20 per cent. over the February, 1951, level was the 5th July of last year.  The staff side, therefore, asked the arbitration board to award the increase as from 5th July, 1952.  When the Government representatives appeared before the arbitration board their whole line was to convince the arbitrator that the state of the Exchequer was such that it could not meet retrospective payments to July, 1952, and apparently so impressed were the board with the arguments submitted by the official side that when they came to make the award they made the operative date, not 5th July as the staff side asked but 1st November which was substantially later than the date claimed by the staff side.</P>
    <P>Thus we have reached this situation, that the board made an award that certain increases should be granted as from 1st November, and that report was submitted to the Government on 18th November; in other words, the board's award was merely from a current date.  The claim was heard by the board on 3rd and 4th November. The staff side tried to have the award made operative from 5th July but the board said: &ldquo;No.  We will give it to you as from 1st November,&rdquo; and they presented the report to the Minister on 18th November.  The Minister has held up the award since the date on which he got it, 18th November last, until the 18th February and he told the House what the report contained; at the same time he indicated that he did not intend to take action on the report until such time as he was framing his Budget for 1953-54.</P>
    <P>In the course of his Budget statement the Minister announced that although he received the report of the arbitration board on 18th November, recommending payment from what was <Col N="44" /> virtually a current date, the 1st November, he proposed to pay it only as from 1st April; in other words the Minister is going to deny the staff organisations and those whom they represent the benefits of the arbitration award between the period 1st November and 1st April.  I call that nothing but unadulterated cheating.  The Government created the board, availed of the board in every possible way and put a case before the board, a job which the Government representatives did skilfully and thoroughly.  One would imagine that having set up the board and having availed of every aspect of the arbitration scheme which was favourable to them, the Minister would say, when he lost the case before arbitration: &ldquo;There are certain things that decent people ought to do and that is to abide by an award when it has been made by a board constituted by the people against whom the award was made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The position now is that the House have been asked to deprive lowly-paid staff servants, postmen, telephonists, clerks, engineering workmen, part-time postmen, cleaners, charwomen, all that variety of lowly-paid people in the State service, of 21 weeks' arrears of pay, as if they had not to meet the increase in the cost of living which took place in July of last year.  They have had to meet the increased cost of living from July up to April last.  They applied for an increase in pay to compensate them for the increase in prices.</P>
    <P>Although they convinced the board that they ought to get an increase from 1st November last the Minister, disregarding completely the fact that the high cost of living impacted upon these people with the same severity, if not indeed with greater severity because of the low wages, than on outside people, still refuses to compensate them from the date recommended by the arbitration board.  The Minister's attitude is: &ldquo;I will pay only from 1st April and I do not care one curse whether you had to bear the increased cost of living from a date before 1st April.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These people have, unfortunately, borne burdens and accumulated debts for the past six months and instead of <Col N="45" /> paying them for the entire period recommended in the arbitration board award, the Minister is going to deny them arrears for a period of 21 weeks. In other words, the Minister intends to deprive these people of an increase in wages which has been given to practically every other class of worker in private employment.</P>
    <P>I have here a copy of the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> for March.  There is a report here of the principal changes in rates of wages reported in the period November, 1952 to January, 1953, a periodic of three months.  This is a periodic report which appears in the <i>Trade Journal.</i>  There are 20 pages here of wage increases granted during that period between November and January. Anybody who cares to peruse the <i>Trade Journal</i> will see that some of these increases go back to June and July of last year.  These 20 pages indicate that in this period alone more than 90,000 people have had their wages increased and many have had these increases granted from a date as early as July, 1952.  Yet in the face of that abundant evidence, the Minister for Finance refuses to honour the award of the arbitration board which recommends an increase in pay to persons whose wages are less in many cases than the wages quoted in this trade journal and deprives them of the benefits which ought to flow from them by the acceptance in full of the arbitration award.</P>
    <P>The claim of the staff side for an increase in wages based as it is on the increase in the cost of living is one which is unchallengeable.  I think there is a moral obligation on a decent Government and on anybody who has any regard to the moral law to adjust the wages of its workers to the cost-of-living increase.  If you do not do that you are not treating them fairly or justly; you just cheat them out of their just award.  The staff side would have a claim for an increase in pay if there never had been an award of the arbitration board, but the consideration which induced them to believe they have a special claim for an increase in pay is enhanced by reason of the fact that they have been granted an award in favour of an increase in <Col N="46" /> pay from an independent arbitration tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Minister speaks about the Government accepting the principle of arbitration.  What the Minister is doing now cuts completely across the whole principle of arbitration as industrially known and as popularly understood.  While the Minister may pretend that he is giving effect to the scheme of arbitration without any infringement of the spirit or the letter of the agreement, the Minister must know perfectly well that he is just not playing the game with the staff when he refuses to implement the award in the manner recommended by the independent chairman of the arbitration board.  Let me quote some things the Minister has already said on the whole matter.  The Minister for Finance had an interview with the staff side on the 21st March, 1952, when the negotiations for the re-establishment of the conciliation and arbitration scheme were deadlocked.  An effort was then made to try to ease the deadlock and to get some mutually acceptable scheme of arbitration.  One statement made by the Minister for Finance on that occasion was that the Government had accepted the principle of arbitration and it followed therefore that awards of the board would in the ordinary course become effective.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>By the time I am finished, you will be sorry about quotations.  I am going to take the quotations in my own order.  That was the view of the Minister for Finance then.  Here was the Tánaiste's view. Speaking on the eve of the last general election as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> he said: &ldquo;It has been suggested that Fianna Fáil would terminate the arbitration systems which had been set up here for civil servants.  He did not know if these systems had worked to the satisfaction of public officials.  They seemed to have delayed rather than facilitated the adjustment of salary rates.  But, if the Civil Service organisations were satisfied with them, they were quite prepared to allow them to operate unchanged and would give <Col N="47" /> effect to any wage or salary increase resulting from them.&rdquo; Was ever a more positive promise made to the public, to the Civil Service or to the staff associations than is contained in this forthright utterance from the present Tánaiste?  His only worry then was that the scheme was not working quickly enough to give the civil servants an increase in pay.  That was his only doubt but if they were prepared to take that risk, of the slow working of the arbitration machinery, his pure soul was such that he could assure the service and the public that the Fianna Fáil Government would give effect to any wage or salary increase resulting from it.</P>
      <P>Another Minister had something to say on arbitration in its international bearing.  Speaking here on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs, the Minister for External Affairs had something to say about the principles of arbitration in affairs between nations and he uttered these views: &ldquo;We still adhere to that principle of pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination. That is the type of world we want, a world wherein there is a law which applies with equal force to the big and the small and which can be invoked should a small nation have a grievance against a large nation or a large nation against a small nation.&rdquo;  So that we had the Minister for Finance assuring the staffs that the Government accepted the principle of arbitration and further that the awards of any board would in the ordinary course be made effective.  We had the positive unmistakable assurance of the Tánaiste that not only would the arbitration scheme be continued but that the Government would honour any award of salary increase given through the arbitration board.  We had the Minister for External Affairs pining for the adoption of a scheme of international arbitration and stressing the necessity for honouring the awards of international arbitration tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister for Finance and to those who sit behind him on those benches: do they not consider <Col N="48" /> that the attitude of the present. Government, against the background of these three positive statements, constitutes a clear abandonment by the Government of all that is implied in the setting up of the arbitration board and the making of the award?  These statements by the Government throw into bold relief the extent to which they have run away from the promises and the assurances which they gave to the public and the staff on these occasions.  Not a single word of explanation has been offered in defence of the obvious violation of the principle of arbitration as indicated in the motion which the Government is now asking the House to consider.  The scheme of arbitration was accepted by the staff side as a medium for the settlement of disputes between the staff organisations on the one hand, and either a particular Government Department or the Department of Finance on the other hand.  It was then thought that matters would be dealt with through the medium of the conciliation and arbitration machine, in a spirit of harmony, a spirit of understanding and that reasoned argument would replace bickerings and quarrels.</P>
    <P>So far as the staff side is concerned they believed the awards of the arbitration board would be accepted unquestioningly, in the spirit and in the tradition in which arbitration is generally understood.  The Government proposals as set out in the motion before the House and as indicated in the Minister's Budget statement have given a rude shock to the staff.  The Minister's attitude in this whole matter has caused bitter disappointment and a feeling of frustration throughout the entire public service at the manner in which he is treating State employees at the present time.  What would this House think, if any member of the public, or a private employer were to treat the Labour Court's recommendations in the same way as the Government is treating the award of the Civil Service Arbitration Board?  If some private employer, having agreed that a case should be adjudicated upon by the Labour Court, found himself with an award given against him from the <Col N="49" /> 1st November and then said: &ldquo;Even if the merits of the whole case have been assessed by the board I do not propose to pay that award until the 1st April,&rdquo; I think there would be a large volume of public opinion in criticism of the employer who took that attitude.</P>
    <P>So far as the Government is concerned, it is doing precisely the same thing; it is repudiating the award for five months, an award which should be as binding on the Government as the Labour Court's recommendations had been made binding by the voluntary act of private employers.  Is it the attitude of the Government that there is to be one law for the ordinary citizen, one law for the worker and the employer outside, but that the Government does not find itself bound by any law, not even the moral law, in its approach to the merits of the award made by the arbitration board? So far as the staff side is concerned, they had no reason to expect this unfair and unjust treatment.  For that statement I think I can rely upon the assurance given by the Minister for Finance.  Speaking on the Budget debate last year the Minister for Finance clearly foresaw that an adjustment in wages must necessarily follow the withdrawal of the food subsidies. In the course of that debate he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not only do the food subsidies mask the real cost of living but they distort the cost-of-living index as well.  The taxation which enables the goods to be sold over the counter at less than their real cost is not taken into account when computing the cost-of-living index, but the artificially low price of the goods over the counter is used as the basis for the calculation.  In a system where wages tend to be related to the cost-of-living index this is hardly to the wage earner's advantage.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I believe it would be better for the workers, in particular, that they should know what their real wages are in terms of the true cost of commodities rather than continue the present wasteful and cumbersome and expensive system which has so <Col N="50" /> developed that it now exists to conceal from them that fundamental fact.  In altering the food subsidies we have acted on that principle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, the Minister for Finance then felt that if wages were to be related to the cost-of-living index figure, it was better eliminate food subsidies altogether.  The implication clearly was that so far as those for whose wage scales he was responsible he would adjust their wage in accordance with the rise in the cost-of-living index figure.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste had something more to say about the adjustment of wages when he spoke at a meeting last year of R.G.D.A.T.A.  Addressing the grocery trade on that occasion he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am glad to hear that the grocery trade has found it possible to arrange the wage adjustments which the rising cost of living made necessary by way of friendly negotiated settlements.  The Government recognises that the rise in the cost of living, which occurred last year by reason of international conditions and this year by reason of the change of policy in regard to subsidies, would involve changes in wage rates.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the declaration of the Tánaiste last year, that these changes in food subsidies would involve changes in wage rates and that when presented with an arbitration award we should pay these wage rates to our own employees. They have now cheated and will only pay them from the 1st April. The speech of the Minister for Finance on the Budget last year and the Tánaiste's speech quite clearly indicated that they foresaw and expected that wage adjustments would take place following the slashing of the subsidies and the increase in the cost of living.  Not only were these views strongly supported by the staff sidebut they were copper-fastened by assurances given to the present staff side by the present Minister for Finance in March, 1952.  Here is what the Minister said on that occasion.  I am quoting from the agreed minutes the minutes agreed to by the Minister himself:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" />&ldquo;The Government, said the Minister, had accepted the principle of independent arbitration for the Civil Service, subject to certain safeguards. Having accepted the principle, it followed that they also accepted that awards made by the arbitration board should, in the ordinary course, become effective. There were, however, exceptional circumstances where the public interest might render it impossible to meet an award in the current financial year or to meet it in full.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister, in dealing with the Exchequer protection clause, said that a very difficult situation had been created during the trial year by the general pay finding and the consequences of this finding were lamentable from the point of view of the public finances.  The Minister for Finance would, for the future, have to be in a position to determine whether he could accept such an arbitration finding the current year or not.  The Minister might not have the money available to meet the finding and it would be most undesirable that he should be called upon to go into debt in order to pay the increases.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the amendment offered in the scheme by the Minister and of which he is taking advantage to-day.  The minutes go on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The amendment was an advantage from the staff point of view in that, in order to save the public finances, the Minister for Finance would not be obliged to take the extreme step of going to the Dáil for the rejection of the finding.  The amendment visualised that the Minister would pay what he could during the current year and that there would be a contingent obligation to pay the balance in due course.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It goes on further to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In conclusion, the Minister said that the exchequer protection clause was merely a question of deferment of consideration of the full payment of an arbitration finding.  He felt <Col N="52" /> that the Government would be bound to make provision in the following year for payment of the finding assuming any kind of normal financial conditions.  In response to an inquiry whether the staff might take it that the Minister did not wish to deprive the Civil Service of any part of an arbitration finding of this nature, the Minister replied that this was so&mdash;unless the circumstances were entirely exceptional.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then that came to be translated into the agreement.  It was put in the agreement in this way in paragraph 20 (3) which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Should the Government decide to adopt course (c) in the preceding sub-paragraph in relation to any report of the arbitration board on a claim for a general revision of pay, they will, save in entirely exceptional circumstances, make full provision in the Budget for the following financial year for the annual charge appropriate to that financial year in respect of the report of the arbitration board and also for the amount necessary, as an addition to any amount already paid, to give full effect to the board's findings from the date of operation recommended in the report to the end of the financial year in which the report was presented to Dáil Éireann. Where the Government does not propose to give effect to the board's findings, they will introduce a motion in Dáil Éireann indicating the action they propose to take and recommending such action to the House.&rdquo;</P>

Any fair-minded person who is not skilled in testing words or in giving them half a dozen meanings to suit his purpose realises the clear indication of these assurances by the Minister.  They amount to this&mdash;if the Minister could not pay at the time he got the award he was asking for permission to defer payment until the following year's Budget when he would pay all that was due for the ensuing financial year and pay for the portion <Col N="53" /> of the previous year.  English has lost its meaning if it does not mean that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave these positive and solemn assurances to the staff and that induced them to accept paragraph 20 (3).  That paragraph was taken into the scheme only because it seemed not unreasonable that the Minister was merely asking for a chance to defer payment if he was short of cash but that he would pay it in full once the following year's Budget was passed.  Now the Minister who gave these positive and solemn assurances comes along and changes that and notwithstanding the content of the assurances given by him he is going to welsh on this award and pay only from the 1st April in respect of an award which he was recommended to pay from the 1st November last.</P>
      <P>Is it not a fair contention to advance that the only circumstance in which the Minister would not honour his obligations was a circumstance in which the financial circumstances were entirely exceptional, but not a single effort has been made by the Minister, either in his Budget speech, in his reply to the Budget debate or on this motion, to discharge the onus which rests on him of proving that the financial circumstances are entirely exceptional.  Far from that, not only has he made no effort to discharge that onus, but the Minister's whole line of approach to the Budget, and the line which characterised his reply on the Budget debate, was that this country is now on the high road to success and prosperity and that there are now no entirely exceptional financial circumstances: that, in fact, people are slinging money at the Minister for Finance who got up to £20,000,000 of a loan last year, and that, thanks to his being in office, to his brain and to his magnificent handling of the State's finances, C.I.E. were able to borrow £2,500,000 the other day.  Everybody is bursting to give a present of money to the Minister for Finance&mdash;so satisfied is he that he is going to lead them into the promised land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> I would ask Deputies to look at the end of the Minister's Budget speech in order to get some idea of the direction in which we are travelling.  The Minister there says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thanks to the measures which the Government have taken during their term of office, the nation is no longer moving towards economic disaster; it has regained its balance; and it only remains for it, unitedly and co-operatively, to bend its will and its energies to ensure that the bright prospects which now open before it will be realised to the full.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does anybody think that you are going into &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; by travelling that road?  Is not that more like the road to &ldquo;Great Expectations&rdquo; than the road to &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo;?  The Minister there says that this country is now on the high road to bright prospects.  All you have to do is to bend your will and your energies and you cannot fail to get there under the leadership of the present Minister for Finance.  On the same day as he makes that statement, he announces in the course of his statement that he proposes not to pay the Civil Service arbitration award, although the only contingency provided for as giving him an excuse not to pay was that he could establish that the financial circumstances were entirely inadequate.  I think the Minister has not discharged that onus.  I think that he has, in fact, adopted the attitude that not only can he not discharge that onus, because his stock-in-trade during his Budget statement and in his reply on the Budget was that he had now no further financial problems: that, in fact, money was flowing into the Exchequer at a very satisfactory rate and that as regards public savings, he was getting embarrassingly large offers and thinks that these have reached the stage at which he is quite satisfied that, if he needed further moneys of the same magnitude during the current year, there would be no difficulty in getting them.  Yet, although there is only one justification for not honouring the award in full&mdash;that he could prove beyond question the existence of entirely exceptional circumstances&mdash;he has failed completely to discharge the <Col N="55" /> onus, and, realising the hopelessness of his task in that respect, he has not even attempted to discharge that particular onus.</P>
    <P>Are civil servants expecting anything unreasonable when they ask the Minister to honour the award?  That recommendation by the board was a very modest recommendation indeed. In fact, when compared with recommendations made by the Labour Court &mdash;recommendations made as a result of collective agreements and direct negotiations as regards workers in private employment&mdash;in some respects the Labour Court recommendations were higher and better than the award made by the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  Therefore, so far as State servants are concerned, and particularly the lower paid civil servants, we are asking the Government to honour the same kind of award as that which has been made in the case of workers employed in private employment.</P>
    <P>Here is something about which we have heard nothing whatever from the Minister.  I am taking seven companies which are entirely financed out of State funds: C.I.E., Aer Lingus, Aer Linte, E.S.B., Bórd na Móna, the Sea Fisheries Association, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Take these seven undertakings into which State money has gone.  The staffs employed in them are employed on the basis of the State's investment of its money in these undertakings.  We find that, in the case of C.I.E., the staff have got an award which has been honoured since the 1st November last.  The staff in Aer Lingus got an award which has been honoured since the 1st November last, the staff of Aer Linte got an award which has been honoured since the 1st November last; the staff in the C.I.E. got an award which has been honoured since the 1st July last; Bórd na Móna since the 1st September last; the Sea Fisheries Association since the 1st November, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation since the 1st November last.</P>
    <P>On what grounds does the Minister purport to justify this discrimination in respect of persons in the direct employment of the State, compared to <Col N="56" /> the terms extended to those who are employed in these State-financed undertakings?  The State provides the money to pay those who are employed in nationalised and State-financed organisations, but it refuses to pay an award, from the same date, in respect of those who are directly employed by the State.  No effort has been made by the Minister to justify this unfair and unjustifiable discrimination against those directly employed in the State service.</P>
    <P>Many persons employed in the Post Office, and in other Departments of State, have less pay than those who have got increases from July, September and November last.  I think I am entitled to ask the Minister why he will not pay, in respect of the underpaid staffs for whose wages he is responsible, increases from a date as early as those made in the case of those employed in State-financed undertakings? How can the Government justify increases in pay, in the cases I have quoted, from July and November last, and deny equal treatment to their own directly employed staff?</P>
    <P>Remember that the increase for which their own staffs is asking is merely an increase that was recommended by an arbitration board set up by the Government itself to hear and determine staff claims for increases in pay.  The staffs' claim in this whole matter rests, in my view, on a morally unassailable basis.  They have got an award from the board to which they agreed to submit their claim, and not the slightest justification on any grounds whatever, has been offered by the Minister for Finance as to why he will not accept the award in full.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude in this whole matter has outraged the feelings of the staff, and particularly the lower paid members of the staff who have had to meet the impact of high prices since July last and now they are not to get anything until April of this year in order to meet that impact, although those in private employment and those in State-financed organisations have got increases from the middle of last year and towards the end of last year. Yet, for the lowly-paid persons in the <Col N="57" /> direct employment of the State, there is to be no increase until April of this year.  Not a single justification has been offered by the Minister for the mean and niggardly attitude which he has adopted in this matter.  So far as the staffs are concerned, they feel that they have got a very raw deal. There is no set of circumstances operating in this country which justifies the Government in withholding the award for the 21 weeks from the 1st November to the 1st April.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Government intend to put on the Whips so far as this motion is concerned.  It is hardly a case where people's consciences ought to be guided to a decision by the aid of a Party Whip. It is hardly an occasion on which people would not be allowed to express their views fearlessly and when there might well be more than one view on this matter.  Members of the Government Party may have to respond to the Whip but there are other people in this House who normally support the Government but who are not obliged to follow the lash of the Government Whip.  I hope that they, at all events, will show that they recognise that the merits of the case are all on the side of paying the award from the date recommended by the arbitration board.  There can be no justification for outraging their feelings to such an extent as to do violence to the whole principle of arbitration by lending their aid to the scheme of the Minister for Finance to cheat lowly-paid people out of 21 weeks' arrears of pay.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is useless to appeal to the present Government to honour this award in full.  If there were any respect for honourable and decent dealing it should not be necessary to make this appeal.  An honourable course demands that the Government should accept the principle of paying the award in full even though there might have to be adjustments as to when the last instalment would be paid. The Government have given no justification for not honouring the award in full.  They ought to indicate that they are prepared to accept the full implications of the award, particularly having <Col N="58" /> regard to the plight of the lower paid people in the Post Office and other branches of the State service.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose there is any use in appealing to the Minister for Finance to do the decent and honourable thing in this matter.  The miserable rôle of expediency will probably commend itself more to the Minister's mind.  I regard this award as a State debt. I feel that this Government are not entitled to use the machinery of this House nor the heads nor the feet nor the hands of members of this House to do violence to the principle of honouring their moral obligations.</P>
    <P>If this Government do not honour this award in full then I hope that it will not be many months until another Government is in office.  If the Labour Party have any responsibility in that other Government, we shall do our best to ensure that whatever balance of this award is not paid by this Government will be honoured and paid by the next Government that controls the destinies of this country.</P>

      <P>Undoubtedly, the motion before the House modifies the award of the arbitration board and makes payment of the increase effective from the beginning of this financial year instead of from the beginning of November last, as recommended by the chairman of the board.</P>
      <P>We were told and the people of the country were told by certain propagandists that the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Norton had exercised their ingenuity in the preparation of amendments which would give the House an opportunity of voting in such a way as to show the wishes of the House in regard to the award.  These amendments have been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  Consequently, the ingenuity that was mentioned in the Press propaganda is not altogether evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that an amendment that would be in order to this motion could have been tabled.  I did depend on the Deputies mentioned, particularly in view of the propaganda, to put down an amendment that I personally could support.  I wonder why such an amendment <Col N="59" /> was not put down.  As I see it, if this Dáil declines to pass the Minister's motion it means the end of the award as far as the civil servants and other bodies depending for increases upon the award are concerned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello and Deputy Norton both spoke without interruption.  I am not getting very far without being interrupted.  Deputy Costello says that the Fine Gael Party will vote against the award.  I am not too sure of what Deputy Norton intends to do because he did not express it.  He did say what he proposes to do if certain fortuitous circumstances should give him an opportunity of becoming a member of a Government in the future.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the position is that Fine Gael will be able to say to their supporters who object to any increases for civil servants that they have opposed the Minister's motion to grant increases as from the beginning of this financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of arbitration was to set up a system whereby the claims of civil servants could be considered in a cold, calm and judicial atmosphere without regard to Party politics or the influence of Party politics.  I think it will be agreed that, from that aspect, the arbitration machinery for the Civil Service has not been a success.  Every conceivable effort is being made&mdash;and I do not limit this to one side of the House only&mdash;to make political hay out of the whole business.  Every responsible civil servant, irrespective of rank or grade, must deeply regret the increasing tendency, for the past six months or so, to make civil servants the plaything of politicians.  I would regard it as a tragedy if political Parties were to make the issue of civil servants' pay, whether it was to be <Col N="60" /> increased or reduced, a matter for the hustings or a matter for general or other elections.  If civil servants are to be dragged into Party politics, then it is really an end to democracy as we understand it.  It is my opinion, which I am not afraid to express, that every person, whether he is a Deputy or not, who has made this a political matter since November last has not rendered good service either to the Civil Service or to the State.  If I could make an appeal to Deputies, it would be even at this late stage to deal with the matter objectively and in the national rather than the Party political interest.</P>
    <P>I read the award of the chairman of the arbitration board.  In my view, it was not a generous award by any means.  The lower paid civil servants have a distinct grievance&mdash;and it is not a grievance of to-day or yesterday but a grievance over a long period &mdash; that their rates of pay and remuneration are entirely inadequate.  I hope that, apart entirely from this question of the arrears, early steps will be taken to guarantee a living wage to those lowly-paid civil servants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello has stated, and I think the House will agree with him, that the action of the Government in regard to the award is strictly within the law.  It may be strictly within the law, but I feel that it is outside the spirit of the negotiations and the agreements that went to the establishment of the arbitration machinery.  I would press the Minister to reconsider the decision not to pay the arrears; and even if extra taxation is required to pay those arrears it would be better that there should be extra taxation than that we should have the political campaign we have had in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>There is another reason on which the Minister might&mdash;in fact, the Minister should&mdash;reconsider the decision in regard to those arrears.  It has been suggested to me that refusal to pay the arrears will be considered by almost 1,000 &ldquo;transferred officers&rdquo; as a material worsening of the conditions of their service, that they will be entitled to avail of the machinery of retirement, by which they will receive substantial gratuities and maximum <Col N="61" /> pensions long before they would be entitled to those gratuities or pensions. If that happens, the financial loss to the State may be greater than the amount that will be saved by refusing to pay the arrears to the civil servants.</P>
    <P>I stated before, in the course of a debate here to which this matter was incidental, that I have never been satisfied that arbitration machinery such as has been set up is advisable or even constitutional.  The Minister for Finance has a special responsibility under our Constitution to the Government, to Parliament and to the people, and I cannot see any constitutional justification for the establishment of machinery that has the effect of interfering with or impeding the Minister in the exercise of his constitutional functions.  I do not accept for one moment the suggestion of Deputy Costello about the sum of over £2,000,000 that he refers to as &ldquo;till money&rdquo;, a sum of money which he says Deputy McGilligan&mdash;who did not do anything about it for over three years&mdash;had intended to liquidate over a period of years if he had been maintained in the position of Minister for Finance.  The fallacy in Deputy Costello's argument&mdash;as Deputy McGilligan would agree&mdash;is that Deputy McGilligan had no intention of remaining in the office of Minister for Finance longer than he could help and I do not accept the suggestion of an intention to liquidate the &ldquo;till money&rdquo; as has been suggested.</P>
    <P>As I see the matter, if we have the real interests of the civil servants at heart, we are bound to ensure by passing this motion that they will get the increase in pay as from the beginning of the financial year.  By refusing to pass this motion&mdash;now that there is no amendment to which we can subscribe before the House&mdash;we would be throwing the matter into the melting pot and we would be denying an increase to civil servants as from the beginning of this financial year.  I believe that once the Minister and the Government came to the conclusion that the arbitration machinery is defective&mdash; and I am quite sure the civil servants have come to the same conclusion&mdash; there ought to have been some negotiations, some discussion and some efforts <Col N="62" /> to deal with the machinery, having regard to the constitutional position of the Minister; but until that is done the Government ought to have implemented the award in full, even at the expense of extra taxation.  I would have voted for extra taxation for that purpose.  It is ridiculous for Deputies to say it could have been done without extra taxation, that they want the civil servants to be paid all these arrears but are not prepared, because they do not think it necessary, to vote extra taxation for the purpose.  That is not dealing with the matter fairly or properly or with a sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, I will vote for the motion because I want to ensure that the civil servants will get their increase as from the beginning of this financial year&mdash;and let those who want to play-act and play Party politics in this matter vote against it if they wish to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The last phrase used by Deputy Cowan must strike the House with some amusement.  He asked people to play-act&mdash;they could not get a better leader than himself.  Deputy Cowan last year voted for the cut in subsidies that raised the price of food and the cost of living.  Civil servants fall into one group that felt the effect of the cost of living and they went before the arbitration tribunal, and made a case for a 20 per cent. increase and in their own comments they say that it was not denied by the staff side but was taken to be agreed.  Deputy Cowan says he feels sorry for civil servants&mdash;but he is afraid to remove from office the Government that will not give the award fully.  He has justified himself before his constituents by saying that he will vote for this because it is the best he can do and that he will let others play-act.  The Deputy has a reputation for humbug in this House.  He has added a new chapter to the whole series with regard to humbugs he has perpetrated since he came into public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am going to speak here on behalf of 63,000 State personnel.  I spoke on their behalf for years before I went back into Government and when I was in Government I spoke on their behalf, <Col N="63" /> because I had the feeling, as it was represented to me, that, as Minister for Finance, I was not merely responsible for the Civil Service in its relations with the House and the taxpayers but responsible to them with regard to the treatment they got.  The group I belonged to, I felt, were happy in being the people who established a real system of arbitration for the first time in the history of the Civil Service in this country.  We gave them real arbitration.  We established a system which they welcomed and that system worked well.</P>
    <P>Before it became effective, a particular increase in pay was given in the autumn of 1948 and from that we went on to the establishment of the full arbitration machinery, and there never was any doubt in any civil servant's mind, in the mind of any of the people we were dealing with, that, when an award came to be made by the board, it would be met in full.  We had to get over a good deal of distrust on the part of the Civil Service because they had been treated for many years very badly.  There had been offers made to them of arbitration, offers which were so seriously beset with handicaps that no member of the State personnel could accept what was offered as being a real attempt to meet them. We gave them something which they did accept and welcome and which, I think, they trusted us to carry out fully.</P>
    <P>There are about 63,000 of State personnel and the biggest single group of these are the civil servants of the State.  There are then the teachers, the personnel of the Army and the personnel of the Guards.  These are either directly affected by the arbitration award given to the Civil Service as one group or their emoluments and increases are related to whatever is done for the Civil Service.  They await the result of the voting of this Dáil on this modification motion with a good deal of interest, an interest that comes to their homes and their hearths very distinctly.</P>
    <P>I have the view of the Civil Service arbitration scheme in relation to the <Col N="64" /> motion on the paper that, if this Dáil were to reject the motion&mdash;let us leave out the indirect result of a change of Government&mdash;the Government would have to accept the arbitration award in full.  So far as I read the arbitration scheme, it is only if the Government is able to persuade Dáil Éireann to pass a resolution, modifying, in whole or in part, the recommendation, that the modification goes through, and, if we reject the modification, it is my view that the award stands in whole and would have to be met by the Government.  Apart from that, there is the situation that, on a matter like this, which involves the honesty of Government conduct, if the Government were to be beaten, it is clearly a major defeat on a major subject and the Government would have to yield place to other people.</P>
    <P>In that connection, not that I think Deputy Cowan's words will have any effect outside&mdash;his own utterances, which have not been marked by the greatest honesty since he came into the House, do not recommend him as a person of any repute in the country &mdash;lest anybody might pay any attention to his words, I want to echo what Deputy Norton said.  So far as I am concerned for the future, if I again become associated with any Party that forms a Government in this State, I will do it on the condition that whatever is not met of this arbitration award by the present Government will be met by the Government I might help to form.  We can give that assurance, as Deputy Norton has given it on behalf of one Party, and if, say, the inter-Party Government were to meet again, just as we did meet our promise with regard to the removal of certain penal taxation of the year 1948, we would honour it.  It has been stated on behalf of one Party in the House, and, speaking on behalf of my Party, I can say that whatever is not met of the full award which we are discussing by the present Government will be met by any Government we have anything to do with.</P>
    <P>We gave arbitration to the Civil Service because we wanted to avoid a recurrence of what had happened during the war period.  The Statistics <Col N="65" /> Office produces charts like the chart I have here, which shows two lines which are very widely divergent, the bottom line representing the wages which were &ldquo;stoodstill&rdquo; during the war period and the top line, the way in which the cost of living rose, the cost of living being a matter of increases in profits, inducing increases in the prices of certain commodities.  The chart assumes a big sausage shape and the interior of the sausage represents what was cut out of the lives of these people who depended on wages or industrial earnings during the period of the war.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service, as such, are not shown on a chart like this, but civil servants had their wages &ldquo;stoodstill&rdquo; earlier than even the industrial community, and, while the standstill Order remained with certain modifications, the modifications given to the Civil Service were of less value than those given to the outside industrial worker, and the result was that during the war period, civil servants lost, through the impact of that standstill Order upon them, and lost in a most immoral way, a very big sum of money. It was calculated by the Deputy General Secretary of the Conference of the Post Office Workers' Union that the wages standstill Order over the years had cost the Civil Service £6,500,000.  I am not responsible for that calculation but I know that it was a very big sum of money.</P>
    <P>It was because we thought that type of conduct was immoral that we decided it would not be perpetrated again in our time and that we would leave machinery to avoid a perpetration of it again by any other Government succeeding us, unless they were bold enough to come to the House and destroy completely the machinery for arbitration, conciliation and everything else that we had established. We did establish that machinery.  At the time the machinery was being introduced, certain fundamental changes were being made which, as I hold, improved the scheme which we were introducing compared with anything introduced before.</P>
    <P>One of those changes was the removal entirely of the prior veto of <Col N="66" /> the Minister for Finance on matters which could be referred to arbitration, because that of course was the main objection that there was to previous schemes aiming at arbitration which had been brought in before our time.  We were going to remove the ban previously put on association with outside labour bodies; we were going to remove the prohibition on political affiliation; and we were going to remove a variety of restrictions which had encumbered all the previous attempts at arbitration.  We did that after conference with civil servants to find out what would be agreeable to them.  I do not say that we met them in every point they put up, but we met them in regard to the great majority, and the scheme of arbitration evolved was a good scheme and one which was agreeable to those who were in at the preliminary discussions on it.  Improved arbitration was set up and it worked to its first conclusion on the demand for a general increase in pay.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here and repeated, that the scheme was only a temporary one and came to an end.  It was of its nature provisional, and a review of that scheme was initiated on 28th May, 1951.  The letter that went out to the staff associations asking them to assist in the review of the scheme contained a phrase which I feel I was personally responsible for.  It asked the staff to get whatever objections or recommendations they had to make together as quickly as possible, as it was expected that very little delay would be necessary before the scheme would be restarted.  The whole aim and objective of the circular was to exhort the Civil Service to be speedy with whatever they wanted to bring forward as amendments of the existing scheme, so that the whole machinery could be put into operation as quickly as possible.  The review of that, initiated on the 28th May, 1951, and expected to last only a short time, took more than a year.  It was not until June, and the end of June, 1952, that the present scheme made its appearance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has referred to the remarks of the Minister for Finance with regard to the chairman.  I want <Col N="67" /> to say nothing more about the chairman because, if one does speak of him, the matter is likely to be distorted into a criticism of the chairman but I do want to say that it is wholly wrong for the Minister to represent the chairman as if he were, so to speak, the choice of the staff.  The first move in this matter was a letter from the staff sent on the 28th May, 1952, suggesting the appointment of a certain named person.  It took eight weeks to get a reply to that and, at the end of eight weeks, there was a letter regretting delay and turning down the suggestion with regard to this particular appointment.  In the early days of December the staff wrote a second time agreeing to the selection of another person and that person being agreed on by the Minister for Finance, an approach was made to the person and it was found he could not act but, with the letter refusing the staff's first suggestion there was sent a list of nominees of the Minister for Finance and the staff were invited to select a chairman from that list and the first name selected was from that list and the second name selected, who eventually became chairman of the board, whose report we are discussing, also came from that list.  But it is to be remembered that the list was a list of the Minister's nominees and the staff made two attempts to choose.  In one case the man would not act and then they chose a second man and he did act.  So the arbitration came about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello has referred to some of the arguments and the whole matter was quoted but it is not improper to refer in this debate to one or two of the points made before the board. Deputy Costello stressed, and it ought to be stressed, that one of the points made by the staff side was that neither at conciliation nor in their counter-statement had the official side attempted to challenge that an increase of 20 per cent. in the cost of living, as reflected in the official index figures, had taken place since January, 1951, and they submitted that it had, therefore, to be inferred that the official side had accepted the fact and that there was no disagreement about it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="68" /> In fact, there could not be any great disagreement about it.  An attempt was made later by the staff side to argue that the 20 per cent. increase was based upon a wrong date and the figure which had emerged upon a particular date and that another figure should have been chosen but on the date that was chosen the 20 per cent. increase was established beyond any doubt.</P>
    <P>The staff side went on to say with regard to their members:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They were being forced to cut their consumption of the barest necessities, such as bread, milk and fuel.  As a result of the reductions in food subsidies, bread, butter, flour, tea and sugar had increased in price. These were the staple foods of the people&mdash;the necessaries of life.  They had gone up but wages had not. They had been put outside the reach of the people with subsistence incomes; and no amount of argument about economics or finance could alter the fact that people were being deprived of the necessaries of life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Anticipating an argument which they knew would be brought forward on the official side they pointed out that the case would be made that there was no money available to the Minister to meet the bill and that, accordingly, the just claims of the staff should be rejected. On behalf of the staff it was submitted that &ldquo;the board should not be influenced by an argument devoid of any moral basis.&rdquo;  That is a phrase that should apply to the speech of the Minister for Finance here.  He certainly has not attempted to justify this on any moral basis.</P>
    <P>The staff also submitted that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Pay increases in outside employment had been granted with retrospective effect.  The Civil Service were compelled to seek such retrospection because the procedure of getting a claim heard by the arbitration board was much slower than in outside employment.  They instanced the case of certain employees in the E.S.B. and the Dublin Corporation who had recently obtained increases with effect from 1st April, 1952.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The staff said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" />&ldquo;The present claim first submitted in July, 1952, was still undetermined in November, and that would not happen in outside employment.  If the Civil Service claim had been decided in July there would be a case for making an award effective from a current or near-current date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally, they said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was not a valid argument against the claim to say that an increase in the pay of the Civil Service would have repercussive effects on the pay of other State employees&mdash; the Army, Gardaí, etc.  The staff side considered that it was unreasonable to contend that the pay of State employees, whether in the Civil Service, Army or Gardaí, should not be increased, no matter what increases took place in the cost of living.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>People who pay attention to the newspapers will remember that the answer to that, that came from what is called the official side, was most alarming.  They said that revenue was not coming in to the extent that had been anticipated and that expenditure was outrunning even the heavy estimate of expenditure presented at Budget time.  They said there was a short fall, and a very definite short fall, of revenue in most of the sources of revenue.  They wound up by saying that the only course, if the civil servants' claim were to be met, would be to increase taxation or reduce the bread subsidy.  That threat runs through the great part of this argument, that what the civil servants were forcing upon the community by pressing their claims was that the price of bread would have to be increased and that there would be dear bread for the community in order to provide what was justice or what was regarded as justice for the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The official side spoke of the recent trade recession which, of course, had been due to the Budget and to Government action outside the Budget. They spoke of the yield from direct taxation and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The yield from direct taxation next year must, therefore, be expected <Col N="70" /> to reflect the adverse effect on company profits of the recent trade recession.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They spoke of the increases that had occurred in certain goods mainly because of taxation but also due to some pay increases, and they spoke of the revised prices for food which had followed the withdrawal of subsidies&mdash;of course that is the start of the whole thing.  They appealed to the staff that the only realistic course was to accept the disimprovement in private living standards that was necessarily involved.  I take that to be necessarily involved by the Government's policy.</P>
    <P>Faced with these arguments and all sorts of statistical information on the official side as to the disappointing yield of certain taxes and certain increases on the expenditure side, the board nevertheless decided to award what we know they did award.  They gave an addition of 12½ per cent. on that part of the salary which was up to £200 a year.  They gave an increase of 5 per cent. on the portion of salary over £200 and not exceeding £965, and they finally awarded that the foregoing increases should operate with effect on and from 1st November, 1952.</P>
    <P>So, against all these horrors that the official side brought forward, the board nevertheless awarded what I think nobody has considered to be a very generous sum.  They have given an increase of 12½ per cent. on the first £200 and 5 per cent. on anything else up to £965.  This award, which is causing so much trouble, the retrospective element in which the Minister is denying, although it has been awarded by the board with a full sense of the claim made by the Civil Service and, I imagine, with full appreciation of whatever weight was to be attached to whatever arguments were produced, both on the staff side and the official side, then comes into the machinery of conciliation and arbitration that was established by the present Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out here, and it is necessary to emphasise it, that the Government were bound to accept and to honour the award.  The only real exception to that is contained in <Col N="71" /> the very solemn words in paragraph 20, Section 3:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Should the Government decide to adopt course (c) in the preceding sub-paragraph. . .&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the course which has been adopted&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;. . . in relation to any report of the arbitration board on a claim for a general revision of pay, they will, save in entirely exceptional circumstances. . .&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I might paraphrase the rest; they would not merely pay in each financial year the amount required by the award but they would also pay the amount necessary, if there is retrospection, to make it fully retrospective, and the only circumstance of exception is : &ldquo;Save in entirely exceptional circumstances.&rdquo;  Have we a word about an exceptional circumstance?  Have we a word about an entirely exceptional circumstance?</P>
    <P>Speaking on the Budget on the 6th of May, as reported in column 1212 of the Official Report for that day, in dealing with the Civil Service arbitration award, the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The substantial economies which will be vigorously sought and secured in administrative and other expenditure will enable the award to be met in respect of 1953-54, but not for any prior period, without an increase in taxation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apart from the matter of the carry over with which I will deal later, that is the only phrase about the Civil Service arbitration award.  The only thing about which it was his desire to be timid was an increase in taxation. An increase in taxation cannot be regarded as an entirely exceptional circumstance, because the course set out in paragraph 20 (c) only comes into operation if the Government signify that they consider it would not be possible without imposing additional taxation to give full effect to the findings in the current year.  That is an ordinary circumstance which would drive them to adopt course (c).  Having adopted course (c), paragraph 20, one <Col N="72" /> reason for that would be to avoid increasing taxation.  The taxation was then to provide fully to meet the award in the current year, not in any &ldquo;entirely exceptional circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister talking about the way in which the chairman was appointed.  He tried to make a point about the delay in bringing the matter to arbitration.  In all the matters he referred to we heard nothing of an entirely exceptional circumstance which would prevent him doing what he signed to do, namely, to accept fully and to carry out any award of the arbitration board.  He is not doing it and the only excuse he seems to be relying on is that it would require an increase in taxation, and that he regards as an entirely exceptional matter.</P>
    <P>That, therefore, has to be tackled and it can be tackled.  There is this matter of the carry over. The phrases which the Minister used with regard to the carry over are to be found in column 1206 of the Official Report of the 6th of May.  Dealing with his decision to take £500,000 from this particular lot of moneys for the purpose of defensive equipment, he speaks in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Of the remaining £1.4 million, I propose to find £500,000 by drawing on the revenue balances carried forward at the 31st March last.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is his description of them:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These balances are the Exchequer counterpart of the liquid capital of a going concern.  They are paid into the Exchequer in the first few weeks of the financial year when current revenue receipts are meagre and in this way they obviate <i>pro tanto</i> the necessity for temporary borrowings. In recent times, however, the balances have tended to exceed the £2,000,000 or so which is regarded as a reasonable carry over.  On 1st April, 1948, the cash balances in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners amounted to almost £1.9 million and over the three years to 1st April, 1951, they were maintained around this level.  As a result of fortuitous accretions over the past two years, however, the figure at 1st April last had risen to £2.5 million.  They will <Col N="73" /> now be drawn upon to the extent and for the special purpose which I have mentioned, thereby reducing them to a round £2,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the carry over, the Exchequer counterpart of the liquid capital of a going concern which is paid into the Exchequer in the first weeks of the financial year when current revenue receipts are meagre.</P>
    <P>That point was also made by the Minister in a letter which he wrote to the papers in reply to a letter of mine. He spoke of these balances in these terms in a letter dated 12/11/1952:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These balances provide essential relief for the Exchequer during the lean opening months of the financial year.  The amount of the balances at the end of 1947-48 was £2,251,045 and the principle has been to maintain them at or around this level by relying on the revenue collected each year to meet expenditure incurred in that year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The fact is that the Exchequer carry over is the working cash balance that must be held in hand at the beginning of every financial year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A sum of £2,500,000 is an enormous carry over in a country like this.  As Deputy Costello said, at a certain period when I had dealings with finance I made up my mind that it was far too large an amount and I spoke at the time to the officials concerned about my own view in the matter.  The programme I had set out to achieve was that year by year I would reduce that balance by somewhere between £600,000 and £750,000 until we had reduced it to somewhere about the £500,000 point.  Then I said I would consider how far it could be reduced further.  But revenue was good in my time and I never had to draw £600,000 out of that carry over and reduce the amount carried forward to the next year to what I took out in any year. Revenue was always buoyant and the result was that that £2,000,000, or thereabouts, remained all the time.</P>
    <P>I had inquiries made and got certain replies from departmental officials with <Col N="74" /> regard to the matter.  I asked for a return which would show the balance of revenue remaining in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners at each 31st March and I got it traced back during the years.  It started in 1923 when the balance retained was £171,000.  It went down to £108,000 in 1924 and it rose to £111,000 in 1925. In 1927, for the first time it rose above £250,000.  In 1931 it went down to £10,000.  From 1923 to 1932, the average over these ten years was £140,000.  A sum of £140,000 was regarded as an adequate amount of money to have in reserve to meet the lean times, the time when revenue was meagre, according to these statements, when expenditure runs at a rather high level and there is not enough revenue to meet it.  After 1933 the balance of about £140,000 was more or less maintained.  It went up to £162,000, and in the year 1934 it dropped to £19,000.  It rose in 1935 to £79,000.  It reached the £200,000 mark again about 1936.  In 1939, the year before the war, the carry over was £71,000 and it was only when we entered the war period that it rose to something like the proportions to which we have been accustomed in recent years.  In 1941 it crossed the £1,000,000, mark.  In 1942 it reached £1,330,000.  It decreased slightly in the next year, 1943, and it went up to almost £1,600,000 in 1944.  It went almost to £1,750,000 in 1945.  It came down in 1946 and in 1947 it went up to £2,333,000.  After that, as has been said, it kept around about the figure of £1.9 million for some years and last year it rose to £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>I got that statement showing the amount in the carry over and, having got it, I began to look for the reason for it.  I got the usual statements that are made here by the Minister for Finance: one had to think, of course, of the lean period at the beginning of a financial year; expenditure was still running high; one might not get enough money in.  I again asked for an investigation.  I asked for a return of the expenditure in each of the first four weeks in April and the three years I chose for that investigation were 1948, 1949 and 1950.  I asked for a return for the second four weeks&mdash;that <Col N="75" /> is, the second month&mdash;in each of these years.  I asked for the revenue, excluding the carry over and excluding any siphoning in of any part of the carried-over moneys.</P>
    <P>I have not carried out the investigation beyond those three years but as far as my memory serves me&mdash;I have only got the record here for three years &mdash;I never found a year, save one, in which there was any necessity to have any greater amount of money in the till at the end of the financial year than, say, £100,000.  In 1949, the revenue in the first eight weeks was £9,390,000; expenditure was £7,726,000. In 1950 the revenue in the first eight weeks was again about £9,000,000 and expenditure was £8.7 million.  In 1948 there was an exceptional circumstance and the revenue in that year, without the carry over, would not have been sufficient; it would have been short by about £900,000 to meet the outgoings. That, of course, was due to the fact that in the early part of the year when the new Government came into office they remitted the impositions on tobacco and other things; that remission meant a loss of about £6,000,000 over the year and that showed its effect at once but, save for that exceptional year, there was no year in which it was necessary to have a substantial carry over.  Indeed, if there is any year, I would like to hear which one it was.  Is there any year in which facts prove the necessity for any carry over of a larger sum than £100,000?  I assert there is none.</P>
    <P>I would not be troubled if expenditure ran in excess of revenue by even £1,000,000 or so, in the first eight weeks.  There are such devices as short-term borrowings and, so long as revenue over the whole year meets expenditure over the whole year, nobody will worry about what happens in an exceptional first or second month in an exceptional year.  The records show that there is no necessity to have this enormous sum of money retained as what is described as &ldquo;liquid balance&rdquo; to meet the meagre period when money is not coming in and when expenditure is running high.</P>
    <P>That being the case, we have here <Col N="76" /> now a situation in which, I suppose, nobody will deny that if the State has this money the Government should honour the Civil Service Arbitration Board award.  The one thing the Minister has not given us in his apologia in this matter is how much is being pinched from State personnel by the Government not honouring the retrospective element in this award. I put the sum myself at a figure of £900,000; that is to say, the 63,000 State personnel are having pilfered from them a sum of £900,000 due to them on foot of the award.  I assume most people would regard that as an obligation the Government should meet and I assume that the only answer that can be made here to me, or to any other speaker, in justification for not meeting that obligation is: &ldquo;We have not got the money.&rdquo;  In fact, the money is there.  There is enough money available to pay this sum twice over.  It is certainly quite easy to abstract £900,000 out of this £2,000,000 carry over.  Am I to be told this is bad finance?  This year the Minister has decided to take £500,000 of that carry over of £2,000,000 in order to purchase defensive equipment.  Is not our obligation to State personnel something that should be considered more seriously than the purchase of, as I said in my Budget speech, weapons that are likely to become obsolete within a few months of their being brought in here?  I assume most Deputies would feel better pleased and would feel that they had something off their consciences if this money to meet the Government's obligation to State personnel could be found to implement the award of the arbitration board. Where does the bad finance come in in the conclusion that £2,000,000 is not required as a carry over, that it is an unnecessary amount of money to carry over from year to year.</P>
    <P>I have given a statement of my own experiences.  I decided with my colleagues to reduce that carry over to £600,000 per annum until such time as we were likely to get a manageable figure.  I asked for the returns.  I have produced the record for three years. Is there any return that can be brought here to show the necessity for holding in hands, even if one accepts <Col N="77" /> there must be something held in hands against a possible emergency, anything more than £100,000?  I believe there is not.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the other argument that, even if the point is made that there are some years in which more than £100,000 is required to keep the balance even, I do not regard that as an argument for carrying forward year after year a sum in the region of £1.9 million or £2.5 million when there is no immediate need for it.  Honesty and honour demand that the Government should meet the arbitration award.  The money is there.  If the only argument the Government can produce is to tell us yet again that it cannot be done without taxation, I say it can.  If I am told this is a fund that should not be raided for that purpose, I ask what is the fund for?  If it is right to raid it for defensive equipment is it not right to raid it to meet the demands of those who on their own statement, and that statement was accepted by the arbitration board, are driven to restricting themselves in the necessities of life because of the inadequacy of their pay in relation to the cost of provisions, a cost mainly affected by Government action?</P>
    <P>I suggest we can do what honour and honesty require should be done.  The Government in face of what the Minister has revealed in relation to the carry over, cannot plead the necessity to tax in excuse of their action in this matter.  I also urge that the House should not accept the contention of the necessity to tax as a relevant objection contemplated by those who framed this arbitration machinery.  This is not an entirely exceptional circumstance of a type that would warrant the award not being met in full.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly this debate will be used to defame civil servants and State personnel throughout the country.  Already an effort has been made by even hangers-on, like Deputy Cowan, to argue that if it was not for the civil servants there could have been remissions in taxation this year and last year.  He says civil servants are being brought into politics.  I think they should be at least so far in politics that people could plead their <Col N="78" /> case for them without their being smeared in that deft fashion of which Deputy Cowan is such a master.  I object to their being brought in in opposition to claims by other sections of the community for alleviations in taxation.  By their introduction into politics in that way they are painted, so to speak, as the enemy of the rest of the people, absorbing money that could otherwise be spent on other purposes or used to give those reductions for which everybody is crying out.</P>
    <P>Those who framed last year's Budget and reduced the food subsidies surely must have had before their minds that if food subsidies were reduced, the cost of food raised and the cost of living raised, State personnel had a case with which to go before an arbitration board for an increase.  The Budget was hardly passed when one of the trade union congresses came to a calculation that a 12/- a week increase was required.  I understand that the arbitration award for the Civil Service is based pretty definitely on that 12/- a week increase.  It was a calculation that the trade unionists could make within a month after the Budget made its appearance.  It could have been easily foretold what the arbitration award was going to cost the Government and the country because of the reduction in the food subsidies.  The food subsidies reduction in last year's Budget was going to mean a profit of £3.9 millions, call it £4,000,000.  Take away the £2.4 million that has now been conceded as the just claim of State personnel and you will see how utterly foolish was that move last year to reduce subsidies.</P>
    <P>We know that wages have risen all round the country.  Imposts of 2/- or 3/-, or 4/- and 5/- in the £ in some cases, have been put upon the ratepayers of the country.  All of that has been the result of last year's Budget. Increases in wages had to be granted because of the increase in the cost of living due to the Budget.  All the Budget did was to hide some of the results for a while.  Now we are getting the figures which ought to have been added into last year's Budget statement and we are going to have them added in openly this year.  The cost <Col N="79" /> of the food subsidies was saved as a Government expenditure and was thrown on to industries.  Various wage claims were successfully made and imposed upon industrialists outside; local authorities have had their claims to meet and the rates showed the answer.  Again it all amounts to showing how completely ridiculous was this effort to save money by the reduction of food subsidies last year.</P>
    <P>Now the civil servants are going to be paraded as the enemy of the people because they are absorbing £2.4 million that could have meant a reduction in taxation.  You would think that civil servants were inhuman, that they can pull in on any slackening off, that they can nearly all cut their rations and that they can be made to impose further rationing on their wives and families particularly with regard to the lower paid civil servant.  If he can pull in on any slackening, it is going to hurt somewhere, either from the point of view of food and clothing or the education he provides for his family. Unless there is some such inhuman point of view accepted for the Civil Service, it is quite clear they had to get the minimum, as they have been given the minimum, to meet the changes brought about in their lives by last year' Budget.</P>
    <P>The Government is now parading the civil servants as the people who are absorbing what the rest of the community might have got in relief of taxation.  Already cries are being raised, fostered by propagandists on the Government side, that there are too many civil servants, that they are doing no work and that they are getting this immense sum of money.  We on this side of the House are going to be paraded as the enemies of the industrial and farming community because we want extra money for the Civil Service, and because that means extra taxation.  It is quite clear it does not mean extra taxation; the money is there to be distributed.</P>
    <P>There is no redundancy in the Civil Service as it is worked.  The late Secretary of the Department of Finance is on record as saying that there was not a single man in the Civil Service <Col N="80" /> extra to requirements.  That was a well chosen phrase.  As long as the system of government and of handling public money continues as it is at the moment, you will get no reduction in the numbers of civil servants.  It has been said that in 1950 the officers known as organisation and method officers were appointed.  That was done with the assent of my colleagues and myself in an endeavour to find out if there was any work being done which could be avoided and whether we could get any reduction in the personnel without hardship to that personnel.</P>
    <P>That was only the early stage in the movement to get some better handling of public finance and some better method of dealing with public business. I had got no definite plan but I was getting one developed and the suggestions I made to my colleagues were accepted by them.  It would, I believe, have meant a reduction in the numbers of civil servants but it would have meant a couple of other things. It would have meant a new outlook on what were the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  It would have meant what would have been, as far as I was concerned, a welcome development, the complete abolition of the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <P>Without any disrespect to the personnel who sat on it, I say that committee has done no useful work since this State was founded.  It would have meant coming to this House and making a case for a new system of looking after the public accounts.  All that could have been done and when that would have been done the public would have been better able to bear the cost of the Civil Service, because that cost must be measured by numbers and proper emoluments given to those people.  There is no use trying to reduce expenditure in this country by cutting their wages or their emoluments. All one can do is see that good value is given and that the numbers are appropriate to the work done.</P>
    <P>There is a wastage in the Civil Service of about 1,000 a year arising from those who leave on the ordinary retirement basis, those who go to other occupations&mdash;and they are very few&mdash; and those who die or, on the female <Col N="81" /> side, those who retire on marriage. That wastage of 1,000 could have been usefully employed to reduce gradually and without any hardship to the serving civil servant, the numbers employed. Certain considerations would have to be taken into account such as the various families educating their children for entry to the Civil Service; it would not be reasonable to cut the numbers off completely but over the years a change could have been made. That change will be made some day, and until that change is made this country will have to put up with the result of Government folly exhibited through the Civil Service as much as anywhere else.</P>
    <P>If the Government is foolish enough not to consider the repercussion due to the reduction of food subsidies, they must meet the increases which follow from the rise in the cost of living and which result in further charges to the State.  It is because of the Government's folly in reducing the food subsidies last year that we are now faced with a bill of £2.4 million for the whole State personnel in this financial year.</P>
    <P>A board which nobody has criticised as being unfair&mdash;nobody has said a word against the chairman or against the people who sat on that board&mdash;has made an award to the Civil Service.  No member from any part of this House has said that it was an extravagant award.  The only phrase we used was that it was not very liberal.  As measured by outside standards and by what was achieved in outside employment, it does not rank very highly. However, we are asked to be content merely to give civil servants what they are entitled to in this year.  The arbitrator, frightened though he must have been by all these woeful statements&mdash; failure of the revenue and increase in expenditure&mdash;decided in favour of this increase extending back to 1st November last year.  Without any reason given and without any exceptional circumstances being marked, we are asked to accept that as something generous.  Deputy Cowan said if we do not give them that the civil servants will get nothing.  He hides behind the lame excuse that he will vote for this motion because otherwise civil servants would not get anything.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> I suggest that we can come to a different decision.  The money is there and there is no question of an increase in taxation.  Under the scheme as it stands if the motion is adopted it would involve a modification but assuming that it is not passed, I suggest that the arbitrator's award would have to be met in full.  Apart from that if we vote against this, and if we get rid of a Government that is not going to give civil servants what the arbitrators thought they should get, that Government can only be replaced by one of two Parties that have already pledged themselves to give the civil servants the full award.  That is the choice before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past hour we have had Deputy McGilligan setting out, in his best form, to pillory the Government because of the fact that they have put this motion before the House.  The motion which the Minister moved last week proposes that the award made in November last should be operative from 1st April this year. The award will mean that a sum of £2,400,000 must be provided in the present financial year to defray the increases to Civil Service and other State employees.  Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Finance in the Government that was in power in 1951 and introduced a Budget when the arbitration board was sitting.  Deputy McGilligan was, no doubt, aware that they were within reasonable distance of bringing their deliberations to an end.  I am sure he was also aware that the cost of living had increased from the time he took office until the arbitration board was set up.  Yet in the Budget which he introduced, not one single shilling was provided to pay the arbitration award which he knew was in the offing and that his Government knew was in the offing.  The people outside within a few weeks afterwards decided that that Government was no longer worthy of the confidence of the country.  The award of the arbitration board was in the Government offices before that Government went out of office in 1951.  That Government were fully aware of the award.  Notwithstanding that, we had no indication whatever, except from a chosen limited  <Col N="83" /> few in the City of Dublin, that the Coalition group, if they were returned to office, would have honoured that award.  That is the Deputy who to-day takes the Government to task because of the fact that they are proposing to operate the present award from 1st April this year.</P>
      <P>He tried to persuade the House&mdash;I doubt if he has persuaded himself&mdash; that the Government have no right to do that and that they are bound to accept the award from the first day it was made.  Deputy McGilligan had in his hands at the time the terms under which the arbitration board was set up.  While he read many sections of the machinery of the arbitration scheme, it was significant that there were some very important sections of the machinery which he did not read for the House.  Paragraph 2 of that machinery says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The existence of this scheme does not imply that the Government has surrendered or can surrender its liberty of action in the exercise of its constitutional authority and the discharge of its responsibilities in the public interest.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That paragraph clearly shows&mdash;and no one knows it better than Deputy McGilligan&mdash;that the Government have the right, on behalf of the people, to operate the award from any day that they believe it is in the general interest of the community to operate it.  Notwithstanding what Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Costello or any of the Opposition Deputies may say, the Government were fully within their constitutional right in determining the day from which the award should operate. I think that is clear to everyone, and I doubt if anyone will have the hardihood to challenge it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is quite plain and everyone fully realises that the Government have done everything they are legally bound to do in respect to this arbitration procedure.  It was provided in the machinery that &ldquo;subject to the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) following, the Government as soon as may be after such presentation will either signify its acceptance of the finding <Col N="84" /> contained in the board's report or will introduce a motion in Dáil Éireann recommending either the rejection of the finding or such modification therein as it thinks fit.&rdquo;  The Government are fully entitled, therefore, to recommend its rejection or such modification as it thinks fit.  It is quite obvious from the machinery agreed to by both sides that the Government have the right either to reject or modify the award. Acting as the Government of the country in exercise of their full constitutional rights, they decided to modify the full award and to make payment date from 1st April which will mean, as I have already said, the provision of £2,400,000 in a single financial year.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, Deputy McGilligan as one of the members of the previous Government, should be the last person in this House to challenge the Minister for Finance or the Government of to-day in regard to the modification of the award.  Neither we nor the country had any indication whatever from the last Government that they would accept the findings or that they would operate the award&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This House is discussing the motion by the Minister for Finance. In his financial motion a while ago the Minister stated he proposed to implement the award as from the 1st April this year and provide the money for it.  Provision was made in his financial statement and in this year's Budget to raise taxation sufficient to pay this award as from the 1st April of this year.  There is no gainsaying that fact.  This House and this Government passed the Finance Bill and, in a few days' time, it will be the duty of the State finances to provide that the remuneration of all State officers will be increased to the amount of £2,400,000 in the present year.  That is what the House is being asked to vote upon.  I take it that any vote against it will be a vote against providing that remuneration.  There are possibly in the ranks of the Opposition many who disagree with the payment of this award.  If they were honest about it, if there was a free vote of this House on a motion to that effect, I have not the slightest doubt but that many members of the Opposition, if they were not tied, would vote against the payment of any portion of this award.  I have no doubt about that.</P>

He was at great pains to emphasise that if these services had not been provided, there would be plenty of money in the Exchequer to pay this award.  I wonder are all his colleagues and his ex-colleagues in the Coalition Government in agreement with Deputy McGilligan that services provided by the present Fianna Fáil Government were not needed by the community? Are they all in agreement with him that other proposed services which will be provided, let us hope, before the year is out, will not be needed by the community?  Is that the issue in this discussion?  Is that the viewpoint taken by the Front Bench Opposition, <Col N="88" /> or is that part of their policy?  For quite a long time now there is a big doubt in the minds of most people as to what the policy of the Fine Gael Party is on this matter.  Deputy McGilligan recently told the people down the country that the Social Welfare Act was unnecessary expenditure and that it was absolutely unnecessarily put across on the people.</P>

There is a doubt in the people's minds all over the country on that matter.  I suggest it is something that should be cleared up, and this House is the place to do that.  We are told by the Fine Gael Party that they hope to be the next Government, and further that they hope the Labour Party will be in the next Coalition Government with them. I do not know whether or not the Labour Party will be willing to do that or not.  So far they have not given any indication as to whether they are willing or not, but the Fine Gael Party have stated that they hope to be part of the next Government.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion before us is one to which, I have no doubt, the House will give its support.  The Minister <Col N="90" /> for Finance has given a full explanation of it.  He has indicated that the revenue which accrued from the Budget of 1952 did not permit him, or the Government, to pay the award as from the 1st November last.  It has already been pointed out that the State finances were in such a precarious condition during last year, together with the difficulty of balancing the Budget as was pointed out by the Minister late last year or early this year, that they did not permit the Government, in the exercise of their constitutional rights as the Government of the country and in the interests of all classes of the community, to pay the award as from November last. There was no option left to the Government but to hold over, until this year's Budget, the making of provision for the payment of the award.</P>
      <P>The House and the country know well that there was a deficit of over £2,000,000 on last year's Budget.  That is an accepted fact.  I do not believe that this House would accept a motion from the Minister for Finance to borrow money to pay the award as from November last.  I doubt if even a majority of this House would be found to agree to that.  I wonder if the Opposition are suggesting that the Minister should have borrowed money to pay the award from the 1st November?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Opposition suggesting that the Minister for Finance should have borrowed money to pay the award from that date, and that for the next 30 or 40 years the people should have to pay in taxes the sum of money required to meet the interest and sinking fund charges on the sum so borrowed?  Will the Opposition leaders inform the House if that would have been their policy, assuming that the Exchequer returns showed a deficit on the year's working?  That is an important matter, and one that <Col N="91" /> we should have a clear understanding on.</P>
      <P>I think it is in the interests of the country as a whole that our finances should be maintained in a sound condition. I am sure that Deputy MacEoin and Deputy MacBride, who is a wizard in finance in his own right, will agree that sound finance in the management of the State's affairs is in the best interests of all the people.  I doubt if any Deputy will challenge that point of view.  I think we are all agreed that sound finance is the keynote of the prosperity of any country.  It is the duty of a Government to provide out of taxation for ordinary day to day expenditure.  The same thing applies to the businessman or the farmer if he wants to keep out of debt. If either were to borrow money to pay the wages of his employees and to meet the cost of household maintenance, he would quickly run into debt and eventually find himself a bankrupt. If the Government were to borrow money to pay the wages and salaries of those in the employment of the State it would be travelling along the wrong road, and would, I believe, get short shrift from the people at the earliest opportunity.  I have no doubt about that.  There is one thing on which this Government can stand foursquare before the people, and that is that it believes in paying its debts as it goes along.  It believes that it should not borrow money in order to meet ordinary day to day expenditure. That is a wise and a sound policy.  It is the policy that has been enunciated here.  When Deputies realise that that is the only principle which is before the House, I have no doubt they will give a full majority to the Minister for Finance on the motion before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, everyone will agree with the general statement made by Deputy Allen that sound finances are necessary, but there is a great difference of opinion as to what constitutes sound finance.  I think that, probably in the present situation which we have reached in regard to wages, salaries and earnings, every section of the community has a typical example of what constitutes unsound finance. <Col N="92" /> The present crux arises by reason of the fact that the Minister for Finance and the Government decided by their own deliberate action to increase the cost of practically every essential food commodity, and as a result of that, of course, the wages and earnings of every section of the community were reduced proportionately.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether members of the House really appreciate the extent to which the value of wages has been reduced in the course of the last two years.  Reference has been made to a 20 per cent. increase in the cost of living.  I think that the figures actually, in regard to food, are higher than that. The official index figure for the cost of food stood at 97 in mid-February, 1949. It went up to 98 in mid-February, 1950, and remained at 98 throughout up to mid-February, 1951.  In the following 12 months it jumped up from 98 to 109, and in the following 12 months, up to mid-February last, it went up to 122.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Deputy is not.  The Deputy is quoting from the official journal, and it is a pity that the Minister for Finance does not know his own figures.  If the Minister will look at the official cost-of-living index figures for food, he will find that between mid-February, 1951 and mid-February of this year they went up from 98 points to 122 points.  The Minister will get the relevant figures in the current issue of the <i>Trade Journal</i>; it was issued about ten days ago.  On the basis of these figures, it now costs £8 2s. to purchase £6 10s. worth of food.  Accordingly, the award made by the arbitration tribunal was extremely moderate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest the Minister should not be familiar with the figures which I have quoted, I should mention that they do not take into account the increases that have occurred in the price of foodstuffs since mid-February last. For instance, they do not take into account the recent increase in the price of sugar or the increased price of meat.  Meat has been increasing pretty steadily in price in the course <Col N="93" /> of the past two months.  Therefore, the figures are probably higher now than they were in mid-February last.</P>
    <P>I have always taken the view that, in the kind of situation in which we have been living during the past ten years or more, the only satisfactory basis on which wages and prices could be related would be some automatic arrangement whereby wages, be they of State employees or of any other employees, should fluctuate automatically with the cost of living.  My view is that we should concentrate on a comprehensive cost-of-living index and that State pensions and the wages of State servants should be anchored to the cost of living and fluctuate with such a system.  I think I have referred before in this House to the fact that such a system exists in Sweden and has worked very satisfactorily there for quite a number of years.  In Sweden, the salaries of State employees are anchored to the official cost of living and are automatically adjusted without even the intervention of an arbitration tribunal.  We are very far from having reached that position and I do not think we shall reach it under the present Government.</P>
    <P>I understood from the Minister's Budget statement and from his attitude in regard to the arbitration award to civil servants that he is determined, if possible, to try and reduce the real wages of different sections of the community. His attitude in regard to the Civil Service seems to be in pursuit of that general line of policy.  It seems extraordinary that&mdash;having taken part in arbitration proceedings, having announced in advance, before the arbitration, that the Government accepted the principle of arbitration and would implement the findings&mdash;the Government should now come to the House and ask the House, in fact, not to implement the findings which were made.</P>
    <P>I thought we had reached a position where the principles of arbitration and conciliation were recognised as the only sane and logical way of adjusting wages and salaries not merely in the case of civil servants but in the case of the community as a whole.  By and <Col N="94" /> large, the recommendations and findings of the Labour Court have been accepted and certainly any employer who fails to accept the recommendation of the Labour Court is not regarded as a good employer.  When the State employs persons it has to give the best example possible.</P>
    <P>It has to behave as a good employer towards its servants and, therefore, it should set a headline in its capacity as an employer.  Unfortunately, in this case, I am afraid the Minister for Finance is setting a headline which will have repercussions not merely throughout the Civil Service but throughout the whole industrial structure of the State.  No doubt the attitude he has adopted is intended to encourage employers not to fulfil the recommendations of the Labour Court in the future.  Obviously, if the Government themselves are prepared to ignore or reject the recommendations of an arbitration tribunal&mdash;to which they have submitted&mdash;it is very difficult for that Government to expect employers to carry out the recommendations of the Labour Court or of arbitration proceedings.</P>
    <P>This motion affects many people besides civil servants.  It is an indication, presumably, of the attitude which the State proposes to adopt in regard to teachers, the Army, Gardaí and any other sphere where it can exercise influence. Therefore, the effect of this motion is very far-reaching.  I am not going to repeat many of the arguments which were used by former speakers&mdash; by Deputy Costello, Deputy Norton and Deputy McGilligan.  I agree entirely with the arguments they have advanced.  I think that the welshing on the arbitration award is a bad example and is one which should be frowned upon by every interest in the country.  It is particularly bad having regard to the fact, as I pointed out, that the present necessity to increase wages and salaries generally arises from the Government's own action. They agreed to arbitration.  They took certain steps which were bound to lead to an increase in the cost of living. They took certain steps which were <Col N="95" /> bound to lead to an increase in the price of every essential foodstuff.  Then, having taken those steps, the Government refuse to abide by the findings of the arbitration tribunal.</P>

      <P>Having heard the Minister make his case for the motion and having heard another Deputy from the Government side of the House, I feel that both the Minister and the Deputy clearly said that they had not their hearts in the case they were making. It is clear that they are basing their arguments not on the question of whether or not civil servants, as such, are entitled to the benefits resulting from the award of the arbitration board.</P>

      <P>The object of the Bill is to extend the normal period between local elections from three to five years, and accordingly to postpone to 1955 the local elections which are due under existing legislation to be held this year.  The requirement that local elections must be held every three years was provided for in the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, but it has proved unworkable in practice.</P>
      <P>Since 1922 the Oireachtas has passed no fewer than ten Acts postponing local elections, and the fact is that within the past 31 years local elections have been held only six times, namely, in 1925, 1928, 1934, 1942, 1945 and 1950. The average interval between local elections has been, therefore, something over five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1945 the County Councils General Council and the Association of Municipal <Col N="96" /> Authorities passed resolutions asking that legislation be enacted to provide that local elections be held quinquennially.  At the annual meeting held in September, 1951, of the Association of Municipal Authorities, a resolution was passed asking that the period of membership of urban district councils be extended from three to five years.  This resolution was later discussed by a deputation received by me, following which, by letter dated 25th July, 1952, the association was informed that the matter was being considered and that their representations would be borne in mind.  In January, 1953, the executive committee of the Municipal Authorities Association passed a further resolution asking that the local elections be deferred for two years.  I fully agree with the views expressed by these representative bodies, and this Bill is designed to give effect to them.</P>
    <P>Having given the House the main purpose of the Bill, I shall now review briefly its 12 sections.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines the bodies which are local authorities for the purpose of the Bill.  They are county councils, county boroughs and borough corporations, urban district councils and town commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is the main provision of the Bill.  It provides that an election of members of every local authority shall be held in 1955 and in every fifth year thereafter, and extends the term of office of existing members of local authorities to 1955.  The actual date for elections to the various local authorities in each county will be fixed by the county council under the provisions of Section 5 of the Local Elections Act, 1927, and must lie in the period between the 23rd June and the 1st July.  The city councils in the county boroughs will fix the dates for their elections within the same period under their respective Management Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 3 affects the operation of the School Attendance Act, 1926. School attendance committees are appointed in part by the Minister for Education and in part by the local authority concerned.  The School <Col N="97" /> Attendance Act, 1926, provided that the appointments be made at three-year intervals at times to be fixed by Order of the Minister for Education. The periods of office of the members appointed by local authorities were extended by the legislation postponing local elections from 1937 to 1942 and again from 1948 to 1950.  The Minister for Education continued to make appointments triennially as required by law.  The current periods of office of members of these committees will expire on dates ranging from 31st December, 1954, to 31st December, 1955.  It is considered desirable to provide that the current periods of office shall in all cases expire on 31st December, 1955, and that appointments by both the local authorities and the Minister for Education shall be made in 1955 and quinquennially thereafter, that is to say, in the local election years.</P>
    <P>Sections 4, 5 and 7 make adaptations in the Vocational Education Acts, the Agricultural Acts and the Harbours Act, respectively, so that the election years for vocational education committees, committees of agriculture and harbour authorities will correspond with the local election years.</P>
    <P>Section 6 amends Section 45 of the Local Government Act, 1941.  Section 45 provides that where the members of a local authority are removed from office a new election of members shall be held at such time as the Minister may fix within three years from the date of removal, except where such period ends within one year of a date on which a statutory election of members of local authorities is due to be held, in which case the new election is held on that date.  Consequent on the extension of the normal period between local elections from three to five years, it is proposed to replace three years by five years in Section 45.</P>
    <P>Section 8 will extend to 1955 the current period of office of members of bodies which are required by law to be appointed by a local authority after an election of the members of such authority.  The section is designed to apply to the members of such bodies as boards of public assistance, joint drainage committees, the Dublin Fever <Col N="98" /> Hospital and the Lough Corrib Navigation Trustees.  The section does not affect bodies whose appointment is not connected by law with the election of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 9 explicitly preserves from disqualification any existing members of local authorities who may cease to be local government electors for the area which they represent between now and 1955.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with the adaptation of enactments.  It adapts references to triennial elections and enables the Minister to adapt or modify a statute, Order or regulation to enable it to have effect in conformity with this Bill.  Such an adaptation or modification must be made by Order, which shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and may be annulled by resolution of either House.</P>
    <P>Section 11 repeals provisions inconsistent with those contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides the short title and collective citation.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the management system, the elected bodies, in the exercise of their reserved and supervisory functions, are concerned more with the broader aspects of local government including the direction of policy and long-term planning rather than with the details of administration and this is all the more reason why their tenure of office should be extended so as to give them sufficient time to make themselves familiar with the numerous and complex problems with which they have to deal and to let them see during their term of office the solution of some of these problems working out in practice.</P>

      <P>The general electorate of this country in the summer of 1950 elected the local governing bodies.  The Minister has said quite a lot with regard to this Bill, but there is only one thing in it. The Minister intends by the passage of this Bill through the House that the electorate which elected the local bodies for three years in 1950 will not be allowed to speak its mind on the kind of representation it wants now <Col N="99" /> for the next three years.  That is all. The ministerial hand, by the operation of its appendage in this House of five independent votes, is to be put upon the mouth of the electorate who have certainly seen something during the past three years, and, I am sure, would like to say something as to how they want to be represented on these bodies which control the expenditure of their rates and carry on the policies of their localities.</P>
      <P>Number 1 on the list of intentions is that, if this Bill is passed, four of the five people who keep the Government in office will be saved the exposure which the local elections would give them that they have no right to represent the people.  Deputy ffrench O'Carroll would be told by the people of South-West Dublin, Deputy Cowan by the people of North-East Dublin, Deputy Flynn by the people of Kerry and Deputy Cogan by the people of Wicklow, that they no longer wish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In June, 1951, the Deputies I have mentioned, amongst others, put a Government into office, and that Government set out to sow the seeds of dissension throughout the country and to pilfer the pocket of the country, both in rates and taxes.  We came then to May or April of last year when £11,000,000 additional taxation was put on the taxation burden the people were already shouldering and £8,000,000 additional on their pockets in respect of food, by the withdrawal of the subsidies.  A sum of £20,000,000 additional was taken out of our people's pockets in that year by way of additional taxation and withdrawal of subsidies, with the assistance of certain people who would now be shown in local elections that they were unrepresentative of their areas.  Last week again, by five votes, the same blister of taxation was put on top of a people weakened, disheartened and dislocated in their general industry and economy by the taxation burden put on <Col N="100" /> them the previous year and by the additional burdens put on anybody carrying out constructive business in the country by the increase in the bank rate which came into operation in the autumn.</P>
      <P>The principal reason for this Bill is to hide the fact that four of the people who hold the present Government in power are no longer representative of their areas.  The second reason for the introduction of this Bill is the general purpose I speak about, that the Government does not want to give the electorate a chance of speaking their mind on the administration of the country at present.  The Cumann na nGaedheal Party of old stood for years against the introduction of Party politics in any way in local administration, but, from the very beginning of its reformed career, Fianna Fáil persisted in approaching local Government elections with their Party cloaks around them.</P>
      <P>In the continuation of their career wearing their Party cloaks in our local councils, although they opposed the introduction of the city manager in the case of Cork and Dublin, when they got into Government in 1932, they thought that the managerial idea could be useful to them as a Government in getting a grip of the local machinery and making it serve their purely concentrated Party political ends.  Therefor, the Party that opposed the introduction of the managerial idea in the administration of the City of Dublin and the City of Cork spread it generally and with one slap throughout the country as a whole and we had the present county manager system put into operation straightaway.  In the way in which that Party knows how to use everything they can get a grip on for their Party ends, they have used that system to impress their purely Party will from the ministerial offices on local administration with particular results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need not go back any further than 1945-1946 to see what the position with regard to rates collection is.  We could give an interesting picture by going back further, and there is no need to do so.  The total amount of rates collected in 1945-1946 was <Col N="101" /> £8,312,000; in 1946-1947, £7,999,000; in 1947-1948, £9,137,000; in 1948-1949, £9,814,000; in 1949-1950, £11,023,000, and in 1950-1951, £11,027,000.  I do not know what it was for 1951-1952, but the incidence of the policies pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government has impacted itself on our local taxation in such a way that rates have risen in that way, year after year.  Representation for local authorities has been extended to the general adult electorate as a whole, so that they took the scheme, wove it together and took as dictatorial a grip from the Department of Local Government as they possibly could on the machine.</P>
    <P>Now in the final process of being found out by those who have to pay money and who expect services for rates and taxes, in their final fight to hold their grip, they do not want a disillusioned and open-eyed electorate, having seen the results of the past few years of their administration and having seen a comparison made with the three years of the inter-Party Government, to be given a chance of saying what they think and the Fianna Fáil hand therefore is to be placed on the people's mouth.</P>

      <P>The Party opposite are now making a desperate attempt to hold a grip on a situation which they know is bringing nothing but disillusion and poverty to the people.  They are hoping, Micawberlike. Their attitude is a mixture of Hitler on the one hand and Micawber on the other, and it does not make a good mixture.  It must be a mixture that gives a very considerable amount of pain.</P>

      <P>There is one thing which is clear and which this Bill makes clear.  It is that you do not want the local electorate to speak their voice as to what they think of the people supporting the Government, No. 1, or a very large section of the Government Party, No. 2.  They are just holding on with the Hitler grip and the Hitler spirit and the Micawber hope that something will turn up, that something will go wrong with the people to confuse them more and to make them disagree about some petty thing or another and they can hold on for another year or two.</P>

I put it to the Minister that what he is <Col N="103" /> doing now is stopping the electorate from speaking their minds, that he hopes to achieve something for his Party while waiting for something to come around the corner&mdash;the bright prospects that the Minister sees and that he is hoping the people may see or think they see.  He wants to keep a grip of the Fianna Fáil position in the local authorities at the moment. He wants to maintain as it were, untarnished, the prestige of his people who are connected with local government. By a let-down of the electorate they want to keep their grip on the local authority machinery to the extent to which they have it.</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister has succeeded in getting rate collectors to go out at 65 years of age, there is quite a number of rate collectorships coming along within the next year or two.  He would like to have the present Fianna Fáil power on some of the councils to keep a grip on that.</P>

      <P>The policy is to use this Bill to keep the grip on local authority representation and on the semi-control of local authority machinery to uphold the Party while Micawber hopes and hopes.  This Bill was given a kind of tinge of policy by the Minister's suggestion that it has been found unworkable to have local elections every three years.  It will take a lot to gild the Minister's intention in this Bill.  It will take a lot of talk by his followers to do it.  I oppose this measure completely.  I see nothing in it but an attempt to take the electorate by the throat and prevent them speaking their minds.  They have seen a lot of what has happened as a result of Fianna Fáil policy in the past.  They have been a little bit deluded by letting them slip back into power but, when they compare the <Col N="104" /> results of the last two years and the results of the three years that went before that, they are a little open-eyed now.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health, in his own way, in meeting representatives of various local bodies to discuss the Health Bill, and the sweet things he said to them, has helped to open their eyes too.  He has painted a picture of developing services that will only cost them ? in the £.  By the time they have, in their own quite way, added their various impressions together, taken the various things he has told them and figured out that ?, they will know that that ? will grow to be a very big figure if somebody and some circumstance do not take the hand of Fianna Fáil policy off their throat.

      <P>I am going to answer it.  Those of us who serve in this House and on the corporation know that for a great number of years we have been faced with elections almost once a year.  Take the number of Dáil elections and the number of corporation elections.  It is impossible to carry on in that manner.  The Minister has pointed out that the representative body of local authorities made representations as a result of the discussions of all Parties&mdash;Deputy Mulcahy's Party&mdash;to have this Bill brought in and to have this matter put on a basis where we can understand where we are heading and know when we will have an election.</P>

      <P>This Bill was mooted some time ago.  The Minister has pointed out that the elections which were due in the year 1923 were postponed by Cumann na nGaedheal until 1925&mdash;I take it for the reasons Deputy Mulcahy has given to the House as the motives he imputes to us.</P>

The elections due in 1937 were held in 1942.  Was the song sung by Fine Gael, or whatever they were called when in opposition then, the same song they are singing to-day, a song of 52-line verses and a chorus of eight lines which we have heard&mdash;a grip on all the appointments in the local authorities.  No elections were held during the war years for obvious reasons.  The elections that were to be held in 1948 were postponed until 1950. When did that become an Act of the Oireachtas?  In June, 1948.  Who was in office then?  Who was the Minister for Local Government then?  Was he the dishonest person that Deputy Mulcahy speaks about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never heard such a performance as this.  The colleagues of the Deputy who has spoken and the Deputy who says I am speaking an untruth ought to have some conscience because they know that what I am saying is the absolute truth.  Where is Deputy Peadar Doyle?  Let him come in here and challenge me.  Deputy Belton, who is a prominent and active <Col N="107" /> member of the Dublin Corporation, is here and he is faced with the same problem as every other Deputy who is a member of that corporation.  Go through the number of elections we had for this House and put them alongside those we had for local authorities from the point of view of the dates; then find out whether it is not proper to have the life of a corporation or a county council made five years instead of three years.</P>
    <P>This is not something which is suddenly sprung on us.  It has been discussed over a great number of years. Fortunately, most of the business of the Dublin Corporation is carried out as a result of co-operation between members of all parties.  We agree on certain things, not from a political point of view, but from the point of view of the welfare of the city which it is our responsibility to govern.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this Bill has been introduced.  I am sorry that there is a split in Fine Gael on this matter.  They may try to hide it from the honest men in Fine Gael.  There are honest men in Fine Gael who would admit that they are not in favour of the opposition to this measure, but they are bound by a Party decision to answer the Whip in regard to this matter.  I do not know whether I am disclosing secrets or not, but when I first heard from a member of the Fine Gael Party that they were not to be allowed to support this measure, I mentioned it to the Minister and, when the First Reading was opposed here as an indication of opposition, the Minister was quite willing to leave it to a free vote of the House.  If it were left to a free vote of the House, where would the Fine Gael Deputies be on this issue?  Do we not know that this is a fair measure and that it is as far removed from politics as any measure could possibly be?</P>
    <P>Elections are fought on many issues. I do not know what issue Fine Gael would put forward at local elections in Dublin, whether it would be a high cost of living issue or a subsidy issue or what.  It has, however, come to the stage now that if we had a presidential election to-morrow we would have a <Col N="108" /> candidate put up seeking the office on the high cost of living issue.  All sense of values have been lost sight of by Deputies on the other side in their lust for office.  They talk a lot about winning a general election.  They throw their chests out as if they were certain if there were a general election to-morrow that they would be returned by a majority.</P>

      <P>I do not know what kind of a Government a collusion Government or a Coalition Government is. Deputies over there can talk about these things because they have had experience of them.  I say that since the managerial system was set up in the City of Dublin we have had to postpone the elections on a number of occasions for a variety of reasons. Those of us who serve on the Dublin Corporation, irrespective of Party, are in agreement that the life of the corporation should be five years and not three years.  We agree with the Minister when he says that if you want to put plans into operation it cannot be done with a constant change of personnel, by putting things into the melting pot again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this Bill because I think it is necessary and I hope the House will pass it.  I hope we will hear further speeches from the Opposition and that they will realise, if they follow the line taken by Deputy Mulcahy, that they <Col N="109" /> will not be believed by anybody.  I ask members of the Fine Gael Party who are members of the Dublin Corporation, if they had a free choice in this matter, whether they would not in fact support this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Strange as it may appear to Deputy Briscoe, I am one of the people who believe that we should have a five-year term for members of local authorities, but I will oppose this measure and I will give my reasons. Anyone who has read the papers within the past month can see that many local authorities and many individual members of these authorities resent a change taking place during their term of office.  They hold, and I think rightly so, that they contracted to do a certain term in the service of a local authority.  As Deputy Briscoe said, these members are unpaid and they perform an arduous and difficult task which takes up a good deal of their time.  The members of the local authorities deserve the thanks of the ratepayers because they are willing to give their time to this work.</P>
      <P>I think it only fair that they should know from the beginning just how long they will serve, and they should not be told at the end of a term that they must continue to serve for another two years.  The fact that Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil or anybody else did it in the past is no reason why it should be done now.  In fact that issue does not really arise.  The question is as to whether or not a contract has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Briscoe that five years should be the term.  I think three years is too short.  What is wrong with saying: &ldquo;Let us hold our elections this year and, as from this year, the period will, in future, be five years&rdquo;?  Does that not meet Deputy Briscoe's point?  I cannot see anything wrong with it.  Indeed, I hope that we will be able to move an amendment to that effect at a later stage.  I am very keen on a five-year period.  I think the British system is superior to ours because only a proportion of the council goes out after a certain number of years with the result that the council is not denuded of older and <Col N="110" /> more experienced members at any one time.  That is an advantage, because certain projects have to be carried on from council to council and, if all the council is swept away, there will be no continuity of policy.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill which should be discussed without political heat, but I am afraid I find myself in complete agreement with Deputy Mulcahy that the only reason for the introduction of this measure at this stage is because Fianna Fáil are afraid to face an election.</P>

      <P>I happen to have the honour of being secretary to the Fine Gael Party, and it is my duty to take a note of the decisions taken as well as the observations made.  I am now stating what occurred.  I dare say Deputy Briscoe would wish that the Fine Gael Party would be split as Fianna Fáil is apparently split in Wicklow.  I dare say he would wish that, but wishes do not always materialise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in regard to this Bill is quite clear.  The reason why it has been introduced at this particular juncture is because the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government do not want to hold local elections in 1953.  Deputy Kyne approached the question of the <Col N="112" /> five-year term from the point of view of the council, and I agree with his point of view.  There is also the point of view of the electorate, of the person who elects the members of the council. People are entitled to know, when they elect members to the Dáil or to local authorities, the period during which they are putting them in office. When the electorate elects representatives to this House, they know that those representatives will be here for a particular term, and it would be a gross breach of faith if the life of the Dáil were extended without the wishes of the electorate being ascertained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it not done in emergency legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that the Fianna Fáil Party has been so bad that it has thrust upon the country an emergency equivalent to the one to which he refers? If the Deputy is suggesting that I welcome his suggestion because it is very nearly true.  The people who elect county councillors are entitled to know before they elect those councillors the term for which they are being elected, and it is a gross breach of faith to extend the term deliberately in this fashion without any reason being apparent for that extension other than the political ease of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not suggest that the election was being deferred for any reason, for the purposes of adumbrating new policy or a new method of election.  He was quite blunt about it. The only thing he could produce in favour of it was a resolution of the General Council of County Councils in 1945 and of the Association of Municipal Authorities in the same year. The Minister's Party had two years up to 1947 had they wished to make the term a five-year period.  They were not however, in the same chastened mood then as they are now.  He referred also to the meeting of municipal authorities held during the current year.  We all know the position in relation to the municipal authorities. There is a congress abroad this year and certain delegates are anxious to attend.  That was really the basis of the resolution passed by the Association <Col N="113" /> of Municipal Authorities here. That is well known.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be very pleased with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is well known. If the Deputy intends to relate private conversations here I, too, will relate private conversations on that subject. But, quite apart from that and quite apart from what Deputies and councillors may feel, there have been, as Deputy Harris knows, associations of a non-political character which have indicated that they regard it as essential that there should be local elections this year, perhaps even in Kildare in order to get rid of Deputy Harris and myself and they are perfectly entitled to do that if they wish. They are entitled, if they wish, to say that our period of office expires this year and they want to put somebody else on the council in place of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Briscoe that if changes come about as a result of an election they will be changes from a very arduous task because county councillors and members of corporations who conscientiously do their job have a great deal to do and a great deal of work in the nature of public service, a thankless task to a large extent.  I can understand the point of view put forward that there should in future be a five-year term in relation to local authorities to enable such authorities to bring their plans to fruition.  That is arguable.  Some people hold that it is better that there should be a more frequent reaction to local feeling.  Some people say it is better to have that speedy reaction irrespective of the trouble and the difficulty it may create.  Others think it is better to have a long-term viewpoint so that long term decisions can be taken with a greater degree of security.  Others agree with Deputy Kyne that it would be better to have only a certain proportion of county councillors or members of local authorities seeking election so that there will not be a complete change.  All these contentions can be argued in a calm, peaceful atmosphere when the people are asked to give their verdict as to what is to be done in regard to local government but there <Col N="114" /> is no case whatsoever for introducing a measure to change the whole basis without giving the people an opportunity of voicing their opinion in relation to that change.</P>
    <P>There is no difference of opinion in this Party on that subject, none whatever, and I think I am in a better position to know what happens in my Party than Deputy Briscoe is.  This Bill is introduced for the sole reason of getting the Fianna Fáil Party out of a jam, and for no other reason.  If there was any other reason the elections would be held this year and the new term of five years would come into operation as from this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at Fine Gael's attitude on this Bill and I am even more surprised at Deputy Sweetman's attitude.  I have some 20 years experience in the Dublin Corporation, and the question of three and five years has been discussed from time to time. It has been always felt that five years would be a normal term or should be a normal term.  Anyone who has worked with a local authority over any period knows that a young man, particularly coming into the corporation or elsewhere, is really only coming to know the run of the committees after three years.  With a population of over 500,000 in Dublin, the work of the committees in the Dublin Corporation is of a highly specialised nature.  It may be a moot point whether the term of office should be three or five years and I believe we all seem to agree that it should be five years; but what is not a moot point with me is that there was a general request that there should be a postponement of the elections this year.  I know nothing at all about what goes on at Fine Gael Party meetings or any other Party meetings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am intimately acquainted with every member of the Dublin Corporation and I am glad to say that no matter what Party to which they belong, I think I am friendly with them and they are friendly with me. That goes for practically every member <Col N="115" /> of the corporation whoever he may be. There is no politics, as Deputy Briscoe has said, in the Dublin Corporation.  I thought I was only voicing the considered, unanimous opinion of Fine Gael, of Labour and Independent members of Dublin Corporation when I for one suggested to the Minister that the elections should be postponed. I challenge any member of the corporation who spoke to me on the matter and says he did not ask me to have them postponed.  There are members in this House who spoke to me and asked me to request the Minister to postpone them.</P>

      <P>Members of Fine Gael I do not know what can be argued in relation to the country but I know that on 1st April of this year there was an extension of the City of Dublin which took in just 7,000 acres.  It was represented to all members of the corporation by the city manager and officials of the corporation that it would be an impossible business to have an election this year, having regard to the fact that the extension took place only on 1st April.  It would be quite impossible to arrange to hold an election this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of official difficulties. Actually the wards have only been created a few weeks.  There would be overlapping difficulties there. If the Deputy knows County Dublin&mdash; I know that part as well as I know my own constituency&mdash;and if he can show me how you would have the polling booths&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no accommodation for corporation polling booths. There is great complaint from certain people, a small section of the community in Dublin who constitute themselves as a ratepayers' association. They are a handful of people.  Every <Col N="116" /> member of the Dublin Corporation is a ratepayer and everybody whom each member of the Dublin Corporation represents is in some way a ratepayer or a contributor to the rates.</P>
      <P>The second reason for postponing an election, as far as the ratepayers' association is concerned, would be the saving of expense.  I am not going to hazard a guess as to what an election would cost in the city, but I would say in this particular year when we have so many capital works in hand, that that would be a good reason if there were no other reason.  I do not know why there should be all this fuss, as Deputy Sweetman said.  I do not know why a Bill of this sort should be considered with any heat whatever, because as long as I can remember&mdash; and Deputy General Mulcahy can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;from the first time Fine Gael contested an election as Cumann na nGaedheal in the early days after 1930 their slogan at all times was: &ldquo;No politics in the Dublin Corporation.&rdquo; What is the fuss about if it is not to be a political election?&mdash; and we are not making it a political election.</P>

      <P>When we meet in the corporation the business of the city is done without any reference to politics. It is business that can be done without any reference to politics because it is largely committee work, and the various committees are consulted.  They have not got the power that local authorities might have or that local authorities had before the managerial system was introduced.  I do not know what all the bother is about.  If there are people who do not want to serve &mdash;and I think, without mentioning any names, there are a number of people, some of them from Fine Gael, and very prominent members of Fine Gael &mdash;it might be better if they resigned from Dublin Corporation and allowed <Col N="117" /> that body to co-opt members in their place at the next monthly meeting. That is a simple way out for Deputy Kyne or for anybody else who says he entered into a contract for three years, not for five years, and feels he should be released from his contract.  We do not have to have an election; a member only has to resign and somebody else is co-opted in his place.  That is a simple way out of it.  If Fine Gael consider that we are afraid of an election, I think Deputy Briscoe has cited a number of instances in which could be said that that was the reason on a great many occasions when the Party opposite was in power, why elections were postponed.</P>
      <P>What can a political Party fear in a local election?  The fact is that the result of local elections have no bearing whatever on parliamentary elections. They do not foreshadow, either here, in Britain or anywhere else, what will happen at a general election. That has been borne out here time and time again.  Anybody who studies the question closely, will be amazed at what might be termed the somersault that takes place in a parliamentary election immediately after a local election.</P>
      <P>The electorate might put in a number of Opposition candidates, for example, in England at a local election and when the general election comes round, people realise that the issues are completely different and that then it is a battle of policies.  There is no battle of policies in local elections.  There is no battle of policies in the Dublin Corporation elections because so far as I am aware, every Party is in favour of extending public health services, of pushing ahead with the housing drive and of any amelioration required in conditions in the city.</P>

      <P>When Deputy McCann tells the House that no political significance is attached to local elections, of course he speaks with his tongue in his cheek.  There is, from the very moment the election takes place. The first test of political activity in Dublin after the election, is the election of Lord Mayor and Deputy <Col N="118" /> McCann knows that well.  When the flag is put round the Lord Mayor's shoulders, there is the first simple test of what the alignment is going to be. That, so far as I know, has been the history of the Dublin Corporation for 30 years, if not longer.  A case has not been made why the extension of the life of county councils or local authorities should take place now.  As Deputy Kyne has pointed out, I could understand a proposal to extend the life of local authorities after the next election, and if it were suggested that after the election of 1953, the life of the new local authority should be five years.  It is argued that the local authority has not the necessary time to carry out its programme in three years.  I do not know whether it takes five years for any Party to do the work on a local authority that they should do.  When one goes into a county council or into the Dublin Corporation it is believed and expected, no matter how insignificant one is, that one has made some study of local problems and knows something about local administration. My belief is that it is in one's youth, in the early days of one's life, that one will do something if he is ever to do it and not when one has become a hardened campaigner, after one has warmed the seat for a couple of years and believes that one has acquired a sort of right to hold it for ever.</P>

      <P>We are told that the Minister would not extend the life of the local authorities, were it not that Deputy McCann and Deputy Briscoe told him that the corporation wished to extend the life of the local authorities. Deputy McCann and Deputy Briscoe said that they told the Minister that they had the authority of the Fine Gael members, the Labour members and the Independent members of the Dublin Corporation to support them in that view.  Lo and behold, when we get this Coalition in the Dublin Corporation of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Independents, even the Minister for Local Government in a Fianna Fáil Government must bow his crested head and parliamentary democracy and local democracy must succumb.

Does not everybody know that the local authorities power to-day is insignificant?

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to point out a reason why this Bill should not get a Second Reading because the case made for it was that the Dublin Corporation asked the Minister and were it not for the fact that Deputy Briscoe and Deputy McCann were able to go to the Minister and say: &ldquo;We have the support of all Parties in the Dublin Corporation and we want you to postpone it&rdquo;, he would not have brought it in.  I want to submit to the Minister that he should not be directed on policy by the corporation.  Dublin Corporation is an important body no doubt.  It is true that it has, and does render yeoman service, and that anybody elected to it renders yeoman service to the city.  I am not one of those people who say: &ldquo;County councillors do not do anything.&rdquo;  I know they are hard pressed and that it is very difficult to get successful men in the ranks of labour, agriculture or business to leave their own avocations and take up the duties that devolve on them in the local authorities.  Therefore, I must not be taken as reflecting on them in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that the Government to-day is afraid to face the elections.  They bring in this measure to prevent even their nominees from facing the elections.  They are determined for as long a period as they can not to face them until the same Government Party is probably facing the electorate itself.  Of course, we know the Government Party promised the five Independents that supported <Col N="122" /> them that they would try and keep in office for the five years.</P>

We are told that the city manager is against the holding of local elections this year.  Why?  Because 7,000 acres of the county have been added to Dublin and they could not arrange the wards and the polling booths.  Then, of course, we find that the wards are already clearly marked. There was a split in the Fianna Fáil corporators on that point, that one knew more than the other, but these little things happen in the best regulated families.  We cannot help that divergence of opinion even though the slip was passed round to make sure everything was right.

Anyhow, that is a thing that could be discussed in Committee&mdash;that whatever period was agreed on would not come into effect until after the next local elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that were done, the people would know under what system they were being elected.  They would know that they were not being put into office and were not being kept in office by what is the equivalent of an Emergency Powers Order.  The Government knew that, in regard to these local elections, they could not make an Order under <Col N="126" /> the Emergency Powers Act to extend the life of these bodies for the safety of the nation, although, as one Deputy opposite said, there was nearly an emergency.  Of course, what the safety of the nation means to them is the safety of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>I merely want to intervene briefly to congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill.  I, in common with the members of every local authority, welcome the Bill. Members of local authorities, irrespective of politics, will welcome it.  Everyone is well aware that a period of three years does not permit the work of a county council, or the work of any other local body, to be continued smoothly.  When new members are elected, they are just getting into their stride and becoming acquainted with the work when another election comes round.  Those who say that the electorate want elections are not in touch with the electorate.  The people do not want the costly interference, which an election causes, every three years. So far as the personnel of these local authorities is concerned, I and other members of the House who are members of these local bodies know it to be true, that 99.9 per cent. of the outgoing members present themselves for re-election.</P>
      <P>The Deputies opposite have said that members of local authorities have very little administrative power at the present time.  If that is so, why is so much fuss being made about this extension of time?  The proposal in this Bill is by no means an innovation.  On at least five previous occasions, the life of local authorities was extended by an Act of this House, by different Governments and at different times.  It was extended twice by Fine Gael or whatever they called themselves at the time; it was extended once by the Coalition Government.  When these extensions were made, I do not think any improper motives were alleged against the Governments which did that.  The extensions were made for a purpose.  I think the members of the local authorities were perfectly satisfied that it was the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The members of local authorities <Col N="127" /> have onerous and arduous work to do. It is honorary work, and it is a costly matter for members, who have to follow their ordinary avocations in life, to be contesting elections every three years.  I do not think I have yet met a member of a local authority who was anxious to have these elections every three years.  In fact, there is a unanimous feeling amongst them, irrespective of their shade of politics, that the period of office should be for a longer period than three years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy, in a speech that had a good deal of bitterness in it, opposed the Second Reading of this Bill.  He seemed to insinuate that our principal reason for desiring to extend the life of the present councils is that these bodies are dominated by Fianna Fáil&mdash;that Fianna Fáil had brought in the Managerial Act and had succeeded in planting in these councils Fianna Fáil personnel.  I wonder what knowledge the Deputy has, either of the constitution of these councils or of their staffs.  I do not want to pinpoint any person in any particular council, but I do not think anyone could accuse our council of being staffed by Fianna Fáil at any particular stage.  Perhaps the contrary could be said.  However, the least said about that the better. We are satisfied that we have good officials, and we did not question by whom, or how, they were appointed. We believed they are competent to carry on their work.  We would not insinuate, as Deputy Mulcahy did, that these councils were staffed by Fianna Fáil supporters, and that we wanted to perpetuate that situation by postponing the holding of elections this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could tell the Deputy a lot about what happened in other areas, but I do not think this is the time or the place to do that.  Fine Gael members are continually talking about elections.  They have been doing so for years past, but I think if one takes a glance back over the history of elections in this country he will find that Fine Gael came very poorly out <Col N="128" /> of the elections held.  If an election were held to-morrow, you would have the same thing occurring.  Our council is not dominated by Fianna Fáil, but I am perfectly satisfied that if an election were held to-morrow, Fianna Fáil would return a majority on it. Yet, no member of that council desires an election.  The members look on it as unnecessary, because they feel it would merely impede the work they have to do.  A period of three years only allows councillors an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the work which falls to them to do.  So far as local administration is concerned, the burden of work which falls to be done by members of local bodies is increasing year after year.</P>
      <P>I suggest it is imperative for that reason that the life of these councils should be extended from three to five years.  I congratulate the Minister on having the courage of his convictions in bringing in this measure to extend the period.  I can assure him that if members of the Dáil who are members of local authorities were to speak their minds, and had not to respond to the Whip of their Party they, too, would congratulate him on bringing forward this measure.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCann, when speaking to-night, struck a note which, I think, rubbed every Deputy against the grain whether he sits on the Government side or any other side of the House.  He seemed to adopt the attitude that members of this House who are also members of local authorities can take it into their heads to have elections and so completely disregard the rights of the ordinary people down the country.  The people should be considered first, last and all the time. Deputy McCann, as a member of the Dublin Corporation, may have his own difficulties.  Perhaps Dublin Corporation have their own difficulties.  Nevertheless, it is not good enough for Deputy McCann or the members of the Dublin Corporation to come along and get the Minister to introduce a Bill which will affect 27 county councils besides numerous other municipal authorities.  One of the arguments in support of it is that because the boundary of Dublin City has recently <Col N="129" /> been extended to the tune of a further 7,000 acres there would be official difficulty in having elections.  I can make a suggestion to the Minister about that difficulty.  Would it not be very easy to postpone Dublin municipal elections for six or 12 months?  That would also take the Government out of a very big political difficulty in view of what happened at the by-election in North-West Dublin.  However, I would give the country an opportunity of showing what they think of this Government at local government elections.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Mulcahy was talking somebody remarked that the cost of living would be brought into a local election.  Undoubtedly, the cost of living is one of the most burning problems of the day.  Regardless of the merits or demerits of a particular candidate in any part of the country, I believe that the people would express their approval or disapproval of the present Government's actions, particularly their economic policy, in voting for or against a particular candidate.</P>
      <P>If there is some difficulty because of extending the Dublin City boundary, then I suggest postponing elections to Dublin Corporation for three or six months until the necessary machinery is available, but I consider that the local government elections should be held all over the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>Somebody has stated that local government elections were postponed five times in the past.  If they had been postponed 25 times it would not make it right.  When the people elect a county council or a municipal authority, as the case may be, they understand that, after three years, they will get a chance of changing that body.  They understand that that is the position under the law.  When the people went to the polls in 1950 they expected that in 1953 they would get a chance of showing their approval or disapproval of the people whom they elected.  The present Government have decided to deny the people that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proper solution of this whole problem would be to alter this Bill&mdash; I make that suggestion with a view to helping the Minister&mdash;and to extend <Col N="130" /> the life of future county councils, after the next election, to five years.  However the election should be held in the present year.  I see that the Minister has a cynical smile on his face.  The Minister is very lucky that he has the power to dodge an outraged people at the present time because he is afraid to face the music.  However, the Government will not escape in Wicklow or Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not be surprised if some sort of legal or political subterfuge were introduced to dodge that.  Nevertheless, I believe that when the people of these two constituencies realise the reason behind this Bill they will take the advantage of showing very clearly what they think of the set-up on the Government side of the House.</P>
      <P>I am not familiar with the work of members of corporations but I was a member of a county council for a number of years and I can say that members of county councils are a very hard-worked group of public representatives. The County Management Act has shorn them of authority except in regard to the appointment of rate collectors, caretakers of cemeteries and of course, the right to talk <i>ad lib</i> in the council chamber.  These are the only three rights that the benevolent Fianna Fáil Government decided to leave them when, some years ago, the present Minister for Finance, in his then capacity of Minister for Local Government, established the county managers in full control.  Nevertheless, most of the work of county councillors is not done in the council chamber. They fulfil a most useful function in the life of the community.  They do a thousand and one things.  They help people of all classes with every kind of difficulty.  They give them advice. They get no remuneration for their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that councillors should get an opportunity of relinquishing office if they wish to do so.  Somebody has said that a county councillor can resign if he wants to.  That is true.  Once a man is elected he does not like to <Col N="131" /> resign or to throw the people's gift to him back in their face.  Some councillors might welcome the opportunity of not standing for re-election.  They fulfil their term of appointment and their contract to the people who elected them and, when the full period has expired, they do not stand again.  This measure is not fair to the people or to such councillors.  I suggest the Minister should alter this Bill to take effect after the next county council elec-but that the next county council elections be held some time this year, whenever the period expires.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that one reason for the postponement of county council elections for another two years is the matter of continuity of policy.  I have fairly mixed views about the length of time that a local authority should live. The people&mdash;not the councillors or the members of a corporation&mdash;should have a chance every three years of changing the policy and of giving a direction of change of policy.</P>
    <P>I do not think three years is too short.  I cannot see what continuity of policy means, since policy must change according as times change.  I would be willing to give way if the Minister would agree to alter the Bill as I suggest, making the five-year period take effect after the next election, when the people would know, when going to the polls, they were electing the new council for five years and could not change it even if they were dissatisfied within that period.</P>
    <P>There is no use in Fianna Fáil denying that the whole reason for the Bill is that the present Government is afraid to face the people.  They should give a chance to the people to show their approval of Government policy. It may be argued that it is no place to talk about policy; nevertheless, the present Taoiseach on several occasions took advantage of local elections to sound the people and see whether public feeling was running against him or for him.  This Bill is a candid admission that Fianna Fáil knows now that the people have turned completely against them and feel outraged at their economic policy since last April <Col N="132" /> 12 months, when the harsh Budget was introduced by the present Minister for Finance.  The present Government knows that the people are outraged, and they are afraid to face the music. They got one frightful shock in Dublin City North-West.  Dodging the issue will not save them: it will only put off the evil day.  They are hoping against hope that something will come round the corner to save them, but the people are waiting, they have long memories and will not forget the things that have happened.</P>
    <P>I will make an offer to the Minister for Local Government.  We will support this Bill if the Minister gives an assurance that he will convince the Taoiseach of the urgent necessity to dissolve the Dáil and go to the country.  Much as we disagree with the Bill, we will vote for it if the Minister gives that assurance when replying on the Second Reading.  If he can convince the Taoiseach to dissolve Parliament and go to the country, we will vote for this Bill.</P>

      <P>I feel it is my duty to make a few brief observations on the Bill.  I do not care two hoots whether the local elections or national elections are held in two days' time, or in two weeks, two months or two years.  I am a member of the Municipal Authorities Association, which represents more than 50 per cent. of the population.  In 1951 that body discussed this problem and at the annual conference in Fermoy, in October, 1952, a resolution was passed requesting the Minister to postpone the local elections and to alter the period from three to five years.  That resolution was carried unanimously by the conference and I am not giving any secret away when I state that the association has not on it a Fianna Fáil majority.  In fact, the chairman elected in Fermoy is a supporter of the Opposition and is the candidate for Cork in the forthcoming by-election. Incidentally, I have heard him express the hope that Deputy Smith would be long spared to be Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that in my own county this matter has not been discussed at the corporation of which I am a member. <Col N="133" /> We have our political differences, but happily they do not enter into the administration of corporation affairs.  I am not concerned in the slightest degree about the views expressed by members of the Dublin Corporation here to-night.  They have their representation on our association the same as other cities and towns and they carry no more weight than we do.</P>
    <P>I have heard a good deal of arrant nonsense talked across the floor, even by the leaders of the Opposition. Deputy Mulcahy stressed the ever-increasing rate, running into millions, but he failed to enumerate the increased services which are being given to the most needy amongst us.  That is the reason why we have an increased rate.  The salient factor he overlooked, though quoting the many millions increase in the rate during the past few years, is that on the whole we have a 98 per cent. collection of rate throughout our towns and cities and also on our county councils.  That is something we should feel proud of.</P>
    <P>The period of years for which local public bodies should be elected has not been discussed at my own council, but at the sister town council, Dundalk Urban Council, in January or February, 1952, this very matter was discussed.  After a long discussion, it was proposed and seconded&mdash;not by members of the Fianna Fáil Party but by people opposed to us politically&mdash; that their representatives to the Municipal Authorities Association be recommended to support the appeal to have the elections postponed from three years and held every five years. Here are incontrovertible statements of fact&mdash;not statements made by people with no experience whatever of the administration of local public bodies.</P>
    <P>These bodies have a great deal of responsibility, and three years is not sufficient for men to gather a knowledge of the administration, particularly where there are corporation estates.  It is an intricate business, and people elected for the first time cannot grasp in detail the necessary knowledge of administration.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I unhesitatingly <Col N="134" /> here to-night support this Bill and hope the Minister will carry it through in the interest of local public bodies administration.  I make no apology for my contribution to the debate.</P>

      <P>It is time we got down to the basis of argument on the legislation itself, as distinct from what the political arena may present.  I oppose this Bill and possibly oppose it on a fundamental legal principle.  It is easy for the Lord Mayor of Drogheda, Deputy Walsh, to speak of what they may have done at the Dundalk Urban Council; but the whole genesis of argument must remain whether or not people elected for three years have the right gratuitously to suggest they should be given five.  My quarrel with this Bill is on an issue of principle.  If there is any argument for an extended period of life for the normal county council, it should come as a result of a specific mandate having been sought and obtained from the electorate for that particular change.</P>

      <P>This Bill creates a new tenet of law.  It proposes to alter fundamentally and completely the basis of life of county councils.  One may argue that certain postponements were made before.  I am not going to argue on this Bill the merits or demerits of what was done then.  I might have had very cogent arguments against what was done.  We know that something was done in the exigencies of a situation in which the slaughter of county councils had taken place when the present Minister for Finance was the potentate in the Department of Local Government and we know that the postponement which took place during the period of office of the inter-Party Government arose from the fact that a county council was resuscitated and that its length of life was even less than three years and that it was then an extension by way of Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It affected Dublin and Kerry, but, leaving that aside, I want to argue this Bill on the basis that here is a proposal with regard to the local government <Col N="135" /> code by which it is proposed to re-enact that the period of life of a county council shall be five years.  I think it is quite arguable that it should be five years, and I think it is equally arguable that it might be a good system to have a rotation arrangement in the form of the withdrawal of different members at different times, so that there would at all times be continuity somewhat on the system of directors of companies who retire by rotation.  That might be necessary if we were satisfied that the county councils or the Corporation of Dublin exercised any real control, outside of certain limited functions.</P>
    <P>This Bill has not gone far enough in one respect and has gone too far in another.  Let us argue initially that this measure, making a fundamental and radical change in the general local government code, is one which should be brought forward, as various members have suggested, after elections in which the issue of the particular type of change was put before the electorate.  No matter what we may argue about politics not entering into the activities of county councils, these local authorities, the Corporation of Dublin and every other, are in many ways merely replicas in miniature of the Dáil.  One would need to be divorced completely from reality not to appreciate that, when we read a meeting of the South Cork Board of Assistance, of the West Cork Committee of Agriculture, or the West Cork Board of Health, various Parties are plugging their own Party line and the country is no longer naïve enough to believe that that is not so.</P>
    <P>There is no basis of argument in the suggestion that a local election would not be a fairly salutary indication of the way the general mind was running. With all respects to the House, this Bill is one which, from its very initiation, has been approached in the wrong way.  There is in the House a large number of members who are responsible members of local authorities and who have a communal interest in the improvement of the general standard and efficiency of local authorities, and the Bill could have been approached <Col N="136" /> very effectively on the basis of appointing a Committee of the House to iron out a measure which would give satisfaction to all Parties.  It is a mistake that the Bill should have been brought in in an atmosphere of pending by-elections and in circumstances of a rapidly falling Government prestige.  These circumstances naturally tend to distort the real significance of the Bill, because, pressing as we do on this side for a chance to test the people's opinion, we can use this measure to lambast the Government in respect of its sudden recalcitrant mood in the matter of contact with the people.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take the Bill out of that arena because it is a Bill which is going to make a fundamental and radical change in the whole basis of local government and the general activities of local authorities.  In that situation, it would have been infinitely better from the point of view of everybody if the Bill could have been taken in a less controversial atmosphere and in a way which would have produced results satisfactory to all sections.</P>
    <P>I want the Government to put forward some argument in favour of the indecent haste for the postponement of this Bill.  We are running up to the time in which the local elections would have to be held.  It is going to be any more inconvenient to hold the local elections and then bring into operation the new basis of local government? I do not believe it is, and I think it would be in the Government's own interests to refute the suggestion that must inevitably be in everybody's mind that there is a shyness and a bashfulness in their approach, unusual in the case of Fianna Fáil, which must be indicative of an extraordinary unease or doubt as to the love and affection of the fond people they purport to rule.</P>
    <P>It is better that we get down to reality.  Let the Government hold the local elections and then, in the light of a local election having been held, make their changes, because I feel that, with local elections and by-elections on the mat, we might get a very clear indication of the country's attitude towards the economic policy and <Col N="137" /> general economic plan of the Government. It may be that they would do extremely well.  Why will they not take the chance?  It may be that we would get a salutary answer, although I have grave doubts.  There is no doubt at all, however, that there is a growing anxiety in all sections, in all classes and creeds, of this community to get an opportunity of showing the Government that they are not satisfied with their stewardship, that they do not think this a competent Government and that they are certain that, given the opportunity, they can replace them by a better Government.  Do not let indecent haste to avoid an issue which is inevitably piling up compel us to put a provision in the local government code which may be put in without the benefit of the considered judgment and the generously given advice of people interested in improving local administration and the whole technique of local administration.</P>

      <P>It is very amusing to listen to people on the opposite side clamouring for local elections now, when we remember that, a couple of years ago, they were telling us that local authorities had such little power that it would not be possible to get candidates to stand for election.  It is very amusing to see now all this excitement and outward show, according to Deputy Blowick, on the part of people who are not in the least anxious to have an election.  They may as well tell the truth.  The people who are shouting the loudest in the local authorities for elections are the people who do not want them at all and who are very anxious to avoid them.  There is more of that feeling down the country.  It is not confined to the Dublin Corporation.  I can assure the people on the other side of the House that there are plenty of their people who do not want a local election either. I heard Deputies like Deputy Blowick suggesting that Fianna Fáil are afraid of a local election.

      <P>Seeing that I cannot go any further with my grievance in that matter I want to tell the House that, as a member of a local authority since 1934, as chairman of the local authority in Wexford on three occasions and as present chairman of the premier body of Wexford County Council, I have some experience of local authorities and what we have to do.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party say that representatives would not learn enough in three years.  If that be <Col N="140" /> so in the case of a local authority, why do we have a general election every time it suits the Taoiseachs, sometimes within two years, and plunge the country into great expense?  The only argument that the Government are putting up now is that a local representative would not have enough experience after three years.</P>
      <P>In 1934 I was on the local authority and we had no local elections until 1942.  When the 1942 election was over and when the Fianna Fáil people lost the grip they had on the local authorities, of course, the next thing that was introduced was the county manager. Since then the local representatives as well as the people have lost faith in local elections because, they say, &ldquo;what can we do?&rdquo; The only thing we can do is to strike the rate and appoint the rate collector.  Every power is a managerial function.  I find that we cannot get men now on local authorities who will take the interest that local representatives took before that Act was passed.</P>
      <P>I do not see why the Dublin Corporation should dictate to the Twenty-Six Counties.  I am speaking as a countryman. If the ratepayers of Dublin had their way to-morrow they would put out very quickly the local authority that spent £32,000 of the rates to decorate O'Connell Bridge and light up the streets of Dublin for An Tóstal.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government informed our urban council that we could increase the rates by 3d. in the £ to decorate the town for An Tóstal but we were not taking that.  Of course, Dublin Corporation took it and spent a lot of money which could have gone for other purposes.  Deputy Briscoe may shake his head but I am sure the people of Dublin were disgusted that £32,000 of the rates was spent to decorate the city for the people who were coming over to see us.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan, who is supporting the Government, might lose his seat, which would be a bad headline. I believe that people can find out anyone in three years; they can find out whether he is a good representative or a bad representative.  I believe that Fianna Fáil would lose their seats if they had the local elections because the Budget of last year outraged the people.  We cannot have a general election and we are not going to have local elections because the Dublin Corporation told the Minister for Local Government not to have them now.  Deputy Briscoe, of course, is the head man there.</P>
      <P>I believe that a change is good in any local authority and in any Government because people get too independent when they think everything is going all right.  On the Wexford County Council there are nine Fianna Fáil members.  I know they would not return nine the next time.  I am sure the Minister knows that also.</P>

      <P>The Minister intervened and I had to give him a reminder.  This Bill should not have been brought in at all.  We should have the local elections which will be a test of what the people are thinking.  We should have a general election of course, but you know you have no chance.  I know that it takes some years to understand local administration. But a one-man dictator in a county, the county manager, is a bad thing.  There is corruption.  I do not care what Deputies on the other side say.  I was at the municipal authorities conference several times.  These people are sent from different councils and, of course, they do not want a local election.  They do not want to lose their seats.  That is why they asked the Minister to postpone the local elections.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that local elections are necessary.  The housing drive is slowing up.  Unemployment in the local areas is increasing because the road works, the land reclamation scheme, and schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act are slowing up.</P>

It is no pleasure to fight a local election or a general election.  It means hard work for those on every side of the House and it means expense.  I believe the people should be given a chance when the three years are up and that no Minister or no Party should say to the elected representatives: &ldquo;We will keep you there for another two years.&rdquo; The Minister should withdraw the Bill and then the people of the country will be satisfied, because they often say to me: &ldquo;When will we have the local elections or the general election to get these people out?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Wait and see.  You have got a shock already.  It was the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tim Murphy, who put the housing drive into operation.  At the present time we cannot get housing schemes sanctioned by the present Minister.  A housing scheme of the Enniscorthy Urban Council has been before the Minister for months.  Although all the tradesmen are going away and unemployment is rife, the Minister will not sanction that scheme. I ask him to sanction that scheme and get the machinery going again.  The Minister should not think that there are enough houses.  Local authorities could go on building houses for the next ten years.  In Dublin City at the moment many people are crammed into one room.  Deputy Briscoe knows that.  Around the City of Dublin I see the big swanky, better type of houses, with garages attached, being built while the workers have to remain in the slums.</P>

      <P>This Bill is designed to extend the life of the existing county councils.  It is designed to ensure that members who are elected for three years will continue to act for a further two years in the various local authorities. This legislation, which is being forced upon the House, is most undemocratic because it applies to the <i>status quo</i> and is not designed to alter the position for the future.  If instead of extending the life of the present local authorities the Bill was designed to give a life of five years in future I think there would be agreement on both sides in relation to that matter. When, however, a piece of legislation is introduced in a cowardly way in order to prevent a test of public opinion we must object.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that a test of public opinion will not be permitted, if at all possible, by the present minority Government.  The Government is a minority.  On the day on which the present Cabinet was formed with the aid of the five Independents the Taoiseach said that he would have something to say on a future occasion regarding minority government, but we have not heard from him since except by way of undemocratic legislation such as this.</P>

    <P>Some of the Deputies said that the <Col N="148" /> country could not afford the expense of county council elections.  Everybody knows that county council elections are only as expensive as the candidates wish to make them.  I can say for Dublin County Council that the cost of the elections for a Fine Gael candidate was £15 in 1948.</P>

Dublin Corporation are administering in the Ballyfermot area and they are collecting rents from those people.  The services available in the Ballyfermot area are being supplied by Dublin Corporation and the services being taken away from the people there are also being administered by Dublin Corporation.

      <P>In other words, Deputy McCann's argument falls to the ground.  There are also 2,000 people in Artane and Coolock who will be under the thumb of Dublin Corporation and who are not given the opportunity of saying whether the existing group should operate or not.  The same applies in respect of Inchicore.  This is only an example of the position in which so many people find themselves and they are going to be gagged.  This Bill is designed to gag those voters. It is a cowardly Bill; it is just a cheap trick, but those people must suffer.</P>
      <P>Some people argue that owing to the extension of the city boundary into the Dublin County area, there should be no election held in Dublin City and County.  Supposing that was the case, we are entitled to suggest that the county council elections should take place in the remainder of the country. But the people are not being allowed to speak, either in the country or elsewhere. Everybody knows there is politics in county councils.  Politics were brought into county councils by Fianna Fáil.  Previously most of the county councillors carried an independent banner when they were going into the council, but when they were campaigning for Fianna Fáil they carried in a Fianna Fáil banner with them. The result is that in recent years the inclination is for the councillor to indicate whether he is Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, or other Party supporter during the election campaign.</P>

      <P>The people know what side that councillor intends to take in relation to their interests.  They are able to see what interests the man will represent before he is elected to the <Col N="151" /> county council.  I heard Deputy Walsh saying here earlier that the municipal authorities decided unanimously to ask that the period be changed to five years instead of three years.  It is probable that other authorities did likewise, but they certainly did not ask that the present period of three years should be extended for another two years.</P>

      <P>I was not aware that I was out of order.  This Bill is purely and simply designed to prevent the public expressing their views next month in the way they desire.  Dublin County Council was abolished some time ago because there was not a Fianna Fáil majority on it.  The Kerry County Council was also abolished and commissioners were appointed to these two counties.  The position is that when it does not suit Fianna Fáil to have local elections they will, by hook or by crook, have them postponed.  We know that if it were to the advantage of the Government or of Fianna Fáil at the moment to hold these local elections, they would make sure to have them before the end of June and they would bring in proper legislation to ensure that the persons elected at the elections which are due at the end of next month would be elected for five years instead of three. That is not the position now.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to extend for a further two years the period during which persons who were first elected only for three years can continue to hold office.  In the Dublin County Council there are councillors who have not had to seek election since 1948 and this Bill proposes to extend their period of office of such councillors till 1955.  That means that these councillors will have to serve a period of seven years.  Everybody knows the large amount of voluntary work done by the county councils.  Very often the amount of work these councillors have to perform is not appreciated by the general public.  We have the position now where councillors, whether they wish to retire or not, will be forced to continue to discharge this onerous work for a further two years or resign. As some other Deputies have said if a person is elected to serve on a county council, he will serve for the full period and he does not like to resign unless for very urgent reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not easy to resign before the term of office has expired.  The <Col N="156" /> councillor will usually complete the term of office and then will not offer himself for election at a future election if he cannot find time to devote to the work.  That is not the position in which we now find ourselves in consequence of this Bill.  Even at this late stage I think it is only right that the Minister should be asked to withdraw it.  I personally would be very much in favour of the type of legislation described by Deputy Kyne.  I think it would be an admirable type of legislation, and even if this Bill is not designed to cover that aspect, I hope it will be attended to at some future date.</P>

      <P>I am at a loss to understand the reason for the opposition to this measure.  I listened patiently throughout the debate and I have not heard any case made by the Opposition against the proposal to postpone local elections.  I have seen an effort made by the Fine Gael Party to try to force a political election.  All sorts of challenges have been thrown out in connection with these elections.  As a matter of fact, for the last month in this House we have heard practically nothing but challenges about elections. I remember the last local government elections.  Those elections were fought at a time that was very opportune for the Coalition Government to secure a majority on all county councils throughout Ireland.  They had been given a fairly decent opportunity of showing the people what they were prepared to do in the way of local government. What was the result of the elections? The result was that Fianna Fáil got a majority in a number of county councils where they were not in a majority previously.</P>

A number of items were mentioned in the debate in an effort to bolster up the argument against the postponement of the elections.  I heard Deputy Blowick making his contribution, but I challenge Deputy Blowick <Col N="157" /> to say whether one shilling was struck by the Mayo County Council this year by way of provision for an election. The same thing might be said of county councils all over Ireland.  When the question came before the county council in my county everybody was of opinion that a sensible Government must postpone the elections this year for a number of reasons.</P>

Why would it not be popular for them to strike a rate for the elections if they were anxious to have them?  Why would it not be possible for Deputies sitting on the same benches as Deputy Blowick who are members of the Roscommon County Council to strike a rate?  Is this not the greatest piece of bluff that anybody ever listened to in his life?  There is no sincerity at the back of the statements of these people.  It is just bluff. They know that every county council is quite prepared to have these elections postponed for a further two years.</P>

      <P>They were speeches telling county councils what they should do with the Health Bill when it came before them. The Labour Party, who are all out for social services and who stressed the need for social services, supported that policy.  I might tell the Labour Party that so far as the county council which I have the honour to represent is concerned the Health Bill does not mean a snap of my fingers to it.

Because when we took over the affairs of the county council&mdash;a number of us were young councillors then&mdash;we discovered the appalling conditions left by Fine Gael.  We had workers employed in the mental hospital.  We had nurses working in the central hospital 12 and 14 hours per day and the amount of money they were getting would not keep them.  In those days they did not powder their faces to the extent they do to-day but they would not have been able to do even that on <Col N="159" /> the money they were getting at that time.</P>

      <P>The case Labour made against this Bill was a very weak one. None of the Deputies who spoke against the Bill had actually read it. Some moments ago Deputy Rooney made a statement that he could not understand why they were presenting the House with a Bill for this year and not a permanent Bill.  This Bill deals with local elections for all time.  Local elections will be held only every five years after this.  Why did not somebody try and enlighten him to that extent?  Even Deputy O'Higgins who was sitting beside him did not take the trouble to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot to be said in favour of the arguments put forward from this side of the House.  Local authorities have only just got into the run of things.  They have only got into their stride in the way of getting things moving.  We have had huge programmes to face up to.  I remember that at one time we had actually £600,000 worth of buildings on hand and work on those was about to start when an election was called.  There is no use denying that once an election is over there is no such thing as politics in the county councils.  During the election in regard to our county council we hit hard, but once the election is over it is the affairs of the county that worry every councillor <Col N="160" /> elected to that body and we have always proved that.</P>

I do not believe that it is favoured by the existing members of the councils, but, even if it were, that is one very sound reason why such a Bill should not be passed.  What right has a member of any local authority&mdash;he is elected by the people to represent them for three years&mdash;to suggest, as Deputy McCann has suggested to the Minister for Local Government, that a Bill should be passed prolonging his term of office for a period longer than he was elected for?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, as a matter of principle we are opposed to this Bill.  As we have said from this side of the House, it could be conceded that a case may be made for a longer term for county councils.  It may be that the increase and the complexity of the work of the councils necessitate a longer term.  But, even if one were to concede that a good case could be made for that, there certainly is no reason why that should be advanced as a reason for extending the life of existing councils.  We take care in the legislation we pass here, where it may affect the rights and obligations of people outside, to ensure that if something new is being done it will not have retrospective effect.  But here we are providing for an extension of the life of local bodies elected by the people for a fixed term, and we are apparently doing it on no grounds that I can see that can be regarded as substantial. Now, that is the matter of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also, on this side of the House, <Col N="164" /> cannot close our eyes to the very important political aspect of this Bill. It is correct to say, and everybody knows it, that for some 20 years or so, local elections have been fought by the Fianna Fáil Party on political lines. They have time and again endeavoured to gain control of the local bodies. and to use those local bodies as sounding boards for their political propaganda.  Time and again Deputies and people opposed to Fianna Fáil, such as Deputy Cowan, had in the past to fight that particular menace in local elections.  That was in the salad days of Fianna Fáil, when even a jackass with the Fianna Fáil label, had a very good chance of being elected.  Those days, however, are now becoming very quickly part of political history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The jackass has gone over to Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The jackass is sticking to Fianna Fáil.  Here we have a political party, which is facing a very difficult political situation proposing for political reasons to prevent the people giving any, even a mild, sign of their disapproval of their policy.  If the local elections are held&mdash;and I believe they will be, because I am certain that Deputies in this House will reject this Bill&mdash;the Fianna Fáil Party, whatever about other Parties, must contest them on political grounds. Their candidates in every parish and in every electoral area must stand as candidates advocating Fianna Fáil national policy, because due to the manner in which they fought elections in the past they are committed to that particular kind of fight in local elections. Accordingly, the Party managers have realised that they would be making an issue which would be decided against them.  Clear evidence of that will be available in four weeks' time.  The people of Ireland, from Cork to Donegal, are sick and tired of Fianna Fáil and of everything they stand for.  It is for that reason that the Minister for Local Government trotted into this House waving this Bill.  The reason which he advanced for it did not register as a good reason in the mind of any unprejudiced Deputy.  He was sent in here to save <Col N="165" /> the faces of the Fianna Fáil Party and to prevent these elections being held.</P>
      <P>One cannot, of course, dissociate the difficulty of the Fianna Fáil Party, as part of a Coalition Government, from the difficulty that also faces Deputy Cowan, Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll and Deputy Cogan as other splinters of that Coalition Government.  Those three Deputies who have consistently supported the present Coalition Government would be the first hostages, the first victims, to fall before the rain of fire.  Deputy Cowan would have to face portion of his constituents to try and retain his seat as a city father, and I think that he might be spanked as one of the State's bad boys.  That, no doubt, also contributed to his undemocratic decision to prevent the people next month from electing new councils.  The suggestion was also made in the course of the debate that our opposition to this Bill is bluff.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether or not that suggestion was made with any degree of seriousness but there is always a way to call a bluff.  It is open to the Minister to withdraw this Bill.  The members on the Opposition side of this House&mdash;who certainly represent 50 per cent. of the people&mdash;are opposed to this Bill.  If the Minister considers that the Opposition in this House are bluffing then he can call that &ldquo;bluff&rdquo; if he wishes.  He can do so without losing any face and he can hold these elections.  There is a way of testing whether or not it is bluff.  Of course, if the Minister holds these elections he may not have Deputy Cowan, Deputy Cogan and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll.  That is his difficulty but he made it for himself.  Neither he nor any member of his Party can come in here and suggest that the Opposition are bluffing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also suggested that some local bodies have not apparently, made provisions in respect of their rates for the holding of these local elections because they did not think they would be held.  That may or may not be true.  When most local bodies controlled by the Fianna Fáil Party saw <Col N="166" /> the announcement in the spring of this year that local elections would not be held, they breathed a deep sigh of relief.  Another case which was made was that it would be a great saving in the rates.  Boloney.  If this Bill does not pass within the next four weeks, the law of the land provides that these elections must be held.</P>
    <P>No reason has been advanced by the Government which can commend this Bill to the House.  If it is desirable to give councils five years in future, then let us do it and let us start off all local bodies next June, freely elected by the people, with a five-year term ahead.  Let us not, however, sully the legislative record of this House by passing an undemocratic measure merely because it suits the political difficulties of the twin-set which comprises this Government.</P>

      <P>Whatever agreement may be felt in the Dublin Corporation relating to the advisability of postponing these elections, there is a very definite opinion down the country among the people who elected the present county councils that they elected them for a period of three years and that it is not right that we here should decide that what they decided three years ago should be extended from a period of from three to five years.  There seems to be agreement in the House that an extension is needed but it is not right that members elected to local bodies for a shorter period should stay put for another two years.</P>
      <P>One of the best actions of the inter-Party Government was to return to two counties their county councils.  I refer to the counties of Kerry and Dublin.  Local elections were held in the autumn of 1948.  Consequently, when they were held again in the rest of the country these two counties were exempt.  If we pass this Bill we are giving the members of Dublin County Council and the members of the Kerry County Council a period of seven years.  Whatever may be said for not holding those elections when the last general election of county councils took place, surely no case can be made for extending the life of those two county councils to seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> I can recall those elections very well. I remember working in County Kerry side by side with one of the Deputies who, I am sure, will now vote for the extension of this time.  That particular Deputy had to fight his way back into the Kerry County Council against the organised efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He secured election as an inter-Party candidate.  He supports Fianna Fáil to-day.</P>

      <P>Deputy McCann made a speech in support of this measure.  It may be true that in the Dublin Corporation appointments are not made from a political viewpoint but can any Government Deputy make that case in respect of many of the county councils throughout the country?  Let us see what happens throughout the country.  What I am about to say should not be news to the Minister.  After all, the Minister attended a meeting which was held in Longford on Sunday, 22nd February, 1953.  There was a report of that meeting in the <i>Longford Leader</i> of the 28th February, 1953.  In addition to the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare and Deputy Carter were present.  Let us see what that convention decided.  A resolution <Col N="168" /> was passed at that convention by an overwhelming majority calling on the members of the Fianna Fáil Party in Longford County Council to adhere to the undertaking given by them to support Party nominees for public appointments.  One delegate referred to this resolution as &ldquo;the most important on the whole agenda&rdquo; and declared:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Recent appointments on Longford County Council were Blueshirts. Where are our members on the council?  Are they dead or alive?  If they are alive put them out to hell. They should be damned well ashamed of themselves.  I ask you what good was there in our searching for cars and petrol for the local elections? What good were the elections if our own Fianna Fáil interests are turning against us?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the type of thing that goes on throughout the country.  Despite the feeling, no doubt, in the Fianna Fáil organisation that many of these councillors should be removed, it would seem that, quite contrary to the desires of their own organisation, the Government intend to give these people a further two years.  There is no account in the paper that either of the two Ministers or the Parliamentary Secretary made any statement contrary to the views expressed by that delegate and the resolution was passed by an overwhelming majority.  In fact, we have it on record from a member of the Government, Deputy M.J. Kennedy, Parliamentary Secretary, who appeared on the scene with a letter to the <i>Longford Leader</i> of March 21st this year.  I may remark that that paper had published a leading article deploring the passing of that resolution in the presence of two Ministers, a Parliamentary Secretary and a Deputy.  In that letter, Deputy Kennedy said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Your outraged innocence is amusing over the Fianna Fáil Convention in Longford and one would let it pass as that if it were not malicious.  You pride yourself on your accuracy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Conditions to-day in local authorities are such that there is a feeling in the country that the electorate are entitled to record their views of conditions in the local bodies.  By deliberate action of this House we have unloaded on these bodies over the course of the last two years a great incubus.  It is proposed to add to that.  Consequently, we feel that there is considerable interest being taken in the country to-day relating to the incidence of rates and <Col N="171" /> relating to many things such as the abandonment of the Local Authorities (Works) Act in the great employment it was giving and the work it was doing to assist people in producing more goods in the country.  The effect of these things has been considerable, and it is desirable, we claim, that the people would have the right to vote on them&mdash;which they were guaranteed, as the local elections were to be held this year.  We do not for a moment disagree that a case may be made for the extension of the period for which local bodies are appointed, but we feel that should not be done until the elections, which are due shortly, are held.  Then there would be a very definite case to be made, perhaps, for extending the time.</P>
      <P>We are happy to know that such good relations exist in the Dublin Corporation, that there is a feeling that the time should be extended.  That may occur in other places also.  However, as one who is not a member of a local authority, I would say that there are people who are not on these bodies who feel that it is desirable that these elections should take place and if this House decides to give these people a new lease of life we feel it is not acting in a democratic manner.  This Dáil could not extend its own life, for instance, by everyone acting together, on the grounds that it would save the considerable trouble and expense of a general election.  Even if the Dublin Corporation agrees on this matter, that is no reason why we would have the right to put an Act on the Statute Book that the elections shall not be held for two years more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no right to give the local councils an extension of the period for which they were elected.  We on this <Col N="172" /> side of the House went a long way in giving back to a few councils some rights which were taken from them earlier, but we did not give them back for a period of seven years.  We feel that in the case of these councils and elsewhere these elections should be held.  We think the motive behind the postponment is a political one.  There is a marked reluctance on the part of the Government to face the electorate and it is our claim that in the local elections they would suffer a reverse, which would have a very adverse effect on their political future.  It would also be a benefit to those not of their Party but who supports them, to be spared that ordeal.  These unworthy motives are responsible for the introduction of the Bill and we think it is of the utmost necessity that it should not be allowed to pass through this House.</P>
    <P>This Minister has not put forward any logical reason why this Bill should be introduced now, when we are coming towards the time when the elections are due.  Why not hold the elections and then there may be general agreement that the time should be extended? I would make an appeal to the Minister to withdraw this Bill and then we may seek general agreement. At any rate, he should give the general public an opportunity of electing their local representatives, as they have the right to do this year.</P>
