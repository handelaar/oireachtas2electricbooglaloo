      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave in this House on the 19th July, 1951, to a question addressed by him to me on the same subject.  In that reply I stated the general principle, the observance of which is what concerns the Dáil and the public in this matter, that no member of the Government should engage in any activities whatsoever that could reasonably be regarded as interfering, or being incompatible, with the full and proper discharge by him of the duties of his office.  I have satisfied myself that that principle is being observed.</P>

      <P>Has the Taoiseach any information concerning a member of the Government who attends meetings of the board of directors of a particular company with which he is associated and offers advice, assistance and guidance?  While he is in receipt of no salary from the board he attends frequent meetings and offers advice and assistance similar to those which he would offer if he were a director.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I am <Col N="1068" /> sure the Taoiseach has appreciated, asks whether any member of the Government holds any directorship in any company.  Would the Taoiseach reply to that question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have replied to it in the proper sense.  There have been members who held directorships with companies from which they got indefinite leave of absence.  There were a number of directors of that sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether members of the Government who held directorships in various industrial concerns tendered their resignations to their respective companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered everything that was material to the question and I do not propose to say anything further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inquire is this a new principle?  I know when we formed our Government we were told that any directorships we held must forthwith be resigned and that was done.  I understood that that was an inflexible rule from which there could be no departure.  It was so strictly observed that even those who held directorships in private companies resigned them.  I think perhaps that that was a supererogation but I should like to ask the Taoiseach is there a new principle now introduced that a Minister of this State is entitled to retain on any basis a directorship of a commercial company operating here or elsewhere and, if there is, is this a new principle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no new principle.  The principle is the same as that which was enunciated by my predecessor &mdash; the self-same principle, and it is being observed in the same spirit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the quantity of coal mined in Arigna, Castlecomer, Wolfhill and Slieveardagh, the number of men employed in each of the mines during 1952 and the price realised for coal ex-colliery sold during 1952.</P>

      <P>As stated in my reply on 10th June, 1952, to a similar question asked by Deputy James Hickey, the particulars asked for cannot be given since the Statistics Act, 1926, does not permit the disclosure of information about individual concerns without the prior consent of the concerns in question, which has not been given in this case.</P>
      <P>It is provisionally estimated that in 1952 the production of coal by all mines was 179,000 tons and that the average number of wage-earners employed was 1,300.  Definitive figures of total production and employment and particulars of the average price per ton ex-colliery of coal mined in 1952 will not be available until the annual census of industrial production returns for that year have been compiled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>As no separate heading for Welsh anthracite exists in the official import list the information required is not available.  The imports of anthracite coal from Great Britain in the periods in question were 41,653 tons in 1951, 55,722 tons in 1952 and 2,696 tons in January 1953.  It is understood that the great bulk of these imports were from the Welsh coalfields.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that prices are competitive?  That is the most essential point.  When I asked a question before I found that the Irish coal was dearer than the Welsh coal landed at Cork.</P>

      <P>The Government have considered the proposed arrangements for a transatlantic air service in the light of the findings of the United States Civil Aeronautics Board on the provisional agreement between Aer Línte Éireann and Seaboard and Western Airlines Incorporated and, at my suggestion, the two companies have entered into discussions with a view to exploring the matter further.  The arrangements for the visit of the general manager of Aer Línte Éireann to the U.S.A. were made after I had written on the matter to the chairman of the company on the 10th February.  My approval for the visit of the general manager was not required.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce by what company or out of what fund the expenses of the services of personnel and of publicity by advertisement or otherwise have been paid in respect of the proposed transatlantic service, and if he will further state the cost of such services and of such publicity incurred in the period from 1st January, 1952, to 31st January, 1953 (or other convenient <Col N="1073" /> date), and the total portion of such expenses defrayed in dollars.</P>

      <P>The expenses incurred up to the present in connection with the proposed transatlantic air service have been met out of the funds of Aer Rianta.  I understand that these expenses have amounted to about £4,500, of which the dollar expenditure was equivalent to £1,000 approximately.  As far as I am aware, there has not been any expenditure on publicity by advertisement or otherwise.</P>

This would appear to suggest the necessity for improvement in the marketing arrangements and, possibly, in the quality of the product, of those producers who have recently experienced marketing difficulties. Apart from this, however, I understand that anthracite sales generally have not been up to normal for some months past, possibly due to some extent to the fact that consumers generally are operating on stocks accumulated in 1951, when an acute scarcity of this fuel was threatened.</P>
    <P>While I am concerned to ensure that conditions are such as to afford opportunities to Irish mine-owners to maintain maximum employment and output, the marketing of the output of any producer is not one of my functions.  In the belief that a solution for this marketing problem would be found by the combined efforts of the producers and distributors, meetings between them have been arranged through the instrumentality of my Department.  I am satisfied that only in this way can a satisfactory solution be found.  With a view to assisting towards that end I have already taken such steps as are open to me to ensure that anthracite will be imported only in quantities sufficient to bridge the gap between home production and requirements.</P>
    <P>The number of persons employed in Irish coal mines is approximately 1,400.</P>
    <P>I have no information as to the total number employed on a half-time basis.</P>

      <P>In view of the seriousness of the situation which prevails in Wolfhill, County Laois, where a number of very experienced miners have emigrated and where some hundreds of workers are on half-time due to the fact that the company state they cannot dispose of the anthracite, would the Minister specially examine the circumstances surrounding the Wolfhill position?</P>

      <P>If the Minister contemplates action through this committee or otherwise, will he request the committee to examine the question with a view to inquiring into the way in which the anthracite mines in Ireland are making available their coal in the shapes and sizes which are required for the various uses to which it is put?  Welsh anthracite is available in beans, lumps and, as the Minister knows, in a variety of graded sizes.  I believe one serious marketing difficulty in regard to some anthracite supplies in Ireland is the reluctance of the mine-owners to make it available in the various sizes in which it can readily be used in the various types of combustion appliances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> Imports of superphosphates, ground mineral phosphates and compound manures produced or manufactured in countries other than the United Kingdom, Canada and other Commonwealth countries are liable to duty at the rate of 20 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  They are not subject to quantitative restrictions and no licence or permit for importation is therefore required.</P>
    <P>In view of the large stocks of imported superphosphates already in the country, together with the supplies of superphosphates and compound fertilisers available from the Irish factories, licences for the importation of these fertilisers, free of customs duty, are not being granted generally.  I have, however, arranged with the Revenue Commissioners to grant licences authorising the importation, free of duty, of limited quantities of granulated concentrated compound fertilisers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can it conceivably be true, with the Minister for Agriculture storming the country to get farmers to use more fertilisers, with the Tánaiste making speeches about the necessity for increasing agricultural production and with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs presaging a revolution in agriculture, that we are levying an import duty of 20 per cent. on imported superphosphate?</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together and also to avail myself of the opportunity of making a statement in this matter.</P>
      <P>The report of the Civil Service Arbitration Board was presented to-day to Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To give effect to the board's recommendation, in so far as it is applicable to the current financial year, which ends on the 31st of next month, would cost, in respect of the Civil Service alone, an additional £417,000 over and above the cost of the last general increase in Civil Service remuneration, which gave rise to an annual increased charge for the Civil Service of £1,395,000.  The funds to meet this <Col N="1084" /> award were voted by Dáil Éireann on the 13th December, 1951.</P>
    <P>In a full year the additional sum to be provided for out of taxation would be £1,000,000, which would be for the Civil Service alone.  If, however, the general scheme of the award were to be applied to the personnel of other public services or to other classes which are paid in whole or in part by the State, the total additional cost per annum to the taxpayer would be about £2,400,000.</P>
    <P>According to the best advice available to me a deficit of significant size is likely to be shown by the Budget for the financial year which closes on the 31st March next.  Therefore, if immediate effect were to be given to the recommendations of the Civil Service Arbitration Board, it would be the duty of the Government to bring in a Supplementary Budget imposing additional taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided that in present conditions it would not be justified in taking such a step.  Therefore, in accordance with Article 20 (2) (c) of Part IV of the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service, which provides that should the Government &ldquo;consider that it would not be possible, without imposing taxation, to give full effect to the findings within the current financial year&rdquo;, it hereby signifies that it proposes &ldquo;to defer its final decision on the Report until the Budget for the next following year is being framed.&rdquo; Accordingly, no payment will be made in or for the current year on foot of the increases recommended by the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  When the Budget for the forthcoming year is being prepared, further consideration will be given to the board's recommendations and the result of such reconsideration will be announced in the Budget statement.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state what the estimated budgetary deficit in the current financial year will be, and whether this deficit has been occasioned by a short fall in the revenue or an increase in expenditure or a combination of both factors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the Deputy, in reply to a question by him on 12th February, 1953, that it is not the practice to publish revised estimates of receipts and expenditure in the course of a financial year.  I have nothing to add to the recent statement by the Taoiseach regarding the likely outturn of the current Budget in the present financial year except to reaffirm that a significant deficit is in prospect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in a previous reply&mdash; I refer to Question No. 27&mdash;the Minister formed the decision then announced on a statement as to the outturn of the revenue and expenditure, surely he will concede that in the light of that answer there is some duty to the House to give us the information sought in Deputy D. Costello's question so that the minds of Deputies may be informed in regard to the matter on which the Minister has depended in his reply to Question No. 27?</P>

      <P>I must in reply to questions of this sort, bear in mind the manner in which a White Paper on an Estimate presented by me to Dáil Éireann in August, 1951, was misused in this House.  I do not propose to give Deputies a further opportunity of misrepresentation of that sort.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister refer to the fact that he has stated that an estimate has been formed of the outturn of revenue and expenditure, on foot of which the Government have taken their decision with regard to the arbitration award, and that the Government now come to Dáil Éireann and say that it is in the light of that estimate of the outturn that a grave policy decision has been formulated which the Dáil is called upon to accept?  In those special circumstances, does the Minister <Col N="1088" /> not think that an exception might properly be made to the general rule of a forecast along the lines outlined by Deputy Costello?</P>

      <P>I merely say again that, according to the advice which is available to me, a significant deficit will arise on this year's Budget, and that I do not propose to add to that information.  There are many reasons which would render it undesirable, in the public interest, that any precise figure should be disclosed.  The Deputy should be aware of that fact.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that there are over 11,000 more civil servants in the employment of the State at present than there were in 1939, and that most of the extra civil servants were specially taken on during the period of the emergency, to deal with rationing, etc., which is now ended; and, if so, if he will state what steps, if any, he is taking to remove the extra burden on the taxpayer caused by these employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the number of civil servants increased by about 9,800 between January, 1939, and January, 1952, the latest date for which final figures have been prepared. Whilst it is true that extra civil servants were taken on during the period <Col N="1089" /> of the emergency to deal with rationing and the like, the present increase is mainly attributable to another cause, namely, the steady expansion in the services demanded from and provided by the State.  As illustrations, I would give the taking over of the staffs formerly employed by the National Health Insurance Society, the development and extension of the telephone service and the introduction of further schemes for the benefit of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The staffing of the various Government Departments is at all times kept under careful review both by the Department immediately concerned and by my Department.  For some years past special survey arrangements have been in operation which are designed to ensure that the numbers in the Civil Service will be kept at the minimum compatible with efficiency in the services provided.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state approximately how many persons, civil servants and others, have their place of employment within the precincts of Dublin Castle, and whether it is a fact that most of the buildings in which these persons work are unsuitable for use as offices and are expensive to maintain in a healthy and habitable condition because of structural decay and unsoundness; and further, if in view of the growing unemployment amongst those workers who are usually employed on large-scale building works in the city, he will instruct the Commissioners of Public Works to call for tenders for the reconstruction of the unsound and unsuitable buildings in accordance with the plans which it is understood the Fianna Fáil Government instructed the commissioners to prepare so far back as 1946.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>There are at present approximately 1,600 persons, civil servants and others, employed within the precincts of Dublin Castle.</P>
      <P>The buildings comprised in the castle outside the State apartments are, in the main, a heterogeneous collection of early 19th century structures, including a military barracks, coach houses, stables, etc., which have been converted for use as office accommodation. Most of them are unsuitable for use as permanent premises for Government Departments, being expensive to light, heat and maintain in proper condition.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if his attention has been directed to the leading article in a daily newspaper of the 12th February, 1953, and in particular to the paragraph stating that, despite emigration, the number of registered unemployed has increased from 60,000 to 85,000 and that the tragedy behind this appalling figure is that these are people with family responsibilities who cannot get away; and, if so, if he will state to what extent that statement is misleading by giving the percentage of single persons signing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the leading article to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The figures for unemployment used seem to be derived with liberal rounding off from statistics of the numbers on the registers at employment exchanges and branch employment offices at the beginning of November, 1952, and February, 1953. Comparison of these figures for one period of the year with those for another is misleading.  It is impossible to eliminate from them the varying influence of seasonal factors.  Besides, in the present case there occurred during the period considerable changes in legislation affecting the level of registrations which may make such comparison particularly misleading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement in the article that all those registering are persons with family responsibilities is incorrect. <Col N="1101" /> Two analyses were made during January, 1953, into the number of persons listed for payments of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance whose claims were authorised in respect of dependents.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting a question.  Is it not a fact that the percentage which the Parliamentary Secretary has quoted does not include these people who have been wiped out under the Social Welfare Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few are being wiped out under that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> In considering the reasons for the higher live register since the 5th January, 1953, it is important to take into consideration the influence that changes of legislation had on the scale of registration.  But for these changes many persons now registering at employment exchanges would not be signing there as they would not have been entitled to any payment of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>2.  The means test under the Unemployment Assistance Acts was considerably modified by the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  Formerly a person could not obtain a qualification certificate if his means exceeded £39 per annum in a rural area or £52 per annum in an urban area.  Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, a person in a rural area with means up to £72 16s. may now obtain a qualification certificate and a person in an urban area whose means do not exceed £98 16s. per annum may obtain one.  This modification has admitted a large class of persons previously disqualified on the grounds of means such as small landholders and persons in receipt of small pensions and the like.</P>
    <P>3.  In addition to relaxing the means test the Social Welfare Act, 1952, increased the rates of unemployment assistance.  Many persons can now qualify for a higher rate of payment than formerly and there is therefore a greater incentive for them to apply.</P>
    <P>4.  Persons of the following classes, therefore, who would not previously be appearing on the live register as applicants for unemployment assistance are now appearing thereon: (a) persons whose means lay between the old limits and the new limits; (b) persons who previously held qualification certificates showing means equal to or greater than the scheduled rates of assistance appropriate to their class before the rates were increased; (c) persons who held qualification certificates showing rates of means which entitled them to a rate of assistance under the old rates of employment assistance which in their opinion made it not worth their while to apply.</P>

      <P>On a supplementary question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
      <P>5.  Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, men employed in agriculture have for the first time become eligible for unemployment benefit from the 5th January, 1953.  To satisfy the contribution conditions for such benefit contributions paid by them under the National Health Insurance Acts are counted and it only takes 26 such contributions to qualify them.  Furthermore, they are eligible for the same rates of benefit as industrial workers and these rates were considerably increased by the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.  By a transitional arrangement unemployment benefit paid on contributions prior to the 5th January, 1953, are ignored in assessing benefit payable as from that date.  Not only this, but the contributions that are counted to satisfy the contribution condition for unemployment benefit are (as a transitional arrangement) the national health insurance contributions paid for the applicant.  Both of these transitional arrangements mete out very generous treatment to persons who were formerly insured under the Unemployment Insurance or National Health Insurance Acts and have drawn on to the register a number of such persons who would not otherwise have an incentive to register.  If, for example, a man worked for a total of 30 weeks up to September last, then claimed unemployment benefit and received 30 days' benefit, his contributions became exhausted and he could not qualify for further benefit under the old legislation.  By virtue of the transitional arrangements that man is eligible for 156 days' benefit as from the 5th January, 1953.  Furthermore, a man who had not paid more than a few unemployment insurance contributions under the repealed Acts could now qualify for 156 days' unemployment benefit if the number of national <Col N="1104" /> health insurance contributions since his last entry into insurance amounted to 26 (provided his national health insurance had not lapsed).</P>
    <P>7.  It is a new condition for the receipt of unemployment assistance that an applicant must draw any unemployment benefit to which he is entitled before becoming entitled to unemployment assistance.  A large number of persons, therefore, who have become entitled to qualification certificates under the Unemployment Assistance Acts by reason of the relaxation of the means test have also become entitled to unemployment benefit, because of the fact that national health insurance contributions may be counted for unemployment benefit purposes.  In other words a number of persons who previously were not entitled to either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance are now entitled to one or to the other.  It may be added that the changes in the contribution conditions are also very favourable to applicants and that numbers of persons, as already stated, who previously exhausted their rights to unemployment benefit have now on account of changed contribution conditions become entitled to unemployment benefit for 156 days.</P>
    <P>The legislative changes referred to have not only made considerably improved provision for the unemployed but have admitted to benefit numbers who were not previously eligible. Because of these legislative changes, therefore, the present live register is not strictly comparable with the live register a year ago.</P>

Further, will he oblige me and the House by sending a complimentary copy of that statement to the <Col N="1105" /> editor of the <i>Evening Herald</i> so that he may find occasion to publish it and so undo the harm he was trying to do by the unreasonable leading article last week?</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, dependents within the meaning of the Act are confined entirely to the immediate family of the applicant whereas under the previous Acts dependents meant dependents, be they members of the family, brothers or sisters, or no relation at all, so long as they were actively dependent on the applicant?</P>

      <P>Without in the least wishing or desiring to circumscribe the Parliamentary Secretary's right and duty to give information to the House, is it not an abuse of our procedure that a parliamentary question, having elicited a reply, and a supplementary question being thereupon asked the Parliamentary Secretary produces and reads a brief two and a half pages long in reply to what purports to be <Col N="1106" /> merely a supplementary question?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>The period of repayment of any land purchase annuity is subject to variation. Such variation may arise from the consolidation of holdings, the addition of a funding annuity under the Land Act, 1933, or the charging of an additional annuity in repayment of an improvement or reclamation advance.  In regard to annuities set up under the Acts 1881 to 1896, there is the additional complication of the decadal reductions, the acceptance of which extended the normal period of repayment up to 79 years.  Thus, while many annuities set up under the earlier Acts have expired, many other annuities set up at the same time have still some years to run.  In other words, the period of repayment in any case depends on the particular circumstances of that case and, even at this stage, may be subject to future variation.</P>

      <P>This proposal was submitted in May, 1952, and was examined in conjunction with an earlier proposal to raise a loan for the provision of lofts in cottages.  The examination of both proposals has also been related to the condition of many of the older cottages and to the obligation on the local authority to put cottages in proper repair and sanitary condition before vesting.  My views on the results of these investigations will be communicated to the county council in the near future.</P>

      <P>Preliminary plans for the proposed housing scheme at Walkin <Col N="1121" /> Street were submitted to my Department on the 25th September, 1952.  The plans were discussed by an inspector of my Department with the corporation's architect and certain revisions were agreed to.  Amended plans were received in my Department on the 5th December, but on examination it was found that the proposals for the drainage of the site were deficient and that two of the house-plans were unsuitable. The corporation were requested on the 9th instant to forward a plan showing clearly the proposed drainage arrangements and suggestions in regard to two of the house-plans were also made.  I am aware that the Patrick Street scheme has been completed, but I cannot indicate when work will be commenced on the Walkin Street scheme until I receive the corporation's revised proposals.</P>

      <P>By &ldquo;economic price of butter,&rdquo; I presume the Deputy means the price which would enable the average creamery to pay the guaranteed prices for milk without any subvention from the State. The only element of State subvention <Col N="1133" /> now remaining is in respect of the cost of the cold storage of butter, which is met entirely from State funds, and amounts on the average to slightly over ½d. per lb.  The economic price of creamery butter can, therefore, be obtained by adding this figure of ½d. per lb. to the prescribed prices for creamery butter as set out in the Creamery Butter and Butter Boxes Order, 1952, the Roll Butter Order, 1952, and Butter (Maximum Prices) Order, 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the erection of a cream-separating station at Kilgobnet, near Beaufort, County Kerry, was considered by the Dairy Disposals Company on numerous occasions but it was found that such a project was not feasible.  The whole question was recently re-examined by the company following my promise to Deputy Flynn in Dáil Éireann on 23rd October, 1952, that a fresh survey of the Kilgobnet area would be undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, there is a travelling creamery stop at Kilgobnet. The company now informs me that the peak day milk supply to this stop in 1952 was not sufficient to warrant the establishment of a cream-separating station in the district.  Moreover, if the travelling creamery were withdrawn from Kilgobnet, it would not be economic to continue the service for the two other stops, viz:&mdash;Blackstones and Boheeshil, served by this vehicle and the farmers in the two latter districts would thus be deprived of creamery facilities.

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £20,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1953, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain Administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for certain Expenses under the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for Expenses in connection with the issue of Medals, etc.; for Expenses of the Bureau of Military History; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide an additional grant-in-aid of £20,000 during the current financial year for the Irish Red Cross Society.  In the Defence Vote for the present financial year, I have already made provision for a substantial Grant-in-Aid to the society to enable it to carry out its various functions in the normal way.  The recent extensive flooding which, as Deputies are no doubt aware, has <Col N="1146" /> caused wholesale loss of life, devastation and distress in three countries, has, however, already resulted in entirely abnormal demands being made on the society's resources.  While it is understood that two of the three countries involved do not require assistance at present, the third has indicated that it would be glad to receive all possible aid.  The Irish Red Cross Society is already providing that aid to the maximum extent to which its normal resources, supplemented by contributions from the public, permit. It has not, however, the necessary means available to enable it to contribute aid to the extent to which I believe the Irish people would wish. Our people have, I know, been deeply moved by these appalling disasters and the Government feel that it would be their wish and the wish of the Dáil to put the Irish Red Cross Society in a position to make a really worth-while contribution to relieve the distress.</P>
    <P>I, accordingly, ask the Dáil to vote this sum of £20,000.  In doing so, I would like to express this country's hope for the speedy recovery of the countries concerned from the effects of the great flood disasters.  I would also like to take the opportunity, on behalf of the Government and the nation, of thanking the Irish Red Cross Society for its efforts and also of thanking those who have so generously responded to the appeal already made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will find that the House is at one with him in regard to this particular Supplementary Estimate.  I think it is only right that we should join with him in wishing a speedy recovery to those countries which have suffered distress. We are all gratified, indeed, that we have been able to make a contribution to their recovery.  Speaking on behalf of those on this side of the House, I can say quite sincerely to the Minister that he has not only our complete approval but our absolute sympathetic accord in the approach he has made to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He can take it that the attitude of this House generally in that situation of appalling distress and horror visited on these countries is that we feel the <Col N="1147" /> Minister has acted in the best accord with our Irish tradition and that the Irish Red Cross Society has acted in the best accord with their tradition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like just to say a few words in regard to the Estimate. It is when tragedies occur which affect us, as those recent flood tragedies did, that we can see the wonderful value of the Irish Red Cross Society.  It is a voluntary body nationally organised, carrying on under considerable difficulties but, nevertheless, doing a wonderful job of work.  It becomes the medium in cases such as this whereby this nation can show its practical sympathy for other nations in distress.  I think it might go from all sides of the House that it would be our desire that the Irish Red Cross Society should be built up to its maximum strength and that the efficient organisation which is there, particularly in certain parts of the country, should be extended all around and that we should have a society well organised, efficient and capable of handling any tragedy that might occur in the country.</P>
      <P>There are, from time to time, unfortunate incidents and tragedies which affect small numbers of our people.  It is often very difficult to know the right person with whom to get in touch to deal with the situation.  With a wellorganised, well-trained Red Cross I think we would have the ideal organisation to handle situations such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any money voted by this House to the Irish Red Cross Society is, I think, money that will be well spent and that will repay itself many times over.  I take this opportunity of giving expression to these thoughts in regard to the Irish Red Cross Society.  We have seen its value.  We see the need for it.  We see how important it is in the national life.  All the co-operation and help that it requires should be given by this House and should be given, as it is, by the Government.  If the society itself realises how important it is and realises how anxious we in this House are to support, encourage and help it then it will be an incentive to the officers and members of the society to build up <Col N="1148" /> the organisation in such a way that it will be able to handle any difficulty or trouble that may come upon us at any time in the future.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is twofold &mdash; and each is very simple.  The first purpose is to increase the existing statutory limit on advances from the Local Loans Fund from the figure of £50,000,000 to the figure of £70,000,000.  The second purpose of the Bill is to provide for the writing-off of loans which are now regarded as irrecoverable &mdash; one of them dates back, I think, for over 40 years &mdash; and totalling, in all, a little over £5,000.  The need of having that express provision in the statute arises from the fact that the original Local Loans Act of 1935 provided that no advances from the fund should be written off without express statutory authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

In that respect, of course, there could be no opposition from this side of the House.  We can only express the hope that what is <Col N="1149" /> now being made lawful will, in fact, be carried out.  For the past 18 months there has been considerable apprehension in this country with regard to the slowing-down of local authority housing. When this House gives the Minister power to make these increased loans, we hope that that will be followed by greater financial assistance to local authorities in this very necessary and worth-while work of housing our people.</P>

      <P>This is the section under which the writing-off of certain loans will take place.  I think the total amount involved is £5,038.  The first advance was made in 1913 and another in 1920.  Then there was one to Buncrana Harbour Commissioners which was made in 1929 and 1930.  Another advance was also made in 1929.  It is obvious that these amounts are quite irrecoverable and, for that reason, we think they should be written off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Final Stage of this Bill, I do not want to be controversial, but I gathered from the Minister's tone that he could give no guarantee to local authorities that the rate of interest on these loans will remain as it is for any considerable length of time, but rather that the interest rates charged will be governed by the price at which money is available to the Government.  I think it would be necessary at this stage for the Minister to give an assurance to local authorities that the cost of house-building and of public works generally is not going to be increased within the <Col N="1152" /> next few years.  I may have ministerpreted the Minister's remarks when he was replying to Deputy O'Higgins.  I should like to know from him whether his remarks mean that he can give no guarantee that the rates of interest will not be increased in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not, with any sense of responsibility, give that sort of guarantee.  It is not even reasonable to ask for it, any more than it would be reasonable to ask the members of the Labour Party or of the trade unions to give a guarantee that there would be no advance in wages, or than it would be for me to ask building suppliers to guarantee that there would be no advance in the price of building materials.</P>
      <P>The position is that, under the statute, the rate of interest to be charged on advances from the Local Loans Fund will be determined by the cost of Government borrowing.  There is no alternative to that.  It is quite clear, from what I had to say earlier, that the Government could neither contemplate imposing additional taxation nor making good the losses which the fund might sustain if the statutory conditions were not fulfilled. I think it would, certainly, be very imprudent, taking the long view, that the governing provision of the original Act should be amended to enable the Government to make advances from the Local Loans Fund at a lower cost than the provision of capital for the fund would involve the Government in.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that my only reason for asking the question was that the rate of interest on these loans to local authorities has remained very steady for a long time.  Is that not right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say that, under my administration, the rate of interest payable on Government loans fell from 6 per cent. to 3½ per cent. and 3¾ per cent., and that it remained comparatively steady for a long period.  Deputies, however, will realise that we are passing out of that cycle, and that even the Government of the United States <Col N="1153" /> recently had to undertake a funding operation for the success of which it has been compelled to offer 2½ per cent. for five-year loans.  The Government in Canada, similarly, has been compelled to take the same course for a loan which I think it proposes to offer on much more attractive terms. What these countries have not been able to avoid, it is not reasonable, I think, to expect that we should be able to avoid, or that we should expect to do better than they can when it comes to asking the people to lend us money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is just as well that local authorities should now appreciate the effect of the decision by the Government some months ago to float a loan at an unprecedented rate of interest.  It was inevitable, but not recognised, I think, at the time, that the effect of that loan would have a very serious impact on the money market, and particularly in so far as housing and the financing of housing had to depend on Government borrowings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now find that, under the parent statute which will be amended to-day, the Minister is obliged to charge local authorities the prevailing rate of interest in the money market.  By the action of the Minister, and as a result of Government policy, the rate of interest has been raised by close on 2 per cent.  Accordingly, local authorities, in future, will borrow their money in a very dear market, and the tenants of local authority houses will, as a result of the action of the present Minister and Government, have to pay increased rents by reason of the increase in the rate of interest.  Often, the effects of bad actions by a Government are only felt by the people months later.  The delayed action of the financial policy of the present Government is now being felt in many spheres by the people.  Those, in some counties, have had to face, within the last few days, an increase in the rates.  They have had to <Col N="1154" /> experience one delayed effect of the Budget.  Here, to-day, we have another delayed effect becoming apparent as part of the financial policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>We cannot, of course, oppose necessary legislative sanction for the financing of necessary work such as housing, but we do deplore the fact that the rate of interest on housing has been increased by the action of the Government. We point to the fact that one local authority in England &mdash; there may be others &mdash; within the last four weeks was able to borrow money from the public at a rate of interest substantially lower than that which had to be given by the Government of this country.  It may be that the &ldquo;ha'-porth of tar&rdquo; which the Minister referred to some months ago may become a very expensive bit of painting for the tenants of local authority houses, and for the people generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, I think, enables the Government to continue to provide money to local authorities so that they may be able to finance their future operations.  I think that there ought to be no doubt in the mind of any Deputy on the question as to whether or not the Government will continue to make these loans available. Deputy O'Higgins, I think, on the Second Stage mentioned that there was what he called a slowing down of building on the part of local authorities. As a member of a local authority, I cannot see any valid reason for any such slowing down.  The local authority of which I am a member has not done so, and does not contemplate doing so until the work of rehousing the people has been brought to completion.</P>
      <P>That is the policy of the local authority of which I am a member.  I think it should be the policy of all local authorities.  It is absurd to suggest that, in some way or other, the Government is seeking to influence local authorities to slow down building operations.  In my opinion, if there has been any slowing down on the part of local authorities, it is they and they alone who are responsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of local authorities have always complained about delays in sanctioning housing schemes. These delays occurred under every Government &mdash; Fianna Fáil and the inter-Party Government.  I suppose the Department would justify the delays on the ground that they were making everything safe and right and that questions of title and plans had to be carefully examined.  Members of local authorities have always complained about delays but I do not think the position is worse to-day than at any time I, as a local representative, can remember.</P>
      <P>The material is available; labour is available and, under this Bill, money will be available to enable housing authorities to complete the work entrusted to them.  It is not right that anyone should say that in some way housing is being slowed down through Government action.  I am whole-heartedly in favour of any proposition that will bring down the rate of interest, not only on local loans, but on all loans required for development purposes.  I realise that no Government would deliberately seek to increase interest rates.  The Government has to find money by borrowing and has to pay the current rate of interest.  That is the present position.  I am not thoroughly satisfied with that position. I wonder is there not some way by which we could reform our financial system.  I have pressed for investigations. The fact that a farmer who puts his money into the bank will not receive more than 1 per cent. interest whereas a person borrowing from our banking institutions has to pay 5 or 6 per cent. seems to me to constitute a hardship and to create a difficulty with regard to development work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing is development work which is urgently needed but which cannot be expected to produce big dividends. The reward derivable from investment in housing is in the main the interest which the tenant can pay and, as we know, most of the people who are housed by local authorities are in the lower income groups.  It presents a problem to secure a return of the money invested even though the housing operations are subsidised out of general taxation.  I would ask the <Col N="1156" /> Minister if there is any hope that the general rate of interest will come down so that local loans may be made available at a cheaper rate than at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan has said that he does not know that Government action has slowed down housing or that the increase in the loan charges has slowed down housing.  He ought to know.  There is a question on to-day's Order Paper, tabled by Deputy Davin, to ask the Minister for Local Government if he will state when the scheme for the erection of houses in Walkin Street, Kilkenny, was first submitted for the sanction of his Department.  Up to the change in the cost of money, we went from one housing scheme to another in Kilkenny.  When one scheme was nearing completion, the labour went over to develop the next scheme and the tradesmen followed.  In connection with the scheme about which Deputy Davin asked the question to-day, it was the Corporation that got cold feet, not the Government, when they realised what the cost of the new loans would be, and they wondered if the people would be able to afford the 30/-, 25/- and 22/6 houses.  That has definitely slowed down housing in Kilkenny City.</P>
      <P>The position may not be quite so bad in the case of county councils where the rateable valuations are comparatively high and where they can give a bigger subsidy.  In the case of local authorities where valuations are rather small, the increase in the cost of money is a very severe blow, and it has caused a great deal of unemployment in the building trade in Kilkenny.  If Deputy Cogan wonders how it has been slowed down, I can point out how that has been brought about.  I do not do that from a political point of view.  We would all be anxious to see the people housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that he did not know whether it was the cost of money that was slowing down housing schemes or whether it was due to the fact that housing schemes were completed.  I can assure the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach that housing is not nearly completed in Kilkenny.  There <Col N="1157" /> are 300 to 400 people awaiting rehousing, although we have done a great deal of rehousing.  At the present time the factor that is holding up housing is the cost of money.</P>
    <P>Not only members of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or the Labour Party, but members of every Party in Kilkenny at present are wondering whether, if they build the houses, they will be left idle on their hands or whether the rate-payers who are already overburdened should have to carry the additional burden involved in the payment of too high a subsidy from the local rates.</P>
    <P>I know that this Bill has to be passed but I would ask the Minister what will be the rate of interest in connection with future loans.  The Minister mentioned that the rate of interest on every type of loan has increased.  I hope he will not give 5½ per cent. the next time he is issuing a loan.  It was 5 per cent. the last time and if it is 5½ per cent the next time, I do not know what position the country will be in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">

      <P>The reluctance or inability of the Minister for Finance to give any firm guarantee to local authorities that the price of money to them will not be increased in the immediate future will have the effect, whether it is deliberate or otherwise, of curtailing the building of houses.  The local authorities of which I have experience plan in advance and at the present time they are more or less confident that the price of money will not be increased in view of the increases in other directions.  If this one last blow is delivered at the local authorities there will be a severe setback to the drive to provide houses for thousands of families that still need them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the rate of interest to persons borrowing under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act was an additional burden on local authorities because, when prospective builders realised that the price of money would be increased for the purpose of private houses, they decided they could not do it and the result is that the housing of these people is a charge on the local authorities.  The local authorities have <Col N="1158" /> been, and still are, experiencing unusual difficulties in the matter of house-building.  The increases in the cost of material, the increase, incidentally, in the cost of labour, and the different other difficulties have meant that at present they are in a dilemma as far as the house-building programme is concerned.  The cost is one of the big objections to proceeding with the housing drive.</P>
    <P>I do not think any analogy can be drawn between an assurance by trade unions that members will not look for increases and an assurance by the Government to the local authorities that the price of money to them will not be increased.  The provision of houses is a national problem.  It was recognised by the last Government as a national problem, as I hope it is recognised by the present Government. Therefore there should be some effort on the part of the Government to make sure that the price of money for such an essential thing as house-building will not be increased, at least until the programme announced some years ago of 100,000 houses, approximately, for the whole country is finished.</P>

      <P>I am particularly interested in the cost of money for housing. In the City of Cork, for the last seven years, we have been paying each year over £71,000 in interest on money borrowed.  The city accountant last week issued a statement to the corporation that the loan charge for the year was up by £41,482, which means that for the whole year we will be expected to pay £112,000 as interest on money borrowed, mainly for building purposes. Am I to understand that the Local Loans Fund charges to the corporation have increased since 1950-1951?</P>

      <P>To give some evidence of what I have in mind, here is one of many instances.  A young man, who failed to get a house built by the corporation because he has only two children &mdash; we are trying to meet the needs of the people with large families &mdash; wrote to the Cork Corporation last May asking for a site on which to build a house for himself.  On 6th June, he got a reply from the city manager that his application for a site would be filed, but he regretted to say that there was no money available for a loan.  The week before last the man got a letter from the city manager stating that a site was available for him and that if he wished to avail of it he should select it and that he would have to pay a ground rent of £10 a year.  This young man is fearful of the rate of interest he will be charged for the money.  He as well as others are anxious to know if they will have to pay more than 3½ per cent. for the loan from the Local Loans Fund.  Can the Minister say if the present rate of interest will be continued?</P>

      <P>The municipal debt of the City of Cork represents £27 10s. for every man, woman and child. Every child born there has a municipal debt of £27 10s. apart from the national debt.  By asking the people of the City of Cork to pay more than at present in interest they are expected to pay £112,000 for the present year in interest on money borrowed.  That is a matter of which we should take very serious notice.  It is little wonder that the position of the country is as it is when we are faced with that problem.  The Minister tells me that he is not responsible for it and therefore there is no use in wasting the time of the House.</P>

      <P>This debate opened by Deputy O'Higgins stating that the local authorities were not borrowing from the Local Loans Fund at the rate at which they had been borrowing and that therefore housing was being held up.  Let us see what the figures are. The actual issues from the Local Loans Fund for various purposes are as follows.  For the year 1950-51, the amount issued from that fund for housing purposes was £6,461,000.  The actual issue for 1951-52 was £8,994,000; and the estimated issue for 1952-53 is £9,100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for housing only.  So that, so far as this Government are concerned, the local authorities are in fact availing of the Local Loans Fund to an extent 50 per cent. greater than they were in 1950-51, <Col N="1161" /> and we are contributing 50 per cent. more by way of advances from that fund to enable them to tackle the housing problem.  Again, for sanitary services, the actual issue from the fund for 1950-51 was £407,000, and the estimated issue for 1952-53, the current financial year, is £600,000 an increase of nearly 50 per cent.  For county homes, hospitals, and such-like institutions, the amount actually issued in 1950-51 was £91,000.  The estimated issue for this year is £380,000, four times as much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be greater next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be.  The point about it is that that is the fact. Again, if we take vocational education, we have the same sort of story.  A sum of £57,000 was advanced in 1950-51 to local authorities for the purpose of building vocational education schools, and in this year the estimated amount to be advanced is £200,000, or almost four times as much.  Surely these figures are in direct contradiction to the picture which Deputy O'Higgins has put before the House.</P>
      <P>Let me come back now to another aspect of this.  Deputy O'Higgins &mdash; Deputy Crotty appeared to take the same line &mdash; has suggested that there has been a sudden oppressive burden thrust upon the local authorities by reason of the fact that the rate of interest which we have had to pay in order to find the principal for this Local Loans Fund has been increased to 5 per cent.  Of course, Deputies know that the difference between 3½ per cent., which was the rate at which the last Government issued its last loan, and the 5 per cent. &mdash; that is to say, the additional 1½ per cent. &mdash; does not, in fact, fall on the local authorities as far as their housing schemes are concerned. If they are clearing slums the Government takes responsibility for two-thirds of the interest and sinking fund charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But the one-third is still larger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>One-third in the case of ordinary housing schemes but not <Col N="1162" /> in the case of slum clearance schemes. It is perfectly clear that the additional burden which the local authority has to meet is ½ per cent.  In the other case it is 1 per cent., but that is not at all oppressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy Crotty bear with me for a little while?  It cannot be alleged, therefore, that in so far as municipal or local authority housing is concerned the recent increase is anything like as significant as some Deputies have been suggesting both here and elsewhere.  What is the alternative?  It is all very well for Deputy Hickey to talk.  He says we ought to have some other system. Deputy Hickey and apparently some of the Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches now feel there ought to be some other system.</P>

What other way do they suggest?  Is it suggested that we should print bank notes to inflate the currency in order to provide local authorities with money at a lower rate of interest?  Are we to have forced loans from the banks?  Are we to go to the directors and say: <Col N="1163" />&ldquo;It does not matter what ordinary enterprise, or industry or agriculture requires the Government must have its money at something lower than the normal rate of interest.&rdquo;  Is that the policy of the Opposition?  Do the Deputies want us to institute here a system of forced loans or capital levy? Is that the argument?</P>

Is it suggested that we should raise this money upon such terms that one will not be able in so far as the interest paid on it is concerned to recover any part of it in the form of taxation?  Do not forget that if a person here advances money to the Government and the Government pays him 5 per cent. then in the ordinary course of events, when that private individual comes to make his return for income-tax assessment purposes, he will have to return that interest as unearned income and in normal circumstances that money will be taxed at the full standard rate. If the money happens to have been advanced by a company, the company will have to pay roughly 10 per cent. First of all, it will have to pay corporation profits tax on any income derived from that investment and then the ordinary standard rate of income-tax on that income.

      <P>We are not the keepers of the Kilkenny Corporation conscience.  The members of that corporation are put there to manage the affairs of Kilkenny City.  If they feel that conditions are such that additional houses are necessary, surely they ought to be prepared to shoulder their responsibilities in that regard and to discharge them.  If it is essential to provide 50 additional houses in that city surely the Kilkenny people should provide these houses.  On the other hand, if when they look at the situation in a realistic way they come to the conclusion that the housing needs in the city are not after all such that the corporation would be justified in imposing an additional burden on the ratepayers of that city, then I think <Col N="1165" /> the Government is to be congratulated because it is quite clear that it is the Government that brought the members of that corporation up against the realities of the situation, and that body could not, therefore, continue building houses unless such houses were necessary in order to provide the people with proper habitations.</P>
      <P>If the houses are necessary, then they ought to be built.  If they are not necessary, then they ought not to be built.  If they are necessary, then the corporation was wrong in deciding not to build.  It is the responsibility of the corporation and the Government can do no more than it has done in relation to this matter.  It has provided very generous subventions for local authorities carrying out housing programmes. It has taken upon itself the responsibility for raising the money but in order to raise that money it has to make the loans attractive to the general Irish public and it cannot do any more.  There is no use in members suggesting to me it should do any more.</P>

    <P>Is chuige a tugadh isteach an Meastachán Forlíontach comharthachta chun caoi a thabhairt do Dháil Éireann an Vóta i gcóir Gnóthaí Eachtracha a phlé.  Ach, tar éis an Meastachán Forlíontach sin a chur timpeall, tharla <Col N="1167" /> gurbh éigean Meastachán Forlíontach eile a chur timpeall ag moladh £38,500 de mhéadú sa bhfóirdheontas don Ghníomhaireacht Nuachta Eireannach.</P>

    <P>I rith na bliana hathraíodh an caidreamh a bhí againn leis an nGearmáin ó chéim Chonsalachta go céim Taidhleoireachta.  Ina theannta sin bunaíodh caidreamh taidhleoireachta le dhá thír nua, an Tuire agus an Ostair, tríd an ionadaí san Iodáil a chreidiúnú chun na Tuirce agus an t-ionadaí san Eilbhéis a chreidiúnú chun na hOstaire. Taobh amuigh dhíobh sin, ní dearnadh aon athrú i rith na bliana seo caite ar líon iomlán na n-ionadaithe ó ghairm atá ag an Stát ar an gcoigrích.  Tá 19 gcinn d'Oifigí Gairmiúla againn i gcónaí (7 nAmbasadóireacht, 8 Leagáideacht, Ard-Chonsalacht amháin, agus trí Chonsalacht).

    <P>Bhí éileamh mór ar Phasanna i rith na bliann (cé gurbh ísle é, ní nach ionadh, ná mar bhí sa mBliain Naofa, 1950) toise gur chaith níos mó d'ár muintir saoire thar lear i mbliana ná mar chaith aon bhliain eile.  Is lú go mór an méid visa a tugadh ná mar tugtaí sna blianta díreach tar éis an chogaidh, mar gheall ar na comhaontuithe a rinneadh le tíortha eile chun deireadh a chur le visa.  Rud tábhachtach a tharla, an chéad lá d'Aibreán seo caite, gur cuireadh deireadh leis an ngá a bhí, ó aimsir an chogaidh, le doiciméid taistil idir Éire agus an Bhreatain Mhór.  Tá ár n-oifigí thar lear, go háirithe sna Stáit Aontaithe, ag leanacht de sheirbhís luachmhar a thabhairt do shaoránaigh Éireannacha i gcásanna a bhaineas le huachta.</P>
    <P>Ar an taobh eacnamúil dhe is cuid thábhachtach de ghnó na Roinne tráchtáil choigríche na hÉireann a shaothrú.  Caitheann ár dtaidhleoirí uile thar lear a lán dá n-am ag cur onnmhuirithe na hÉireann ar aghaidh sna tíortha ina bhfuilid. Tá Comhaontú Trádála i bhfeidhm faoi láthair idir an tír seo agus dhá thír dhéag.  Tá a lán de na tíortha sin rannpháirteach linn san Eagras um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta san Eoraip.  Is de chineál leanúnach cuid de na Comhaontuithe sin, ach cuid eile, ar a n-áirítear na Comhaontuithe tábhachtacha ato againn leis an nGearmáin, an Fhrainá <Col N="1169" /> agus an Ísiltír, is amhlaidh a déantar as an nua gach bliain iad.</P>
    <P>Is lán-leor mar fhianaise ar fhiúntas na gComhaontuithe sin gur chuireamar i 1952, d'ainneoin an lagadh coiteann a tháinig sa trádáil eadarnáisiúnta le dhá mhí dhéag anuas, luach £5.9 milliún punt d'onnmhuiríthe chun na dtíortha, seachas an Bhreatain Mhór, lena raibh Comhaontuithe Trádála againn.  Níor chuireamar chun na dtíortha sin ach luach 5.3 milliún punt i 1951.</P>

Táthar anois tar éis oifigigh trádála agus fo-oifigigh eile d'Fhoirinn na Roinne seo sna stáit aontaithe, maraon le Rúnaí Cúnta ón gCeannOifig, a thabhairt ar iasacht go lánaimsireach don chomhlucht sin.</P>

Tá eagras amháin, afach, a d'fhás as Cabhair Mharshall, eadhon, an tEagras um Chomhar Eacnamaíochta san Eoraip, ag feidhmiú go bríomhar go fóill.  Tá a coin féin á dhéanamh ag Éire i gcónaí san eagras sin.  Tugann sé caoi an-mhaith do na tíortha is comhaltaí dhe chun na ceisteanna tromaí a scrúdú a thig go sonrach as an Easnamh Dolaeraí atá ann i gcónaí agus chun go bpléifidís na modhanna ar a bhféadhfaí na fadhbanna d'fhuascailt trí chomhbheart.</P>
    <P>Leanann an Roinn dá feasachán seachtainiúil, tuairim 6,500 cóip, d'eisiúint.  Chomh maíth leis sin, eisíonn an Roinn an <i>Six County Newssheet</i> in aghaidh na coicíse. Bíonn ann nuacht &ldquo;suas chun dáta&rdquo; ar chúrsaí sna Sé Chontae agus ar ghníomhachtaí ag cur i gcoinne na Teorann, agus cuirtear é seo timpeall chun daoine a bhfuil suim ghníomach acu sa bhfeachtas i gcoinne na Teorann.

Roimhe seo dhéannadh an Ambasadóireacht i Washington feasachán d'eisiúint, ach tá deireadh leis sin anois agus eisitcar feasachán na Roinne ina ionad.  Maidir le cúrsaí eolais de, sholáthraigh an roinn freagraí ar cheisteanna de gach saghas, a cuireadh chun na Roinne féin agus chun na misiúin thar lear ó eachtrannaigh a raibh suim acu in Éirinn.  I gcomhair le hOifig Eolais an Rialtais agus le Bord Cuartaíochta na hÉireann, fógra Fáilte, Aer Lingus, agus Córas Iompair Éireann, rinneadar deimhin de go bhfaigheadh iriseoirí a tháinig anseo gach deis faid a bhíodar sa tír.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like at the outset to associate myself with the words of welcome uttered by the Minister to the new Apostolic Nuncio to Ireland, Most Rev. Dr. O'Hara.  The Minister was undoubtedly expressing the views of all members of the House <Col N="1171" /> in saying how pleased we are to have him here.  I am certain that he can assure his Excellency that there was a general feeling of satisfaction at the Holy Father's appointment of Most Rev. Dr. O'Hara.</P>
      <P>Likewise, I would like to associate myself with the expression of sympathy and regret which the Minister has expressed in regard to the death of the late American Ambassador, the Honourable Francis Matthews.  He had been all his life a friend of Ireland and had rendered great assistance to the cause of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Frankly, I am rather disappointed at the speech made by the Minister. It is a factual recital merely of the departmental events and certainly it gives no indication of any kind as to what the Government's foreign policy is, if it has any kind of policy.  I think it is a pity that, once a year at least, we could not have a debate or discussion in the House on foreign policy. The practice should be that the Minister, in introducing the Estimate for his Department annually, should give at least a broad outline of the Government's policy in regard to different matters.  It is very difficult for the Opposition to serve any useful or constructive purpose if the Government is silent on its policy in regard to any particular matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot help feeling that possibly the absense of <Col N="1172" /> any indication of policy from the Minister's introductory statement represents the true position of the Government in regard to foreign affairs, that they, in fact, have no policy.  I do not know whether the Minister would agree to elaborate, before the conclusion of the discussion, on what the Government's attitude is with regard to the concept of European co-oper ation on various matters which arise from time to time in the Council of Europe.  I do not know whether the Government has any policy in regard to our relations with regard to the U.S.A. From time to time in the course of the year, I think one could easily detect a tendency to play up to a certain anti-American feeling which was rather vocal from two or three people in this House and also in tain sections of the Press here, an anti-American feeling which seems to have been bred in two somewhat different quarters.  One quarter which was markedly hostile to America was, of course, the normal Communist quarter. The other quarter from which a certain amount of anti-American propaganda emanated seemed to be that quarter which is usually most closely allied to the British viewpoint; this seems to have been an overflow of anti-Americanism which has been rather prevalent in Britain in recent years.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Government or the Minister can have had any sympathy with such anti-American feeling.  Probably any casual references which were made from time to time by Government supporters or members of the Government to this country &ldquo;being put in pawn to a foreign power&rdquo; were probably only made in the heat of debate or in order to score rather petty political points. Nevertheless, having regard to the fact that suggestions of that kind have emanated from time to time from Government supporters or Government allies, it would be well if the Minister would take the opportunity of clearing the air, when replying to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always taken the view that, as regards the foreign policy of this country, it is essential to balance it between Europe, on the one hand, and <Col N="1173" /> America, on the other.  We, in Ireland, are in a unique position in that respect, in that our associations are evenly balanced between Europe and America.  We have received a considerable amount of help in the past from America, where undoubtedly Ireland can wield a considerable amount of influence.  That should be a very potent factor in the development of our foreign policy, but, so far, we have not developed over a long period any consistent foreign policy. I hope it will be possible to develop such a foreign policy, and I should be glad to see the development of such a foreign policy removed from the field of sharp Party politics here.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister would also consider the advisability of making any reference to the propriety or otherwise of certain steps which were publicised in great detail and with great splash in one of this morning's papers&mdash;intended apparently to embarrass the representative of the Holy See here.  I do not know to what extent it is proper for somebody who enjoys the hospitality of this country to seek to create an embarrassing position for the doyen of the diplomatic corps or for our Government.  It may well be that the Minister may consider it better not to say anything in regard to the matter at the moment, but I mention it so that he may have an opportunity, if he cares, to deal with it.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which should be taken up more actively by the Department than it appears to have been, that is, the question of our territorial waters.  The Minister will recall that, during the course of the year, I put down a great many questions to him to draw his attention to the recent decision of the International Court of Justice at The Hague in the dispute over the territorial limits between Britain and Norway.  That decision is one of the utmost importance to us. As soon as the decision of the International Court of Justice at The Hague was announced, the Government of Iceland took immediate action on foot of that decision by extending very substantially the territorial fishing <Col N="1174" /> limits of Iceland.  It does seem extraordinary that, close on 12 months after this decision, our Government is not yet in a position to indicate its attitude to the whole question.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues involved and I agree that they are fairly complex, but the question, by and large, is fairly simple.  It resolves itself into a question of the baseline from which the territorial limits are to be measured.  If the decision of the International Court of Justice at The Hague, as applied by the Icelandic Government, were to be applied to Ireland, it would extend our territorial fishery limits very considerably and, I think, would be of some tremendous assistance to our own fishing industry.</P>
    <P>As I indicated a few moments ago, the Icelandic Government took action immediately on foot of the decision of the International Court.  I have noticed since that various efforts have been made in Britain to try to coerce the Icelandic Government into retreating from the position they had taken up. I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Icelandic Government and people on the stand they have taken in regard to that matter. I feel that everybody in Ireland would welcome an indication by the Minister and by the Government here that they appreciated the attitude of the Icelandic Government in standing for their legal rights despite the attempt that has been made to bully them by coercive economic measures into acquiescence of the British attitude.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to see from the Minister's statement that the development of an export trade to countries other than Britain has been proceeding successfully. I think that there is very often an insufficient realisation in the country to-day that the Department of External Affairs plays an important rôle in the development of an export trade.  Undoubtedly it is of vital importance to the economy of the country that we should develop an export trade to countries other than Britain.  So long as this country is dependent on just one customer, it will be very difficult to secure a proper development of the export trade which <Col N="1175" /> we desire.  I am very glad to note, therefore, that exports to countries other than Britain have increased in the course of the year.  I hope the Minister will never miss an opportunity of starting trade negotiations or entering into trade treaties with other countries with a view to the promotion of foreign trade.  I do not know whether the relations between Córas Tráchtáia and the Department are close.  I hope they are as close as possible because undoubtedly our missions abroad should be of some assistance to Córas Tráchtála in the promotion of trade.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not deal more fully with the question of the news agency as I feel that there is a good deal of misunderstanding, often created deliberately, as to the position of the news agency.  I regard the news agency as a service that is absolutely essential to this country.  Undoubtedly many differences of opinion may exist as to the method of working the news agency and as to the various details but, by and large, I cannot understand any criticism of the news agency on the ground that we have no need for an Irish news agency nor do I understand any criticism which assumes that an Irish news agency has to be more limited in its scope than a foreign news agency.  I hope that in the course of time it will come to be appreciated that Ireland needs a news agency of its own just as much as any other country.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider the possibility of putting into operation at some time the provisions of the Act under which the news agency was set up, which provided for the setting up of an advisory committee, consisting of representatives of the newspapers and the journalists' associations. I do hope that sooner or later, once the news agency is on its feet, it will be possible gradually to hand over control of the news agency to a committee representative of the newspapers and the journalists' associations. Opposition to the formation of the news agency to a certain extent has delayed that process but as soon as the directors of the news agency and the Government can see their way <Col N="1176" /> to do so, I think that they should set up this advisory committee and in that way ensure a greater degree of co-operation between the newspapers, journalists and the news agency.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister did not avail of this occasion even to mention the biggest and most important national problem we have, namely, the Partition of the country.  Last year I think the Taoiseach indicated in the course of the discussion on his Estimate that he thought the matter had been dealt with in the discussion on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs.  This year we are in the position that neither on the Vote for the Taoiseach's Department nor on the Vote for External Affairs has the question of Partition even been mentioned by either the Taoiseach or the Minister for External Affairs.  True, it may be that here again the Minister or the Government have no policy in regard to it.  Even if that be so, I think that the silence of the Taoiseach and of the Minister in this House might easily be misconstrued by representatives of other countries who might consider that that silence was in effect an acquiescence in the position as it stands.  I hope that the Minister may be able to make the Government's attitude on this matter clear when he comes to conclude.  I know it is always unsatisfactory to debate an Estimate a long time after the Estimate has been in fact passed and I suppose that was inevitable this year.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the work which the Department and its officials have done generally.  I know that their work has always been satisfactory and that very often it does not receive the amount of recognition it deserves from the public generally.  A lot of the work performed by the Department may be of a routine nature but I know that the officers of the Department perform their duties with great loyalty to this country and that their work is of the utmost importance to the country.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this Vote last year, I made a number of suggestions to the Minister regarding the raising of the status of some of our consular offices <Col N="1177" /> particularly in Boston and Chicago.  I feel that the position of the consular officers in those posts is not satisfactory. I know that the opinion of the Irish population in those cities is that the status of those posts should be raised.  They are important posts particularly in regard to the development of trade and I urge the Minister as strongly as I can to consider raising these posts to the status of consulates general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one matter on the Estimate introduced by the Minister and that is the substantial increase in respect of the news agency. I agree that there may be certain functions which the news agency can usefully discharge but as I understand the position since the legislation was introduced establishing the news agency undertakings then given by the Minister introducing it as to the scope and the work of the news agency have been departed from and the news agency has extended considerably the scope of its activities.</P>
      <P>During the discussion on the second and subsequent stages of the News Agency Bill in 1949 the Minister on a number of occasions referred to the work which the news agency would do and to the fact that it was not intended to compete with the existing journalists or the existing practice and work which journalists covered: that, in fact, it would confine itself to certain defined spheres of activity, that it was not intended that the news agency would supply what was described as &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news or reports of accidents, crimes, racing, Dáil debates and so forth.</P>
      <P>Since then, I understand that the news agency has supplied on a number of occasions to journalists and newspapers throughout the country reports exceeding the sphere of activity which was outlined when the Bill was being passed here, to such an extent that on a number of occasions the organisations representing the journalists submitted protests against the extension of the activities and referred to the fact no later than December last, in a circular.  I quote:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" />&ldquo;When the Irish News Agency Bill was before the Dáil in 1949, specific assurances were given by the then Minister for External Affairs that the agency would not enter the field of `hot' news, or compete with existing news channels.  Its function would be, according to the Minister, to `put Ireland on the map by supplying to the Press of the world accurate information concerning matters of cultural, trade and general interest calculated to promote tourism, trade and cultural relations'.  The Minister further stated that it was not intended that the news agency should supply reports of accidents, crimes, court trials, stock exchange reports or Dáil reports.</P>
    <P>So far has the agency departed from these objectives that it is now, with the aid of a heavy subsidy from the Exchequer, competing with established journalists by offering news and features to the provincial Press in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want to quote <i>in extenso</i> from newspapers, but I have here a copy of the <i>Tipperary Star</i> of the 25th October, 1952, and there are in that edition numerous quotations dealing with matters varying from photographs of the jumping team to a report that the Walls of Jericho have been discovered.</P>
    <P>I think that these reports, all of which are attributed to the news agency, go far beyond the undertaking which was given to the House when the Bill was passed in 1949.  I think that a question which should be considered is to what extent public money can continue to be spent and certainly spent to an increasing extent on the work of the news agency which in so far as a good deal of its activities are concerned is, in fact, competing directly with the work which journalists through the years and at present are already quite capable of undertaking and which, in fact, covers matters that the news agency was never intended to cover.</P>
    <P>The supply of domestic news to newspapers and the supply of photographs and so on must interfere with <Col N="1179" /> or jeopardise the prospects of Irish journalists and newspaper men.  The fact that the Supplementary Estimate introduced by the Minister proposes an increase of over £18,000 on what was spent on the news agency last year prompts the question whether the House is justified in voting this money for the work that in some respects the news agency is at present doing.</P>
    <P>I need not read out the numerous occasions on which journalists and the journalists' organisations have expressed concern at the extent to which the news agency is interfering with the normal work which these organisations and their members are quite capable of carrying out.  I would like to hear the justification from the Minister for the proposed increase which is substantially above that of last year and which is far above the Estimate originally introduced when the news agency was first established when it was expected that a sum of £25,000 would cover the expenses, allowing for changes in the value of money since which probably would account for some increase in respect of the expenses.  I consider that much of the work which the news agency is now doing should be properly left to the journalists in this country who are making their livelihood in competition with an agency that is subsidised from the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the foreign policy of the present Government is to have no foreign policy.  The present Minister has held the portfolio which he now holds for a period of 18 months, and during that time it has been, as far as I am aware, impossible to get any statement from the Head of the Government of which he is a member, or from any other Minister, as to what the Government's policy is in regard to the many matters which affect a country like ours in the world to-day, and in particular the problem of Partition, which is one of the major aspects of our foreign policy.  We would have thought that on this Supplementary Estimate&mdash;the purpose of which was to give the Government an opportunity of stating its policy on <Col N="1180" /> foreign affairs and to give the Opposition an opportunity of discussing the Government's policy on foreign affairs &mdash;we would have had more than the mere factual statement which we have had this afternoon from the Minister. We are now in the position of not knowing the Government's policy in regard to the problem of Partition, or what its foreign policy is in regard to the many problems which now confront us in our relations with Western Europe on the one hand and America on the other hand.  The country is left in the dark as to what the Government is doing.  No doubt there are certain circumstances when it is a wise policy to do nothing but, either on the question of Partition or on the question of Western Europe.  I do not think that this is a time when the country should do nothing.  Furthermore, the Government should make it amply clear to the country as well as to interested parties outside the country that it is doing nothing&mdash;if that is its policy.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary, when there is so much unanimity in this House on the subject, to stress again the great injustice of Partition.  Probably the only subject on which this House would be in complete accord is the desirability of ending Partition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time we have been in doubt, I think, as to the effective means of ending Partition.  On more than one occasion the present Leader of the Government has asked for a solution which he would be glad to accept if he thought it would be effective. In the summer of 1951 I had occasion to mention in this House what I regarded as a new approach to the problem of Partition.  I should like to reiterate now what I said on the debate on the Estimate for the Department of External Affairs in the summer of 1951.  I do not regard my remarks as containing the complete solution to the ending of this very difficult problem, but I regard the suggestions as the logical outcome of what are now regarded&mdash;certainly by the vast majority of the representatives of the people in this Dáil&mdash;as our relations between the Northern Government and the Government of this part of the country.  They are the <Col N="1181" /> logical conclusion of the fact that, probably without exception, the vast majority of Deputies in this House are of opinion that the use of force to end Partition would be neither effective nor desirable.  Following from the fact that this Government, like their predecessors, had occasion, several times, to co-operate actively with the Northern Government in works of common interest to the two Governments, I presume that we have now got into a position&mdash;whilst never relaxing our demand that this injustice should be got rid of and whilst never relaxing the legitimate pressure we can bring to bear on the outside world to see that that injustice is remedied&mdash;where we have recognised the <i>de facto</i> Government of Northern Ireland.  From the co-operation that took place between the two Governments a few times in the past three or four years on matters of common interest, nothing but good has flowed.  From the comments in the Press on both sides of the Border it would appear that even the most bigoted Orangeman and the most extreme Nationalist have been prepared to admit that good can flow from co-operation on an economic level between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>The logical outcome of the <i>de facto</i> recognition of the Northern Government and of the co-operation which we have had between the two Governments in the past is that we should now endeavour to bring about a much more complete economic co-operation between the two parts of the country for our mutual benefit.  I can see no reason why, in endeavouring to bring about that economic co-operation between the two countries, the two Governments should not exchange commercial representatives.  I can see no reason why&mdash;given active co-operation between the two Governments&mdash; we could not build up a customs union between the two parts of the country. I have examined the problem fairly carefully and I do not think there is any legal difficulty in bringing about a customs union between the northern and southern parts of our country.  To my mind the difficulties are merely administrative difficulties and can be overcome.  I feel that immense good <Col N="1182" /> could be achieved by co-operation between the two Governments and that, to a large extent, we could overcome the fear and prejudice which, to my mind, is at the present time the greatest barrier to the Irishmen who live in the northern part of our country joining with their fellowIrishmen in the rest of the island.  I feel that that economic co-operation could be fruitful and beneficial.  I can see no reason why, for example, in the administration of justice, certain very simple matters could not be fixed up between the two Governments which would greatly facilitate the working of the courts on either side of the Border.  For example, it would appear to me to be a comparatively simple thing to reach agreement between the two Governments that, for each Government, the other part of the country would not be treated as a country outside the jurisdiction and that it would not be necessary to apply to the courts to serve writs out of the jurisdiction in the way in which both parts of the country have to do now if writs are to be issued against residents in the other part of the country.</P>
    <P>Similarly, for the execution of judgments, it would be a comparatively simple matter to reach agreement by which judgments could be registered in both parts of the country.  To my mind, all that would be comparatively insignificant, but it would be none the less an important development in the co-operation between the two parts of the country.  It is only an example of what could be done if the two Governments were to get together and try to frame a common policy in respect of the many matters in which their interests coincide.  As I have said, it does appear that the co-operation which we have had up to now has been welcomed on both sides of the Border, and all that I am suggesting is a logical development of what has been done in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no comment in his speech on the problem of Partition. He likewise made no comment on Ireland's rôle in the Council of Europe or on Ireland's present position in the many diverse happenings in the politics of Western Europe, of which we <Col N="1183" /> are very much a part.  The relationship between the six countries which form the Coal and Steel Pact and the European countries which are members of the Council of Europe, has raised a very vital issue in the Council of Europe since the autumn of last year; but we have heard no Government statement as to what the Government's attitude is towards the present move among these six countries of Europe which are members of the Coal and Steel Pact as regards a greater integration of their economies and of their political structures.  We have had no indication of our position, which must be shared by other countries in the Council of Europe, in regard to the setting up of a political authority, if such a political authority is set up as a result of the negotiations which are now in progress.</P>
    <P>I feel that our contribution in the Council of Europe has been a very feeble one indeed.  I think that Ireland has a very important rôle to play in the politics of Western Europe, and I do not think that we have been fulfilling our responsibilities in that regard.</P>
    <P>Being a small country, we do not perhaps play a very dominant rôle when it comes to questions of armaments or of supplies, but none the less I think it is quite clear that our position&mdash;we are a predominantly Christian country in many ways enshrining in our way of life the whole of the principles which the countries of Western Europe are now trying by various methods to uphold&mdash;could have a much greater influence than our size and physical resources would appear to justify.  I think that one of the reasons for the failure and the poor showing which we have made in the Council of Europe has been due to this, that the present Government has given no clear indication to its delegates or to the country.  It has not given any lead by which our delegates in the Council of Europe would know what rôle Ireland has to play in regard to the many matters which arise for vital discussion there.</P>
    <P>In case it is alleged that I am in any way warm on this when I stress the importance of playing a greater rôle <Col N="1184" /> in Western Europe, I should like to say that I am in agreement with the present Government's policy, the policy of its predecessors in office of remaining out of the N.A.T.O.  I do want to say, however, that this country has a greater rôle to play in the building up of the spiritual resources which are the backbone of Western Europe at the present time.  These spiritual resources require such a building up if the whole fabric which the statesmen of Western Europe are now trying to erect is not to topple.</P>
    <P>I think that we cannot escape our responsibilities in Western Europe, nor can we hide from the duties which have been imposed upon us in regard to the rôle which Western Europe is to play in the politics of the present day.  I think that, whether we like it or not, no country can be an island apart in itself, and that whether we like it or not, we are part of the mainland.  I should like to hear the Minister, if not at the conclusion of this debate, at any rate in the near future, endeavour to bring to the notice of the Dáil and country what the Government's attitude is to these many problems which are now facing the statesmen of Western Europe, and the solution of which is so vital to the very existence of our State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would be somewhat optimistic if I were to say that the views which have just been expressed by Deputy D. Costello would be accepted by the Minister.  I would be very much surprised if they were, because I do not think that they are in accordance with the views which the Minister has expressed in regard to the handling of the question of Partition. Neither do I think that the views expressed by Deputy D. Costello were very much in accord with the statement of the former Taoiseach, Deputy J.A. Costello, when he expressed the view that the way to deal with Partition was &ldquo;to hit England in her pride, her prestige and her pocket.&rdquo; Deputy D. Costello has suggested a more reasonable approach, if you like, than that to this question, an approach based on mutual goodwill and compromise. I think that his views are more in accordance with the views <Col N="1185" /> which I have always held on this question than they are with the views either of the present Government or of its immediate predecessors.</P>
      <P>I believe that we should aim at securing a greater measure of accord with the existing Government in the Six Counties.  We may not accept, we must not accept and should not accept, that that State was legitimately formed, and must not abate our claims in regard to the injustice which was perpetrated on this nation when the Six Counties were carved out of the nation and set up as a State, Six Counties which could not on historical, geographical, economic or any other grounds claim the right to be set up as a separate State.</P>
      <P>One cannot ignore facts of history. It is a fact of history that a State has been in existence in the North East of this country for over a quarter of a century.  Common sense suggests that an approach based on goodwill and mutual understanding would be more likely to achieve results than one based on force or hostility.  That is my personal view and it is shared by a considerable number of people in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that discussions in regard to economic matters such as transport, hydro-electric development and other matters of that kind did a considerable amount of good, and helped to remove some of the hostility and misunderstanding which existed between us and the Six County State. We should go further.  Deputy Costello suggested the possibility of a customs union.  He seemed to suggest that there were no serious difficulties in that regard.  I am not so sure about that. While the Six Counties enjoy or endure their present status in relation to Great Britain the establishment of a customs union would be rather difficult. The people of the Irish Republic and, perhaps, the Government, whether officially or otherwise, should encourage the people of the Six Counties to achieve a greater measure of independence than they have at present in relation to Great Britain.  It would be desirable that the Six Counties should separate from Great Britain, at least <Col N="1186" /> to the extent of having complete control of their own fiscal policy, complete control of customs and excise and complete control of defence.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest steps towards the reunification of this historic nation would be the establishment of a unified defence force for the entire nation.  If we could secure agreement with the Government of the Six Counties that the armed forces within the island nation of Ireland would be, even for a time, under the joint control of the Government of the Six Counties and the Government of the Irish Republic, it would be a step forward and one which, in the present world situation, might be favoured by more powerful nations in Western Europe.</P>
    <P>It is all right to talk about strengthening the spiritual and economic forces of Western Europe but it would represent a very big step forward if we could integrate to a certain extent control of the economic and military affairs of this Island nation.  It would not be any harm if the Government of the Irish Republic and the Government of the Six Counties were to meet in round table conference to discuss these matters in a realistic way.  It may be that neither side is prepared at the moment to abandon the position which they have always upheld.</P>
    <P>We have to deal not only with the past, but with the future, and the future is far more important.  If an understanding could be arrived at in regard to economic matters, control of imports and exports of the entire island and, in regard to defence, for the common defence of the whole island, it would be a very big step towards the ultimate complete reunification of the nation.</P>
    <P>Many people would feel that an approach along those lines would be somewhat revolutionary, but we must face the fact that a Government has existed in Belfast for over 25 years and, while there may not have been any historical foundation for the establishment of that Government and that State 30 years ago, its existence over that period of years creates a fact of history and an actuality which cannot be ignored and which it may <Col N="1187" /> be just as well to recognise, just as we have recognised the existence of that Government in dealing with transport, hydro-electric development and other economic matters.  I hope there will be a new approach to this question, that we will not follow stereotyped lines, that we will deal with it as a practical issue in a practical way.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that the Irish News Agency should not have been established and that it should be wound up as soon as possible.  I do not think it can serve a very far reaching purpose in regard to the strengthening of this nation's position from a publicity propaganda point of view.  If it is to function as a business concern, it ought to function without State aid of any kind.  Ordinary journalists cannot be expected to compete with an institution or agency which is financed by the general taxpayer.  The Minister should let us know the intention of the Government in regard to that agency. It is unfair that a business organisation which competes with ordinary journalists in their endeavour to earn a living should have behind it the backing of State finances.  If the Minister were to say that he hopes that in a very short time this news agency will no longer require State aid it might be possible to justify its position.</P>
    <P>The position, however, appears to be that from year to year provision has to be made to assist this news agency. That should not be the case in regard to any business concern which is competing with other people who are not in any way aided or assisted by the general taxpayer, but as a matter of fact have to pay the taxes.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister referred to the service which his Department through his agents in other countries is giving to our citizens abroad.  I hope that that service is fully appreciated by our people, because it not only helps Irish citizens in other countries in dealing with other Governments, but it also helps to promote trade with other nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Opposition will appreciate that last <Col N="1188" /> year the Minister stated he would endeavour to give this news agency a fair crack.  It is good to see that they are now coming round, especially Deputy MacBride, to his way of thinking&mdash;that he is giving them a fair crack.  I want to know, however, how long this is to continue.  Is there to be any limit to this assistance to the Irish News Agency, or are we to continue to pour money into it year after year?  In the normal way if you are giving something a trial, you fix a limit of two, three or five years.  I should like to hear from the Minister if he has anything in mind in regard to fixing a limit for this news agency.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this news agency is competing with the ordinary working journalist.  I think that a news agency subsidised by the State should not be competing against the ordinary journalist.  I know that representatives of this news agency seek interviews with people connected with the sporting world with regard to some team coming here, say, from Chicago or going to Chicago.  I do not see what that has got to do with an Irish news agency or that it will help the propaganda in regard to Partition in any way.  I have been approached several times to give interviews by representatives of this news agency in connection with teams travelling to other countries or teams coming here.  I have always refused, because I am used to dealing with the sporting journalists of the three national papers.  I know these gentlemen, and I am satisfied that they are first-class journalists.  Anything I have to say I give to these journalists because they are earning a living here on Irish newspapers.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any Government subsidy to Reuter's or any other news agency except the Irish News Agency.  I think that this news agency was established to help to publicise the injustice of Partition. What have sporting events here got to do with Partition?  I know that our sportsmen are very great ambassadors, but I cannot see why representatives of this agency should look for interviews when we have local men quite fit to cover any sporting events. It may be claimed that the Irish News Agency is giving work to Irish journalists. We appreciate that.  It is well known through the world that Irish journalists are first-class men.  Their record in London alone is first-class, as there have been many great Irish journalists in Fleet Street.  We can be proud of our Irish journalists.  The fact that they are employed by the Irish News Agency is a good thing to a certain extent, but at the same time it is not right that they should be competing with the ordinary working journalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to Partition. I think he was not stating the case of the Fine Gael Party.  It was like what you would hear at a technical school debate or some university debate.  The policy of Fianna Fáil has always been that Partition is a great injustice to this country and at every possible opportunity, whether abroad or elsewhere, our Ministers bring up this question of Partition.  We are not sitting on it by any means.  The Minister and the Taoiseach have dealt with it before and I am sure that they will deal with any question that comes up <Col N="1190" /> here.  I do not think that what Deputy Costello said to-day will give a great deal of help.  Our Ministers know the facts and at every opportunity they get they certainly will bring it up.  We look upon Partition as a real injustice inflicted upon us by the British Government. I will conclude on the note that I do not think it is right that this subsidised news agency should encroach on the work of Irish journalists. I think it is unfair.  The Minister said last year that he was giving it a trial and I should like to know how long that trial will last&mdash;will it be one year or five years?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister to curtail the activities of the Irish News Agency to such an extent that it will not interfere with the ordinary work of Irish journalists, that it will not disseminate what has been described as &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news or news such as was described by Deputy Cosgrave.  As against what Deputy Gallagher has said, whatever opinion the Minister may form of the activities of the news agency in its approach, I would strongly appeal to him to have an Irish news agency.  If he is not satisfied that it is operated properly, I ask him to continue it and to review its activities, because I believe that there is and will be for a long time to come a place for such a news agency in this country as so many news items and stories are disseminated from this country to Great Britain and other countries in the world which are utterly distorted and do irreparable harm to this country and its people.  Anybody who takes up some of the British Sunday newspapers and sees the type of Irish news or stories printed and circulated by these newspapers will readily appreciate why we should have some type of watchdog on the injurious type of propaganda that is circulated in these newspapers. If they were there even for the purpose of contradicting or correcting some of the stories published, I think they would be serving a very useful purpose. The seriousness of the matter was brought home to me by a friend of mine in Switzerland.  An account was published in the Swiss newspapers of the shocking treatment meted out <Col N="1191" /> to horses exported from this country. That account was accompanied by photoghaphs.  I do not wish to enter into the controversy circling around the exportation of horses but I do not believe that the reports carried by these Swiss papers were entirely accurate to say the least of it.</P>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Gallagher's sincerity but, with all due respect, I do not think he gave us Fianna Fáil policy as far as Partition is concerned.  He gave us the Fianna Fáil attitude to Partition.  I believe that that attitude is sincere but it cannot be described as policy merely to recognise the injustice of Partition and be determined to ventilate it here and elsewhere.  All of us are at one in our determination to end Partition.  As a nation I do not believe we have taken all the steps that could be taken to enlist the aid of people who could help us to solve this problem.</P>
      <P>It is quite obvious that any approach, however friendly, to the Six County Government must end in complete failure.  It is quite obvious that no matter what Government is in power in Great Britain&mdash;be it Labour, Conservative, Liberal or a combination of any two or three Parties&mdash;any approach made to it will not bear fruit as we know from experience.  The Government of England invariably looks upon the Six Counties as an out-post of the Empire.  It is one of their colonies, or possessions, of which they are fairly sure at a time when their colonies are fast dwindling and their Empire is growing smaller day by day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we have attempted to enlist the aid that undoubtedly does exist in the U.S.A. in so far as Partition is concerned.  Deputy Costello said we had made a very poor showing in the Council of Europe and that we have not been fulfilling our responsibilities in relation to the problems that confront Western Europe.  I admit that is unfortunate but our approach to these external problems will always be overshadowed by the problem of our own partition. We do not feel enthusiastic about the problems confronting Western Europe. The delegates at the Council of Europe <Col N="1192" /> can scarcely be described as enthusiastic about the problems of other countries when we know from our own experience that they do not show any degree of interest in the problem confronting us.  In most countries we seem to be regarded with a certain amount of suspicion and a certain amount of distrust because of the attitude we maintain with regard to the N.A.T.O. and to other military treaties or agreements into which some of the countries of Western Europe have entered.  We are regarded as a nation that will not play ball.  We know the reason for that.  We also know the truth.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for External Affairs has proclaimed our attitude towards the N.A.T.O., as did his predecessor, Deputy MacBride, on several occasions.  Our attitude towards N.A.T.O. and our explanation for our neutrality must be properly publicised.  Anybody who has travelled in Great Britain or had contact with Americans and people from other English speaking nations knows that immediately Ireland's problem is mentioned our position in the last war is raised and one is asked: &ldquo;Were you not neutral in the last war?  Are not you the nation that will not co-operate to defend Western Europe?&rdquo; Our attitude on these matters must be properly publicised time and time again so that other countries will appreciate our viewpoint with regard to the peace and security of the world in general.</P>
    <P>It would appear that any approach to the Government of the Six Counties must prove abortive.  It would be useless to approach any Government in Great Britain.  Therefore, if we are to have the aid of another world power in our efforts to solve Partition that power would have to be the U.S.A. America has had an influence and will continue to have an influence on British foreign policy for many years to come.  By wielding her influence in the past she has forced the British Government to do things that she would not do in the ordinary course of events.  Before we can achieve the aid of the U.S.A. we will have to co-ordinate the activities of the Irish people in the U.S.A.  A big percentage <Col N="1193" /> of the Irish in America consists of St. Patrick's Day Irishmen.  Their fathers and mothers, their grandfathers or their grandmothers came from Ireland and they have a sentimental regard for this country.  They are, however, Americans first and Irishmen afterwards.  That is quite understandable and we do not want them to be Irishmen first and Americans afterwards. America is the country of their birth.  They are her citizens but they are willing to aid this country and willing to endeavour to bring pressure on their public representatives.  The difficulty is that there are so many Irish societies in the U.S.A. that they are pulling against one another.  There is no unanimity amongst them as to the best methods to be adopted in influencing public opinion or public representatives.</P>
    <P>Were it not for our own representatives in the U.S.A. those of us visiting the country and meeting the different Irish societies there would come back not knowing what the attitude of the Irish in America is towards the solution of our problem of Partition. If the Minister endeavoured to coordinate the activities of these organisations we would be much more successful in enlisting the aid of the U.S.A. as a whole in the solution of our problem.  It is extraordinary to discover the different ideas people in the U.S.A. have with regard to Partition.  They, too, must be educated.</P>
    <P>I met a prominent Congressman from the U.S.A. on one occasion.  He told me that he had been in Ireland, had visited almost every county and was satisfied&mdash;I did not believe this, and I told him so&mdash;that the people in the Border counties did not want to see a solution to the Partition problem.  That is untrue, and the people in the Border counties, especially, know that it is untrue, but is it not a ghastly state of affairs to say that a Congressman from the U.S.A., with a well-sounding Irish name, should believe that traders around the Border of the Twenty-Six Counties and Six Counties do not want a solution to the Partition problem?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;have no interest in the Border traffic to which my Congressman friend referred.  There is one deliberate attitude in the U.S.A., as there is in other countries, that the Partition problem is a religious problem. If we do not take steps to correct that opinion, if we do not take steps to demonstrate that these two opinions which I mentioned are untrue, I do not think we can do the good we undoubtedly could do if we could educate the Irish people in the U.S.A.</P>
      <P>I want to say this to the Minister or to any man who may come after him as Minister for External Affairs and is engaged on this particular problem of Partition, that in a very short time the Irish influence in America will be substantially weaker. Anybody who knows anything of the U.S.A.&mdash;I do not claim to know much about it&mdash;knows that the influence of the Irish&mdash;and their influence was very big up to some years ago&mdash;is diminishing at the present time and diminishing rapidly.  It is true there are many public representatives in Congress and in the Senate with Irish names.  There is a big percentage of what we regard as Irishmen in these two bodies but their influence is dwindling and unless we avail of the influence they now have we will have lost a big opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another angle that was put to me with regard to the efforts of Irish associations in the U.S.A. to influence public opinion.  I was told that some of these societies or some of these individuals were more interested in the sale of Irish hospital sweep tickets than they were in Partition, that they gave their support to Congressmen or Senators who would see that the sale of these hospital sweep tickets was not interfered with.  I do not know what goes on with some of the Irish societies in America but if such allegations are true, that the Irish societies over there mix up their hospital sweepstake <Col N="1195" /> tickets with the problem of Partition, there is little hope of achieving anything over there.</P>
    <P>However, I make this appeal to the Minister to make an effort at co-ordinating the activities of these Irish societies, to try to stop the bickering that undoubtedly goes on between them and to try to have one big Irish society that will have some influence with the Government of the U.S.A., which, I believe, in turn, can have a big influence with Great Britain towards the solution of the Partition problem.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with the Minister in welcoming the Papal Nuncio, Most Reverend Dr. O'Hara, and in wishing him a very happy period in this country.  In that regard I would like to refer to what all of us must have seen with amazement in this morning's papers, a petition filed with the United States Embassy by an American citizen which sought to deprive the Nuncio of his American citizenship.  I do not know whether it would be correct or proper to deal with that particular aspect at the moment, but I would like, if the Minister would make a statement.</P>

      <P>The second matter to which I want to refer is the remarkable silence on the question of Partition in the Minister's statement.  I think that it is the first time since I came to this House in 1943&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a remarkable thing that in this particular Estimate for External Affairs not one single word in the Minister's statement refers to the question of Partition.  I think it is the question that must be uppermost in all our minds, no matter what political affiliations we may hold. Every Irishman and woman would like to see the unification of the country accomplished as soon as possible, and it is an extraordinary thing that the Minister's statement does not refer to what must be the one outstanding national problem at the present time.</P>
      <P>One Fianna Fáil Deputy who spoke about Partition must have been keenly conscious of the Minister's absolute apathy towards this whole question; he glossed over it by saying that Deputies, both on this side of the House as well as on his own side, could safely leave it in the hands of the Minister for External Affairs and the Taoiseach.  That is an extraordinary attitude for any Deputy to take.  Surely the Deputies behind the Government do not believe that once they are elected they can calmly go to sleep.  I want to remind that particular Deputy that if he has completely sold himself out to the Government in that way and is content to regard himself merely as a pair of feet to walk into a lobby to vote he is not fulfilling his duty as a Deputy, and I am sure that all Deputies on this side of the House will agree with me.  It is the duty of a Deputy backing the Government to see that such an important matter as Partition should not be treated in the slighting manner in which it was treated this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember during the three-and-a-half-years' period that the inter-Party Government was in office, Deputy Aiken, as he then was, did not spend three months of his time in the country but went flying all over the globe. Apparently he was trying to solve Partition when he went out of office and knew he could not do it.  Now, when this Department is in his hands where he can do most good to bring the injustice <Col N="1197" /> of Partition before the peoples of the world, he does not say a single word about it in introducing this Estimate. I cannot find words to express my amazement at such conduct and I want to tell Fianna Fáil Deputies that, if they are backing that policy of letting things continue from year to year, that is not their duty as Deputies backing the Government.  If Deputy Gallagher has given a picture of the attitude of Deputies behind the Government at present&mdash;that it is all right to leave everything in the hands of the Taoiseach and the Government, and if they fail to do anything it does not matter, that their only duty is to walk into the Government Lobby on divisions and congratulate them no matter what is brought to the House&mdash; that, I say, is not the duty of any Deputy.  It is new to me if that is the outlook of Fianna Fáil Deputies regarding Partition.</P>
    <P>There appear to be only two methods of attempting a solution.  One, force, is out of the question.  The other, which is the correct course, is to bring it to the notice of every free country in the world, particularly the U.S.A. We should combat to the best of our ability any false propaganda, particularly that which is being spread in the U.S.A. that the question is one of a difference of religion more than anything else.  It is within the Minister's scope to deal with that.  If he is doing anything about it, he might have told us.  He does not suffer from bashfulness and does not hide his light under a bushel.  I hope that, when replying, he will not preserve the stony silence which characterised his introduction of the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Regarding emigration, the identity cards and passports provided a means some time ago of keeping a check, but they have been abolished in practically all cases.  While I do not want them to return, the Department should take some steps to keep a check, so that we would know exactly how the tide of our youth is flowing.  In reply to parliamentary questions here from time to time, the Department or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach will inform a Deputy that there is no means of knowing the <Col N="1198" /> actual number who left the country to seek employment abroad or how many came back.  While it would be undesirable to introduce any system which would oblige intending emigrants or migrants to take out travel identity cards, the Department should have some system by which we could see how many of our youth are leaving each year and how many come back, so that we may have at least an idea of the net outflow per year.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;What does it matter whether it is 10,000 or 20,000 that go in a year?  If they go, they go.&rdquo;  We should know the figure, either through the Central Statistics Office or the Taoiseach's Department or the Department of External Affairs.  There is no use in saying we have no means of keeping a check.  The Minister must have some means of doing it.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not advocating a travel identity card system or passport system for this. They were a nuisance while they lasted and caused much annoyance and trouble to people going on business or going to work in England.  The Department should be able to devise some suitable machinery to provide the information.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, when replying, to say what steps have been taken to develop trade with foreign countries where we have representatives and particularly with the U.S.A. I have a keen interest in the dead meat trade, which has come into such prominence in the last few years.  The Minister should see that it is developed to its fullest, particularly in the U.S.A., where it would be a dollar earner.  I should also like to know, if he has the figures convenient, our trade with some of the principal countries and also what negotiations are under way to expand the dead meat trade and other trades of interest to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to speak this evening, but when I heard the last two speakers misrepresenting facts, I thought I might as well say a few words.  I am sorry Deputy Mac Fheórais dealt with the Irish societies as he did, as I feel they did a good deal for Ireland in her <Col N="1199" /> darkest days.  All Irish societies, no matter what differences they may have had, have pulled and are pulling their weight to bring about the ending of Partition.  I am sorry this House has been used to accuse them of unworthy motives.  Down through the ages the Irish abroad, just like the Irish at home, have done their best.  Like all human beings, people will differ on parish committees and so on, but the fundamental principle of the Irish societies abroad has been and will be, I am sure, to do everything possible to see that this country becomes united.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker had asked what was the policy of the Government. Our policy is well known, and we have let no opportunity pass of making it clear.  Since he took office as Minister for External Affairs, the Minister had lost no opportunity of letting every friendly nation in the world know about Partition and the injustice perpetrated on this country by Partition.  If any other Minister could do more than the present Minister to bring about the unity of the country, I do not know where he is.  As an Ulsterman, the Minister has given a good deal of his time to seeking to bring about the unification of the country, and he will continue to do so so long as he is Minister.  The Taoiseach and his Government have gone as far as they can go to show that we, in the Twenty-Six Counties, bear malice towards no man, but charity towards all.  They have seen to it that all people, no matter what their beliefs, get the same fair and square deal, and those people, dangerous people who claim to be Irish, who have on occasions misrepresented us as being partisan, have not been friends of Ireland, and a future historian would mark them down as mischiefmakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Partition is a national matter. Opposition speakers have tried to suggest that it is a Party issue here, but it is not.  It is a completely national issue, and I am sure there is no Deputy on any side who would not do everything he could to bring about the ending of Partition on the basis of a common understanding and a <Col N="1200" /> spirit of goodwill.  Since Fianna Fáil took over office, Ministers from the two Governments have met on both sides of the Border to settle matters of common interest, such as the G.N.R., the E.S.B. and other matters. I feel that, even in that way, we have tried to bring about a spirit of understanding.</P>

      <P>I shall put it on the records.  This is a report that appeared in the Irish Press on June 16th, 1952, when there was a by-election on in Waterford:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Speaking at Kill, Waterford, yesterday, Mr. Aiken, Minister for External Affairs, said that the exCoalition lawyers are prepared to do any sort of damage to the nation in order to tear down Fianna Fáil.  The former Minister for External Affairs recently accused them of `seeking to pick a quarrel with the United States of America' in order to justify the imposition of our economic and budgetary policy on the country.</P>
      <P>Anyone who had caught a glimmer of the inner workings of the lawyer Coalition would not be surprised at this sort of falsehood coming from this source.  It was the same gentleman who assured the British Ambassador in Dublin that the Coalition Government had not decided to repeal the External Relations Act on the morning of the very day it was announced by Mr. Costello in Canada.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The voters in these elections <Col N="1205" /> must mark their condemnation of our foreign policy being made the cat's-paw of unscrupulous politicians. There was, said Mr. Aiken, about as much truth in our `seeking a quarrel with America' as there was in our desiring `another round with England' when we sought to get rid of the Oath of Allegiance to the British King and to retain the £5,000,000 a year which rightfully belonged to Irish people.&rdquo;</P>

Unfortunately, he got into a position where, with the aid of a certain number of supporters for a number of years, he was enabled to do that.  But the Irish people disarmed him very quickly when they got the opportunity.  They rejected his policy and they sent him back with one other Deputy to represent Clann na Poblachta.  He himself was elected only on the 24th count&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy MacBride asked a question about territorial waters. That question is being examined and, when it has been thoroughly examined, Government policy in regard to it will be announced here in the Dáil.  It is a very delicate and a very wide question which affects not only our relations with our nearest neighbour, but also with other countries, who want to use and enter our waters.  I think the Deputy knows that certain action taken in the extension of territorial waters by certain countries has led to difficulty with a number of other countries.  We do not want to get into that position, until at least the whole question has been thoroughly examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> There have been a number of comments from various Deputies on the question of the news agency.  Deputy Cosgrave seems to be a very innocent young man when he alleges that this news agency was set up by the last Government and that it was not to deal with &ldquo;hot news&rdquo;.  That was said by the then Minister for External Affairs, Deputy MacBride, but within a week it was changed, and changed to the knowledge of the then Government, and they gave him a sum of money to set up the agency.  They passed also the Articles of Association which quite clearly set up an agency that was empowered to deal with all classes of news, hot and cold.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that Deputy O'Higgins is pretty brazen but he cannot have it both ways.  The Deputy supported it, and the Government which he supported signed the Articles of Association.  Deputies O'Higgins and MacBride ought to go outside and settle their differences on this matter if they want to but they ought not drag them in here.  He need not emphasise the fact that Deputy MacBride went away from the policy he announced in the Dáil.  When I came along a year after the news agency had been set up, it was running as a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; news agency dealing with all sorts of news and pictures as would any other commercial agency trying to disseminate news and make a profit thereon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> A large number of people had been employed and an office had been set up in Dublin, another in Belfast and another in London.  I may tell the House quite frankly&mdash;as I did before&mdash; that, while fully in favour of the general idea of having an Irish news agency that would be the channel of disseminating Irish news to the world rather than have to rely upon British and American news agencies, had I been the Minister responsible for introducing the proposals I would not have set it up quite in the way it was set up by my predecessor.  In this world, with one Government coming after another, we should, I think, endeavour to see that any work undertaken by a previous Government should be brought to as successful a conclusion as is possible. That is what we started out to do.</P>
    <P>I came in to the Dáil and asked for a Supplementary Estimate.  This year I am asking for another Supplementary Estimate for the news agency, and I hope that in next year's Book of Estimates the sum required will be very greatly reduced because the news agency's income has greatly increased, though it is a very low percentage return. Last year I think it wound up with an income running at the rate of about £16,000.  Its outgoings were a little over £60,000.  Next year I hope that its income will be up and that the amount of money we will ask the Dáil to vote for the agency will be much less than this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan and others asked me what was going to be the future of this news agency.  As I said, we wanted, first of all, to make certain that it got a fair chance.  I would like to see it very much further away from Government than it is.  If we could only get people who are interested in news-papers here to co-operate that would be done.  The result would be that the present organisation would simply be taken over by a new group.  It would not mean that the staff would be dispensed with.  After all, the staff who are employed by the news agency are Irishmen.  They are competing with foreign news agencies, and the organisation here that deals with the big bulk of the journalists of the country are <Col N="1208" /> perfectly satisfied with the arrangements that have been made by the news agency with their organisation.</P>
    <P>There is a rather smaller organisation, the members of which are in important positions representing foreign news agencies.  They are very much against the continuance of the news agency, but the reason the news agency was set up was to compete with the foreign news agencies as disseminators of Irish news.  It was a good thing for our country that we should have some channel other than a British-controlled or an American-controlled agency to send our news to the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>Another thing has happened&mdash; perhaps, people will say it was costly. The number of news items appearing in continental and American papers that are not unfriendly to our country has greatly increased.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacBride referred to a matter which appeared in the papers to-day. It was also followed up by Deputy Blowick.  I wish they had not bothered their heads about it because in my opinion it is not worth notice and if we do notice it it will only serve the purpose for which the step was taken.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is not true to say that I did not advert to Partition.  I do not think the Deputies who had no Irish had any excuse because I sent round a number of translations in English of the speech.  I did advert to the fact that the information section of our Department was carrying on its work and that our delegates going abroad disseminate the literature and the leaflets about Partition showing our case. I also showed how the members of the groups going abroad took advantage, when opportunity offered, of stating our case.</P>
    <P>I can stand on my head and make all sorts of speeches about Partition. I could write and make speeches every day in the week but I think my business is to make certain that I take advantage of every situation to forward the cause of the ending of Partition and that is what we have been trying to do.</P>
    <P>We could raise the Partition controversy to a white heat.  The question is <Col N="1209" /> how long it would hold at that.  I think it is much better that we should be fully determined and say calmly that we are not going to rest until Partition comes to an end and that we are going to judge everybody's attitude towards us and towards any other question of national freedom by their attitude on the question of Partition.</P>
    <P>I said to representatives of various countries that we believe that if they ask us to get interested in their freedom we are entitled to get the same interest regarding our freedom from them.  During the past year we have continued to send out bulletins to some 6,000 or 7,000 people all over the world.  In addition, we have sent a fortnightly bulletin dealing particularly with Partition.  We have sent literally hundreds of thousands of leaflets prepared by the Mansion House Committee dealing with the matter of Partition.  I feel that, as time goes on, more people are not merely getting to know more about Partition but are taking an interest in it.  That has been shown by certain happenings in the U.S.A. in the past 12 months and, indeed, by certain happenings there in the preceding 12 months.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Mac Fheórais is wrong in talking about the bad organisation and conflict between various Irish clubs in the U.S.A.  Deputy Mac Fheórais was in the U.S.A. for only a few days.  I have been there a great number of times, on and off, over the past 20 or 30 years.  I know the Irish societies intimately in most of the cities there.  I know their loyal and devoted service.  It is true to say that the members are human beings and that they will have their differences and express them.  In that respect they are no different from the Irish people at home, from the English people at home, from the American people at home, or from any other people.  Whilst they may disagree from time to time on details as, for instance, on what political Party in the U.S.A. they should favour and, like everybody else, disagree very violently on that subject, there is no disagreement on the question of Ireland and her right to as much unity and freedom as they have in America.</P>
    <P>One of their great arguments with <Col N="1210" /> the people of the U.S.A. on the question of Partition is to say that we only want what the American people have&mdash;that we only want our children to be able to do what the American children do every day when they pledge their allegiance to &ldquo;one nation, indivisible and free.&rdquo;  I refer to the children's salute to the flag.  We want our children to be in a position to make that salutation to their own country. With the help of God, the day will come when they will be in a position to do it.  There is really no difference among the Irish people on that question. I think, in fact, there is no difference now among the members of the Dáil.  Political Parties here as in other countries will spark occasionally if somebody on the opposite side says something that hurts a bit.  But fundamentally not only have we the same point of view on this matter but everybody in this House will do his utmost to further the cause of the unity of Ireland.</P>

Níl ach £63,000 le deonadh, áfach, toise go bhfuil méadú ar leithreasa i gcabhair agus laghdú ar chaiteachas faoi mhírcheanna eile&mdash; go h-áirithe mírcheann A (Tuarastail agus Páighe agus Liúntaisí).</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to provide a further sum of £80,000 for Land Commission improvement works, but amounts totalling £7,495 are also needed for other purposes.  The additional requirements are offset to the extent of £24,495 by increased Appropriations-in-Aid and estimated savings on other sub-heads&mdash;mainly sub-head A (salaries, etc.)&mdash;leaving £63,000 to be voted.</P>
    <P>The smaller items do not call for much explanation.  Travelling and subsistence allowances have recently been increased.  Legal expenses have risen as a result of greater activity in proceedings for acquisition of land.  I may say that proceedings are arising out of the changes made following the passage of the 1950 Land Act.  Deficiencies occur when State claims are met in land bonds at their full nominal value and the bonds are sold at a discount.  Incidentally, I might mention that the Land (No.2) Bill, 1952, which I hope to have circulated shortly, will contain provisions aimed at securing that future series of land bonds will remain at or near par for a reasonable time after their creation.</P>
    <P>As regards improvement works, the revised estimate of expenditure this year reaches the high level of £560,000. These works provide a substantial amount of employment and the rates of wages, which have been rising during the year, are the same as those paid by the county councils to their road workers.  It is the policy of the Government to expedite the relief of congestion and good progress is being made.  Increasing attention is being <Col N="1213" /> devoted to migration from and rearrangement in the congested districts and these activities necessarily entail heavy expenditure on improvements, particularly on buildings.  Prices tendered by contractors have advanced substantially.  It is hoped to have some 250 dwellinghouses and 300 outoffices completed this year; the corresponding figures last year were 150 dwellinghouses and 160 outoffices.</P>
    <P>Last year holdings were provided for 75 migrants; that figure is expected to be more than doubled in the current year.  A substantial increase in the number of holdings rearranged is also anticipated.  It is estimated that some 28,000 acres of land will be acquired during the year and that the area allotted will exceed 25,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Deputies are well aware of the importance of land settlement operations, especially in the congested districts, and I have no hesitation in seeking their support for this Estimate which will enable progress to be maintained for the remainder of the financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have fuller details from the Minister with regard to the bulk sum that he is looking for in this Supplementary Estimate. With regard to sub-head I&mdash;Improvement of Estates&mdash;under which an additional sum of £80,000 is required, I should like to know from the Minister whether that is due to an increase in building costs during the last 12 months.  I refer to that sub-head in particular because it is there we find the principal increase in this Supplementary Estimate.  Can the Minister tell me whether it is due to an increase in the cost of building or to an increase in the number of houses actually under construction?  If the Estimate is necessary to meet an increase in the cost of building, then I should like to mention that about two years ago the cost of building the average standard house was given in this House at about £990, or roughly £1,000.  If the Minister has the figures at hand, I should like to know from him whether there has been an increase there and, if so, by how much?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> The Minister gave some figures with regard to the total number of holdings. I think that very good work is indicated there.  On that point, I hope that the Minister is of a different opinion now from what he was in the first year of the inter-Party Government when I foreshadowed some finality to the work of the Land Commission in dealing with resettlement and the relief of congestion.  When I dealt with the congestion at that time the Minister, sitting on these benches, expressed some rather gloomy views with regard to seeing any finality to that question. I am glad to see that the work which I commenced in 1948 is going ahead and is beginning to show good results already.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the acreage to be acquired or resumed this year would be 28,000 acres.  I wonder could he give me a breakdown of that figure, and tell me how much of that land will be available for the creation of new holdings, the approximate amount that will be used up for rearrangement, and whether any sizable part of the total will be unsuitable for Land Commission purposes and can be utilised for forestry?</P>
    <P>As regards sub-head K&mdash;Deficiencies on Realisation by Government Departments of Land Bonds&mdash;I should like the Minister to be more explicit on that by telling me how the deficiencies have arisen, or in what particular case, that is, if, to give the information, would not lead him into too great a mass of detail.  If it does, then we can leave the question over until the main Estimate comes before the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the solicitor's branch.  Incidentally, the expenses under that sub-head have increased by a pretty considerable amount.  I cannot quite follow that, although I thought I was pretty conversant with the work in that particular branch of the Land Commission.  The Minister has not done anything by his statement to clarify the situation for my dense head.  I fail to see, however, why an additional sum of £3,500 should be required now, in view of the fact that we had the main Estimate before us only nine months ago.  The figure under that sub-head used to be a pretty stable figure.</P>

      <P>This is the second time to-day that, in a rather surprising manner, the very foolish financial policy of this Government has been demonstrated.  Part of the sum that is now asked for in this Supplementary Estimate is required to make good the fall in recent months in the values of one of the securities of this State&mdash; Irish Land Bonds.</P>
      <P>That depreciation in the value of land bonds took place, as in the case of other securities, because the Government, through the Minister for Finance, put on the market in competition with land bonds a security at a very high rate of interest.  Accordingly, the value of land bonds depreciated substantially.</P>
      <P>That is a very serious consideration because it has meant that many people who receive in land bonds payment for lands acquired from them are being paid merely in so many figures written on a sheet of notepaper.  The real market value of the bonds which they get, is substantially less than the compensation payable to them.  The necessity for this Estimate illustrates the considerable, widespread harm which has been done by the very irresponsible financial policy which has been pursued by this Government in recent months.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Bill which the Minister referred to and which it is now necessary to introduce, which is designed to give some parity in value to land bonds, will be introduced as speedily as possible because it is a serious thing if the State, by its own action, proceeds to depress the value of its own securities.  That causes considerable lack of confidence on the part of the people in the fiscal policy of the State and may undoubtedly cause considerable harm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1216" /> I think the Estimate will be agreed by the House.  I would like to know from the Minister if he has available to him information on the number of purchases made by the Land Commission under the very excellent provision contained in the last Land Act, which was introduced by Deputy Blowick as Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope that the increase in the solicitors' department of the Land Commission indicates that there has been a pretty considerable use of the voluntary purchase power now residing in the Land Commission.  I trust that very valuable power has not been overlooked by the Land Commission and that they have made use of it.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is anything else that it is necessary to mention. The Estimate itself will be accepted. I agree with the matters which have already been urged by Deputy Blowick with regard to the Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of buildings is estimated to have increased by between 5 and 10 per cent. during the year and, in addition, as I stated, we have plans for fixing-up 150 migrants from the West of Ireland in the Midland area as against 75 last year.  There will be 250 new houses, all told, completed as compared with roughly 150 last year. I think that is to a greater degree responsible for the increase than the actual increase in the cost of building.</P>
      <P>Of course, wages have also increased. The average minimum rate of wages in January, 1947 was 44/-; in May, 1947, 50/-; March, 1948, 55/-; January, 1949, 58/4.  Since last year increases have taken place.  In Galway there has been an increase from 72/- to 80/-; Mayo remains at the old figure of 80/-. In Roscommon there has been an increase from 75/- to 80/-; in Sligo, from 68/- to 80/-; in Clare, from 72/6 to 82/6; in Cork, from 72/- to 80/-; in Kerry, from 74/- to 85/-.  There are the main counties in the West of Ireland in which work is being carried on.  There have been increases also in Meath from 78/- to 82/6; in Kildare, from 80/- to 85/-; in Dublin from 95/-to 105/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the breaking up of the 28,000 acres, I am afraid I cannot go <Col N="1217" /> into that on the Supplementary Estimate.  I have not the information readily available as to the proportion of that which would go by way of providing holdings for migrants but I think I can assure Deputy Blowick that practically all the activity of the Land Commission is concerned with the relief on congestion at the present time and in trying to provide additional land by resumption proceedings for re-arrangement schemes.</P>
    <P>The amount of land taken for forestry worked out last year at about 5 per cent.  Roughly, about 1,200 acres of the land acquired by the Land Commission went for forestry purposes. If the commissioners find that the land is unsuitable for their purposes, not being good arable land capable of being laid out in the way that suits their policy, or if they find that they have had to take over an area of old woodland, they may decide to transfer the portion which they do not require to the forestry branch.</P>
    <P>There is an item in respect of deficiencies by reason of the redemption of Government charges by the transfer of bonds at the face value of the bonds as against the market value. Deputy O'Higgins referred to another provision for loss on realisation.  I cannot see that the fact that there has been a fall in the market value of land bonds is proof of any failure as far as the Government's financial policy is concerned.  The recent national loan is standing at a very high figure and if that loan is securing the approbation of the investing public in the country the good effects of that position are bound to spread to the other stocks.  The real point is that if the investing public is satisfied that the country is prosperous and that our affairs are in good order, particularly our finances, our stocks are more likely to approach their face value on the market than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>As regards the law charges, Deputy Blowick wished to know what the position is in that regard.  In 1948-49, the expenditure was £2,439; 1949-50, £4,287; 1950-51, £4,055.  The estimate of £6,500 was prepared for sub-head E in November, 1951, in the light of <Col N="1218" /> estimated expenditure; £4,500 was for 1951-52, but, in fact, the expenditure amounted to £6,060.  The estimate of £2,400 for 1952-53 was framed on the basis of owners' and tenants' costs in cases before the Appeal Tribunal, but there was an exceptionally high number of payments in the current year arising from the disposal of price appeal cases which accumulated after the passing of the Land Act of 1950. The price appeals heard in 1951-52 numbered 111 against 15 in 1950-51.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate in advance in any particular year what these law charges for resumption cases will be. They do not mature for payment until the costs have been submitted by the tenants' solicitors and have been examined, so that the figure which it was assumed would cover the owners' and tenants' costs in cases before the Appeal Tribunal of £2,400 has already risen to £4,500 in 188 price appeal and resumption cases.  The corresponding figure for the whole of last year was approximately £1,500 in 71 cases, so that there has been a very big increase in the costs of cases, due partly to the increased number of appeals in resumption cases as compared with the previous year, and also to the fact that costs came in during the year which might have applied, as I understand it, to the preceding year.</P>
    <P>We also had exceptional costs in cases before the High Court and the Supreme Court.  The estimate was £1,000, but the costs awarded against the Land Commission in a single case amounted to £1,430, which have been discharged this year.  Fees for counsel retained by the Land Commission were estimated at £800.  The fees have already amounted to £1,300 and have been paid.  I do not know whether I have given sufficient explanation of the increases.  The increases, anyway, came under these three heads: owners' and tenants' costs in cases before the Appeal Tribunal, exceptional costs before the High Court and Supreme Court, and fees to counsel retained by the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1953, for certain Transport Services; for Grants for Harbours; for the Salaries and Expenses of the Marine Service (Merchant Shipping Acts, 1894 to 1947, and the Foreshore Act, 1933 (No. 12 of 1933); for certain payments in respect of Compensation, including the cost of medical treatment (No. 19 of 1946); and for the Coast Life Saving Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again the Dáil has to be asked to vote additional money to make good losses incurred during the year by C.I.E.  When the Estimate for the year was being prepared 12 months ago there were discussions with the board as to the provision which might reasonably be made in the Estimate for subsidy in the financial year.  The board had estimated its possible losses at a higher figure than the £1,300,000 which appeared in the Estimate but, after consultation with the board at the time and consideration of the matter by the Government, it was considered that £1,300,000 would not be an unreasonable provision, though there may have been more optimism than confidence in adopting it.  In the event, the actual losses incurred in the year are now estimated to exceed the provision in the Estimate by about £650,000.  The higher losses are, of course, attributable to higher costs incurred during the year, of which increased wages are the most considerable item.  That excess of £650,000 in losses over and above the Estimate provision was incurred, however, notwithstanding the fact that increased charges were brought into operation in July last and further increases in the <Col N="1220" /> present month, and notwithstanding the fact that the board put into operation during the year various economies, some of which involved reductions in staffs.</P>
    <P>The House will recollect that this time last year I had to propose a Supplementary Estimate for £2,250,000 to meet C.I.E. losses in the previous financial year.  Against these losses there had been no provision at all in the Budget prepared by our predecessors so that the supplementary sum then asked for of £2,250,000 was the amount estimated to meet the whole of the losses in that financial year.  In the event, the end of the year showed that the losses exceeded the amount voted in the Supplementary Estimate by £450,000.  That was due almost entirely to the fact that increased wages became operative between the date of the introduction of the Supplementary Estimate and the end of the financial year; but it makes it necessary for us now to vote over and above the £650,000 required to supplement the provision in the present financial year another £450,000 required to make good the deficiency in the provision of the previous year so that the total additional amount which the Dáil is now being asked to vote for C.I.E. is £1,100,000 in addition to the £1,300,000 provided for in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the £650,000 and the £450,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  With regard to the other details of the Estimate there is an additional £100 to provide for legal advice to the transport tribunal and there is an estimated reduction in expenditure of £100,100 on harbour works mainly because of the very slow progress which is being made in the construction of the new graving dock in Dublin.  The net result of all these changes is to require us to ask the Dáil to provide another £1,000,000 for transport and marine services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of the year I had on more than one occasion to make it clear to the board both in private discussion with the chairman and in various public statements that in my <Col N="1221" /> view neither the Dáil nor the public is prepared to continue to find substantial sums every year from taxation to meet the losses of the C.I.E. undertaking, losses which are running roughly at the rate of £2,000,000 per year.  I also informed the board that I was personally not prepared to contemplate losses running at a higher level and that if they should appear likely to emerge because of higher costs or declining traffic they would have to be offset by increases in rates and fares and, if such increases in rates and fares should lead in turn to a reduction in traffic, then there would be no alternative but to reduce services and effect appropriate reductions in staffs.  The position is, therefore, that so far as the present C.I.E. undertaking is concerned we have endeavoured to put a ceiling to their losses.  We made it clear to them and to everybody else concerned that any further addition to their costs must be immediately offset by increased fares or charges or, alternatively, by a reduction of services involving probably reductions in staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>What ceiling has the Minister put?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The present level of losses.  I also told the board that I was not prepared to ask the Dáil to continue to vote subsidies even to meet losses at the present level unless I could hold out the prospect that these losses would in the course of time be eliminated.  I invited the board to submit to me its plans for the elimination of losses and for getting the undertaking at some stage into the position in which it would be able to pay its way without subventions from the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Houses is aware that I received from the board certain proposals for the amendment of the legislation relating to the operation of transport services, involving restrictions upon the operation of private transport vehicles.  By all the usual devices I endeavoured to insure that these proposals of the board would be widely publicised and be brought to the notice not merely of the various trade associations and individuals affected by them but also to the notice of the <Col N="1222" /> trade unions catering for workers in transport employment.  I indicated that I personally was not attracted by the proposals but that I felt bound to consider them in view of the fact that they had been made by C.I.E. and represented their proposals for the relief of their situation.  I intimated also that I was prepared to consider any objections to them that might be forthcoming from other affected interests.</P>
    <P>These objections were numerous and many of them were very vigorously expressed.  I think it is quite obvious that public opinion would not regard these proposals as meeting either the position of the C.I.E. undertaking or as being suitable to the national development. No final decision upon these proposals has been taken.  Before coming to a decision, I invited the trade unions with members employed in the C.I.E. organisation to establish a consultative committee and I requested that committee to consider these proposals of C.I.E. and any associated matters bearing upon the future of transport policy.</P>
    <P>A consultative committee of trade unions was set up.  There are 24 trade union representatives on it.  It has held frequent meetings but I have not yet received its report.  Its terms of reference are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To consult with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and C.I.E. on the problems of C.I.E. and/or to consult with any other person or body whose advice might be helpful to the committee in the discharge of its duties to consider and make proposals thereon.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although I have indicated a personal viewpoint upon these proposals of C.I.E. for the restriction of private motor transport, I do not feel that it would be right to take a final decision regarding the matter until the views of that committee have been considered and until the representations made by a number of other affected interests and trade associations have been fully analysed.</P>
    <P>However, as it was clear to me that these proposals of C.I.E. would not in any event wipe out the losses of the undertaking, nor did the board claim <Col N="1223" /> that they would, I had further discussions with the chairman of the board. The board were requested to put up for the consideration of the Government more comprehensive proposals for the reorganisation and re-equipment of the undertaking, proposals which in the view of the board would hold out the prospect of eventually getting to a stage in which losses would not arise.</P>
    <P>I have now received these proposals of the board.  They are at present under consideration, and no final decision has been taken on them yet. I think, however, I should say they involve the complete dieselisation of the whole railway undertaking.  The board is emphatic in its view that a complete change-over from steam locomotion to diesel electric traction would, by itself, be almost sufficient to wipe out the operating losses on the railway by reason of savings in fuel and maintenance costs.</P>
    <P>They have other proposals for capital expenditure upon equipment which are linked in with these dieselisation proposals.  It will be appreciated that the fulfilment of these proposals could not be completed except over a number of years and that that would involve a substantial additional capital investment in the undertaking, capital investment which would, in itself, impose new charges on the undertaking.  Nevertheless, the board claim that the combined effect of all these proposals, of which the chief is this complete change-over to diesel electric traction, would be to create a situation in which the need for subsidy would disappear or at worst the present deficit in the undertaking's revenue be reduced to very small dimensions.</P>
    <P>The proposals, as I have said, are being examined.  They are being examined both from the point of view of the soundness of the arguments advanced by the board for them and the co-ordination of the capital investment programme which they involve with the general capital programme of the Government.  I, therefore, feel I can come to the Dáil with a slightly easier mind to ask them to vote this additional sum for C.I.E. in the present year, because even though a <Col N="1224" /> final decision on these proposals has not been made, there is at least the prospect contained in them that at some stage, not next year or the year afterwards, when the full programme has been carried into effect, of eliminating these losses or at worst reducing them to manageable size.</P>
    <P>The provision for the transport tribunal, although a nominal one and made necessary by the fact that the possibility of the tribunal requiring legal advice was not foreseen when the Estimate was prepared, gives the House, if it wishes, the opportunity of discussing the operations of that tribunal.  Although it was provided for in the Act of 1950, it was not, in fact, set up until last year.  It was set up to consider certain applications which the C.I.E. board wished to have considered for the abandonment of branch lines.  The first series of applications related to branch lines on which services had ceased but which the board had not finally abandoned.  The House is aware that under the provisions of the 1950 Act the Minister for Industry and Commerce has no function in deciding questions of that kind.  Application for authority to cease a service of trains on a branch line or to abandon a branch line is made to the transport tribunal and the transport tribunal's decision is final.  It is communicated to the board and the board has then the authority to act on it.</P>
    <P>I do not know what I can say regarding the saving upon harbour works.  It is not a kind of saving I would like to have to report.  For some reason the construction of the graving dock at Dublin has proceeded much more slowly than was anticipated away back in 1945 or 1946 when I persuaded the Government to agree to make a grant of £500,000 towards its cost.  I had thought then that the dock would have been completed by this, but apparently work on it has been very slow, and it is not even possible to say now when that project will be completed. There were some other harbour works upon which work was slower than had been estimated, and it because of that fact that we have £100,000 to put against the additional money requested by C.I.E.</P>
    <Col N="1225" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I think, proper that the House this year should hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce a reason why in the recent Budget he underestimated by almost £1,000,000 the operating losses of the transport undertaking.  No doubt the Minister can say that it is not proper in regard to an undertaking having statutory obligations, as this undertaking has, to write them a blank cheque and to say to them: &ldquo;You can go out and lose as much money as you like, provided you do not exceed such and such a figure.&rdquo;  It was last year the Government took the extraordinary step of providing in the Estimates for the losses which they felt C.I.E. would incur in the ensuing financial year.  That was an unprecedented and most unusual act of charity at the expense of the taxpayer by the present Government to C.I.E.  They provided in the Estimates for a loss by C.I.E. of £1,300,000.  That was done because much of the financial wail set up by the present Government when they found themselves in office in June, 1951, concerned the fact that the former Government, in its last Budget, did not provide for C.I.E. losses totalling £2,250,000.  The reason such a provision was not made was that no sensible Government under the sun would do that if it expected the transport company to endeavour to operate its concern in such a way that losses would not be necessary.  Of course, it was appreciated by the former Government, as it is appreciated by the present Government, that losses will be incurred, and it was recognised and it was the practice, unfortunately necessary, that at this time of the year a Supplementary Estimate to make provision in respect of losses already incurred would be moved by the Minister.  That practice has obtained, and it was only because members of the present Government sought to make capital for political purposes of the fact that, in the previous Estimates, no provision was made for possible C.I.E. losses that some effort was made last year to provide for these losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, as the House has heard from the Minister, that effort was not a serious one.  He glossed over it by <Col N="1226" /> saying that he selected a figure, £1,300,000, in an optimistic frame of mind, to provide for C.I.E. losses.  The House and the country may take it that there was no effort to budget for those losses.  A figure was selected and put in the Estimates, so that the Opposition at the time could not say: &ldquo;You are not providing for C.I.E. losses; why blame us for not doing the same?&rdquo; It was for that reason the figure came in and now, as expected, the Minister has to ask for a supplementary sum to provide for that underestimation which the Minister for Finance made in his Budget.  The Dáil is asked to vote over £1,000,000, made up of two underestimations&mdash;the first being a sum of almost £500,000 underestimated in the last Supplementary Estimate, and the second being £650,000 underestimated in the last Budget.</P>
    <P>We must agree with every word the Minister has spoken regarding continual operating losses by C.I.E.  No one could regard the prospect of annual losses on the transport undertaking with any degree of complacency. While that must be said about all Deputies, it must apply with particular emphasis to the present Minister, because it was due to him, if bouquets are to be thrown, that the idea of a national transport company became possible.  It was his efforts originally that formed the first C.I.E.; it was his efforts originally that propped up the shaky structure of the G.S.R. with the fine city transport system we had in Dublin; it was his genius and his imagination some nine or ten years ago which saw the possibility of a national semi-socialised transport industry. It was his vision and prophecy that enabled him to tell Dáil Éireann nine years ago that the proposal which he was putting before the Dáil and the country would guarantee for the people of Ireland cheap and efficient transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Minister and his Government have little or no policy now as to how best to provide what they originally promised&mdash;a cheap <Col N="1228" /> and efficient transport service.  The Minister said he referred to the proposals he got.  Undoubtedly he did. In the month of July last, the country heard by hearsay, by rumour, by reading&mdash;I think it was during the newspaper strike&mdash;what was printed in some English newspapers, that a proposal had been made to the Minister by the Board of C.I.E. to restrict the right of every owner of a commercial vehicle to carry his goods or those of anyone else beyond a certain zonal distance.  That was given by the Minister to a conference of trades unionists and eventually it percolated amongst the people.  Naturally, it caused some concern in the distributing trade and amongst decent people who had built up through years of effort a system of distribution of their goods.  Bit by bit, a very considerable wave of opposition grew up towards that proposal.  When Dáil Éireann met again, in the autumn of last year, we took steps from this side of the House to ascertain the Government's policy in relation to that proposal.  We were told that no decision had been taken.  I think that at that time the Minister, outside the House, expressed his own personal disinclination to carry out that particular proposal; but the House was told that no Government decision had been taken on the matter.  So far as we can judge from the Minister to-night, the position is still very much the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the suggestion of restricting or zoning commercial vehicles, the Minister is still unable to say what, if any, decision the Government has taken in the matter.  He said he is rather against it but he has been very careful to say that does not mean it will not come.  &ldquo;I may have a personal disinclination to doing it, but no decision has yet been taken.&rdquo;  He went on to say that, in any event, he was satisfied that even the zoning of commercial vehicles would not meet the operating losses of the transport undertaking. Accordingly, he had asked the board to give to him, as Minister, more detailed suggestions and accordingly he has been in a position to tell the House to-night that the Board of C.I.E. have made certain proposals to the Government which involve, amongst other things, a change-over, the dieselisation <Col N="1229" /> of the system and a change-over to quite a different method of traction. I agree with the Minister when he says that he is happy to be able to show that amount of progress.  It would indeed be an appalling prospect if the Minister to-night was unable to give the House any assurance for the future and unable to show any real step being taken to meet these operating losses. Although this matter of operating losses must have concerned the Minister for the past 18 months, it is strange that these proposals should be of such recent origin.  There may be a reason for that&mdash;we do not know&mdash;but I take it from the Minister's speech that whatever decision is taken will be taken with all possible speed, after considering, of course, the different possible effects of such a radical change.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned&mdash;it is part of this Estimate&mdash;the Transport Tribunal. I do not know what the practice is in this regard or what the exact position is, but, in the past six months or so, the Transport Tribunal has adjudicated on a proposal to close down lines which in fact have not been operating.  In addition, sittings have been or are being arranged to consider objections from those interested in branch lines which are at the moment operating lines.  I do not know whether it is possible to make any provision for the legal costs of objectors fighting a case of that kind before the tribunal, but, speaking as a Deputy, I am aware of the vast amount of work that may be involved in presenting to the tribunal an intelligent case for its investigation in relation to the closing of these branch lines.  I am not certain if, under the statute, the Minister has any function.  The Minister has no function?  Very well; I will pass from that point.</P>
    <P>We join with the Minister in regretting the necessity for this Estimate and we sympathise particularly with the Minister in having to introduce the Estimate and having to seek this money.  We would oppose any suggestion to ease the difficulties of C.I.E. by the virtual elimination of private enterprise in road carriage.  We hope the alternative proposals the Minister now has before him will ease the <Col N="1230" /> difficulties of C.I.E. and that whatever decision is come to will be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement in relation to the public transport of the country is a pretty sombre one, from the point of view of the taxpayer and from the point of view of the future of public transport in this country.  As I took it, the position is that C.I.E. is operating at an annual loss of £2,000,000.  The Minister has said&mdash;it is indeed poor consolation to the taxpayer&mdash;that he is limiting those losses to £2,000,000 annually.  I listened carefully to his statement and, so far as I could gather, he has no alleviation to offer in this unfortunate situation that has arisen, except to endeavour to change over to diesel oil as the fuel for public transport.</P>
      <P>I take it that the importation of this diesel oil fuel will be from the dollar world, which means that it will throw a heavy burden, by reason of the non-convertibility of sterling, on our dollar pool.  How does the Minister propose to meet that?  I should be glad if he would give us some information on that point.  Admittedly, he did not dogmatically state that&mdash;it is just a suggestion on his part.  In effect, really and unfortunately, he has no solution to offer.  He also said it might be a matter for consultation with the trade unions.  Am I to take it that the suggestion is that the employees of C.I.E., who, as I know, are clamouring for an increase in their wages, are to be asked to take a lesser sum each week?  The public have already paid dearly for C.I.E.  We have had an increase in all the fares and so far as we can gather from the Minister's statement, there is a possibility of fares being further increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not time that somebody said, as, in effect, the Minister himself to a certain degree this evening has said: &ldquo;There is a limit to the losses which you may incur; there is a limit to the extent of the mismanagement of your business?&rdquo; If any private firm in this country was running its affairs in the manner in which C.I.E. is conducting its affairs and imposing a heavy drain like that on those who provided the capital, would the management of that <Col N="1231" /> firm be retained?  I am not conversant with the people who are responsible for the administration of C.I.E., but it is quite obvious that they are not making a success of their job.  That statement covers the whole organisation, but, of course, the people at the top must always be held responsible. The difficulty with this company is that if I, as a Deputy, write and make any suggestion to C.I.E. which is brought to me by some of my constituents&mdash;and I have made innumerable suggestions since I was elected&mdash;I am only wasting my time.  I shall get a reply saying that the matter will be considered.  I presume that my communication, like many others of a similar nature, goes into the wastepaper basket and there is no more about it.  Then when I come into the Dáil here and ask a question about any matter in which C.I.E. are concerned, I am referred to the 1950 Act.  The 1950 Act is apparently the cloak under which C.I.E. can spend the money which we, the elected representatives of the people, vote and get away with it every time.  I do not agree with that system at all.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister has the responsibility to call in whoever the directors, the management or the controllers of this particular company are and point out to them clearly and emphatically that this is not a rich country, that it is already an over-taxed country and that we cannot afford to go on handing over £2,000,000 per annum or give them a ceiling of £2,000,000 per annum to run their business in the way they are doing it.  In other words, we should call a halt to present trends.</P>
    <P>It is not that C.I.E. have a particularly tough road to plough.  They are not in the position of ordinary private firms who have to compete with rival firms in the country.  They have a virtual monopoly of everything in the line of transport.  Does not every Deputy know that, with the exception of a few lorries with trade plates, C.I.E. has a virtual monopoly of road haulage in the country to-day?  In spite of that monopoly, which constitutes, to my mind, a very definite restrictive practice, they cannot make the organisation <Col N="1232" /> pay and they come in here and look for money to subsidise them.  As if to add insult to injury, they have thrown into chaos all the private firms and many industrialists in this country who provide lorries for their own transport.  What state of mind are the directors of these companies in at the present moment, facing the suggestion of a zonal limitation of about 20 miles?  I am sure every Deputy has had letters from all over his constituency, as I have had from my constituency, asking if this suggestion is to be enacted into law or not.  By a parliamentary question, I tried to elicit from the Minister what his mind in this matter is.  He has told us he is not enamoured of these proposals but he has to give due consideration to them.  Is there any suggestion that, even if C.I.E. were to be given these unnatural restrictions on private haulage in the country, they would be able to make a success of transport?  I do not think so, and I think it would be a sorry day if they got any further grip on the country than they have now.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the Minister some little information about the manner in which transport is carried on by C.I.E.  This is one of the few chances one gets of mentioning these matters without being referred to the 1950 Act.  In the town of Bunclody, in my constituency&mdash;some of you may know it by its older name of Newtownbarry&mdash;a delivery system is carried out by C.I.E.  If you are a tradesman or a merchant in Bunclody and you arrange to have stuff ordered in Dublin delivered by C.I.E., it is sent out from Dublin in the morning to Tullow, in County Carlow.  It is kept there until a lorry comes from Enniscorthy which takes the stuff from Tullow and delivers it in Bunclody, after closing hours in the evening.  This happens twice a week.  That is the transport which C.I.E. is providing for the people of Wexford.  I am sure every Deputy has had a similar experience in his own constituency.</P>
    <P>I asked a question in reference to this matter because the last time I was in Bunclody, the merchants there came to me and told me that they had to pay their staffs overtime and keep <Col N="1233" /> them at work after hours to suit the whim of C.I.E.  The stuff arrives, if it ever does arrive, about 8.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>We are asked to vote £2,000,000 to C.I.E., but yet the answer I get when I question the Minister in regard to these matters is that, under the 1950 Act, the Minister has no jurisdiction. If I were Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;I am sure I never shall be, and I am afraid I would not be a good Minister&mdash;I certainly would not agree to be bound by the 1950 Act, and if a Deputy asked me a question in reference to such complaints I would go to C.I.E. and say to whoever is in charge of the particular section concerned: &ldquo;Look here, the Government has to provide you with £2,000,000 per year and the least you should do is to give some decent service to the public for that.&rdquo;  If the Minister thinks that C.I.E. are giving the Irish people satisfaction, let him dwell for a while on the points which I have put to him.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the railways. I think anyone with a constructive national approach to the problems of transport in this country must realise, especially bearing in mind the difficulties which we had to overcome during the emergency, that railways are an essential part of public transport in this country.  Without railways we certainly could not carry on in time of emergency.  If there should be another outbreak of war, we would again be absolutely dependent on the railways.  Of course it is difficult to make railways pay now.  Things have changed a lot with the passing years, but I do not think railways have been given justice in regard to the general transport arrangements of this country.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it has been arranged by whoever controls the transport of C.I.E. that you must have trains and buses all going in the same direction.  There are certain parts of Ireland where people have to walk, travel by private car, ride a bicycle or go in any way they can, and there are other parts, on the main routes mostly, where you can go by bus or train.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying&mdash;I was not Deputy in the House in the last <Col N="1234" /> Dáil&mdash;that some sort of a commission was set up by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Daniel Morrissey, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, to go into this question of transport. I think we had somebody over here to advise us on the matter, and I think that one of the principal things he advised was that the trains and the buses should not run in competition with each other.  Am I right?  I think I am.  I do not know what that man came over here for or what he was paid to give us that advice, but it did not produce any results, anyway, because in my part of the country&mdash; and as far as I know in other parts of the country&mdash;the buses and trains continue running in opposition to one another.</P>
    <P>Take the case of Bray.  I think there are 84 buses per day travelling between Bray and Dublin.  I may not have my figures quite right.  Before C.I.E. came into existence and before the happy days when we shook a couple of million pounds round to keep these white elephants alive&mdash;real white elephants, not the ones we heard of 20 years ago&mdash;the Dublin South-Eastern Railway, on the Bray to Dublin line, carried all traffic economically.  It was solvent and kept the line alive.  It could be the same again to-day if given a chance but what chance has it with 84 buses per day going into Dublin? There might be some sense in it if they ran some buses from areas where there is no transport and bring the people to the railway station so that they could take the trains in to Dublin.  Who will walk to a railway station if he can step into a bus in the main street?  It may be a little difficult and hard on the residents but if it is going to save £2,000,000 or portion of the £2,000,000, it is worth considering.</P>
    <P>Another piece of fatuous nonsense I heard about the other day was in connection with a branch line that was closed down somewhere in Ireland.  A train has not run on it for some years. There are four or five houses on it with nobody living in them.  Somebody was sent out the other day to paint them inside and out.  That is the sort of thing that is being done in C.I.E.&mdash; money thrown away for nothing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> Nationalisation or State control at any time is a step in the wrong direction.  Nobody wants that in this country.  The railways and the public transport in this country are not actually nationalised, but I think we may say that they are next door to it. I think we must all speak with a sense of responsibility here now.  Unfortunately, we have got to face up to the unpleasant fact that this firm is running at a heavy loss.  I think there is only one solution to it.  I think it would be better for the present governing board of C.I.E., whoever they may be, to be superseded.</P>
    <P>We have in it, of course, very fine engineers, architects, running engineers and fine people who are concerned with transport and the timing of trains but what we really need in C.I.E. is somebody with a good business capacity. It would be worth the country's while to try and get somebody who is fully conversant with the running of transport and pay him to do it in order to try and save this country from the drain on our resources.  There is not a bright future as we stand at present.</P>
    <P>May I digress slightly, Sir, for a moment and refer to the rumours of deficits in Budgets, unhappy financial positions and a further increase in the cost of living?  It is a natural sequence of events that the employees, the working men connected with C.I.E. will be looking for more money to subsidise their weekly budget.  That means that you will have further overcharges on an already overburdened C.I.E. exchequer.</P>
    <P>I suggest now to the Minister that he get hold of somebody who has got a real good business head and try and save Irish transport and take it out of the maelstrom and the muddle in which it is at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather afraid that Deputy Dr. Esmonde did not realise how fiercely and how emphatically he was condemning the whole policy of the inter-Party Government during their tenure of office in connection with road transport.  When this whole problem came before the Government in 1950 they had it in their hands to <Col N="1236" /> abolish C.I.E. as it then was.  It was not a nationalised body at the time, but it was centralised if you like.  They had it in their hands to transfer the whole system of transport to private enterprise.  What did they do?  They introduced the 1950 Act which completely, thoroughly and finally nationalised the whole system of transport and established C.I.E. as a State company with a certain amount of independence from Dáil and ministerial control, but as a State company, State financed and State controlled. If there was anything in what Deputy Dr. Esmonde said and if he had any faith in what he said, he should have conveyed that message to Deputy Daniel Morrissey when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce and to Deputy Cosgrave.  Instead, we had by the 1950 Act the whole system of C.I.E. as a centralised State controlled transport company made permanent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde went further and said that that company should have been placed in the hands of some man with business experience, with training in transport, and yet the decision of the Minister of his own Party and the Parliamentary Secretary of his own Party was to place control of C.I.E. in the hands of a permanent civil servant.  A permanent civil servant, no matter how efficient he might be in his own Government Department, could hardly be expected to have any knowledge or experience of transport.</P>
      <P>With that history before us, I think it is rather difficult to be patient with people like Deputy Dr. Esmonde.  We know that this is a problem of extreme gravity and complexity.  Previous Governments have not been able to solve it.  Neither Fianna Fáil nor the inter-Party Government could find the ideal solution except by committing themselves to State aid for a centralised transport body and State aid, as we know, is a dangerous thing.  It is something which carries with it the menace of permanent and growing inefficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time to review the whole position without trying to make Party capital out of the situation and without trying to condemn any Party in <Col N="1237" /> connection with the matter.  I do not think that Deputy Dr. Esmonde added anything to the sum of our knowledge on the subject or made a constructive approach by his all-round condemnation of the present Government.  He must realise that when another Government had this problem on their hands for three and a half years, they failed to solve it.  I think it is necessary to take stock of the position before deciding to make any further large contribution to the upkeep of this company.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that I did not hear the Minister's statement.  I am not sure, therefore, whether or not he stated the particular branches of C.I.E. in which losses were incurred in the main.  I think everybody knows that the greater portion of the deficit is in relation to the maintenance of the rail system.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde agrees that the rail system must be maintained. Therefore, even if we make him Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;a position which, he says, he does not desire&mdash;we shall still be committed to maintaining the rail service which is unable to pay its way.</P>
    <P>The Minister's suggestion for an improvement of the rail service either by the introduction of diesel traction or by any other system is to be welcomed. I feel, however, that it might be better if C.I.E. cleared off the roads altogether so far as goods transport is concerned.  Everybody agrees that C.I.E. can give a reasonably efficient passenger service, but it is very difficult to imagine how a large centralised company such as C.I.E., maintaining a huge fleet of freight lorries, can utilise those lorries to the best advantage and make them pay. I feel that it is an impossible and unnecessary task.  So far as goods transport is concerned, private enterprise can fill the bill adequately.  It is only in the matter of passenger and rail transport that a State or centralised body is required.  Therefore, I think it would simplify the problem if C.I.E. withdrew completely from road transport. I do not think they can handle the service efficiently and I do not think they should be expected to <Col N="1238" /> handle it.  I feel that private enterprise can handle that service to the satisfaction of the community.</P>
    <P>If C.I.E. were confined to the task of maintaining the essential railways and of giving a passenger and goods service on those railways and also to the task of providing adequate bus services where required and where they do not compete with the railways, they would do as much as it is necessay for them to do.  Private enterprise could look after the carriage of goods. I do not think that C.I.E. should be under the legal obligations which they are under to give a goods service in every area.  I think that their liabilities, responsibilities and expenses should be cut down.  One thing is certain: this nation cannot go on subsidising transport.  Sooner or later &mdash;and the sooner the better&mdash;that subsidisation must cease.  The general taxpayer should not be asked or expected to provide the finance to carry on a transport system.  The system should be able to stand on its own feet.</P>
    <P>Another point which must be made clear is that there must be no interference with the right of the private citizen to convey goods by lorry.  The free operation of goods lorries is absolutely essential to the business life and to the agricultural industry of this country.  The more freedom we have in regard to goods transport by road the better for all concerned.  There are people who say that the private lorry owner does not pay as good wages or give as good conditions of employment to his employees as C.I.E.</P>
    <P>We are living in a competitive age and anyone who is connected with organised labour knows that there are thousands of well-paid workers in the employment of private lorry-owners and licensed hauliers who are well satisfied with the conditions under which they work.  It would be terrible to deprive those men of their employment, but it would be even more serious to deprive commerce and industry and agriculture of the free and flexible system which private enterprise provides for the conveyance of goods to and from every portion of the country.  Furthermore, it would be <Col N="1239" /> very dangerous if the entire transport of this State were in the hands of a monopoly when the entire economic life of the nation could be paralysed overnight by a trade dispute.  So long as you have privately-owned lorries to convey goods there is no danger that the people in the towns and cities will ever be held up to ransom with regard to their food supplies or that the farming community will be refused a market for their produce. Therefore, I say emphatically that whatever we do and whatever problems may face C.I.E. we must preserve the system of private enterprise in regard to road transport.  I suppose it is equally true that the private citizen should be free to travel by his own car or by whatever means of transport he wishes to employ.  The essential thing to bear in mind is that it is important that the vital interests of the nation be considered&mdash;and the vital interests of the nation demand that the greatest possible measure of free enterprise should be allowed to operate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make an earnest appeal to the Minister, on the matter of this very great problem of transport, to give another chance to some of the branch lines which it is proposed to close in the near future or which, at least, are the subject of notice.  I know that the pros and cons of the case in relation to broad policy will be dealt with by the tribunal, but we must regard these branch lines as feeders of our main lines.  It is not enough to regard them individually as a unit: we must regard them as feeders of the main lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have some regard for the communities which live in our small rural towns.  They are up against much opposition to-day.  There are two towns in my constituency which are seriously affected at the moment by the proposal to close branch lines.  If that policy is persisted in it will mean the death knell of these towns.  If, for example, the lines were kept open on fair and market days it would mean a good deal for the towns concerned.  It is felt by those in the cattle trade, and others, <Col N="1240" /> that if the cattle which are now transported from these local fairs by rail are to be brought by road the farmer will be called upon to take a reduced price for them and that, rather than do that, he will divert his cattle to fairs held in a town, perhaps not very far distant from him, where there are rail facilities.  For these and the other reasons which I have stated, we feel that these branch lines should be given another chance, particularly in view of the developments in relation to diesel cars.  We think that the diesel cars should get a trial on these branch lines.</P>
    <P>We cannot understand the policy that is being pursued by the management of a great concern such as C.I.E.  On the one hand, they are aiming at carrying out economies by closing these branch lines while on the other hand they are embarking on very considerable expenditure in the reriveting, repainting and rehabilitation of a large railway bridge which spans the river Blackwater over one of these branch lines.  Why is that being done in view of the fact that the closing of that branch line is under review?  We regard that as a waste of money.  It seems to indicate that, so far as the management of C.I.E. is concerned, there is room for much inquiry.</P>
    <P>The last Deputy who spoke shed what, I feel, were crocodile tears in his concern for the private haulier.  We must, of course, remember that he was one of the Deputies who, only a few months ago, walked into the Lobby to vote for a measure that was deliberately designed to drive the private haulier out of business by increasing the taxation on him and by diverting the goods, formerly transported by him, into the hands of C.I.E.  The Deputy said that he was in favour of competition.  I suggest that what happened in that case was not fair competition.  The private hauliers that he spoke about, many of them, have lost their employment over the past six months.  They are now approaching us and asking us to try and find some position for them.  I think it is rather late in the day for Deputy Cogan to try and recover the ground which he <Col N="1241" /> lost by being a party to a policy that was designed to drive these people out of existence.</P>
    <P>As a result of that policy, we have to bear increased costs to-day for the transport of the raw materials which we require for industry and agriculture. Those engaged in lorry transport either have to take a reduced profit for their labours or else increase the cost on the consuming public.  I, therefore, cannot believe that Deputy Cogan has made an honest case.  I cannot accept him as an advocate of private enterprise. He was a party to the action of the Government, that he now supports, in trying to drive these people out of business.</P>
    <P>I should like to finish on this note, that at the moment there is considerable unrest throughout the country at the increase that has taken place in the rates.  It is felt that our roads to-day are carrying vehicles of a weight that they were never intended to carry. Consequently, the maintenance of the roads is becoming a matter of very grave concern for the local authorities. The closing of the branch lines, in our opinion is not going to alleviate that situation.  I would appeal to the Minister to have special regard to the continued maintenance of these branch lines.  They are required by the rural population.  It is on record that, where branch lines have been closed in the past, the neighbouring small towns and villages have disappeared in consequence. I would appeal to the Minister to give them another break.  Facts in support of the demand for their continued maintenance are being collected and will be put before the transport authority.</P>
    <P>There is no question but that in dealing with C.I.E. we are faced with one of the greatest problems before the country, namely, the problem of national transport.  It is conceded that, in time of emergency, it is absolutely essential to have an efficient rail system operating throughout the country.  As many Deputies have already pointed out, it is certainly bad business to run road passenger services side by side with the railways.  That system has been in existence for some <Col N="1242" /> time.  We feel that it is one of the things which has been conducive to the situation with which we are faced to-day. Consequently, we feel that much could be done in the way of having a rearrangement of the internal management of C.I.E., so that buses would be employed only as feeders to main and branch lines.  In that way, they would be employed bringing business to the railways instead of being, as they are at present, used to compete with the trains on the main lines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Sullivan must have completely forgotten that it was the Coalition Government which appointed the present board of directors of C.I.E., the board which the Deputy has claimed is responsible for all the troubles from which C.I.E. is suffering at the moment.  I suggest to the Deputy that he should be fair in his approach to a question like this and should state the facts.  I think he should tell the truth of the matter.  He knows that there was a certain gentleman fired, if you like, by the Coalition Government and that he was blackguarded throughout the length and breadth of Ireland because of his work in C.I.E. The present board of directors was appointed, as I say, by the previous Government.  I think it was the present Minister for Industry and Commerce who said on one occasion that they are there and cannot be removed unless they either go bankrupt or go mad.</P>

      <P>Well, you are the people who appointed them, and if the present transport problem in the country is difficult, you have got to take as much blame for it as anybody else.  You cannot have it both ways. I think Deputy O'Sullivan should face the facts.  He talked about buses running alongside the railways.  We have heard Deputy Corry talk on that, too, from time to time.  The Deputy does not want the buses running alongside the trains and he does not want the branch lines closed.  What I suggest to the Deputy and to his colleagues is <Col N="1243" /> that, when they are making speeches on this subject, they should remember that if there are any flaws in the transport position at the moment it is the people in their Party who are responsible for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only speak in regard to Dublin.  I would say at this stage that the board, as bad as they are painted, have certainly made a great improvement in the transport services in Dublin, and I sincerely hope that every effort will be made, and I am satisfied it will be made, to improve bus services to outlying districts such as Finglas, Ballyfermot and other places.  Great improvement has taken place.  There was a big hold-up due to the electricians' strike. That has been remedied and, as far as Dublin is concerned, we have a very good service of buses in the city which is a credit to C.I.E.  I do not think the bus services in other cities in the world are as good as the service in this city.  The conductors and drivers are very courteous, and during peak periods do everything possible to meet the big demand on them.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Fine Gael people to remember that they put in this board. They put in the present managing director, and he is there for a certain time.  They should face the fact that they are responsible for all the faults about which Deputy O'Sullivan is talking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as C.I.E. is concerned, there is a big problem and, as has been said, it is one that will not be solved overnight. Whatever money the Minister is looking for, it is to continue men in employment.  If they do not get this money, are they to be thrown out on the street?  Are the men in Inchicore, Broadstone and elsewhere to be put on the labour exchanges?  If that is to be the position, the Opposition will be looking for the figures of men sacked from Broadstone, Inchicore and elsewhere. There is a big problem.  It is a question of giving this extra money to keep men in employment and to maintain the services.  At least we are <Col N="1244" /> being honest about it on this side.  We are facing the facts.  We are providing the money.  We are not like the Coalition.  Before they went out of office money was needed for C.I.E. and they failed to give it.  They failed to provide the money and when Fianna Fáil came back we had to pay their debts for C.I.E.  That is ancient history by now but it is no harm to repeat the truth.  It was a task that we had to carry out and we certainly did it.</P>
    <P>It is well to remind the people on the other side of the House that they were not defeated in this House; they were not put out; they were not defeated here on a vote.  They left of their own accord but, when they did leave, they certainly left us a headache in regard to debts to C.I.E.  They scuttled the ship, if you like, and the Tánaiste felt that he would have to meet the debts in order to keep the system going and to keep the workers that are still there in employment. You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot keep the system going unless you have money.  We are being honest. We are telling you exactly what we want and not leaving anybody else to pay our debts.  That has never been our practice and I do not think it ever will be.</P>
    <P>Once more, I would pay tribute to the improved services in Dublin and I sincerely hope they will continue.</P>

      <P>No matter what Deputy Gallagher may think about the improved bus services in Dublin, he must admit that Deputy Liam Cosgrave, Deputy Alfie Byrne and Deputy Tom Byrne are the three men responsible for that.  It is well known and widely known that that is the case. Deputy Alfred Byrne, in particular, has left nothing undone and it is to his credit that there are considerable improvements in the bus services in and around Dublin.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Minister's statement introducing the Estimate he dealt with the various aspects of C.I.E.  But anyone who is in close contact with C.I.E. or who travels by C.I.E. knows quite well the reasons for their failure, the reasons for the bad service and why they are going from bad to worse.</P>
      <P>The Great Southern Railway, to a fairly successful extent, carried out transport operations for a considerable time.  I imagine that it would have been much better to have left them alone rather than for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government to bring about the birth of C.I.E.  In the event of this Estimate being approved by the House, will we get a guarantee from the Tánaiste that no more employees of C.I.E. will be dismissed either permanently or temporarily?  Will we get a guarantee from the Tánaiste that existing services will not be curtailed?  Can we have a guarantee from the Tánaiste that the existing services, whether good or bad, will not be taken from the public?</P>
      <P>I do not think the Tánaiste has given any guarantee that dismissals from C.I.E. will not continue in future. Surely the Minister must be very well aware that in Limerick, in my own constituency and in Dublin dismissals from C.I.E. have not been on a small scale.  Many fathers of families who are employed in C.I.E. do not know whether they will be in their employment next month or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde compared C.I.E. with any other business concern. He was quite right in doing so.  I am sure the Minister for Industry and <Col N="1246" /> Commerce would have to agree with Deputy Dr. Esmonde when he says that if there was any particular board of directors administering the affairs of a company in such a way as to lose, not only thousands, but millions of pounds in the year they would not be left in charge of the concern.  It does not matter what Government put them there; I am inclined again on this occasion to agree with Deputy Hickey that after all the talk as to what the first Government did, or what the second Government did, or what the third Government did, it is the Government that is in power that has the responsibility, no matter what other Governments did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government that is in has the responsibility.  If the Government of the day finds that a board cannot discharge their duties economically and efficiently, it is their job to change the board.  It is their job to replace them by sound and practical business men who will run the concern at a profit, not a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>What would it cost the State to dismiss them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that the Government realise that they have their responsibility.  But, when they are depending on a number of Independent Deputies to support them in the event of taking drastic action, we cannot expect them to take drastic action in that respect.  We know quite well that what is responsible for some of the recent losses of C.I.E. and for a large portion of this Estimate is the last Budget.  C.I.E. have a large number of lorries and private cars belonging to the company as well as the buses and that all these vehicles must be taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These vehicles must be taxed by C.I.E. at the Government's increased rates.  As has been pointed out, owing to the continued increase in the cost of living, the trade unions representing the various workers in C.I.E. have made just claims for increases in wages and these must also be met.  I am convinced that, if it were not for the <Col N="1247" /> last Budget of the Minister for Finance, C.I.E.'s financial position would not be as bad as it is or will be in the future. With regard to employment in C.I.E., it cannot be denied that a large number of workers are at present on half-time or short-time and that every effort is being made by the company to have their staffs very drastically reduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made reference to the closing of the branch lines and expressed the genuine grievance which people in particular areas have at being deprived of their branch lines.  We know that in areas where there are no bus services or road services provided the rail services are the backbone of the fairs which are held in the different towns.  If you close the branch lines in these areas, you will kill the fairs, which will mean killing the trade in the towns, because buyers and others interested in live stock will go somewhere where there are services provided and the towns as a result of the branch lines being closed will be reduced to deserted villages.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that it is very unbusinesslike and improper that C.I.E. should have railway services running in competition with road services. They should have a definite policy as to whether they are going to operate on the railway lines or on the roads. If C.I.E. developed the railway services on a larger and better and more efficient scale and used the buses to feed the railway services then they might show some profit some time, or at least endeavour to pay their own way.  I think it would be well worth a trial.  In the West of Ireland we have railway services and bus services, one taking traffic from the other.  We have C.I.E. lorries taking the transport of merchandise away from railways.  Yet we are told that a case can be put up that such-and-such a branch line must be closed because it it not paying. Figures will be produced by C.I.E. to show that a particular branch line is not paying, while at the same time traffic is being diverted from the railways to the roads.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, a number of branch lines have been temporarily <Col N="1248" /> closed and are about to be permanently closed.  The Transport Tribunal invited interested parties to put forward their case for the reopening of the branch lines.  That is not the duty of the local people.  It is the duty of C.I.E. and the Transport Tribunal to give the local people the reasons for closing down the various branch lines. It is most irregular and most unbusinesslike that the local people in a particular area must put forward a case. I believe it is the duty of C.I.E. to put forward their case for the closing of the lines.  The suggestion put forward by Deputies on this side of the House is well worthy of consideration, namely, that copies of the case put forward by C.I.E. for the closing of any branch lines should be furnished to county councils, county committees of agriculture, town commissioners, development associations and other responsible people who have made protests.</P>
    <P>I do not know what C.I.E.'s plans are for the development of the canals, whether it is proposed to leave the canals as they are, whether it is proposed to develop them or what it is proposed to do about them.  The position is that the C.I.E. has taken over the Grand Canal Company.  They have taken over the various canal stores and offices and they are responsible for the payment of rents, rates and taxes and for the administration of the canal company generally.  The Minister has made no reference to this.  We should hear what C.I.E.'s plans are in connection with the canals.  It is only right that C.I.E. should face up to their responsibilities, where they have responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Time and again representations have been made to the canal section that they should undertake the repair of certain canal roads or lines, as they are called, and on each occasion C.I.E. have refused to accept responsibility and stated that it was the duty of the local authority to repair the various canal roads and lines, despite the fact that they have put up notices that the canal roads and lines are private property and that transport over a certain laden weight must not use them.  I think that C.I.E. and the Minister would be very well advised to examine <Col N="1249" /> that whole situation, because repeated representations have been made, even by Fianna Fáil Deputies representing Laois and Offaly regarding the canal road at Ballycommon, which is the only road to the Catholic church.  Repeated representations have been made to C.I.E.  That body's engineers have been down and have interviewed the parish priest.  Nothing has been done and the position is now so deplorable the local people cannot use any kind of transport along that particular road. The repair of that road is definitely the responsibility of C.I.E.</P>
    <P>The railway carriages and the buses that are operated by C.I.E. at the present time are no credit to our transport system in this year of grace, 1953. We hear a good deal of talk of An Tóstal and the advantages that will accrue to the country as a result of that festival.  We hear a good deal about the manner in which we propose to receive the visitors to this country on that occasion.  If any of the people who come here care to have a joy ride down the country in C.I.E. buses they will take away with them a very strange experience.</P>
    <P>The buses on the long-distance routes at the moment were too old for the scrapheap ten years ago.  They are noisy; they backfire constantly.  There are explosions and stoppages on the route, to say nothing of all the stops in the different towns.  There are extraordinary smells from the exhaust. The buses on the long-distance routes at the moment are a disgrace.  It is only right that Deputies on an occasion such as this should direct the attention of the company and the House to the disgraceful type of vehicle in which the people are expected to travel.</P>
    <P>A bus leaves Mountmellick at 7.45 a.m.  It reaches the City of Dublin at 10.25.  Mountmellick is only 52 miles from the city.  It is odd that one cannot have a bit of comfort in those three hours travelling a distance of 50 miles, and it puzzles me that anyone avails of this service.  The services all round are too slow.  There are the most extraordinary delays.  Take the buses coming from Cork and Limerick. The first inquiry people make at Roscrea is to ask where is the nearest <Col N="1250" /> chemist so that they can get plasters or rubs for their backs.</P>

      <P>I think it is very important that we should go into detail.  If we have to contribute towards C.I.E. we equally have the right to ensure that the people will be given a reasonably good service. The buses are draughty.  The windows are broken.  The winds blow in from every quarter.  Everyone who travels by bus knows that.  The door at the end of the bus is left open, possibly to enable the conductor to discharge his duties.  The windows, as I said, are also open, and there is a through draught right up through the centre of the bus.  There are no heating facilities.  In fact, one would be far better off running either behind or before the bus.  The passengers know that quite well.</P>
      <P>The bus services are deplorable. People will now endeavour to travel any other way they possibly can in order to avoid travelling by bus.  I am sure the Minister and Deputy MacBride and Deputy Cowan will agree that in the London buses one at least has a comfortable seat.  In Paris there will not be 15 or 20 minute stops in every second street.</P>

      <P>If any step is taken by C.I.E. or by the Government to deprive private hauliers and private lorry owners of the right of discharging their obligations it will be met with very, very serious and strenuous opposition by the people in the country.  I hope that the Government will long delay consideration of any decision in that respect.  The Minister knows that protests have reached his office from all quarters.  I think it would be most unfair to deprive industrial concerns and companies of the right to transport their own goods in their own commercial vehicles.  This Party will do its utmost to oppose any action of the Government in interfering with the <Col N="1252" /> rights of private citizens to use their own lorries whatever way they like and for as long as they like.  If any action is taken in that respect by C.I.E. or the Minister and his Department it will have very serious consequences on industry.</P>
      <P>There is one industry in my constituency which sends large consignments of their particular products from Clara in Offaly to Donegal, for example.  If that concern had to avail of the services provided by C.I.E. it would suffer considerable inconvenience.  It would suffer financial loss and that would result in loss of employment by those who are at present engaged in the business.</P>
      <P>I hope that even the Fianna Fáil Deputies will have the courage to make themselves heard and felt in order to ensure that nothing will be done to deprive private concerns of the use of their own lorries.  I understand that this matter is still under consideration by the Government.  On an occasion such as this the Minister should indicate to the House what the future prospects are and he should state whether it is proposed at an early date to restrict the distance over which private lorries can travel or whether it is proposed to give an assurance to the owners of such lorries.  I am sure that most of our industries and most of our business concerns are very deeply disturbed by any attempt or even by a suggestion that the mileage of the lorries should be in any way limited.</P>
      <P>I am opposed very strongly to this, and the Party with which I have the honour to be associated will certainly do their utmost to defeat the Government in any such attempt to deprive the people of the right to use their own lorries when they like and how they like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We always have a discussion on C.I.E. something on the lines of the discussion this evening, and we always have from Deputy Flanagan a speech such as he has just made.  Deputy Flanagan knows that proposals have been made to the Government by the Board of C.I.E. for the purpose of limiting or restricting the mileage of private lorries.  There <Col N="1253" /> have been many serious objections to that course from many parts of the country, but I think that a proposal such as that is a proposal that must receive very deep consideration from the Government and from every person who is concerned with the problem of finding employment for our transport workers in the transport industry.  Up to the moment no decision has been taken and no decision could very well be taken.</P>
      <P>It is just as well we should remember that the proposal has been made by the board that was appointed by the last Government and that board, as was stated at the time, was the very type of board that should not be appointed by a Government to deal with a problem such as the transport problem.  It was a question when they were appointed of trying to reconcile certain conflicting interests.  It was a question of trying to provide space on the board for representatives of particular groups.  It was obvious that the board, so constituted and so appointed, could not possibly handle the difficult situation which they had to face and, as the Minister has said on many occasions, the Government and the Minister are saddled with this board for a particular period of time. If the Government or the Minister were to dismiss that board to-morrow it would cost the taxpayers of the country quite a considerable sum of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the five-year period is not up yet.  The position then is that, so far as the particular board is concerned, we have it for a period of five years from the date they were appointed, and what the House will have to consider is not the crossroads type of contribution we had a few minutes ago but this very serious problem in all its ramifications and complications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point has been made that there is competition between the C.I.E. road service and the C.I.E. rail service and that competition is objected to as being wasteful and inefficient.  But in <Col N="1254" /> the very same breath there is an objection taken to the closing of branch lines that are inefficient.  It is very hard to understand the logic of some of the contributions we have in this House from time to time.  If competition between road and rail is inefficient and wasteful, and if it is sought by the board of C.I.E. to eliminate some of that competition, I do not think they can be condemned on both sides.</P>
    <P>Transport in this and every other country is not a thing that is static. Is is a thing that is changing from decade to decade.  C.I.E. bus and lorry transport and C.I.E. rail services are very seriously hit by the private motor-car and by the private lorry. The Minister and the Government can step out of it, and they can let the competition exist between the private motor-car and the railways and the buses or between the private lorries and the goods services of C.I.E. road or rail.  They could do that, but we would have a position of absolute chaos.  I do not think anybody wants the form of regimentation that is suggested by Deputy Flanagan and other Deputies; in other words, that people will be obliged to travel in a particular way.  That is a suggestion that is there.  There is the suggestion of absolutely free and unrestricted competition, and in the same breath there is the suggestion of regimentation so that unfortunate people will have to travel the way they are ordered to travel.</P>
    <P>Taking our rail and bus services by and large, they are as good as you will get in any other country in the world, and they are better than the transport services that are provided in quite a number of countries.  As far as I can judge it, the whole trade union movement would be anxious that there should be some organisation of goods services and some organisation of passenger services.  It has always been a plank in Labour Party policy that transport should be completely under public control.  If we have the competition that is there at the moment between very heavy lorries and the lorries owned by C.I.E. and the trains run by C.I.E. it is obvious <Col N="1255" /> there must be waste and inefficiency everywhere.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>(2) Not less than one month before making any such declaration as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section the road authority shall publish in at least two newspapers circulating in their functional area notice of their intention to consider the making of such declaration and such notice shall contain such particulars as may be prescribed.</P>
      <P>Under Section 25 of the Local Government Act, 1925, the parent section to which this Bill applies, public notice in two local newspapers must be given of a local authority's intention to declare a road a public road.  This is a desirable provision and it is proposed in this amendment to ensure that public notice will also be given of a local authority's intention to declare a road a public road under the powers conferred by the Bill.

    <P>Under the Bill, as it stands, it would be for the manager to decide whether to take over a road as a public road. I think the general intention was, however, that this should be a reserved function to be exercised by the elective council.  The Special Committee agreed that it would be a good idea to introduce this amendment on the Report Stage.</P>
    <P>In addition to making the power of declaring a road a public road under Section 2 a reserved function, the amendment seeks to make the parent power under Section 25 of the Local Government Act, 1925, a reserved function also, as it would be ridiculous to have one power a managerial function and the other a reserved function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <P>I think this is a desirable amendment.  When the Bill was introduced, I intended that the decision to declare these roads public roads should be left to councils and not to county managers.  The Minister has now enshrined that in the Bill.  For many years past much criticism was levelled at local bodies on the ground that most of their powers have been stripped and handed over to county managers.  One very desirable feature of this Bill is that power is now given to local authorities to decide for themselves what roads they in their wisdom consider to be of public importance. This is of benefit also in that the criticism levelled at councils is that they are more or less inclined to leave many of their duties in the hands of the county managers.  Under this Bill, considerable power will be given to local authorities regarding the repair of certain types of roads.  If that power were left to the county manager, it was quite possible that various councils would be utilising the Managerial Act as an excuse for not carrying out very necessary repair work.  Now that the power lies in the hands of the local authorities themselves, <Col N="1257" /> they will, in my opinion, use those powers with a sense of restraint and of responsibility and therefore I welcome the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a very simple Bill and proposes one solitary amendment.  It is in sub-section (1) of Section 56 of the Friendly Societies Act 1896 and is to insert the word &ldquo;three&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;one&rdquo;.  Under that Act, a member of a registered society may, by writing under his hand, nominate a person to whom any sum of money payable by the society on the death of that member, not exceeding £100, shall be payable at his decease.  The value of money has changed considerably since 1896 and members of friendly societies feel that the sum of £100 is not sufficient and at their request I have put down this amendment which I hope the House will accept.</P>
      <P>If the House does accept it, the Bill will go to a Special Committee and I understand there may be some minor consequential amendments.  As this is a simple Bill and is so necessary, I do not intend to delay the House.  I have pleasure in moving the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment of the Friendly Societies Act which Deputy Cowan is suggesting in this Bill appears to be a desirable one.  As he mentioned, the Act was passed in 1896 and the value of money has changed considerably since then.  The £100 limit fixed in Section 56 of that Act, as the maximum amount which could be paid by such a society on the death <Col N="1258" /> of a member to a person nominated by him could reasonably be raised now to £300.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy says, some consequential amendments would be necessary&mdash;one directly in Section 57 where the same amount is mentioned and another in Section 8.  Section 8 of the Act provides that a friendly society which contracts for the assurance of a gross sum exceeding £200 per annum, or an annuity exceeding £50 per annum, may not be registered under the Friendly Societies Acts.  If the amount which may be nominated is increased to £300, it would be anomalous to maintain this limitation in Section 8, so the £200 limit should also be raised to £300.</P>
      <P>Apart from these consequential amendments, as it is proposed to legislate for amending the Friendly Societies Acts, there are certain other changes which might be made and which I would suggest the Committee should consider.  Section 57 (3) of the Act provides that where, on the death of a nominator, the amount payable to the nominee exceeds £80, a certificate that death duties have been paid must be produced to the friendly society before payment can be made to the nominee.</P>
      <P>The level at which liability to death duties arises has been raised considerably since 1896, and, under the law as it stands, death duty does not commence to be payable below £2,000. It would, therefore, appear to be desirable to dispense completely with that provision of the Act and I may say that I have consulted the Revenue Commissioners and have got their agreement to that course.  Another sub-section of Section 57, dealing with the giving by the Revenue Commissioners of receipts for death duties can also be repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other provisions which I have been considering, but upon which I have not yet got the final views of the Revenue Commissioners.  These are the provisions in Sections 58 and 69, and the question whether these sections should be deleted or amended, so as to take into account the point at which liability to death duty arises in <Col N="1259" /> present day conditions, is also being considered.  By the time the Bill has been considered in Committee, I will have completed the examination of that matter, in the light of the views expressed by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, I think it is a good thing that some Deputy took the initiative of proposing this change.  It is a type of change which should be made, in view of the alteration in circumstances since the original Act was passed, but something which a Government Department, concerned with more pressing matters, might not consider.  In fact, as a point of interest, I should say that there have been very few cases at all in which even the £100 limit appeared to have imposed any hardship, because most of the sums payable on the death of a member to the person he nominates have been substantially less.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I addressed a question to the Minister for Finance asking:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" />&ldquo;if he will state approximately how many persons, civil servants and others, have their place of employment within the precincts of Dublin Castle, and whether it is a fact that most of the buildings in which these persons work are unsuitable for use as offices and are expensive to maintain in a healthy and habitable condition because of structural decay and unsoundness; and, further, if, in view of the growing unemployment among those workers who are usually employed on large-scale building works in the city, he will instruct the Commissioners of Public Works to call for tenders for the reconstruction of the unsound and unsuitable buildings in accordance with the plans which it is understood the Fianna Fáil Government instructed the commissioners to prepare so far back as 1946&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There are at present approximately 1,600 persons, civil servants and others employed within the precincts of Dublin Castle.  The buildings comprised in the castle outside the State Departments are in the main a heterogeneous collection of early 19th century structures&mdash;including a military barracks, coachhouses, stables, etc.&mdash;which have been converted for use as office accommodation.  Most of them are unsuitable for use as permanent premises for Government Departments, being expensive to light, heat and maintain in proper condition.</P>
    <P>As regards the final part of the Deputy's question, tenders for reconstruction works could not be invited until certain buildings which are at present occupied, had been vacated and demolished.  Alternative accommodation for the staffs concerned is not at present available and will not be easy to secure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The House will remember that during the debate on the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department all the oppositions in this House&mdash;I say &ldquo;oppositions&rdquo; as distinct from the Opposition &mdash;laboured and emphasised the figure to which the number of unemployed <Col N="1261" /> had reached at the employment exchanges.  Emphasis was further laid on the fact that a great number of people had lost their employment because of the almost complete cessation of work in the larger building schemes.  We have everybody asserting that we must find work for those unemployed people&mdash;whether they belong to the skilled or unskilled classes&mdash;and side by side with that we have a situation where the State has housed in a building 1,600 persons, a great number of whom are expected to do their daily work as civil servants or employees of the State in so-called offices or buildings which are unsafe, unsound, unhealthy and which could easily become in a very short space of time dangerous.</P>
    <P>I have heard, of course, that members of the Clann na Poblachta Party, referring to Fianna Fáil projects, describe this place as a palace.  Deputy Dillon to-day stated, to use his own words, that he had meandered around the place and saw nothing wrong with it. I take it that many individual Deputies have on occasion visited the various departments in the castle and I am sure they have found it difficult to understand why it is that the Government has delayed dealing with this problem.  We have old stables and coach-houses which the Minister has said have been converted into offices. I have been down there in the winter months.  I know that there are nasty draughts in certain parts of the building. I have seen attempts at heating in all sorts of old fireplaces and men running around with buckets of fuel trying to get the place warm.  I say that anybody aware of these conditions should urge strongly on the Minister to introduce an immediate reconstruction scheme for the building.</P>
    <P>I understand, and I should like the Minister to correct me if I am wrong, that plans were actually prepared and were approved for this particular project in 1946.  I want to know why it is, having regard to all the unemployed about whom there is so much noise, having regard also to the increased availability of materials and the possibility of finding, even temporarily, alternative accommodation for some of <Col N="1262" /> the staffs, we have had to wait until now to deal with this urgent matter.  I shall make a present to the Government of a bit of help or advice in this matter.  I understand from the Minister's own staff at present employed in Lord Edward Street that employees of the Social Welfare Department will be removed shortly, lock, stock and barrel, into that famous edifice&mdash;the Store Street bus station.  There will then be a series of offices temporarily available for staffs who will have to be removed out of the castle until the buildings which they at present occupy are properly reconstructed.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister if he is aware that certain parts of the castle buildings were already condemned for demolition and that at one time, if the staffs in certain parts of it had not been moved out, they were preparing themselves to move out.  If part of a State building has been condemned by State officials and marked out for demolition, how can staffs be kept there indefinitely?  Are we to wait until some part of the building collapses or until we hear that some of the staff have suffered loss of health because of the conditions under which they have to work?  The Dublin Corporation is, if you like, the authority to ensure that buildings in the city are maintained in safe condition but I say to the Minister that if Dublin Castle were in the hands of private owners, a notice would have been long since affixed to part of the building condemning it and, if the owner did not deal with the matter within a very short space of time, he would have either to pay a fine or the building would be taken over by the corporation which would carry out the job.  You cannot do that with the State.  The Corporation of Dublin cannot declare war on the Government, take possession of Government property and do this.  If the position were reversed and if the Government itself found fault to the extent I am finding fault with the condition of these buildings, the entire corporation, together with the city manager, would be removed for permitting the buildings to be in the condition they are in and expecting people to work in them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> I do not know how many people could be employed on this particular job but I know that we have more than sufficient working people available who could be immediately employed on this particular work.  I do not know what the cost will be.  I say that the Minister should be urged to ask for tenders.  I heard a lot of talk at one time about wasteful projects contemplated by governments. There is more waste involved in leaving this series of buildings in the condition they are in and a good deal will have to be expended on the cost of reconstruction if we do not do the job immediately.</P>
    <P>I asked to-day by way of supplementary question whether the Minister was aware that the buildings were being undermined by the Poddle River which flows under the castle.  The Minister admitted that he had been so informed, Is he going to wait until the church building, which is directly over the Poddle River, becomes so undermined that it will collapse?  I say this is an urgent matter.  It is urgent because of the condition of the buildings and it is essential that this matter be dealt with. Moreover, unemployment is rife in our midst and it behoves us not to talk about it but to do something about it. Here is one particular project which can help in doing something about it. I do not know how many hundreds of men might be employed on this, but if you look upon it to a certain extent as a relief scheme it will be a relief scheme of a productive nature and money will not be wasted on it.  It will create something of value for a great number of years.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his reply stated that this building was constructed in the early 19th century.  I do not know whether it is good policy to retain Dublin Castle, with all the memories associated with it, in the shape it is in to-day.  It is in a deteriorated condition and, if left as it is, will be reduced to dust and blown away by the wind.  I do not want to take up the time of the House, but I want to reiterate that this building is in a dangerous condition visibly.  It is <Col N="1264" /> dangerous so far as the health of a number of civil servants who work in the building is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have unemployment.  The materials are available, and this job should be tackled immediately in whatever form or manner the Government choose, but they should get on with the job.  I do not think there is anybody in the House who would find fault with or criticise this proposal.  This is a necessary and essential work.  When the work is completed, it will be good value for money spent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like just to say a few words in support of the case so ably made by Deputy Briscoe.  It is a scandal that a block of offices used by the Government in the centre of our capital city should be in the condition described by Deputy Briscoe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and by the Minister.  It is essential, if we want to make any hole in our unemployment problem, that large schemes such as this should be taken in hand right away.  I would like to see built offices that would be a credit to the Government, to the city and to the country. As has been so well said, we have the materials.  We have the men and there is nothing really that prevents us doing a job of work such as this except the lack of determination to do it.</P>
      <P>I should like to see buildings of that kind constructed of stone.  In our quarries we have quite a number of craftsmen and stonemasons who could get excellent employment in providing the stone that would go towards the construction of buildings such as we should have in Dublin Castle.</P>
      <P>I certainly very strongly support the case made by Deputy Briscoe and I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to announce that work on this will start at once and that it will be work of such a kind that will give the greatest possible employment to our citizens who are idle at present.</P>

      <P>Naturally, with a great deal of what Deputy Briscoe said I agree.  I should like to be able to give to Deputy Cowan and Deputy Briscoe the assurance which they have requested but, unfortunately, the position is that there are about 1,600 civil servants employed in these buildings.  It would be necessary before we could reconstruct them to demolish them and in order to do that we should naturally have to get the people out.</P>
      <P>I have, since this question was put down, raised the matter with the Commissioners of Public Works and they have informed me and I informed the House in turn to-day, that alternative accommodation for the staffs concerned is not at present available. If it were we could proceed with the demolition work.  I understand that the plans for the buildings had reached such a stage in 1948 that we would be able, within a comparatively short period, to invite tenders for the structural framework of the first stage of the buildings which would embrace the reconstruction of the stamp branch, the accountant-general's office and the estate duty office.</P>
      <P>Work of this kind, if we were able to proceed with it, would occupy about two years and during this period the necessary drawings, specifications and quantities for the main contract for the next stage could be completed.  I should very much like if we were in a position to begin the demolition work, to proceed with the preparation of these plans and go ahead with this scheme as originally proposed.  In fact, the existing conditions are exactly those which the Government had in mind when this project was initiated in 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had already been informed that some of these buildings were in a dangerous condition.  Naturally, a certain amount of planning and replanning would be required.  It was intended to plan the reconstruction of Dublin Castle in such a way that the works could be executed from time to time as (1) the condition of the buildings warranted the execution of this work, <Col N="1266" /> and (2) if the employment situation at any time seemed to require that some public work of permanent value should be undertaken in order to relieve it. Unfortunately, as I have said, we find ourselves unable to carry out that plan to-day for the reason that the offices which were vacated in 1947 or 1948 in order to enable the buildings to be demolished have now been reoccupied and it is not possible to provide alternative accommodation.</P>
    <P>However, I can say that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, and myself, are keenly aware of the situation and I shall&mdash;if I can, at any rate&mdash;have the work pushed forward as rapidly as possible.  I greatly regret that I cannot say more than that but that is the position as it stands to-day.  I trust that, with that, Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Cowan will be satisfied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Briscoe and myself could help to make available to the Minister a very nice space of ground on which he could erect temporary accommodation for the civil servants concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already drawn the Minister's attention to the fact that there will be a removal of civil servants from Lord Edward Street to the Bus Station&mdash;the Social Welfare staff.  I agree with Deputy Cowan: I am sure that the rest of my colleagues in the corporation would willingly give the Minister a site of Dublin Corporation property on which some temporary structure could be erected for those who at present work in the castle.  This is a very important matter.  From the point of view of the unemployment position and of the employment which such work would give to ordinary building workers, I urge the Minister to consider doing something in the matter as soon as it is humanly possible.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 2 p.m. on Thursday, 19th February, 1953.</P>
