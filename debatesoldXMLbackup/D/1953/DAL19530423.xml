      <P>The total value of the gross agricultural output (excluding turf) in 1951, compiled according to the methods explained on pp. 81-86 of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i>, June, 1952, was £135,717,000 No account is taken of the value of the changes in the number of live stock on farms in arriving at that total.  The value of the changes in live-stock numbers between the beginning and end of that year was minus £1,131,000. The corresponding data for 1952 are not yet available.</P>

      <P>The precise quantity of wheat delivered to mills for conversion into flour, as distinct from wheaten meal, cannot be stated, as some mills produce both flour and wheaten meal; neither is it possible to state from which crop native wheat delivered to mills is derived, but in general the deliveries during the 12 months ended 31st August would relate to the crop grown in the previous year.</P>

    <P>Note: The figures for 1944-46 have not been adjusted, by making an estimate of the &ldquo;provision for stock appreciation&rdquo; and certain other recomputations, to make them comparable with the recent series covering the years 1947-51.  The differences in <Col N="535" /> content of the two sets of figures are set out on pp. 42-43 of the <i>Irish Statistical Survey</i>, 1950-51 (Pr. 1445).  The data needed for the recalculations for these years are relatively incomplete but suggest that the inclusion of the relevant figures for &ldquo;provision for stock appreciation&rdquo; would not substantially alter the totals given above for the years 1944-46, which are those published in Tables of National Income and Expenditure, 1938 and 1944-50 (Pr. 350).</P>

      <P>I am informed that the insurance companies have not altered the premium rates for motor-cars consequent on the revision of ratings for the purposes of road tax.  Where the revised rating has resulted in a lower horse power, the insurance premium rate has not been reduced, and, where it has entailed a higher horse power, the premium rate has not been increased.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been drawn to a recent statement in the British Parliament by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury answering for the Chancellor of the Exchequer that he was not in a position to state whether or not financial aid had been transferred to Walter Naumann and other German subjects by Sir Oswald Mosley due to the fact that Sir Oswald Mosley was now resident in this country and, therefore, not subject to British exchange controls; and, if so, if he will state whether any financial help in the form of sterling had, in fact, been transferred from this country by Sir Oswald Mosley to Walter Naumann or other German subjects; and, if so, if he sanctioned the transfer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report of the statements referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the confidential nature of information disclosed to the exchange control, I would not in the normal course be willing to answer a parliamentary question bearing on a particular application, or directed towards finding out whether or not a named individual has made an application for a particular purpose.  In this case, however, I feel that it is in the interests both of the exchange control and of the named Irish resident that I should deal with the report mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>No exchange control approval for the transfer of funds to the Federal Republic of Germany for the purpose stated in the Deputy's question has been sought by, or granted to, any Irish resident.  The reply to the second part of the Deputy's question is, therefore, in the negative.</P>

      <P>As particulars of consumption of the commodities mentioned are not available, I propose to give the figures of the net duty-paid quantities retained for home use.  I must point out, however, that there is reason to believe that, in the case of certain of the commodities at least, consumption was in excess of these figures due to the using up without replacement of duty-paid stocks acquired prior to the Budget, 1952.</P>

    <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement showing for the commodities concerned the approximate net duty-paid quantities <Col N="549" /> retained for home use in the year 1952-53.  Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the 18th February, 1953, I gave the Dáil a list of ten proposals for the utilisation of moneys in the Grant Counterpart Special Account, which, at that date, had been presented to the American Embassy for transmission to the United States of America authorities.  Early in March two further proposals, namely, the provision of an agricultural institute and a scheme for the subsidisation of the delivery costs of ground limestone, were submitted to the American authorities.  These 12 proposals account for £5.5 million of the total sum of approximately £6,142,000 now standing to the credit of the special account. As regards the balance of £642,000, which is approximately 10 per cent. of the total, it was proposed that it should be held as a reserve to be applied to such one or more of the specific projects already submitted, as might subsequently appear desirable. I understand that all the proposals are under active consideration by the American authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>No such condition or policy as implied in the question governs the migration of tenants from County Kerry or elsewhere.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that tenants from County Kerry were recommended by officials of his Department?  The main point put forward by his headquarters here in Dublin was that they were vested tenants and they could not be accepted. Even though local conditions warranted their transfer and officials in Tralee recommended their transfer, the migrants concerned were not accepted. That is why there is such discontent, that so many of them who are eligible are deprived of this transfer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>As I have already indicated, the Comhairle and Director of Radio Éireann have been given the maximum freedom to conduct broadcasting free of day-to-day political administrative control, and I would again ask Deputies to address their observations on matters of this kind to the director rather than to me.</P>
      <P>In this instance, however, I should like to say that the broadcaster of &ldquo;The Week in Leinster House,&rdquo; who wrote the article to which the question refers, has never reviewed novels or any other books for Radio Éireann.  He is not a member of the staff and is employed as an outside contributor on a week-to-week basis.</P>

This close season was fixed following on public inquiries held in the district in May, 1952, at which the general trend of evidence tendered in regard to brown trout angling favoured prohibition of such fishing before the 1st March in any year.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Money Resolution in connection with the Health Bill has been ordered for discussion.  I would like at this stage if we had from the Taoiseach or the <Col N="576" /> Minister for Health some statement in connection with the rumours which are circulating in this city and throughout the country.  It is generally rumoured that the Government have received a communication from the Hierarchy in connection with the Health Bill.  I would like to know (1) if that is so, (2) whether we can be made aware of the document which the Hierarchy has issued in connection with the Bill and (3) whether we can be told what steps the Government propose to take in the matter.  It is obviously unfair to the House that it should be asked to consider this Bill in a vacuum.  The House ought to approach the consideration of the Money Resolution and the provisions of the Bill against a realistic background.  Some statement should be made on the matter and the House should be afforded an opportunity of considering the statement.</P>

      <P>I was saying when I moved to report progress that the attitude of the Fine Gael Party to this Bill was characteristic of them. The leopard does not change his spots.  Neither has the Fine Gael Party changed in any way whatsoever.  At every advance of the nation they have stuck their heels in the ground and taken an almost unbelievable attitude.  As it was then, so is it now.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the farmers of Tipperary that I represent I must state that I have no knowledge whatever of any farmer of £50 valuation with a Chrysler car in Tipperary.  Deputy Costello stated in this House that this Bill was principally for the people of £50 valuation and under, with their Chrysler cars.  If any of them have been able to rise to the old baby Ford, more power to their elbow.  They need not thank Deputy Costello or the Fine Gael Party for the prosperity they now enjoy.</P>

      <P>Now Napoleon.  Not to-night, Josephine.  Deputy Mulcahy will have a very difficult job in explaining to the people of Tipperary that the Health Bill is principally for the people with Chrysler cars.  If Deputy Costello had read the Bill he would not make such statements.  He certainly would not have made the statement that certain bus drivers would be exempt from it.  He forgets that every insured person is entitled to the benefits of this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is, apparently, great sympathy for the people of over £50 valuation and the people under £50 valuation are begrudged any benefits this Bill confers on them because of the taxation. Deputy Dillon introduced what is known as the land project scheme. We all realise that it is the farmers over £50 valuation who get the benefits of it.  There was no means test in so far as the wealthy people in this country were concerned then.  This Bill will not commit the country to the same extent as regards finance.  There was going to be £80,000,000 for the rehabilitation scheme.  This Bill will not cost anything like that even over 20 or 25 years.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies have great fears of Communism in this country.  They need not worry.  I assure them that while Ireland holds the remains of its martyred dead Communism will never live.  Do not worry. All the politicians on the other side who, for political reasons, will try to spread rumours of that kind will not get away with it.  Do not worry.  They will not get away with that at all.</P>
      <P>This Bill, Sir, is an honest effort to do something that perhaps we should have tried to do many years ago if the time had been opportune.  Naturally, if you wanted a healthy people one of the first things you had to do was to try to house the people.  There was no use in hoping for a healthy nation while housing was in the horrible condition in which we found it in 1932. Not even one house had been built in a rural area.  That was not conducive to the health of our people.  Now that we have broken the back of the housing problem we can, I believe, with confidence, say that the time is ripe to undertake the task of restoring the health of our people in every possible way and of helping our medical practitioners to restore the health of our people.  This Bill will go down in history as one of the most beneficial and one of the greatest steps forward that Fianna Fáil has been responsible for.</P>
      <P>I must refute statement made by Deputy O'Higgins, Junior, statements that should not be made, with regard to the previous Minister for Health. Deputy Dr. Browne on every possible occasion showed that he was a man of great courage, a man who had the interests of the sick poor at heart. When he was Minister in the Coalition Government I said, just as I say now, that he was the one Minister that should be admired.  He should be admired.</P>

There might be a black sheep here or there, but the medical profession should not be censured because of that.  On the whole, our Irish doctors are second to none, they are humane, and while at times they may be a little bit cross, through being brought out of bed late at night or something else, they do their work conscientiously and well.  This Bill will enable them to do it in a more perfect way, it will give them more confidence, regardless of how they may interpret it now, and more appreciation of their work for the sick poor.  I sincerely hope that Deputy Costello's statement that all the farmers under £50 valuation have Chrysler cars will be perfectly true long before we have seen the end of this Bill.</P>

The rules of order do not allow me to use those two words and I leave them to people's imagination. He was challenged as to whether he said the truth.  Of course he did not. It is mild to say it was untrue, it was the furtherest end of the scale from the truth, it was simply the last thing from the truth, it was the assassination of truth.

      <P>I am exposing this thing which has gone on too long and killing what has been put through the country for years.  Every Fianna Fáil propagandist who cannot find any other kind of dishonesty to utter inevitably comes back to this scandalous statement.  It is a shock to me that a matter which has been discussed in this House before can still be gone back on year after year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing this Money Resolution in very peculiar circumstances. We had this Resolution tabled over a week ago.  We had two members of the Government Party, as far as I remember, people attached to the Government, who spoke for it.  One was the Minister for Health.  He made a hurried intervention in the debate after Deputy Costello indicated on behalf of our Party complete and utter detestation of the whole measure and gave the reasons why we are going to object to it in the most strenuous way possible.  The only other person attached to the Government who came into that debate was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Kennedy.  It was indicated in the course of a question that Deputy Kennedy went down to Westmeath County Council and we <Col N="594" /> find what he said reported in the <i>Midland Herald</i> of April 2.  We find that a resolution was tabled protesting against this Bill and that Deputy Kennedy rode into the fray as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Referring to the moral aspect, Mr. Kennedy said the Fine Gael Party saw fit to pontificate on morals and set themselves up as judges, claiming that right was on their side; that on their side was virtue while everything opposed to them was guilty. They had dragged in the Cardinal and the Bishops on their side.  Thirty years ago, they had shook the Bishops at the Republican Party and threatened them with excommunication but that cock would not crow any more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Kennedy, speaking for the Government, said that that cock would not crow any more.  With that phrase ringing in our ears, we are supposed to close our ears to what the people are speaking about and what we all know, and that is that a letter was sent to four newspapers for publication. It was addressed to the faithful of the country.  I understand one of the phrases used in it was that notwithstanding the points that have been excised from the 1947 Health Act, what is left in it is not in harmony with Catholic teaching.  The answer of the Government to that is to use their best effort, successful so far, to have the letter delayed, and they are using that effort, I understand, to have that letter suppressed.</P>
    <P>This House is surely entitled to know in what atmosphere we are debating this legislation.  Is it actually a corpse on our hands?  Has it been found riddled with moral disease, or is it something that an attempt will be made to restore to life by artificial methods?  Will the Minister for Health come in here as truculent as he was in his attitude to the doctors and Deputies and to every amendment put down?  Will he come in and be brought to some point of bitter sweet reasonableness and frame legislation which will get inside the principles of Catholic teaching?</P>
    <P>I sought for a long time to find out whether there was anything good in <Col N="595" /> this legislation and I did discover, tucked away in the end in the repeal section, something that I thought at least was of good.  In the Schedule, under the heading of &ldquo;Enactments Repealed&rdquo;, we have a reference to the Health Act of 1947, and I find there amongst the repealed sections Sections 21 to 28.  These sections are well known to people who were in this House as early as 1947 when the first fumbling and blundering efforts were made to introduce health legislation in this country.  We did not know at the time, but we know now that, in connection with that health legislation of 1947, a letter had been addressed by the Hierarchy to the present Taoiseach, who was then Taoiseach, indicating the Hierarchy's grave disapproval of various parts of it, more particularly Part III, which contains these sections which are now being repealed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be subjected to the muddled examination of the Deputy.  I am quoting from the Bishops' letter of the 7th October, 1947, addressed to Deputy de Valera, the Taoiseach, and his Government. The Hierarchy pointed out that to claim such powers with regard to the mother and child service for the public authority, without qualifications, is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family, the rights of the Church in education, the rights of the medical profession and of voluntary institutions. That was the condemnation on the moral side, and so successfully was that letter hidden that we knew nothing about it until we became the Government in 1948.  About that time, in 1947, Deputy James Dillon had started proceedings in the courts to have these Sections 22 to 28 inclusive declared unconstitutional.  There was <Col N="596" /> an objection, therefore, to these sections from two points of view; the moral angle about which we had no knowledge in relation to the approach of the Church, and Deputy Dillon's angle from the point of view of a person looking to the Constitution and seeking an interpretation there of certain sections.  Deputy Dillon's action did not come to hearing, because Deputy Dillon had not to wait to get the judgment of the court as to the unconstitutionality of these sections. He got that opinion from an Attorney-General, and the Government in 1948 decided these sections would have to be removed.</P>
      <P>The sections were very definitely criticised from the point of view of the power they gave the central authority, and particularly the lay authority, in connection with motherhood, and from the point of view of the power that was given with regard to children and the general power to safeguard and improve health and physical education and provide for educational matters relating to the health and treatment of illnesses and defects and in the ascertaining of cases of mental deficiency.  These were then unconstitutional in our opinion.  We know now they have been criticised as being contrary to the moral law.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I was entitled to regard the present legislation with some suspicion even when Sections 22 to 28 had disappeared from it, because there is the same Taoiseach under whose auspices the legislation in 1947 was brought forward.  He was again Taoiseach when the 1952 Bill was introduced. In 1947, Dr. Ryan was Minister for Health.  Again, in 1952, he was Minister for Health.  He has presumably the same Department of Health officials around him as he had in 1947. There is the same Attorney-General as <Col N="598" /> there was in 1947, the Attorney-General who said that these sections were all right.  I presume he gave the same advice in 1952.  When Fianna Fáil speak on this they say that the Constitution is there for the protection of the community.  There is, in particular, Article 45, the directive Article of the Constitution.  Do not forget that the Constitution was there in 1947 and the directive Article on social policy was there, too, Article 45.</P>
      <P>I wonder what the present position is.  Have these sections been completely abandoned without any possibility of their return?  I find that Section 4 says as clearly as words can say it that this legislation is to be free.  There is to be a free choice.  The Minister has interpreted that in these terms: it is free as far as the doctor is concerned because he can come into the scheme, if he wishes, or he can stay outside; it is free as far as the applicant is concerned; it is free as far as institutions are concerned.</P>
      <P>Our attention was directed to Section 18.  A little later we got a new Section 18 thrown at us by way of amendment.  As far as certain sections of the public are concerned I think I am not wrong in stating that the Minister's new Section 18 is causing considerable anxiety and great scruple amongst the nuns who run our secondary schools where day pupils are attending and amongst Catholic headmasters running secondary schools where day boys are attending.  I do not know if the Minister will say I am going beyond what is in the Bill when I state that, as far as religious communities of nuns responsible for the education of children are concerned, they have indicated that they will not allow this section, if passed, to operate in connection with their schools.  The Catholic headmasters dealing with day pupils in secondary schools have indicated their complete objection to this section and have gone so far as to say, as far as I am aware, that they will not allow it to operate if it is within their power to prevent its operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that in Section 4 everything is open to choice and there is free choice.  I wonder what other errors might be hidden in this <Col N="599" /> particular piece of legislation now that we know how free the choice really is. Objection was taken to the 1947 Act on general principles and not so much along certain sections.  The phrase used was that the Bill in principle was contrary to Catholic teaching, the rights of the family and the rights of the Church in connection with education and to the rights of the medical profession and of voluntary institutions. It is noteworthy that in that context the rights of the family come first. We know that since the legislation of 1947 many well informed members of the Church and many learned men have directed their comments, without directly aiming at the Government or individual members of the Government, towards this legislation.  The one fundamental objection they have to this legislation is summed up in the phrase that it deprives the community of their responsibility and deprives fathers of families of their responsibility to educate their children, physically as well as mentally.</P>
    <P>Objection was made that if this legislation went much further and there was much more in the way of State control, that inevitably must have the effect of weakening self-reliance and breaking down the moral fibre of the community.  Yet, we get this piece of legislation welcomed, as it was in this House, in the phrase that it represented egalitarianism, and that was apparently something to be proud of.  Consider the egalitarianism that is in this measure.  It is equality at the lowest possible level.  The one phrase that has been repeated by the Minister for Health over and over again in the course of this debate is that those who want to avail of this and the free services provided under it must avail of them in the public ward.  That is equality at public ward level.  The Bill specifically prohibited any provision being given to people who take treatment in private or semi-private homes.  In that respect it is a great contrast to the British legislation. As if he delighted in it, however, the Minister harps on that again and again.  If there is equality in this measure it is equality at the lower <Col N="600" /> income group, and not even at the level of the middle income group.  It is equality at the level of those who are described in the Public Assistance Act as folk who, by their own industry or lawful means, cannot provide their own essential medical services.</P>
    <P>In the light of that, we gaily set forward, leaving clerical objections out of it altogether, on this voyage towards social betterment, and the improvement of health services and the level of social betterment and improved health services is treatment in the public wards.  I should have thought that if there is anything to be improved in social conditions here on the health side it would have been our ambition to work upwards from the public ward situation and to get away from that atmosphere altogether.  If lack of medical staff, lack of sufficient nurses or lack of buildings meant that for some time, at any rate, we had to continue with the public wards in our hospitals it should be our endeavour to ensure that they would not be crowded with new applicants and that the horrors of the public wards would not be extended for a wider circle of the citizens than those who qualified for public assistance and were forced to put up with these rather shocking conditions.  When the Hierarchy did condemn in 1947, in the letter to the Taoiseach, and when later the blundering of Deputy Dr. Browne brought the fullest possible condemnation from them, they did not confine themselves to a negative approach to this matter. In one of the letters that they wrote, dated 5th April, 1951, this sentence occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Archbishops and Bishops desire to express once again approval of a sane and legitimate health service which will properly safeguard the health of mothers and children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the end of that letter this sentence occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Accordingly, the Hierarchy have firm confidence that it will yet be possible, with reflection and calm consultation, for the Government to provide a scheme which, while it affords due facilities for those whom the State, as guardian of the common <Col N="601" /> good, is rightly called upon to assist, will none the less respect, in its principles and implementation, the traditional life and spirit of our Christian people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a letter dated 8th March, 1951, from the Archbishop of Dublin, this phrase occurs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I welcome any legitimate improvement of medical services for those whose basic family wage or income does not readily assure the necessary facilities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A second paragraph follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And if proof be needed of my attitude, I may be permitted to point to many actions of my Episcopate, in particular to the work of the Catholic Social Service Conference founded by me, more especially to its maternity welfare centres.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Towards the end of a letter dated 10th October, 1950, this sentence comes in:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Bishops are most favourable to measures which would benefit public health, but they consider that instead of imposing a costly bureaucratic scheme of nationalised medical service, the State might well consider the advisability of providing the maternity hospitals and other institutional facilities which are at present lacking and should give adequate maternity benefits and taxation relief for large families.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to stress these sentences because of the dishonest criticism that has occurred with regard to the efforts of the Hierarchy to perform their teaching office in this community and because of the efforts to misrepresent that attitude and to make these people appear as if they were anxious merely about taxation, that they had no care for the poor and certainly saw no necessity for improving the health as well as the social services for those who could not provide these things for themselves.  At a meeting of the Government to which I belonged, on the 7th April, 1951, this decision was taken:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...that in the light of the Government's conviction that <Col N="602" /> mothers and children should not be deprived of the best available health care by reason of insufficient means, a scheme or schemes for a mother and child health service should, as soon as possible, be prepared and undertaken which would</P>
    <P>(a)  provide the best modern facilities for those whose family wage or income does not permit them to obtain, of themselves, the health care that is necessary for mothers and children and,</P>
    <P>(b)  be in conformity with Catholic social teaching,...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Immediately after that decision was taken and for a brief month or two there was, for the first time since inter-meddling with health affairs happened in this country, a period of co-operation in which the professional men outside&mdash;the doctors&mdash;met with the professional men&mdash;the doctors&mdash;in the Department of Health and with others. That co-operation was enthusiastically given by the professional men, both those in the Department and those who were outside.  Their enthusiasm was to provide a real scheme which would have benefited everybody because the principles were good, the extent was no way meagre, the methods adopted would have ensured smooth working and got a scheme that could work and be made work because the profession were behind it.  Now, after all the years&mdash;notwithstanding the warnings that were given to the Taoiseach in 1947, notwithstanding the many warnings and the effort to correct and the efforts to guide that met with such lamentable ill-success in the case of Deputy Dr. Browne&mdash;Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Health, apparently finds himself in exactly the same position that Deputy Dr. Browne was in about two years ago.  Again we have the tactics of suppression.  Nobody knew anything about the letter of October, 1947, addressed to the then Taoiseach until it was disclosed in the Dáil Debates that took place and Deputy Dr. Browne did what was called here &ldquo;make a sacrifice&rdquo; but which I have heard phrased differently&mdash;&ldquo;had a sacrifice imposed on him.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to the Taoiseach's statement <Col N="603" /> earlier this afternoon the Minister for Health is now conducting the business of the Government in the ordinary way.  The ordinary way, apparently, is to take steps to have the publication of a letter at least delayed&mdash;a letter which, incidentally, was not addressed to the Government specially, a letter that was addressed to the community, a letter which was intended to be for the guidance of the community and which, I understand, is founded upon the teaching office of those who composed the letter.  So far the publication of that letter has been suppressed even though it is addressed to the community and is for the guidance of the community.  Again we have the same difficulties.  Is there the freedom that a Catholic community should have?  Is the responsibility left to parents&mdash;fathers and mothers&mdash; within a Catholic community which, according to Catholic teaching, ought to be left to them?  Is that the position or has it been found that again there is a breakdown and that another Health Bill will have to be scrapped entirely or will have to be amended so completely that it will be very far away from the piece of proposed legislation that got the acclamation of certain peculiar odd people in this House in the past ten days?  Has the Minister amendments that he can speak of when he is replying to this Money Resolution? Will we know before the Money Resolution is passed what the money is required for?  Is it for something that now lies under condemnation or is it for some new scheme that the Minister will have hurriedly to think up?  That is one of the ghastly parts of this.  I myself did not consider it credible, in view of the warnings given in this earlier correspondence, that any responsible person entrusted with preparing health legislation could have neglected to have association with those who composed these letters.  I believe he had that association and that he had that association over many months.  I believe also that recently when this matter was mounting to a climax here and outside, the Minister was visited by at least one member of the Hierarchy, who, I am sure, gave <Col N="604" /> his best in the way of advice and offered him his best in the way of guidance out of the embarrassing difficulties into which he had landed. Do not forget that this legislation, this Estimate for the Department and this Money Resolution have been before the House and the public for very many weeks.  We had the phrases used here that it was socialism and it was welcomed as socialism.  We had this peculiar phrase about egalitarianism, that at last it had been achieved, and although the toe was only in the door we still would get freedom to kick the door down and make our proper advance to socialist medicine.</P>
    <P>Defiantly it was said in this House that the Hierarchy of this country knew how to defend themselves; that this legislation had been before this country and before the Dáil for many months, and yet there had not been one word, one line or cheep of protest against it.  There was not.  As far as that member, Deputy Dr. Browne, or as far as any of us knew, that was the case.  The Minister knew how false that was, because he had been approached and he had these criticisms. Yet he shambled along, apparently impenetrable to argument and insensitive to any matter of principle, apparently unaffected by any reason until we again got this collision that had occurred in 1947, 1950 and 1951.  Again we had the huddled business, smuggling behind closed doors, and the suppression of what the public are entitled to know, in an effort to get the Minister breathing space so that he need not appear shamefaced, having to confess what went wrong.  He would not be in such a lamentable position if he had accepted, when proffered, the advice which he is now rather reluctantly going to take.  However, those aspects will come out later.</P>
    <P>In this House there has been a great deal of adverse comment of the medical profession.  The medical profession, in all this matter, are supposed to be acting very selfishly.  Despicable phrases were used about them by the Minister for Health that he presumed arose out of something said over in England.  The situation would soon <Col N="605" /> develop like that in England, and the doctors would find they are financially better off under the health services plans, but in England, while they are better off, they objected, because they had to pay income-tax.  That, coming from a member of the profession, was cast at the I.M.A. as being presumably the reason why they objected to this scheme.  They might make a bit more money, but they would be compulsorily honest.  They would have to put in the correct income-tax returns and to that degree might lose.  There, in any event, this legislation turned aside from the profession.  The profession were to be at the best ignored; the county manager, a lay person, was to take on a variety of important responsibilities under these proposals.</P>
    <P>I say the profession were at the best to be ignored.  Deputy McGrath had a different view.  Deputy McGrath wants them prosecuted or possibly manda-mused into doing their duty.  Deputy McGrath thought that after this legislation passed those who held themselves out as unwilling to co-operate or work the scheme should have the Attorney-General put on to them.  That is the free society into which Ireland is drifting.  Under Section 4 everything was to be free but when it came to the practical application if people did not co-operate the Attorney-General would get after them.  They would be either prosecuted in the Criminal Court or efforts would be made, I suppose by some application of mandamus, to get unwilling doctors to give the services under the health proposals that they are expected to give.</P>
    <P>I know that in 1950 there were different proposals.  The view of the Minister for Health in those days was that the Department had power to insist on the dispensary doctors coming in under the scheme.  The attitude was put up in a minute which still remains on a file in the Minister's Department and which he can see, that the Department believed they could operate these powers and when they did the others would have to come in or that the others would cave in.</P>
    <P>We have the situation in which the profession are opposed to this legislation. <Col N="606" /> They have expressed their view that the scheme is unworkable, it will not be a good one and they will not co-operate.  Reading the debates and listening to what has been said on this question, I have waited to have somebody put up a reason why the doctors should behave in this way.  Their conduct at least merits a question mark. Why are they behaving in this way? I understand that it is accepted by those who speak for the Government that these health proposals will mean expenditure of more money on health services.  If that is the case I should imagine&mdash;and I think the Minister for Health accepts this himself&mdash;that the members of the medical profession would benefit financially.  Why, against their financial interests, do they take this line?  The cheapjack way of speaking of it is to say it is only Merrion Square and the crescents who object and they apparently have power to overawe all their colleagues, even those who come from the rural areas or those who come from the provincial towns.  Strangely enough these specialists from Merrion Square and from the crescents find it possible to overawe the National Health Council.</P>
    <P>The National Health Council is a body of some 30 people elected on a peculiar basis.  There are representatives of the General Council of County Councils on it; there are representatives of the municipal authorities on it; there are certain doctors appointed by the medical association and certain others who come from elsewhere.  In the last ten days I glanced down through the list of names.  From my own knowledge of the political views of those whose names I saw on that sheet, I would say not less than 50 per cent. are in their politics affiliated to the present Government.  Yet, I understand, after a nine hours' interview (two periods) with the Minister for Health, the Minister did not find it possible to get a single person of the 30 to approve of a single part of the proposals of the health legislation we are discussing.  If the influence of the specialists in Merrion Square and from the crescents is so powerful that they can coerce their colleagues who are not of the specialist type, overpower the <Col N="607" /> people coming up from the country, and even get their influence worked with representatives of the General Council of County Councils, the municipal authorities and a whole heap of other people, it is a striking fact that there is no person to be found in the room with the Minister for Health who can say a good word about a single one of the Minister's proposals. How is it ever hoped to have this scheme worked, even if the scheme could get over the difficulties with regard to Catholic social teaching? What belief is there, what real expectation is there, that a scheme dealing with the health of the people could be made to work if the doctors and the community are against it?</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin, generally very accurate on matters about which he speaks in this House, did make a statement here which was inaccurate.  I listened to hear how his statement would be put across in the Radio Éireann version of the proceedings of Dáil Éireann, and there was a cute distortion of Deputy Larkin's phrase, to get over the mistake he made. Deputy Larkin said&mdash;I am not quoting his exact words; I am just giving the gist of his remarks: &ldquo;What is the good of the I.M.A. holding out against the scheme?  When a more powerful body than they are&rdquo;&mdash;I presume he was referring to the B.M.A.&mdash;&ldquo;took up the same attitude of non-co-operation, they had to give in because of disunity in their ranks.&rdquo;  That, of course, is not the case.  It was not the doctors who gave in.  It was the Minister of Health who gave in.</P>
    <P>I have here a book on national health service in Great Britain written by one, James Stirling Ross.  This book does not run to more than six or seven pages with regard to what he calls &ldquo;The Settlement.&rdquo;  Deputy Larkin spoke of disunity amongst the doctors. There were three plebiscites amongst the doctors in England.  The first was a mere preparatory one.  The second was the effective one for the time being, and the voting was 40,000 odd against the Act and 4,000 odd for it. <Col N="608" /> There was not much disunity there. Having got that vote, the B.M.A. were put in a position of great strength but the B.M.A. did, nevertheless, make a further approach to the Minister and, according to this book, the Minister, Mr. Bevan, spoke in the House on the 7th April and said he had been trying to find out for himself&mdash;I wonder did the Minister here ever put this question to himself&mdash;&ldquo;What it is that is really and sincerely worrying the doctors.&rdquo;  The book goes on to state that it was the fear of a full-time salaried State medical service.  Mr. Bevan thereupon gave the guarantee that a whole-time service would not be introduced by regulation under the Act. A number of points which were published in a medical journal known as <i>The Lancet</i> were then put to the Minister and eventually, after the Minister of Health had promised enough to enable the medical people to give their co-operation, they took a new plebiscite and they said that they would not advise non-co-operation unless at least 13,000 of the general medical practitioners voted for non-co-operation.  The result, as far as the general practitioners were concerned, showed that 8,600 odd voted for accepting the scheme and 9,500 odd against.</P>
    <P>So far from there being disunity, there was even this vote against accepting it but, as the majority did not number 13,000, which was the necessary requirement for deciding on non-co-operation, they said they would co-operate.  Once they got together, even though there was quite a number of general practitioners still against it, things went smoothly.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the B.M.A. wrote a letter, and this I want to quote because it shows how these men took their stand on principle and how, when they were met on grounds of principle, they could wholeheartedly work a scheme although the doctors did not believe it would be for the betterment of the people in England.  In that letter he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There will be no shortage of good-will.  The profession will seek to make the new public service the best that is humanly possible under <Col N="609" /> present circumstances.  The individual citizen will be free to decide whether he will take advantage of the public service in whole or in part.  But this will not mean that there will be two qualities of medical service rendered to the public.  Only the best is good enough for the public service and we shall do our utmost to provide it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That drew a corresponding message of good-will from Mr. Bevan, the Minister of Health on the other side.  The fight was for a principle, the fight is here for a principle.  The doctors here too object to being made salaried members of a State medical service. Apart from that, the doctors have indicated in a series of articles in both the <i>Independent</i> and the <i>Standard</i> why they are opposing the scheme of the Department of Health and why they should not be asked to give it their co-operation because of deficiencies in institutions and deficiencies in personnel, medical and nursing.  Do not forget the phrase I have quoted: &ldquo;Only the best is good enough for the public service and we shall do our utmost to provide it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What has happened here?  We are told that the services are to be given on the public ward level.  We have a division of the people into two classes or groups&mdash;one group of which, I suppose, is regarded as being envied by the lower income group.  Let us take the top level, the person whose family means do not go beyond £600 a year.  From figures given in this House it has been established that the 1939 £ is now worth 8/-.  Six hundred pounds a year now represents a £240 income of the 1939 character.  Anyone beyond that income is outside this scheme, be he married or otherwise. Anybody else not on the public assistance level cannot avail of the proposals in this legislation, and the Minister's consideration for those who come within the scheme is that of the public ward&mdash;a place that some of them are not accustomed to go&mdash;and in the public ward, if they are above the lower income group, they will pay £2 2s. a week.  If they go into some private or some semi-private home, whether they have to look for specialists' services and pay this £2 2s. or not, they <Col N="610" /> are outside this scheme.  If that is the corresponding Irish effort to the British health services let it be exposed for how contemptibly low it is.  &ldquo;Only the best is good enough for the public service in England and we shall do our utmost to provide it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here the most that can be provided is the public ward.  Deputy Larkin said he did not see why members of the profession here would seem to regard the public ward as something horrible or something pretty horrible. It may not be, but the best that this country can afford should certainly be away and above that until the country gets richer and there is more production. At any rate that is the level on which we are starting.  If there are people in this community who think when they get ill that they would like something in the way of privacy, people who do not like the promiscuous conditions of the public ward, who would like a little better, possibly, in the way of food, something better in the way of service of food, some place where people who visit them can be received in privacy by them and where they can enjoy their talk without a whole group of people listening in, we are denying these to anybody who comes in under this scheme, even though they pay for them.  The public ward level is going to be good enough here under our improved health services, not the best that the public service demands and should get, as it is going to get apparently in England.</P>
    <P>Most people in this debate have sheered off from the cost.  The Minister set off on a tour of the public authorities to popularise this Bill.  His reception by the first one or two was sufficiently bad to put him off the tour and a member of the Department took up the running.  From both&mdash;I take it the Minister accepts responsibility for what the head of his Department said&mdash;we get this estimate of cost: it was not going to be less than 2/- in the £ on the rates, which would pay half the cost of the service.  The other half is to be found some way. If it is going to be found by the people who were in the mood they were in at this time last year it will be found in another cut of the subsidies, so that <Col N="611" /> we will have 2/- in the £ on the rates and the rest provided in some other way, but possibly by a saving on the breadstuff of the community.</P>
    <P>A sum of 2/- in the £ may seem a small amount.  Deputy McGrath, as Lord Mayor of Cork, has recently succeeded in putting 5/- on the rates, plus an extra 6d., and I suppose that the addition of 2/- will not loom very large in the eyes of the Cork ratepayers, if they can tolerate the 5/6 which is going on this year.  We are to have 2/- on the rates, and the service then is to depend to a great extent upon the health authority, the county manager, or, in places like Dublin, the city manager.  Under certain parts of this legislation, the county manager is to decide who will pay the two guineas and to whom may the two guineas be remitted; he is going to decide on the type of medical service that may be given to certain people, and when the patient goes freely to the doctor of that patient's choice, and that freely-chosen doctor thinks of sending his patient to a hospital where he thinks that person will get the medical attention that person requires, the county manager can say: &ldquo;No; you are going to another hospital.  I will not let you go where your medical attendant desires you should go.&rdquo;  Again, in the background of it all, wherever the county manager directs any patient, that patient, arriving anywhere is shown up to the public ward.  For 2/- on the rates, we are to get a free public ward treatment&mdash;2/- on the rates as to half the cost, and possibly a cut in subsidies to provide the rest.</P>
    <P>I think there are certain people in this House who have a great right to complain at this moment.  I have no doubt that, when certain people, in complete defiance of their election promises, last year walked into the Division Lobby to support a Budget which cut subsidies, after these people had made promises to maintain and increase subsidies, the way they were brought to vote for that cut in subsidies was the consideration offered of a good health service later in the year. <Col N="612" /> Let them now go to their constituents and tell them that their bread, their butter, their tea and their sugar are all increased in price, and that now the consideration has got to come, if the Minister can get over the objections of the Hierarchy.  The consideration is going to be a service at the disposal of the county or city manager; under his control, under that layman's control, controlling sometimes the doctor and certainly always the hospital, with, at the very best, the offer of a public ward when the patient eventually arrives at the hospital.</P>
    <P>In any taxation, one has to relate the incidence of the taxation to the service given.  The community under this legislation is divided into three groups: the low income group, the middle income group, and the rest. The middle income group, I see, is at the very amazingly low level of a maximum at the old-time rate of £240 a year salary.  These people are going to pay and it has been pointed out that they will likely pay three times&mdash;once, to provide the service for those who are destitute; secondly, on the basis that they are providing a service for themselves; and thirdly, for the service they actually will provide for themselves.</P>
    <P>Free choice has been commented on by so many people that I do not want to stress it or criticise to any great extent.  May I say simply this, that the free choice is not a characteristic of this measure?  There is, in fact, no free choice.  There is a free choice under very limited circumstances amongst a certain number of what are called participating doctors, but to describe that as freedom of choice to the patient is taking the words completely out of their context and distorting the plain meaning of plain words.</P>
    <P>So far as the lower income group under this legislation are concerned, they will get no improvement.  It has been put here, and there is force in the argument, that they will have their conditions disimproved, because they will find the hospitals, the institutions, the public wards in which they used to get their treatment crowded out by new applicants who will reluctantly <Col N="613" /> have to avail themselves of services they do not want because they have been made pay for them.  The middle income group are not getting any treatment&mdash;the treatment they expected or were accustomed to get. They are not getting the treatment given in England where the health service is open to those who go to a private or semi-private home.  How it is to be paid for, I do not know.  Deputy McQuillan has made the suggestion that farmers ought to be made pay according to their valuations, and the Minister may take note of that.</P>

      <P>Where is the effort in this legislation to improve public ward conditions?  I await an answer from Deputy McQuillan or Deputy Carter.  Where is there in this legislation any effort to improve the public ward conditions?  I take it that it is <Col N="614" /> accepted there is none, and I object to that.  I think an insurance scheme could help to improve them and leave the public wards bereft of a lot of people who are going to crowd in to them in the future and pay for them. You could improve conditions in the public wards if you got the crowded conditions relieved, and you could then get the medical people to get the service in them they would like to give but cannot give under the crowded conditions in these wards.  The farmers, Deputy McQuillan thinks, ought to be taxed.</P>

      <P>The principle is here.  Make the farmers, large and small, pay according to their valuation. Will the Deputy accept that as his statement?</P>
      <P>A White Paper put the population in two big groups.  According to the White Paper dealing with health services, one-third of the population was availing itself of the destitute public assistance type of medical service.  I understood there was some catch in the phrase &ldquo;availing itself&rdquo; and that it meant that people were getting the service who were not entitled to it but the Minister said that one-third of the population were entitled to it.  The definition for public assistance covers those people who cannot by their industry or other lawful means pay any part of the essential health services they require. We have 1,000,000 out of 3,000,000 of the population who are in that condition. In the position that one-third of the population cannot provide any part of the health services they require this Government produced the White Paper in 1951-52, and last year cut the subsidies that were given for foodstuffs on the plea made by the Minister for Finance that the people were too well off.  He said their personal salaries and incomes had gone higher than the increase in the cost of living since 1939.  On that he swayed people in this House to vote for increased cost of the foodstuffs of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One-third of the population are in the destitute condition of being unable by their own industry or lawful means to provide their health services.  On that basis, we are trying to build what are called improved health services and <Col N="617" /> the improved health services consist in sending the rest of the community, the middle income groups and others who can avail of these services, down to the conditions applicable to the destitute. That is brought forward as something we should be proud of and something that marks progress.</P>
    <P>I have already remarked upon egalitarianism at this particular level.  It is egalitarianism to be carried out under the local authority.  Again, I want to know why is there this insistence on the county manager handling everything in this legislation?  The county manager is a political appointment, so to speak, inasmuch as he is appointed by the Government and members of the Government.  He is certainly, when appointed, a servant of the Government. What is the necessity for throwing into the hands of an uninstructed layman&mdash;he must be uninstructed in regard to health&mdash;the control of these intimate matters in regard to mothers and children and the ordinary health services?  I have yet to hear some explanation as to why a county manager or a city manager is picked out to shoulder this responsibility. It is certainly not copying the English situation.  In England there are a number of boards.  There is a central health service council composed of almost 40 people.  Again, you have hospital boards.  Why are we excluding under this measure the people who know and why are we handing over the responsibility in all these health matters to the county manager? What special right has the county manager to decide what doctor a person should go to or whether certain medical services should be given to one person at one figure and to another person at a different figure.  What is their discrimination likely to be?  It would certainly be a question of the voting capacity of the people.  They will certainly not decide on medical grounds, the only grounds on which they should be decided.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government at this late stage in respect of a Bill that has no merits in itself, the matter of payment has not yet been disclosed and the full expenditure has not really been estimated and when the service, if availed of at all, that will be given is scandalous, <Col N="618" /> to call a halt and consider this again in the light of Catholic social principles which we are told have been contravened in all this legislation.</P>
    <P>For many years there has been a conflict between different people in the House&mdash;the people who favoured the extension of the State and State control and the people who disagreed with that, the people who had the view that it is better to have people operating on their own, to give them bigger salaries if possible to enable them to buy for themselves what otherwise they would have to get from the State.  In 1950-51, there was a great issue at stake if it could only be recognised.  The words used in an article in <i>Christus Rex</i> were:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether we were to take this further tremendous stride towards the servile State, towards becoming a nation of well-fed, well-doctored, State slaves, or whether we were to solve our social and economic problems in a way that would leave us still free men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on in that article it is said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But in the name of common sense, what is the way to remedy that?  Is it to turn the nation into one huge dispensary where no one is free&mdash;or rather to strike at the roots of poverty and so make every one free?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Do we want State control, even supposing the citizens under this legislation &mdash;although I deny that&mdash;were going to be better doctored than they are at the moment? Is that a sufficient mess of pottage for which to surrender our ordinary birthright?</P>
    <P>Is it right to turn this community into a huge dispensary?  I know there are people who have a view against that.  Deputy Dr. Browne, speaking at the week-end, said that &ldquo;a group of people had been given an opportunity of carrying out a particular job over a number of years, but had failed. Now they, the representatives of the people, the State, felt that the group had done their best, but had not succeeded, and they were taking it over.&rdquo;  Just casually like that, State <Col N="619" /> medicine is introduced.  There is a characteristic article in yesterday's <i>Irish Times.</i>  We are told that &ldquo;in any health legislation of this kind certain Christian principles must inevitably suffer&rdquo;, so we are going to have progress at the expense of Christian principles.  We know that the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, speaking not as a Minister in the year 1946, indicated a view which drew a leading article from the <i>Independent</i> with the heading: &ldquo;Putting a Halo Around Bureaucracy&rdquo;.  I quote his view as something to which I have always objected.  Deputy Childers was speaking as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government in Cork on the Saturday before December 3rd, 1946&mdash;this is the pagan doctrine of the Welfare State.  He said that &ldquo;paternalistic care of a community by civil servants, acting on instructions from a Government elected by the people, could alone preserve the fundamental freedoms and the sanctity of human existence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, that is the mentality that is behind this legislation, that the more the State takes over the better it is going to be for the whole of us.  The present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs thinks it is the only way of preserving &ldquo;fundamental freedoms and the sanctity of human existence&rdquo;. There are other views on that, views that have been given by any number of learned people on the moral law over the last two and a half to three years.  The addresses which they have delivered have been issued in pamphlet form, and they speak of this sapping of the moral fibre and independence of the people and say that the people should be free in certain essential matters.</P>
    <P>The present Minister finds himself in the same confusion as that in which Deputy Dr. Browne was two years ago.  I would have though that he would have been glad enough to leave Deputy Dr. Browne a lonely figure representing proved incompetence in office.  Responsibility was thrust too early on him, and he failed to take it.  The Minister has not that excuse. <Col N="620" /> The Minister is well versed in public affairs.  He was in charge of the health legislation in 1947.  He must have been aware of what the Hierarchy said to his Leader in 1947 about the legislation that he then introduced.  Notwithstanding that, and notwithstanding the warning paraded here every day by Deputy Dr. Browne, the Minister decided to go along his own way, although I believe he was tutored.  I believe that an attempt was made to guide him and to give him proper standards.  He blundered along until he now finds himself in exactly the same position as that in which Deputy Dr. Browne was in two years ago.  He has either to brazen out the health legislation that he has brought in or to make the amendments of principle that we suggested.  We, as a Party, decided not to put forward any amendments because we felt that the legislation was so hopeless, so bad, so rotten and of such a low level that no amendment could improve it.  On that attitude we have been justified by the events of the past ten days.  How the Minister is going to get out of that, I do not know.  I hope Deputies will take the one way they have, and that is to give no money for this legislation until we find that the legislation is inoffensive from certain angles, or until such time as we are in a position to give a better health service.</P>
    <P>Is there any Deputy going to tell me that he is prepared to go to his constituents openly and, at a public meeting, tell them that he is going to vote to impose a rate of 2/- on that community, and then expose the weaknesses of this Bill and the services, the bad services, that are promised, even if they could be made work?  I hope that this House will not give one penny piece of money for this legislation.  I think it is bringing parliamentary institutions into bewildering contempt to ask money for legislation which we know must be radically amended before it passes the scrutiny of a Catholic people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I intend to vote against this Resolution, I should like to indicate briefly why I am doing so. This Money Resolution is to provide <Col N="621" /> social services for which I am convinced there is no popular demand, as far as my knowledge goes.  Practically all sections of the community are confused as to why it has been introduced at all.  I have grave doubts myself as to whether, if it had not been for the publicity it got two years ago, it would have been introduced at all.  If I could get any evidence whatever, from any section of the people with whom I mix, that there was a genuine demand for such a service, I would be inclined to consider that demand and would probably favour it, but since there is no such demand, I am going to vote against the Resolution.  Any scheme of this kind should, to my mind, be considered from the point of view of the capacity of the people to pay.  Anybody connected with local administration must know that ratepayers everywhere are clamouring and protesting against the rising increase in local taxation.  That situation is going to be very seriously aggravated if this legislation ever comes into operation. Speaking as a member of a local authority for the past 11 years, I could not, in the light of my knowledge and of my experience of the difficulties which ratepayers are enduring in order to meet their local taxation demands, morally or conscientiously support this measure.  I could, perhaps, strain a point, or bring myself round to see the view for its necessity if I had any evidence whatever that there had been one single human life lost because of a patient's failure to obtain medical assistance.  I do not have to be told, and neither does any other Deputy, the value of one human life, but no Deputy has attempted to bring forward any evidence whatever that one single human life has been lost because a patient was not in a position to pay for medical assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest for a moment that our present health services are perfect or perhaps adequate, but I do suggest that the system is there and that it works, and works reasonably well.  I have grave doubt that the system proposed in the measure will remedy or improve that situation.  In Roscommon and, I am sure, in every county any patient can obtain medical aid.  He <Col N="622" /> can obtain domicilary aid, and, if necessary, institutional aid.  There is no question at the time when that attendance is required, whether at home or in the institution, as to the ability of the person to pay.  It is correct to say that, afterwards, and investigation of means is made, and if it is found that the person is in a position to pay payment is demanded. If he is not in a position to pay the full demand, he is requested to pay what it is reasonably considered he can afford.</P>
    <P>Under that system it is difficult enough to get institutional accommodation for all cases.  Even in Roscommon, where we have a new, modern, well-equipped and well-staffed hospital, patients often have to wait perhaps a few weeks.  What will be the position if this Bill is enacted and the rush on the institution which has been suggested here takes place?  The very people who, it is suggested, would benefit by this Bill, will be the victims, and I have not the slightest doubt that what are now regarded as public assistance patients will be relegated to the background and others in more prosperous positions will get priority of accommodation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost, it has been said here that if a man's valuation is £10 he will pay, in the first year at any rate, £1 per annum.  That appears to be a modest sum but one must remember that, whether one requires medical treatment or not, he pays that £1 year after year.  There are many people and families in this country who have never had recourse to medical aid either at home or in an institution.  If it is admitted that in the first year of its operation the Bill will cost only about 2/- in the £, will it be suggested that when the extra hospital accommodation and the extra equipment and staff for those hospitals are provided it will then cost only 2/- in the £?  I am sure the Minister would never put forward that contention. Those who have given consideration to the problem and who are in a position to judge this matter believe that when that accommodation is provided it will cost at least 5/- or 6/- in the £.  Is that a burden which we can afford to <Col N="623" /> put on local taxpayers when they are protesting that the present level of taxation is much too high?</P>
    <P>I am not ignorant of the fact that there are medical men with specialist qualifications who demand very heavy fees.  I admit that freely.  I have heard it referred to before this measure was introduced.  Other means can be found of meeting that situation.  I do not think it is necessary to go to this extent.  There must be some power vested in the Government, elected as it is on a democratic basis, to introduce legislation to restrain the rapacity of such ignoble members of a very noble calling.  That should be stopped.  It has been going on for a long time.  I believe that the people who could be described as being rapacious are the exception rather than the rule.  I have not any documentary evidence to prove what I am saying.  Deputy McQuillan seems to have one or two such examples.  I have been told that exorbitant fees have been demanded for specialist services.  I am almost certain that they have never been paid, at any rate in full, because quite a number of people who have availed of such services would not be in a position to pay anything like those fees.  No matter what happens to this measure, that practice should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is very difficult in present circumstances to deal with this whole matter on account of the atmosphere of unreality that has surrounded it, particularly in view of recent developments referred to here to-day. We feel we are discussing something nebulous, something which will never come into operation or which, if it does come into operation, will be so altered by ministerial amendments as to be a mere skeleton of the Bill put before us. I find the greatest difficulty in discussing the question as it ought to be discussed.</P>
    <P>References have been made to farmers of £50 valuation.  I wonder if people realise what took place in regard to land valuations.  In Roscommon the most absurd position exists with regard to valuations.  You may find valuations up to £50 where the landholder could be truthfully described <Col N="624" /> as a poor man and whose economic condition would fully entitle him to free medical service.  Valuation is no criterion.  It is not a fair measure of gauging a man's capacity to pay. It is the most misleading basis you could adopt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know of any farmer in Roscommon who has a Chrysler car, irrespective of his valuation, and I would certainly dissociate myself from remarks of that type.  I have no hesitation in doing that.  On the other hand, a man's valuation may be only £10 and he may be able to buy a motor-car.  In my experience, valuation works out very inequitably and is rather a bad basis to adopt.  I certainly would not allow anybody to get away with the idea that there is such a thing as a wealthy farmer of £50 valuation.  Such a farmer is comfortable, if he is hard-working, as practically all such farmers are.  He is just comfortable enough to get along and pay his way.  That is something every one of them wants to do.</P>
      <P>Whether a man's valuation is £50 or £100 or whether he has £1,000 a year, if he requires medical service and if his circumstances prevent him from paying for that service, the service should be provided.  That is the whole point.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of entering into the moral issues involved in this Bill. I leave that to other and more highly qualified people.  I have no doubt that the present Government will seriously consider it and make the necessary alterations in anything that is repugnant to the teaching of our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two reasons for opposing this Money Resolution and I hope to be very brief in putting them before the House.  My first and main reason for opposing the Resolution is the cost of it.  Ever since the days of the advent of the inter-Party Government we heard nothing but &ldquo;the increased cost of living,&rdquo;&ldquo;everything has gone up in price&rdquo;. Ever since the days of the advent of the present Government we have heard nothing but &ldquo;the scarcity of money,&rdquo;<Col N="625" /> and &ldquo;the increased unemployment.&rdquo;  I can assure the House that our people are looking for legislation to curtail the cost of living and to give us more employment, not for legislation to increase taxation, such as we are getting under the present Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin has summed up the Health Bill when he says that it is not a Health Bill out merely a Bill enabling the Minister to make regulations governing the health of the people.  That is really what it does.  Is it right for this House to pass on to any Minister the powers to make those regulations?  If we know what they are, why not incorporate them in the Bill?  If we want money to implement this Bill, why not tell the House the amount that is required?  I notice that my colleague, Deputy Cunningham, said the other day that an assurance had been given that the passing of this Bill would not mean an increase of more than 2/- in the £ in local taxation. I have read the Bill, I have read every word said by the Minister, but I can find no undertaking given that local taxation will not exceed 2/- in the £ for this measure.  I live in a constituency where the rates are now about 37/6 in the £.  Add a minimum of 2/- to that and where are the people going to find the money?  In the Six Counties, public health at the moment costs £8 per person&mdash;per man, woman and child&mdash;per year, and if we pass this Money Resolution we may find ourselves in exactly the same position as the ratepayers of the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect to the Bill which we should consider and that is the handing over to county managers of all executive authority as fully described by Deputy McGilligan. At the moment county managers have that authority for T.B. and we should inquire into that and see how they are using that authority.  I will give an example of a case in my constituency which was recently brought to my notice.  A local dispensary doctor diagnosed T.B. in a patient who was living on an island.  Unfortunately owing to inclement weather it is not easy to get patients from the island to the mainland and he advised the patient to take the first available opportunity of <Col N="626" /> travelling to Letterkenny and being X-rayed.  That patient duly turned up at Letterkenny for X-ray purposes but was informed there, on the instructions of the local authority, that such X-ray could not be proceeded with unless the patient was willing to pay for the X-ray himself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá réiteach ar an gceathrú fhadhb <Col N="631" /> san alt seo.  Míníonn an t-alt seo é féin.</P>
    <P>This short measure deals with four separate problems quite unrelated to each other and, as the provisions dealing with these problems do not entirely speak for themselves, it seems best to take them seriatim and explain the nature of the problem and the manner in which the proposed legislation is designed to meet it.</P>
    <P>Section 2 proposes to authorise the use of draft nets in certain cases by exception to the general prohibition of all net fishing in fresh water imposed by Section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1939, and which came into effect as from the 1st January, 1948.  This prohibition was primarily designed to conserve stocks of salmon, but strong representations have been made on behalf of the fishermen of Lough Ree in the River Shannon against the denial to them of their ancient right of netting for trout through a prohibition which, in the case in point, does not serve any useful purpose so far as salmon are concerned.  The case made by the fishermen has been met, as far as was possible, under the original enactment by making by-laws which enable them to engage in netting for coarse fish, i.e., fish other than salmon, trout or eels, but this is clearly not sufficient to meet the situation.  I am advised that the use of nets in Lough Ree with due regard for conservation of spawning stocks, would not result in any injury to the fisheries of the Shannon system as a whole.  Lough Ree, as part of the Shannon system, is, of course, vested in the E.S.B. under the Shannon Fisheries Act, 1938, and I have accordingly with the concurrence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, secured the consent in principle of the E.S.B. to the amending legislation now proposed.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that Section 2 is drawn in general terms and not by reference to particular waters.  For this purpose lakes of a minimum area of 30 square miles have been taken as it is only in such large lakes that commercial netting of trout can be undertaken without detriment to the maintenance of stocks.  The E.S.B. <Col N="632" /> is the only fishery owner having exclusive rights over such large bodies of water but the situation also has to be envisaged where a large lake might be the property of a number of individual fishery owners.  It is only right that any such owner should have a deciding voice as to facilities to be given to the public in the fisheries under his control.  This position is safeguarded by the provision that an applicant for permission to use draft nets for the capture of trout must furnish the consent in writing of every owner of a several fishery in the lake in question.  Moreover, the provision under Section 4 of the Bill for the holding of a public inquiry will ensure that any person with an interest in particular waters will have an opportunity of registering his objections to any proposed permissive by-law. Finally, the general provisions of the Fisheries Acts as to publication of, and appeal against, by-laws are applied as a further safeguard for interested persons.</P>
    <P>The need for legislation as set out in Section 3 has arisen from the situation in which the E.S.B. finds itself in regard to the salmon fisheries of the River Erne.  For the purpose of constructing a hydro-electric works near Ballyshannon, the board found it necessary to buy out the valuable salmon fishing weir at Assaroe Falls as this lay in the path of the river diversion and tail race excavation.  The board has, up to now, been unable to make any use of the salmon fishing rights so purchased and is naturally anxious to engage in fishing operations with a view to eventual recoupment of its outlay in this connection.  What the board proposes, with the support of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is that permission should be given for the taking of salmon in the fish pass erected at the Cathaleen's Falls dam.  Under existing fishery law no fishing can take place in a fish pass and, as that prohibition must be maintained in regard to mill dams and similar structures throughout the country, it is undesirable to relax it in the present cases.  Instead, it is proposed to regard the fishing device which the board proposes to install in the fish pass as a fishing weir.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> The general provisions of the Fisheries Acts require that every fishing weir should have a free gap, and detailed provisions are laid down as to such free gap being situated in the deepest part of the stream, being of certain dimensions, and so on.  It would be quite impracticable to apply such provisions in relation to the fishing device proposed in this case which will be no more than a trap installed in one of the pools of the fish pass. It is, therefore, proposed that the requirement as to a free gap should be dispensed with and that, as an alternative, the weir should be operated in accordance with conditions that would ensure the release upstream of a sufficient number of fish for the purpose of adequately maintaining stocks.  In effect, what will happen is that each batch of fish entering the pool will be counted and a permitted percentage captured, the remainder being released upstream.  An essential feature of this arrangement will be the exact counting of the numbers of salmon taken and released upstream respectively and it need hardly be said that such an arrangement lends itself to much more exact control over the maintenance of fish stocks than does the free gap system which depends so largely on chance.</P>
    <P>This section, again, is in general terms and may be applied not only to any E.S.B. installation but also to weir fisheries which will be acquired by the State in due course in pursuance of Part V of the Fisheries Act, 1939.  The provisions will be applied by Order and, as any change in the existing arrangements for securing the ascent of adequate numbers of fish for spawning purposes must be of concern to anyone with an interest in the fisheries of the river concerned, such persons are entitled to certain safeguards.  The necessary safeguards will be provided in three stages, namely, by the holding of a public inquiry as provided for in the next section and also by the publication of a draft of any Order proposed to be made authorising the operation of a weir without a free gap, so that those concerned may know precisely what provision is being made for the safeguarding of spawning stocks and may make objection if they consider <Col N="634" /> such arrangements inadequate or in any other way unsatisfactory. Finally, every Order of this kind will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas where it can be annulled by resolution.</P>
    <P>Section 4, which provides for the holding of public inquiries, has been referred to in connection with the two preceding sections and requires no further explanation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 re-enacts in slightly different form the provisions of Section 26 of the Fisheries Act, 1939, as amended by Section 3 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1944.  The need for reenactment arises from the fact that the first-mentioned section was repealed as superfluous by the Fisheries (Statute Law Revision) Act, 1949.  Some doubts recently arose as to the precise effects of that repeal and the Attorney-General has advised that what was repealed by the 1949 Act was the substituted provision, namely Section 3 of the Act of 1944.  In effect, therefore, these provisions in relation to the protection of waters from pollution have been inadvertently abrogated and it is now proposed to reinstate them.</P>
    <P>Some difficulties have arisen in the past in enforcing the provisions for protection of the fish from pollution due to the fact that, while certain injurious substances such as lime or spurge were prohibited by name, other sources of pollution were not adequately covered.  The section as now drafted prohibits the use of any deleterious matter for the capture, destruction or injury of fish and the expression &ldquo;deleterious matter&rdquo; is defined as meaning any explosive or any substance which on entry or discharge into the waters is liable to render the waters poisonous or injurious to fish, spawning grounds or the food of any fish.  This may appear to be rather a sweeping provision inasmuch as many substances which in sufficient concentration are injurious to fish, are daily discharged from industrial plants and sewerage systems in such manner as to be quite harmless.  To meet such cases, provision is being made for the grant of licences for the discharge of industrial and other effluents subject to conditions <Col N="635" /> as will ensure such treatment by way of cooling, dilution and so on as to render them harmless from the fishery viewpoint.  The interests of industry will be safeguarded by consultation with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and those of local authorities in consultation with the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>The form of this section renders Section 36 of the Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1850 (already repealed in part) and Section 7 of the Fisheries Act, 1924, redundant and these two enactments are to be repealed.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Fisheries Act, 1925, provides that a person who holds a salmon rod licence for a particular year in a fishery district shall be entitled to receive a licence (known as an endorsement licence) for the same year in any other fishery district on payment of a reduced fee of 10/-.  The Foyle Fisheries Commission, in licensing regulations made under the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, has adopted the same principle by providing a 10/- licence fee for any salmon angler wishing to fish in the Foyle area (which comprises the entire former Moville and Derry fishery districts) who already holds a licence for the same year in a fishery district.  It is desirable that boards of conservators should reciprocate in this matter by issuing endorsement licences to holders of Foyle area salmon rod licences, but I am advised that this is not possible on a strict interpretation of the law as it now stands.  The purpose of this section is to regularise this matter by giving the necessary wider interpretation to the provisions of the 1925 Act.  I understand that legislation will also be introduced in Belfast to deal with the question of availability of Foyle area rod licences in Six-County fishery districts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have been gratified had the Parliamentary Secretary further elaborated on what seems to me to be a very revolutionary proposal in this Bill.  Certainly there has been nothing like it in this country before.  I refer to the taking of power to license draft nets for the catching <Col N="636" /> of trout.  I do not know where that idea emanated from.  Apparently, it must have come from the fishermen on Lough Ree.</P>
      <P>Is the House seriously going to accede to that request?  I do not know how these men have lived in the past. I do not know what their means of livelihood has been, but to use a draft net for the catching of trout seems to me to be highly revolutionary and I cannot bring myself to agree to such a proposal without having a very clear and definite explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary in justification of it.</P>
      <P>The material section of this measure is very complicated and one finds it difficult to appreciate how it will ultimately work.  The main objection, however, is to this very revolutionary provision.  It is one that could not be accepted without a more elaborate and detailed defence.  I cannot understand the justification for issuing licences for draft nets for the taking of trout.  One can imagine what will happen.  There will be wholesale slaughter of all the trout in the lake.  How will we guarantee that the nets used will be of such mesh as to leave any trout at all alive in the lake?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary convinced that this section, the material section in this Bill, can be operated with safety to the welfare of the lake? At the moment this lake is a national asset from the point of view of rodfishing. I have the greatest misgivings. I cannot see this leading to anything but disaster.  If we accept this proposal now it will be the thin edge of the wedge.  This lake is three miles wide, but the moment this provision becomes operative pressure will be brought to bear from various parts for licences for a smaller area.  I have the strongest objection to this proposition. It is quite new.  I have never known anything like it before.  I would like to have from the Parliamentary Secretary the submissions made to him which justify him in introducing this measure and seeking the approval of the House to this provision.  I am thinking of the welfare of these men. I do not know anything about them but I am thinking of their welfare, of <Col N="637" /> the livelihood they made out of it in the past, all down through the years. What is the reason for the urge to make this drastic and revolutionary proposal which is contained in this Bill?  I think the House should be very slow to adopt this entirely new and revolutionary proposal.  I consider that it is a jump in the dark, without any detailed explanation by the Minister as to what he hopes will eventuate.</P>
    <P>I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary has full particulars as to the stock of trout in this lake.  If so, no matter what the trout population may be to-day, how does he expect it to survive against any sort of intensive fishing by draft nets?  It sounds to me like a greedy attempt to destroy the national asset which this lake is from the point of view of tourists as well as of the local people.  Another important question is whether the proposal will be effective.  I consider that the drafting of this important piece of legislation is very peculiar.  Take, for instance, Section 2 (1) (b):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) the applicant furnishes the Minister with the consent in writing of every owner of a several fishery in the lake ...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that not a hamstrung performance? Does the Minister not know human nature?  Does he not know the people of this country and their mentality? I do not know of one river in Ireland where, if you went out to canvass for permission from the riparian owners, you would not find one stick-in-the-mud who, out of pure cussedness and in opposition to his neighbour, would refuse to give his consent.  I think this is a revolutionary proposal.  I am not so desperately keen&mdash;and never have been&mdash;on revolutions and certainly I am not keen on this step.  Has the Minister acceded to this and incorporated it in the Bill merely because pressure was brought to bear upon him?  Has he done so, knowing that he will never have the trouble of issuing a licence because consent will never be got from all the riparian owners?  I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary knows these people in the West of Ireland.  I take it that he disapproved of such a revolutionary <Col N="638" /> proposal and that, therefore, he said: &ldquo;If you get the consent of all the riparian owners I will give permission.&rdquo; The loophole is that, human nature being what it is, there will always be one man out of 100 who will refuse to co-operate with the other 99.  I strongly object to such a revolutionary proposal as to put a draft net on a lake to catch trout. What is to be the size of the mesh in the net?  How many trout are going to be taken out?  Has an approximate inventory been taken of the amount of trout already in the lake and how many trout of a given size would the Parliamentary Secretary permit to be taken out?  Further, what size mesh will the Parliamentary Secretary prescribe in the licence which he will issue with regard to the taking out of trout from this lake?  We will have something more to say about this later.</P>
    <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary repealing the existing laws with regard to pollution and the illegal use of instruments for the taking out of fish? There is no word about &ldquo;gaff&rdquo; or a sort of &ldquo;dummy net&rdquo; made out of netting wire or all the other contrivances that clever and chronic poachers can invent for the purpose of taking out fish.  Is all the existing law being repealed and the whole thing contained in Section 5 of this Bill?  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should seriously consider tightening up Section 5.  If we are to look upon fishing as a national asset and to keep it for the national benefit, the destruction of fish by illegal means needs to be very minutely detailed.  Remember that when these people are brought to court they get a solicitor who knows the fishery laws, and if there is any loophole he will take advantage of it.  In my opinion, the whole thing requires to be redrafted.  We are all aware of the steeping of flax.  The real danger to fish is the draining off of flax dams in August and September even though it may be done at a considerable distance from any given river because, when the water is allowed to escape, it eventually reaches the river.  Has the Minister taken every precaution with regard to protection against pollution? <Col N="639" /> I fear that this section is not ample enough.</P>
    <P>I strongly object to Section 2 of the Bill.  It can only be, as I have said already, that the Minister believes and is convinced that, in fact, it will never operate.  That being so, why bother this House about it?  Why go to the expense of bringing in this Bill, getting it printed, and so forth, if it is to be a dead letter?  There is the further point of the menace to the national reputation of this lake as a fishing centre by the entire and complete destruction of the stock of trout in it. Assuming that the Bill becomes operative, how many trout will the Minister allow to be caught and of what size are they to be?  Is the mesh such that it will allow the whole lake to be cleared indiscriminately by men?  We have to take the long view because it is the only view that can be taken by us&mdash;representing, as we do, the interests of the State.  These are the two matters that have to be considered, and we shall discuss them further on another occasion.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the attitude adopted by Deputy McMenamin. How he proposes to speak for the fishermen on the islands on Lough Ree, I do not know.  He professes himself as being ignorant of how they carried on their way of life heretofore.  He may not realise that with the advent of the E.S.B. back in 1939 the rights of the fishermen in Lough Ree and those of their families were severely curtailed and that those fishermen had been fishing that lake from time immemorial without let or hindrance.</P>

      <P>What did Deputy Dillon do for the fishermen of Lough Ree?  He found in 1949 that the Garda barracks in Athlone and in the other towns which surround Lough Ree were full with fishermen. He then brought in a by-law to enable them to fish the lake for coarse fish. That was no use to the fishermen of Lough Ree.  They did not make their living previously on coarse fish.  He found even then that the E.S.B. might not agree to that proposal either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="641" /> I welcome this proposal in the Bill. In spite of the opinions of Deputy McMenamin or any other Deputy on the Fine Gael Benches it is only fair and equitable.  However, there is one point to which I would draw attention.  When the application is made to the Minister and if he thinks fit, he &ldquo;may make by-laws permitting the use of draft nets for such capture subject to such conditions as he thinks proper.&rdquo;  I would be concerned to see that the E.S.B., as an owner there, would not step in again and object, and put forward some grounds that might foul up the section, thereby tying up the Parliamentary Secretary in his efforts to help to relieve the Lough Ree fishermen.  I am not a lawyer but I doubt if it was within the power of this House, the E.S.B., the Department of Agriculture or any other institution to take away the livelihood of the fishermen who fished that lake from time immemorial.</P>

Deputy McMenamin was asking practically all the time for information from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who is to some extent interested in the inland fisheries in this country, I hope that when at any time a proposal is made by any Government to give facilities which do not at the moment exist for the netting of either trout or salmon, this House will always be very careful and extremely critical of giving them.  It will be agreed by anybody who has any knowledge of our inland fisheries, whether it is lake or river, that one of the troubles is that we are cursed with too many nets, weirs and traps.  There is no question about it.  The Minister said in the course of his remarks that under some ancient section&mdash;I forget what it was&mdash;every weir in this country <Col N="642" /> is supposed to have a free gap, which used to be known as the King's gap. It may be that there is supposed to be but I know at least one weir that has no free gap and never had it.</P>

I would like to assure Deputy Carter that so far as we are concerned on this side of the House we do not want to deprive, in any way, the fishermen of Lough Ree of any of their rights, nor do we want to stand between the fishermen of Lough Ree and the restoration of any rights they may have had.  I do not blame Deputy Carter in the slightest for confining his interest and his attention in this matter to Lough Ree, but I would remind him that it is proposed to take power in this Bill to deal with many lakes other than Lough Ree.</P>

      <P>Lough Derg is one of those.  I was born within five miles of it and I have some interest in it. I could mention quite a number of others, but I am not trying to be controversial. I have a real interest in this apart altogether from politics.  As a matter of fact one of the few occasions <Col N="643" /> on which I can get away from politics is when I can get out on the bank of a river or a lake.  I wish I could be more often there, to the benefit perhaps not merely of myself but of some of my colleagues here.</P>
      <P>My objection to the Bill is based not so much on what it contains as on what it does not contain.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to elaborate a little more when he is replying, or if not we can get it on the Committee Stage, on this proposal for taking fish from the fish pass.  I am not attacking that proposal because I do not know anything about it.  It may be a good proposal.  I should also like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary as to when he hopes to be in position to bring into operation Part V of the 1939 Act.  Perhaps he could give it to us even approximately.</P>
      <P>This question of the inland fisheries is one of the utmost importance to this country.  The potential value of our inland fisheries is very great and the tragedy of it is that we have done practically nothing whatever either to improve the fisheries, to preserve them or to stock them.  This country has spent considerable sums of money in trying to attract tourists here particularly in the off-season.  I know of no greater attraction in the off-season than the lake and river fishing we have in this country.  Shooting I have mentioned before on another occasion and I am confining myself for the moment to fishing.  In my opinion a great deal of the money that we spend in other ways in order to induce people spend their holidays and their money in this country, could be much more usefully spent for the benefit and further development and protection of our inland fisheries.  The angler is the best type of tourist we can get for two reasons.  When he comes, if he gets any fair fishing at all, he will come back again year after year and probably bring others.  If he meets with any little bit of success on the river or the lake, when he returns home he is not going to understate his achievements.  He is more likely to indulge in a little exaggeration and, in that way, he becomes a sort of ambassador for this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="644" /> We should also remember that the fisherman or the angler does not want the same sort of luxury surrounding a hotel or even the same food as the ordinary type of tourist whom you see once in a lifetime here.  When the angler comes once, he is likely to come back again.  The angler also gives very considerable employment to boatmen and gillies on our lakes and rivers.  I know one particular village in this country which lives in the holiday season almost entirely out of fishing.  I have gone out into the yard of the hotel in that village in the morning and seen there 20 or 30 boatmen or gillies lined up waiting each for his own particular angler.  Each of these men gets anything from 15/- to £1 a day.  That employment could be multiplied many times over.  The whole system at present is in my humble opinion wrong.  I do not profess to be an expert; the only excuse I can advance for intervening in this debate is my interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>The whole set-up here, with boards of conservators getting about one-fifth of the amount of money they would want properly to discharge their duties and being advanced in such a way that it does not enable most of them to employ one river watcher or keeper or to pay him a decent wage, does not indicate any keen desire to develop our fisheries.</P>
    <P>Apart from overletting and over-trapping, there is almost wholesale poaching carried on in this country.  A great deal of that poaching is of the worst possible type&mdash;the use of poison, the use of explosives.  Unfortunately for the future of fishing in this country some of the poachers are doing their damnedest to kill the goose that is laying the golden egg and the greatest amount of damage to fish is done during the spawning season.  I must say, though some people would not agree with me, that I have no terrible personal objection to the poor man who takes a salmon out of the river in the middle of the season, but I would have very little sympathy with the fellow who would take a salmon out of the river in October, November and December, apart altogether from the fact that fish taken at that period of the <Col N="645" /> year are not fit for consumption and certainly are not safe to eat.</P>
    <P>There are a great many matters, now that I am on my feet, I should like to deal with in connection with our inland fisheries.  There is one appeal I would make to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Will he try to get out of the very substantial sums, which are now made available to the two boards that are looking after tourist development in this country, some decent amount instead of the miserable sum which was made available, I think, to the trust this year?  I am speaking quite sincerely when I say that there is nothing upon which we could spend money more usefully than on the development and better protection of the fisheries of this country.  Nothing would pay better dividends.  There is no doubt whatever that once you get over the summer season in this country, with the exception of fishing, shooting and hunting, we have very few attractions to offer to visitors in this country that they cannot get in far greater variety in other countries.  We know that we can offer them fishing and shooting here equal to the best in Europe.  We know what the Scotch have been able to do.  We know what enormous revenue must be attracted to Scotland and in particular to the highlands of Scotland every year. There are very few people in this House who know more about this matter than the Parliamentary Secretary himself.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary comes from, and is thoroughly acquainted with, what is perhaps one of the best sporting areas, not merely in these islands, but probably in Europe.  There is a wealth of fishing in the west of this country, leaving out altogether the south and east, which it would be hard to equal anywhere.  Many of the lakes, even lakes which are first-class lakes not merely for brown trout but sea trout, are almost unapproachable, unless you are a fairly active young fellow who can hop from one hillock to another across a bog.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows that as well as I do.</P>
    <P>It is absurd to see fellows brought <Col N="646" /> up in court for using explosives in a salmon or trout river, being read a lecture by some district justice and fined 10/-.  We cannot be blind to this fact, that the inducement or incentive to use every and any means to get salmon and trout nowadays is aggravated by the very high price, comparatively speaking, which is available for salmon and trout, and there is no use in fining in a sum of £5, a fellow who, by poison, or by netting a pool in a river, or by the use of explosives, brings out a salmon or five or ten salmon, when he can get £5 for one salmon.  I know that the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of these things and probably much more aware of them than I am.  What I have been saying is to some extent the result of my own experience, for what it is worth, the result of my own observations, but more so the result of information I have got from people who have been interested in inland fishing all their lives and who are concerned that this national asset of ours&mdash;and it is a national asset&mdash;is being left there, without any real drive being made to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy McMenamin, I should be a little apprehensive of the powers being sought here regarding legalising the netting of trout in various lakes in the country.  It is not an answer, as we have often said, for the Parliamentary Secretary or Minister of any Government putting a particular Act through the House to say that that is not his intention, that he does not mean to do that.  The trouble is that, once we put the Bill through the House and it becomes an Act, we have nothing further to do with it.  It depends entirely on the interpretation put on it by the people outside, and while the present Parliamentary Secretary, with his knowledge of and interest in inland fisheries, might be concerned to see that nothing detrimental to the future of our inland fisheries is done, his successors in the years to come might not have anything like the same interest.</P>
    <P>I appeal to him to let us know what he has in mind on this question of the better protection and development of <Col N="647" /> the inland fisheries, and particularly to let us know whether he sees any prospect in the near future of being able to buy out, if that is the way it is to be done, some of the traps and trapping rights which are being operated, in my opinion, to the detriment of the inland fisheries.  There is no doubt whatever that our lakes and rivers were much better stocked and infinitely more salmon and trout got out of them 50 years ago than are got out of them to-day.  I am not trying to make this a controversial subject in any way; on the contrary, I am trying to treat this as a Bill which we can discuss in a completely non-Party way and solely from the point of view of our interest in the future of the sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to make a speech on the advantages of the fishing industry as a tourist attraction and I will try to confine myself, so far as I can, to the Bill.  I have very many reasons for opposing Section 2.  I have been closely associated with the fishing industry for a good many years and I know quite a lot about inland fisheries, but once I hear nets mentioned in relation to inland fisheries, my hands are up.  I spend a great part of my time prosecuting decent men for using nets in inland fisheries in one part of my constituency, and, in another part, I spend an equal length of time defending decent men for using nets in inland fisheries; but I hate to see any section going into the Statute Book legalising the use of nets in inland waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine for Deputy Carter to speak as he has spoken.  I can understand and appreciate how anxious he is to see the people of his own constituency gaining some rights under this Bill, but it may be a case of Deputy Carter to-day, Deputy McGrath of Cork to-morrow and Deputy McMenamin of Donegal, the day after.  The successor of the Parliamentary Secretary may have a completely different outlook from that of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I think that no net other than a landing net should be permitted in inland fisheries or waters.  It is time that steps were taken, as Deputy Morrissey has said, <Col N="648" /> to abolish some of the traps, the fixed engines, fixed nets, which we have, and it is a serious retrograde step, in my opinion, to permit the use of draft nets in fresh waters.  Even this very day, we have a party of Frenchmen fishing in the West of Ireland.  What are they going to think when they hear that we are going to permit the use of draft nets in these fine fishing lakes over there?</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago the Letterkenny (No. 14) Board of Conservators making application to the then Parliamentary Secretary for permission to net certain lakes for the purpose of catching cannibal trout.  It was a very good and wise suggestion, because the cannibal trout could have been removed and the fish in these lakes possibly improved, but the then Minister refused the board of conservators the power to use nets for the purpose of removing these cannibal trout.  I could understand nets being used on such occasions as that, but, once they are used commercially, we will find ourselves in the very same position as that in which we find ourselves in relation to estuary fisheries at the moment in the matter of draft nets.  It will possibly be necessary to introduce legislation to control the number of licences which may be issued and I seriously ask the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw that section.  It may be, as Deputy McMenamin said, wise politics on his part and Section 2 may be a saving section.  However, I personally am opposed to it.</P>
    <P>With regard to Section 3, the free gap referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary has been an important one. It has been known as the Queen's Gap, ever since the introduction of the 1842 Fishery Act, right down through the years, but here we are taking steps to do away with it, to seal off one end of the fish pass.  I do not think it is a good thing.  Why should we give a quasi-State body such as the E.S.B. more powers than we are able to give to the ordinary fishermen, the ordinary owner of a private fishery?  Why should they be given more powers to commercialise a fishery than are being given to the ordinary owner of a several <Col N="649" /> fishery?  It is something that the Parliamentary Secretary and this House should be very very slow to grant and I hope it will be further considered on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In regard to Section 5, it is a strange thing that our fishery laws have to be introduced through the Oireachtas piecemeal.  Section 5 reintroduces our old friend of the 1952 Act. Under the Act it was unlawful and illegal to cause deleterious flax to be put in rivers.  That section was repealed under the 1939 Act, re-introduced under the 1944 Act, repealed under the 1949 Act and here we are introducing it under an Act of 1953.  I think that instead of introducing this Bill the Parliamentary Secretary would have done much better if he had introduced the Bill circulated some months ago, the Fisheries (Consolidation) Bill, 1952. If he had put these various sections into the Consolidation Bill he would have avoided, in my opinion, a considerable amount of trouble and ambiguity.  I am very glad to see Section 5 re-introduced, but there is one deleterious matter in relation to which I would like to see provisions specifically set out and that is the refuse from the alcohol factories.  I know one river down near Convey in Donegal which was a good fishing river until the alcohol factory was erected.  After the alcohol factory had been erected, we saw dead fish floating down the river.</P>
    <P>There is not one solitary fish to be found in that river.  The matter was brought to the notice of the Department. They were asked for directions as to whether proceedings should be instituted or otherwise.  No proceedings have ever been instituted.  We are aware that this refuse is a deleterious and poisonous matter so far as fresh fish is concerned.  I should like to see something done under Section 5 of the 1953 (Amendment) Bill to enable the proprietors or operators of these alcohol factories to be prosecuted and made amenable to the law just as any other individual in the State.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Morrissey, I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to approach those boards who are now <Col N="650" /> responsible for advertising and looking after the interests of tourism generally for more funds for the development of our inland fisheries. What we require most are hatcheries.</P>
    <P>In Donegal where we have something in the neighbourhood of 375 lakes, we have but one hatchery.  I am not very old myself but I remember a time when in one quarter of that county we had three hatcheries but now one hatchery must serve the entire county.  To obtain brown trout ova for that hatchery we have got to import it from Scotland.  I would like to see the Parliamentary Secretary make a serious effort to establish a greater number of hatcheries not only in Donegal but in the West of Ireland. After all, the West of Ireland deserves a considerable amount of attention from the point of view of the State's ambitious programme in connection with An Tóstal.  I would like to see small hatcheries on every chain of lakes and rivers all over the country. If we had that, in my opinion, we would be doing much more for tourism than we are at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would also appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to make some provision whereby boards of conservators may spend the surplus money which at the moment they are compelled to retain on deposit.  Our board at home in Donegal has to carry a credit balance of approximately £1,200 year in, year out, while at the same time we are permitted to pay water keepers only the meagre sum of £6 per season. Knowing our boards, there is no reason why they should not be permitted to spend at least another £800 out of that surplus.  Four hundred pounds would be sufficient to indemnify them and ensure that they would never have to call upon the Treasury for funds.  I know certain boards in other parts of the Twenty-Six Counties require subsidisation from the State but boards that have proved that they are able to look after themselves and carry a sufficient credit balance to provide them for two years' work should be permitted to spend the surplus either to pay water keepers, provide hatcheries, clear fish passes or generally improve the fisheries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="651" /> I would also like to see closer co-operation between the boards of conservators and local anglers' associations. There is no better advertisement for the country than the local anglers' associations, and we should encourage every angling tourist who comes to the country to join the local angling association.  Grants should be made available out of these State funds to these angling associations for the purpose of procuring fry for the restocking of rivers.  I make a final appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider Section 2 before we reach the Committee Stage, and to amend Section 5 by the inclusion in sub-section (2) (a) of provision in respect of the refuse from these alcohol factories.</P>

      <P>Perhaps my introductory statement about Section 2 was not full enough.  I did, in any event, specifically mention a particular lake, Lough Ree.  It might be expected that, perhaps, I should have dealt with the matter in the Bill in that way by naming the lake.  We preferred, however, to do it in the general way of naming dimensions and making some other provisions which would meet the problem which was to be solved. Deputy McMenamin said that this was a revolutionary measure.  From all the facts that I have been able to gather about this particular problem of the abolishing of the right to net in Lough Ree, I am convinced that the revolution was the other way round, that it was the statute which sought to bring about the revolution.  What Deputy Carter said is, in fact, true, that there was no time within living memory, or, to put it in his own words, from time immemorial, during which this draft netting for trout was not <Col N="652" /> carried on as a means of livelihood. With a stroke of the pen, it abolished the livelihood of a considerable number of families living on the islands of Lough Ree.  It left them with no alternative but to emigrate from their ancestral homes and find a livelihood wherever they may.  There was no other comparable case in the country, and, personally, I am satisfied that a very grave hardship, in fact an injustice, was inflicted on those people.  It is because of that that we have introduced this measure.  We are trying to undo the wrong that was done to them. As Deputy Carter pointed out, appeals were made from all sides of the House to do justice in this matter.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure Deputy McMenamin, Deputy Morrissey and Deputy O'Donnell that we are not opening every lake in the country to draft netting for trout.  The area is sufficiently large to exclude practically all sheets of water with the exception of four.  From the reading of the section, it is obvious that an application must be made, and that the applicant must furnish the Minister with the consent of every owner of a several fishery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Morrissey has put his finger on the fact that the difficulty will be practically insuperable.  The E.S.B. is the only several fishery owner that we know of in these lakes, and in this section we are not interfering with the E.S.B. ownership in any way.  What we are doing is legalising a certain method of catching fish, and after that it is for the people concerned, that is the Lough Ree fishermen, to secure the necessary permission from the E.S.B. to ply their trade as they have always been in the habit of doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I have always been conscious of the fact that the fishing is only a secondary consideration with the E.S.B.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but this House on two occasions, that is when the 1935 Act and the 1938 Act were passed, decided that it was the lesser of two evils to give the people who control the major interest the control of all interests.  Apparently, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was advised that, if the E.S.B. interest was not paramount, there would be serious interference with the carrying into execution of the works which the E.S.B. was primarily established to carry out.  The Fisheries Branch is always consulted by the E.S.B. when they propose to develop a river.  I must say that they have always been most co-operative, and have never taken any serious step without first getting the advice of the scientists and engineers in the Fisheries Branch.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure Deputies who feel a little bit nervous about the extent of the application of this section that, in so far as the Fisheries Branch can foresee, it will not, and cannot apply except to solve the problem which I have outlined, and that is the very serious interference with the 50 or 60 families who&mdash;this applies to their ancestors as well&mdash;have lived mainly by the netting of brown trout in this lake. The section, too, is designed to restore that right to them.  As a matter of fact, the question has been raised outside this House, of the competence of this House to take away that right from them.  It has never been tested, but I know it has been mooted.</P>
      <P>Deputy McMenamin asked me if Section 5 repeals all other provisions. Section 5 deals with poisons, explosives and other deleterious matter. This section replaces all other provisions. We are satisfied that it is comprehensive enough to cover every possible use, and to include those specifically mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell.</P>

      <P>There are some matters that I am dealing with now which, possibly, are not provided for at all in this Bill. Deputy Morrissey asked me about Part V of the Act of 1939.  I do not mind answering the question although the matter does not arise on the Bill.</P>

      <P>Part V, as Deputy Morrissey knows, provided that there should be observation of each of these transferable fisheries by an officer of the Department for a period of not less than three years and not longer than ten years.  I am sure he will agree with me that a delay of that length is inadvisable.  That, in itself, I think, is sufficient justification for amending the measure.  There are other matters, of course, as well.  There are proposals for the amendment of the 1939 Act. These are taking shape in the Fisheries Branch.  They have not yet reached the point at which they can be submitted to the Government for approval. There are a great many matters taking up the time and attention of the principal officers in the Fisheries Branch and some of them are equally as important as the amendment of Part V, but I want to assure Deputy Morrissey that all the time and attention that it is possible to give to this particular question is being given to it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to the trust.  The trust is really the product of the angling associations. Deputy Morrissey has expressed his appreciation of the work these associations are doing and I endorse that. As a matter of fact, the trust is a body designed to co-ordinate the activities of all these voluntary bodies.  It is the policy to ensure that the representatives of the voluntary associations will, as far as possible, control the activities of the trust and that there will be as little interference as possible from the officials of the Fisheries Branch with the work of development.  But, of course, the Department provides the finance for the work and must naturally have an effective say in how it is spent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite so.  On the question of the lack of money, that is becoming more obvious as time goes on.  Costs generally are increasing. On that particular matter the Department is hammering out proposals with the object of increasing the funds <Col N="656" /> available for the protection of our inland fisheries.  An Bord Fáilte, as has been mentioned, contributed a considerable sum for the development of lakes in the West of Ireland and it is hoped that they will see their way to continue that financial assistance in respect of similar development in other parts of the country.</P>

Orders and by-laws will still have to be brought into being and in bringing in those Orders and by-laws the House and interested parties outside will have an effective say as to what the final form will be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

      <P>Are there no by-laws governing fishing in Lough Ree at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The only by-law is one that was brought in about three years ago restoring the right to net for coarse fish.  That does not meet what I consider an injustice on these fishermen and that is borne out by their failure or refusal to apply for compensation under the legislation which enabled fishermen to be compensated for the loss of their right to net.  The Lough Ree men did not apply for that compensation for the reason that money would be no compensation for the loss which was being inflicted on them.  In that connection, Deputy O'Donnell indicated that these fishermen were poachers and were breaking the law.  We do not know what law the Lough Ree men were breaking.  When they and their ancestors were netting, so far as we know, there was not any law and they were really exercising a natural right. It was we who introduced the element of law into it and they have been challenging that.  So, I think the revolutionary action was taken on the part of the State, not on the part of the fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell made the statement that boards of conservators are <Col N="657" /> not allowed to spend their money and that there is an undue interference with them&mdash;I think he meant to suggest by the Fisheries Branch&mdash;in this matter of disposing of their funds.  There is no truth in that.  The boards are free to spend their revenues on all functions and duties for which they are constituted. Possibly there is interference with a board who spend in such a way as to leave no reserve for protection of the fisheries during the close season. Beyond interference of that sort, and we consider that that is wise interference, wise supervision, I do not think Deputy O'Donnell's complaint can be substantiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>I do not think that there is any other point that has been raised that I have not dealt with, except perhaps the regulation with regard to the new fish pass constructed by the E.S.B. at Ballyshannon. Deputies who are acquainted with the fishery laws know that where there is a fishing weir there must be a free gap and that this free gap must be open for two days of the week.  They also know that it is not permissible to take fish in a fish pass.  A difficulty arose at Ballyshannon and will arise in other similar works created by the E.S.B. of complying with the requirements of the fishery law in respect of the free passage of fish.  To meet it, the E.S.B. engineers constructed what the Fisheries Branch regard as being very satisfactory and efficient fish passes, and the law in relation to the prohibition of fishing in these passes is being modified.  Devices or contrivances for measuring the number of fish that get into the pass are installed and the exact number of fish entering the pass can now be recorded and, therefore, <Col N="658" /> the exact number that get into the upper reaches of the river for spawning can be recorded accurately and precisely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was concluding my remarks when I moved to report progress at 6 o'clock.  I repeat that my principal reason for opposing this Resolution is that at the moment what we need is more employment.  We lawyers know of a disease known as &ldquo;pre-settlement&rdquo;.  We find in the case of workmen's compensation, in running-down actions, that the plaintiff never fully recovers until a settlement has been reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking as a solicitor for the defence.  We find this pre-settlement neurosis very often setting in.  The plaintiff is worried; he does not recover.  Unfortunately, the same thing is happening in the country. If there is a deterioration in the health of the people generally, it is through lack of proper and full employment. I say that the money which we are voting, or which the Minister asks us to vote for this Bill, would be much better spent on giving full employment, on slashing the cost of living, on the restoration of subsidies&mdash;which would be as good as medicine to the people, which would feed them, which would give them the opportunity to buy butter and the other commodities on which the subsidies have been cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that the health services are not 100 per cent. perfect, but there is no great outcry at the moment against those which are being provided.  If there is one particular subject on which we could spend more money, it is on cancer research.  Some of that which would be spent on the administration of this Bill would be much <Col N="659" /> better spent on cancer research.  If the present Government did for cancer what Deputy Dr. Browne and the previous Government did for T.B., it would be much more beneficial to the country generally.  Those are my main reasons for voting against the Bill.  As I said at the outset.  I agree entirely with Deputy Larkin that this is not a Health Bill but merely a Bill to enable the Minister to make regulations governing the health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>To take up where the last speaker left off, I am in full agreement with Deputy Larkin's statement, which has been quoted by Deputy O'Donnell, that this is not a Health Bill, but a Bill to enable the Minister to make regulations.  If this were a Money Resolution asking this House to vote money to improve the health services, the present hospitalisation, the Minister would have the support of Clann na Talmhan.  As it is, Clann na Talmhan is going to oppose this Money Resolution.  The Minister was challenged here to-night to show where the Health Bill would improve hospitalisation or health conditions and the Minister did not answer.  I have read the Bill and while I cannot say I am a doctor or say I was able to go into the Bill as finely as a medical man would, I think it will not by any means achieve what it sets out to achieve&mdash; apart from the objectionable features in it.  If the Minister was asking a specified sum of money, instead of an unspecified sum, to improve present health conditions and hospitalisation, he would be getting our unqualified support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opinion of this Party is that the present hospitalisation is hopelessly inadequate for maternity accommodation. The death rate, particularly on the maternity side of the medical service, is rather high and is capable of reduction if we apply ourselves to the task.  The Minister will agree, as most doctors will, that there is a high death rate amongst babies and mothers that we could and should tackle at once.  That is a thing the Minister could do without any Health Bill since there is ample scope for it <Col N="660" /> under present legislation.  Also, hospital accommodation in the various counties is not adequate.  There again the Minister does not need a Bill such as this&mdash;a contentious Bill which is occupying the time of the House pretty long and which I presume will occupy us longer.  He does not need a Bill for that.  If the Minister tackled these things and asked for money for them and if these two urgent and pressing problems were eased off&mdash;I am only asking that they be cased off somewhat; I am not asking he should work miracles or do impossible things&mdash;then we could turn our attention to other aspects, which may be contained in this Bill, and see what could be done about them.</P>
    <P>There are three outstanding things that must hit anyone in the eye who examines the health of the nation at the present time.  One is T.B., one is cancer, and one is something seldom spoken about but making an awful inroad on the lives of the people, namely, rheumatism in its many forms. We should do our best to tackle these problems first.  If money were being sought for them, no Deputy would be so inhuman as to consider the cost of our attempt to master these problems that are pressing on us.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health here in the Dáil last Friday concerning my county. The same Parliamentary Secretary is given to making wild statements.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That is occurring in every townland in the country.  Deputy Browne talked about the red ticket not being used in County Mayo.  It is used in Westmeath.  In Mayo they have to bring the ass-load of turf or bag of potatoes.  The doctor does not demand it, but the eggs, chicken and turf are brought as a <i>quid pro quo.</i>&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to say that that is a complete slander.  There is not a single shred of truth in it.  I am in a position to speak for the people of Mayo and the conditions in Mayo a lot better than Deputy Kennedy and I never heard of that.  It comes very ill from a member of the Government deliberately to slander the people of Mayo in that way.  I suppose it is in keeping with some of the statements he made at the by-election in North Mayo this time last year, when he told the people of North Mayo, because the food subsidies had not been removed at that time, that they would not be taken off and asked them did they think poor Dev would do that to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is foundation for that rumour.  I think it ill behoves the Minister, particularly on account of his connections, to make a joke of that particular matter here in the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making political capital out of it.  I do not know whether there is any foundation for the rumour or not, but the Minister does.  If there is foundation for the rumour, I ask him to withdraw the Bill at once.  It will take a certain amount of courage to do that, but I do not say the Minister has not the necessary courage.  I do not know how his Party will take it or how certain Deputies backing him will take it.  I would say, however, that the Minister would gain very much more admiration for doing that than for the shuffling tactics adopted now to cloak the real truth about the matter.  I am asking the Minister to have the political courage to withdraw the Bill now and not to do the damage, which he is better able to measure than I am, which will result.  I am trying to speak seriously and I do not like to see the Minister turning this matter into a joke.  If it were the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I would not mind so much, because I know their calibre fairly well by this time, but it ill behoves the Minister for Health to be carrying on in that particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Bill has been condemned lock, stock and barrel.  I believe that sooner or later, when the truth comes out, if it does come out, it will be seen that there is a good deal of truth in the rumour which is going about, that it is not exaggerated or <Col N="665" /> false.  I believe that the Bill has been condemned.  The Minister will probably try to steamroll it through the House.  If he does, that is a matter for himself, but I would advise him not to do so.  If he does steamroll it through the House for the sake of political expediency and for the sake of holding on to office and power, then I say he is doing irreparable damage to the country and damage that a Catholic Minister should not be prepared to support or stand over.  That is as far as I will go on that particular matter. I shall have more to say, perhaps, on another stage.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments used by Deputy McQuillan in favour of this measure, and he, no doubt, sees some advantage in it, is that its implementation will only cost the small ratepaying farmer 2/- in the £.  The Minister quoted 2/- in the £ as being the cost of the Bill.  I would like to know how he arrived at that figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>He came down to 1/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I never went over 1/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If he said 7/- in the £ he would be nearer the mark.  In the course of two or three years the cost of implementing this Bill will be nearer to 9/- in the £.  I think the Minister's 2/- is nothing more nor less than a shot in the dark and an illdirected shot at that.  He told us that 2/- in the £ would be the cost borne by the ratepayers.  Let us examine how that calculation will work out because obviously Deputy McQuillan is quite captivated with the idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Roscommon there are 16,298 farmers under £30 valuation. There are 993 with valuations between £30 and £50.  There are roughly 16,300 farmers against 1,000 farmers. I want to bring to the Minister's attention now something that may not have been brought to his notice prior to this.  For the first time the small farmer with £2 and £3 valuation will be asked under this measure to pay both by way of rates and taxation for the treatment of those who hitherto always paid for themselves.  That is one of the glaring injustices of this <Col N="666" /> Bill.  For the first time in County Roscommon 16,300 farmers, approximately, will have to pay under this Bill.  I want to make that quite clear to Deputy McQuillan.  If we take the figures for the whole country there are 316,496 under £30 as against 30,000 with valuations between £30 and £50. The farmers on that latter valuation have as keen a sense of independence as any other section of the community and they have in the past always paid their own way.  Now for the first time the small farmers under £30 valuation will be asked to pay for the medical services of those who hitherto have always paid for themselves.  I cannot see any advantage in that to the small farmer.  This scheme was not devised by accident.  It was cunningly devised to blister the small farmer with an added burden of rates and taxation and I want to take this opportunity of exposing that.  I am certain that some of the officials in the Minister's Department or in the Department of Local Government have slipped that across on him with a certain amount of cunning.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked for an unspecified sum of money to implement a Bill that has been condemned in its entirety.  I believe he is asking for money to implement a Bill that will never become law.  Had the Minister come in here to ask for more money to increase the present accommodation in hospitals for maternity cases we would have been the first to support him. This Bill is nothing more than a piece of political expediency.  I cannot see any benefit accruing from it.  As a neighbour of mine described it the other day: &ldquo;The Bill, as far as I can see, is like a man shearing a pig; there is a lot of noise but very little wool&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister concludes I want to make the position of the Labour Party to the Bill and the Money Resolution quite clear in the light of the situation that we are told has developed within the past few days.  I want to make the position quite clear so that there can be no future ambiguity as to where the Labour Party stands in the matter.</P>
      <P>I have not been supplied with a copy of the document which, I understand, the Cardinal and certain other bishops have sent to the daily newspapers and a copy of which, I also understand, is in the possession of the Government but has not been made available to us in order that we might consider the document against the background of the Money Resolution and, in particular, against the background of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Whatever the merits of the document or the Bill may be, it seems to me a rather extraordinary situation that Parliament should be asked to discuss a Bill of this kind while a document of vital importance in relation to the Bill is being suppressed from Parliament. I do not know who is responsible for its suppression and the question of responsibility does not matter at this moment.  What is important is that there is available a declaration of the Irish Hierarchy in connection with this Bill, and Parliament, which ought to have the fullest possible information on the matter and, in particular, any information emanating from the Irish Hierarchy, is now in the position that such information is not available to it and apparently the document in question will not be released for the information of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without taking sides one way or the other on this issue, that is truly an extraordinary position and I cannot <Col N="669" /> see what purpose is being served by failing to disclose to Parliament&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Whether the Government received such a document?</P>
    <P>(2)  If it did, where is the document now?</P>
    <P>(3)  Had the Government any discussions with the Hierarchy in relation to the document?</P>
    <P>(4)  If so, has it reached agreement with the Hierarchy and have any questions relating to Catholic social principles and Catholic social teaching been resolved to the complete satisfaction of the Hierarchy, on the one hand, and the Government on the other?</P>
    <P>Am I unreasonable in asking that Parliament should have that information on a matter of such vital importance to the people?  What purpose is being served by withholding that information?</P>
    <P>In any case, we in the Labour Party have got to take cognisance of the fact that this document is in existence.  We have to take cognisance of the contents of the document so far as one can glean them without actually having a copy of the document.  I understand that the document in question contains a declaration that the Hierarchy are in favour of a satisfactory health service and that then it goes on to express views on the Health Bill.  We on the Labour Benches have expressed very definite views on the Bill.  I could make a strong case in many respects against the miserable cheese-paring and niggardly methods that have got into the drafting of this Bill.  Earlier, I pointed out some of the obvious flaws in the Bill.  For example, I pointed out that people with 24/- and 50/- a week are being expected by the local bureaucrat to pay charges up to two guineas per week for hospital treatment and that they are expected to pay that money out of these miserable pittances which they will receive in the form of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. Are all the Deputies in the House going to be allowed to repeat the speeches <Col N="670" /> they have already made on the Money Resolution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is not aware that Deputy Norton is repeating his previous speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out that this Bill will give the local bureaucrat &mdash;the county manager&mdash;power to charge fees in respect of treatment in a county hospital or even in a voluntary hospital and that these fees will be fixed by the bureaucrat without any advertence whatever to the viewpoint of the representatives of the local ratepayers and without any regard whatever to the income or the capacity of the persons concerned to pay the fees.</P>
      <P>I have pointed out also that one of the big flaws in the Bill is the absence of a general practitioner service.  That is the point, so far as ill-health is concerned, where some of the biggest bills arise for the ordinary working man throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that denial of medical services to secondary and vocational schools is needless parsimony.</P>
      <P>I pointed out that the proposal to treat children up to the age of six weeks instead of up to school age, when they could then be taken in under the school medical service, represents a miserable paring down on health services&mdash;services which, in my view, ought to be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I complained that one of the biggest difficulties which the Labour Party has about this Bill is that its administration will be left to the county manager. He is the gentleman who will have all the power and all the authority under this Bill.  It is he who will prepare regulations.  It is he who will railroad the people into hospital.  It is he who will collect the money which he decides to charge people for undergoing hospital or specialist treatment&mdash;and, under the Bill, he will do that without any reference to the local authority. We have to remember all the time that this local bureaucrat is solely responsible to the Minister who can compel him to do anything the Minister wants him to do and the local authority will merely provide a grandstand audience when they see the county manager <Col N="671" /> implement the directions given by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party submitted a number of amendments designed to remedy many of the blemishes in this Bill.  For example, we desire that some of these cheese-paring methods will be eliminated from the Bill and that there will be a broader and more understanding approach to the economic difficulties of persons whose only income is that derived from a week's wages and whose only shield against poverty is their ability to toil regularly for 52 weeks of the year.  We have urged, in respect of those people, that whatever grading of contributions is to take place under this Bill will be done with due regard to the inability of men in receipt of an income of 24/- or 50/- per week to pay for hospital or specialist services.  We have urged, in respect of ordinary workers coming under the Social Welfare Act, that there shall also be a recognition that they just cannot pay for hospital services and that if they do manage to pay it is only at the expense of depriving themselves of food or clothes or of letting their weekly bills or rent run into arrears.  We have urged that we ought not evolve a health scheme which compels them to pay fees charged by the county manager&mdash;fees which can be paid only by sacrificing many of the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>We have urged, in an amendment to this Bill, that the patient should have a choice of doctor.  In the White Paper on which this Bill was supposed to be based, provision was made for a choice of doctor by the patient.  There is no choice of doctor in this Bill.  The patient will have Hobson's choice&mdash;and Mr. Hobson, as we all know, was a gentleman who had a lot of horses for hire: you could have any one of them but you had to take the first one.  The patient must take the doctor whom the county manager prescribes.  We have submitted an amendment to the Bill in an endeavour to secure for the patient a choice of doctor&mdash;a choice which was promised in the original White Paper.</P>
    <P>Many of the amendments which we have submitted are designed to remove flaws and imperfections from the Bill. We wanted to ensure that the Bill <Col N="672" /> would be far more liberal in its approach to the economic difficulties of working people and that, in certain respects, it would be more liberal in its approach to children.  We desired that it would provide services for young persons attending vocational and secondary schools in the way services are provided for children attending national schools.</P>
    <P>We wanted a choice of doctor and we wanted to make quite sure that so far as the administration of this Bill is concerned&mdash;at the point where the administration of the Bill meets the ordinary patient&mdash;the county manager would be required to set up a health committee consisting of representatives of the medical profession, of local administrative staff and of the majority of members of the county council concerned. We wanted to ensure that that body would approach this problem of health services from the point of view of the economic and human needs of the person concerned, of endeavouring to get satisfactory health services and of ensuring that the people's representatives would be allowed an adequate voice in the framing of local health services and the charges which would be imposed on persons availing of such services.</P>
    <P>I understand, with regard to the letter from the Hierarchy, that one of the complaints is that patients are not being permitted a choice of doctor. The Minister can tell me whether or not that is so.  I understand the position as reported to me is that one of the complaints of the Hierarchy is that the patient is denied a choice of doctors under this Bill.  We agree that is a flaw in the Bill and it ought to be remedied.  We have submitted an amendment to that effect.  We understand, too, that one of the complaints of the Hierarchy is that they, like the Labour Party, object to the administration of these services locally being in the hands of one man who is tied back to the Minister and obliged to carry out the directions issued by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another complaint I hear is that there ought to be a better or a more satisfactory scheme of grading charges in the Bill.  If there are to be charges <Col N="673" /> in the Bill, then the charges ought to take cognisance of the inability of people in receipt of ordinary weekly wages to pay the charge which can be imposed on them by the county manager under this Bill and which can even be imposed on them notwithstanding the fact that they are endeavouring to subsist on sickness benefit payable under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>So far as my information goes, therefore, many of the complaints which have been made by the Labour Party during the discussion on this Money Resolution and on the Bill proper are complaints about flaws, imperfections and deficiencies in the Bill which apparently are covered also in the document issued by the Hierarchy. Just as they seemingly desire the Bill amended so as to conform with their views as to the relationship of the Bill with Catholic social teaching, we in the Labour Party also take the view that the Bill ought to be amended in these aspects because if the Bill goes through in its present form it is denying to the Bill that democratic element which is essential to the administration of a free and responsible health service.</P>
    <P>Our vote on the Second Stage of this Bill was a vote not for any doctrinaire health scheme or for any particular view as to what shape the health scheme ought to take.  Our vote then was, just as our vote now will be, a vote in favour of a satisfactory health scheme.  We want a comprehensive health scheme.  Above all, we want a health scheme which will take note of the inability of large masses of the people to make any contribution for hospital treatment except to the extent that they deprive themselves of the necessaries of civilised living. We want a health service which will be democratic in its concept and democratic in its operation by tying into the administration of the service at a high level a properly constituted national health authority, not one that will meet when the Minister wishes it to meet and never to meet if the Minister does not wish it to meet, but one which will meet regularly and be composed of professional people and sensible people who will give to the Minister either when requested by him <Col N="674" /> or of their own volition advice on essential health matters concerning the community.</P>
    <P>While we want that at the top, at the bottom where the service impacts on the local persons, we want a health councils&mdash;so as to ensure that this body is representative of the will of the persons, county managers, county surgeons, county medical officers of health, a couple of practising doctors and perhaps a nurse&mdash;the professional knowledge all tied in with a greater number of members of the county councils&mdash;so as to ensure that this body is representative of the will of the people expressed in the local elections and will be able to bring to bear on the operation of the health services that humanitarian outlook and that understanding of people's difficulties which is often absent from the physical and mental make-up of the county managers.</P>
    <P>Our vote on the Second Stage has been, just as our vote on this Money Resolution will be, a vote for a decent health service, for a scheme which will take cognisance of the necessity for moulding our health legislation on the lines I have indicated.  We want to see a comprehensive scheme.  We want to see an efficient scheme and one through which breathes an appreciation of people's difficulties and a democratic approach to the application of the scheme.  Our vote on this Money Resolution will, therefore, be a vote in favour of the provision of a health service.  We will seek on the Committee Stage to secure by the votes of this House some of the essential amendments which we have tabled. We shall also seek by argument across the floor of the House to persuade the Minister that in matters in which we cannot move amendments he should do so in order to ensure that the Bill will be moulded and shaped to suit the needs of those who are genuinely concerned with the passing of a satisfactory health service which can be administered without irritation and without the red tape which at the outset must seriously impair he proper implementation of any genuine health service.</P>
    <P>While we would vote for this Money Resolution, that vote must be interpreted <Col N="675" /> as a vote for a satisfactory health scheme.  We will strive to have the Bill amended by our own amendments and by arguments which will be advanced in the course of the debate on the Committee Stage.  I hope that when he is concluding, the Minister will indicate that no sense of punctilio will induce him to stand over a Bill which he knows from an examination of its merits and which he knows from advertence to the document he has received from the Hierarchy, will not represent a satisfactory Bill if it goes through this House without amendment.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, the Minister will take this opportunity of indicating what he proposes to do to meet the amendments which have been tabled, and to meet the other amendments which he has been asked to make.  I hope that no sense of face and no sense of artificial rectitude in these matters will prevent the Minister from agreeing that in a Health Bill which is of such tremendous importance to the whole people, we should be prevented from securing the greatest possible measure of agreement by any reluctance on the part of the Minister to depart from the provisions of the Bill which he has brought before the House.</P>
    <P>Our desire is to see, and our final vote on the matter depends upon this, how far the Bill is made satisfactory from the point of view of those on whom the Bill impacts as patients, No. 1; and we want to ensure also that the Bill will not pass this House doing violence to or being in any way contradictory to Catholic social principles or Catholic social teaching.  If the Bill conforms to those two tests, that it is in conformity with Catholic social principles and Catholic social teaching and, at the same time, is a Bill which we can stand over in the competency of the administrative measures recommended in it, then the Bill will ultimately beget our full and final support.  At this stage our vote is a vote for a health service and we must judge the situation during the Committee and other stages of the Bill. We will endeavour to amend it then hoping ultimately that we can get a <Col N="676" /> satisfactory Bill and one which does not do violence to Catholic thought and Catholic social principles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself largely in agreement with the views expressed by the Leader of the Labour Party, and I do not propose to detain the House by reiterating our views.  We have tabled a number of amendments, too, dealing with the Committee Stage of this Bill.  I would like to make one final appeal to the Minister.  I already made an appeal of this sort to him speaking on this question the other day.  Anybody who has the welfare of the health services at heart should deplore the discussion of this Bill in the atmosphere of the issues that have arisen and in the atmosphere of sharp Party conflict.</P>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister to leave over the further consideration of this Bill for, say, a fortnight and to circulate whatever amendments he proposes to put forward. He could then appeal to the House to resume the discussion in an objective atmosphere when we would have an opportunity of enacting the best possible Health Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister must give credit to Parties on all sides of the House for genuinely desiring to promote a good Health Bill and to improve health services generally.  The Minister has to remember, too, that all Parties are committed to providing whatever moneys are required to make proper health services available.  I would appeal to the Minister therefore to leave over the further discussion of this Resolution and the Committee Stage until such time as he has had an opportunity of considering whatever amendments he wishes to introduce himself and of circulating these amendments to enable Deputies to consider them.  I ask also that he should, as far as possible, indicate at an early stage which of the amendments already tabled, both by the Labour Party and by Clann na Poblachta, he is prepared to accept and discuss.  I think it would be of assistance to the House to know that.  It is unfair, in my opinion, to ask the House to proceed with a further discussion of the Bill until the <Col N="677" /> House has had an opportunity of knowing what amendments the Minister proposes to accept.  I shall not go into any further detail, but I think the Minister should accept the suggestion I am making.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister has the time not arrived to withdraw the Bill and to bring in a measure that will satisfy the Hierarchy?  We have not been told either by the Taoiseach or the Minister the nature of the correspondence that has passed and some of us are being asked to vote in the dark.  As Deputy Norton has stated, we want to vote for a health service but this is not the Bill we want. I cannot see Deputy Norton or anybody else amending this Bill to make it a suitable measure and I would ask the Minister to consider the advisability of withdrawing the Bill and of introducing one that will satisfy all Parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been discussed at great length and I shall be very brief now.  Some Deputies have expressed the view that we are at a serious disadvantage in discussing the Bill in the light of the rumour or information that the Irish Hierarchy have made certain requests to the Government.  I personally feel that I am at a great disadvantage also due to the fact that rumour has it&mdash;and the rumour seems to be well-founded&mdash;that some communications have passed between the Hierarchy and the Government.  If that is so, I should like to have the views of the Hierarchy before I would be in a position to speak fully and openly on this Bill. However, the Leader and members of our Party made it clear quite a long time ago, on the occasion of the meeting of our national executive at Limerick, that we were opposed to this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a poor rural constituency, North Mayo.  I go around the constituency quite a lot and I meet all types of people&mdash;the working class, many poor people, perhaps better-off people and some members of the wealthy class.  I have not met any constituents so far who were in favour of the Bill.  I feel that in the circumstances I must oppose it.  I am very <Col N="678" /> conversant with the health services generally in the county for the reason that I am a member of the Hospitals' Visiting Committee there.  I had an opportunity some months ago of discussing with the county surgeon and the county physician the question of hospitalisation in the county.  They expressed the opinion that our hospitals were already overcrowded and that if any new measure of this kind were enacted, we would not have sufficient accommodation to facilitate the extra patients.</P>
    <P>That opinion was expressed by the responsible medical man and the responsible surgeon in my county. Having carried out inspections of the various institutions in the county on a number of occasions and having seen things as they are in our various institutions, even within the last fortnight, I am perfectly satisfied that we cannot hope to accommodate any additional patients in these institutions.  I quite agree with the viewpoints of the doctors who say that they are not able to cope with this extra work if it is imposed upon them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Government (Mr. Lynch) Jack Lynch">

      <P>Is the suggestion, then, that people who need hospital treatment must go without it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the suggestion. I have put the situation plainly and in understandable language.  One of the doctors who has given expression to that opinion is a brother of a Fianna Fáil Deputy for Mayo and a responsible doctor.  If you care to visit our county hospital in Mayo, you will find that that state of affairs does exist.  In that institution we have patients lying on the floor on mattresses. If the Parliamentary Secretary cares to have the statement I am making here investigated, I am sure he will find that it is true and correct. I am not stating any lies or trying to put something across the floor of the House which is not true.  I am conversant with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Deputy is telling lies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, I was on a number of deputations to the <Col N="679" /> Minister in connection with this matter and the Minister knows that what I am stating is correct.  He realises our difficulties and in fairness to him I should state that, to a considerable extent, he has been sympathetic to our representations.  Quite apart from the question of the attitude of the Hierarchy, I feel that if this measure goes through we shall not be able to accommodate additional patients.</P>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity also to make a protest against a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  He stated here on last Friday morning that doctors in County Mayo were accepting ass-loads of turf, eggs and chickens as payment for their services to people in County Mayo.  As I have already stated, I am already fully conversant with conditions in Mayo and I feel that that statement is absolutely untrue. There is not a semblance of truth in it.</P>
      <P>I feel that the Taoiseach should ask the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw that statement and to apologise here in the House where he made that statement.  I have on more than one occasion criticised the system which operates in the county and perhaps I said hard things about medical men in the past, but I can say this much to the credit of the Mayo doctors, that, taking them through and through, they are a decent, honourable and charitable group of men and are certainly not of the type that would accept a bribe of an ass-load of turf, of eggs, of chickens or anything else and I think it is a disgrace that such a statement should have been made in this Parliament and by a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill is passed, it will be one of the worst Bills that has passed through the House in my short time here.  It is rather difficult to speak at any great length on this subject when it is so strongly rumoured that the Irish Hierarchy have intervened with the Government and when members of the House have not been made aware of the communications which have been received.  Other Deputies have expressed the same point of view, that it is very difficult to discuss a matter of this kind in the absence of such information, and I think it is very <Col N="680" /> wrong and very unfair that the Taoiseach and the Minister should deny such information to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>If there were no ethical or moral issues in connection with this Bill&mdash;and we do not intend to discuss the Bill from that angle&mdash; and if the Bill were acceptable to the House in its present form, we would have to protest very strongly against the principle which the Minister proposes of asking the local authorities to provide 50 per cent. of the capital for the administration of this scheme.  The Minister will appreciate that we are highly rated in my county, and, no matter what county council is in existence there, I cannot see for years to come any inclination on the part of the councillors to impose an extra burden on the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>We are one of the heaviest rated counties of the 26, and, coming from County Mayo, we would find it very difficult to accept the principle involved in the Bill, even though the Minister would wish us to believe that it will mean only an extra 2/- on the rates.  We do not believe that.  It is our belief and our contention that, when this Bill becomes law and is put into operation, the ratepayers of Mayo will be asked to provide anything from 2/- to 10/- in the £ extra.  It is well that the Minister should be clear on this issue that the ratepayers of Mayo are in no position to provide that increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I should be only too glad to see a Health Bill in operation which would be of benefit to the people, but, as a member of the local authority for the past eight years and more, I have not yet discovered a patient who wished to avail himself of hospital treatment and who failed to do so.  I have not discovered any patient who wished to have treatment at the hands of the best specialists or doctors in the country who failed to secure it.  If these people who enter our county hospitals find that they are unable to pay, everything is made all right, and at no time have they been embarrassed or held up to public odium because they were unable to meet the charges arising out of the treatment they have received.  The <Col N="681" /> same applies to extern treatment in the City of Dublin when a patient is sent up here for certain treatment or an operation which is not available in the county hospital and I think that the House will find it very difficult to justify a Bill involving such heavy costs for the ratepayer and taxpayer such as this Bill or another Bill which may be introduced in the very near future. I agree that quite a lot of improvement could be carried out in relation to the renovation and extension of our institutions.  The matron of our county hospital informed us a short time ago, on the occasion of a visit we paid to the county hospital, that, over the past few years, the number of maternity cases has quadrupled and that sufficient accommodation is not available.</P>
    <P>There is need for the provision of an extra maternity block for that institution, and, if such an extra block is essential without the operation of this mother and child scheme, what are we entitled to visualise will be required when the Bill has been a year or two in operation.  The Minister is aware from the information given him when we visited him in his office recently that the outlay which the ratepayers were asked to provide amounted to £250,000.  That expenditure came before the county council in the course of the discussion on the annual estimates and it was left aside, because, irrespective of our political affiliations and looking at the whole thing as elected representatives&mdash;on the Mayo County Council, we co-operate very reasonably in trying to do the best we can for the ratepayers&mdash;we could not take it on ourselves to saddle the ratepayers with the provision of an extra £250,000, notwithstanding that we realised the necessity for the extension of some of these institutions.</P>
    <P>There is, as the Minister is aware, need for a modern clinic attached to our mental hospital and for a female nurses' home there also.  That has been an outstanding necessity over a period of years.  There is need for a maternity block and a clinic attached to our county hospital, and for a nurses' home.  There is need for the renovation of the county home which <Col N="682" /> has been discussed time and time again by the county council.  All these works amount to something like £250,000.  If this Bill or any other Health Bill is put into operation and the ratepayers of Mayo are asked to provide 50 per cent. of the cost, I can assure the Minister and the House that the ratepayers will refuse, no matter who is on the council, to make this extra provision in the form of an increase in the rates.  Apart from the ethical or moral principles involved in this measure, if there are any&mdash;I am not going to rely on rumour until we hear what the Minister has to say&mdash;I judge this Bill on the cost it will entail on the ratepayers of my county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy answer a question for me?  If the charge on a small farmer with a valuation of £6 in County Mayo will be 2/- in the £, what will it cost him for maintenance and specialist treatment in the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy McQuillan's question whether as a small farmers' representative&mdash;I am a small farmer myself&mdash;I would consider it good value that the small farmer of Mayo would be able to secure the best specialist and medical attention that goes with hospital treatment.  I appreciate that question, but I should like to point out to Deputy McQuillan that we have got no guarantee from the Minister that it is only going to cost 2/- in the £ on the rates.  Deputy McQuillan is not too young in years and not so innocent as not to know that this Bill, when in operation, will cost much more than 2/- in the £.  As I said a few moments ago, the matron informed us that the number of patients seeking accommodation in our county hospitals&mdash;I speak only for our county hospitals.  I know nothing about the county hospitals in other counties, but I assume it is the same with them &mdash;has quadrupled over the years.  The demand made upon us at the present moment&mdash;I am not speaking of the increased demand which will come about when the Bill is in operation&mdash;is very great.  It is on that evidence that I have to oppose this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> If the moneys essential for the administration of this Bill and for the provision of specialist, surgical and medical treatment were provided from the central purse I would look at it from a different point of view.  But faced with the position with which we are faced and having regard to the fact that the farmers are poor, their valuations small and that they are saddled with a heavy rate, I would be failing in my duty if I were, by my vote, to impose any further burden on them.  I am not antagonistic to the Minister or the Government.  I appreciate that the Minister is, perhaps, doing his utmost to provide the people with better social services.  I also appreciate that his intentions may be the very best, but my reason for speaking is to indicate both to the Labour Party and to the Government that that is the position.  I do not know how these people stand in relation to their own constituencies but quite a number of them, I understand, are members of local authorities.  If they are in the same dilemma as we are in at the present moment, then I can hardly understand how they are going to justify their conduct before the ratepayers. At their annual meeting next year they will have to strike the rate to provide money to administer the provisions of this Bill.  That is my main grievance.  That is the reason why I will walk into the lobby to-night to vote against this Money Resolution.</P>

Is it not a fact that the money has to be paid by somebody?  Is it not a fact that if it is not paid by the poor person himself it goes directly to the ratepayers?  Can the Deputy not see the fallacy in his entire argument against this Bill on the basis that the ratepayers are being burdened?</P>

      <P>I have been kept for four days from telling Deputies what they are going to hear.  Perhaps they will listen now.  The debate was a very long and unpleasant one on a Money Resolution of this kind.  It is very hard to know why it lasted so long.  I am sure Deputies will realise that it would be impossible even were I to speak until 10.30 p.m. to deal with all the points raised.  Many of the points raised should properly have been made on Second Reading.  If some of the Parties were caught out in some way and did not make Second Reading speeches they kept them for this. Many of the points raised can be more properly dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am puzzled as to why Fine Gael are going to vote against this Money Resolution.  I know they are going to vote against it to show that they are against the Health Bill.  Usually when a Party opposes a Bill, they oppose it for a certain reason or for a number of reasons but when you have members of a Party opposing a Bill for directly opposite reasons it is very hard to understand it.  It does appear, I think, very evident that Fine Gael made up their minds that they were going to <Col N="685" /> oppose the Bill and thought of the reasons afterwards.  That is quite evident because some of them said they were opposing this Bill because it was not a good Bill and that they did not mind the cost.  Others said it was only because it was so costly they would vote against it.  Others said that on no account would they support it it was so bad.  While others, with a slight amendment here and there, said that the Bill would be acceptable. That, I think, should be sufficient to show any intelligent person why Fine Gael met hurriedly last Wednesday, made up their minds they had made a mistake in letting the Bill through, made a mistake in providing the money for the Bill by letting the Estimate through the week before last and then had not time to say why they were going to oppose it.  They came to the Dáil and each man made up his own mind on what he would say against the Bill.  It is not very easy to deal with an Opposition like that&mdash;a conglomerate number of individual Deputies, each man thinking of his own constituency, each thinking of political opportunism, each opposed to the Bill for some reason of his own but not sticking to the speeches of their Leader, Deputy Costello, because Deputy Costello condemned the Bill through and through.  He said it was wrong in every respect that any man could think of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins, for instance, said that the only reason he was going to oppose it was because it would cost too much.  Deputy Esmonde said that if he knew what the cost was and thought it was not too much he would support the Bill.  Speaking here to-day, Deputy O'Donnell said that only for the cost he could not see any great objection to the Bill.</P>
    <P>You had member after member coming along and speaking, and yet they did not know what Deputy Costello had said.  They gave their own reasons because they were told by the Whip: &ldquo;Go in and oppose the Bill; it does not matter what you say.&rdquo;  That is because there is no Fine Gael policy.  The only Fine Gael policy is to oppose the Bill.  Why did they make up their minds last Wednesday to oppose the Bill and agree to it on the Second <Col N="686" /> Reading?  I have the Official Report here which says: &ldquo;The Bill is agreed.&rdquo; Why did they come in on the Estimate and vote £500,000 for the working of this Bill?  Again, there was no objection to the Estimate.  It was agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not mind about the Estimate because he did not know the reasons for opposing the Bill at that time.  He was not aware of the reasons at that time.  That is quite obvious.  Their reasons cropped up afterwards and then they had a hurried meeting.  They said to Deputy Costello: &ldquo;Go in and oppose the Bill, and oppose it vigorously; hit the table; oppose it up and down and give us a lead.&rdquo;  But they did not take the lead.  They were not able to take the lead because they thought up some other reasons, some of them on the grounds of cost and others of them on some other ground&mdash;because there was something left out.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, the principal speaker amongst them, made a most denunciatory speech, but he wound up by saying that if I could provide a proper consultative council that, well, things would be different, that the Bill could be knocked into a shape which they could accept.  You had all these various reasons for rejecting the Bill, all of them speaking with divers tongues, but at the same time sticking to the Whip to oppose the Bill. Why did the Fine Gael Party let the Second Reading through?  It is recorded in the Official Report that the Second Reading was agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did the Fine Gael Party let the Estimate through, an Estimate which provided £500,000 for the implementation of this Bill?  The Estimate was agreed to and went through.  What did they hear on Wednesday morning that made them change their minds, and why was there such a hurried <Col N="687" /> meeting that they must oppose it, and talk it out for three days?  Why all this opposition?  I go outside sometimes for a smoke when some Deputy is talking who is not interesting and there are a few of them in this House. I saw Fine Gael men coming up and one saying to the other: &ldquo;You talk next&rdquo;.  That went on the whole week. They were just talking it out.  Why did they talk it out for a week in view of the fact that we have a lot of business to do in this session?  The Estimates have to be put through, and why was it necessary to talk this out for a whole week?  They never gave any reason. The only thing they said was that they were voting against the Money Resolution. They wanted to give the impression that they were against the Bill, but they did not give that impression on the Second Reading.  Why did they change their minds, I wonder?  None of them has told us.</P>
    <P>Then they did a thing which is not usual.  They brought in Deputy McGilligan to-day.  They had him here on Friday and had him here to-day at Question Time to make a speech.  I do not know why there has been such terrible commotion about a Money Resolution.  Usually, a Money Resolution goes through the Dáil in five minutes.  As a rule, it is a formality. They agreed to the Second Reading of the Bill, and they agreed to the Estimate.</P>
    <P>Under that Estimate they agreed to give me, as Minister for Health, £500,000 to work the Bill, but now they will not let the Minister for Finance give me the £500,000 which they had already voted to the Minister for Finance for that purpose.  Was there ever such a silly vote in this House? They agreed to the Second Reading of the Bill and agreed to give the Minister for Finance £500,000 to finance the Bill.  Now they say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;Well, you have the £500,000 but you must not pay it over.&rdquo;  Does that Party want to stultify itself by going on like that because they must give some reason? They have not given any reason so far.  I suppose we are not going to get any reason, and so we might as <Col N="688" /> well proceed and get on with the business.</P>

There was no interest whatever in the Bill at that time, but they are so interested now that they have taken four days to talk it out, bringing in relays to talk it out.  On that occasion they had nothing at all to say.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy will look at the details given under &ldquo;Miscellaneous Grants&rdquo; he will find the information which I have just given to the House.  Then we had Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy McGilligan made a very long, tedious and venomous speech against the Bill here to-day.  I suppose I need hardly say that it was venomous, because it would be hard for that Deputy to make a speech <Col N="689" /> which was not venomous.  It was a long, tedious speech.  He spoke for over an hour denouncing the Bill.  Anybody listening to Deputy McGilligan would think that he could never have seen anything good in the Bill.  Deputy McGrath quoted Deputy McGilligan here before, and it is no harm to quote him again.  On the 20th March last in this House Deputy McGrath said something which drew this remark from Deputy McGilligan, speaking at column 958: &ldquo;I did not speak against the Health Bill.&rdquo;  That was correct. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle then said that Deputy McGrath was entitled to be heard, and Deputy McGilligan replied:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Is he entitled completely to misrepresent? I did not say anything against the Health Bill.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Lower down, on the same column, Deputy McGrath came back again on the subject, and Deputy McGilligan said: &ldquo;I am not against it.&rdquo;  Imagine that Deputy, who is not against the Health Bill, making the speech he made here to-day.  What changed him?  Why did he change around to make that long venomous speech against the Bill that he is not against?  Deputy Mulcahy chipped in and said that it was not against the Bill they voted, that is, the Fine Gael Party, but in favour of an amendment introduced by Deputy Dr. O'Higgins.  He did not want it to be said that the Fine Gael Party voted against the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am getting back to the point now.  I am getting back to this point, that Deputy Mulcahy said it was not against the Bill that the Fine Gael Party voted.  At that time the Fine Gael Party were not too sure what they should do.  They did not vote against it.  Deputy Mulcahy was balancing the thing nicely&mdash;we voted for the amendment but not against the Bill.  Did Deputies hear the speech Deputy Mulcahy made against the Bill?  Why did he change?  Why did they all change like that so completely <Col N="690" /> around to opposition to the Bill?  They have not told us.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan made a very long speech here which was interspersed here and there with references to the suppression of a certain document and, in the course of his speech, he told us that in 1950 there was a Minister for Health there, that Deputy McGilligan does not like now&mdash;he did not say anything against him then, of course&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe last thoughts are better than first.  I am not like Deputy O'Leary.  Deputy McGilligan says that the Department of Health, through this Minister&mdash;I do not know whether this is true or not&mdash;put up a proposition that they would make the dispensary doctors work the scheme whether they liked it or not and that then, of course, the other fellows would have to follow.  He denounced that here to-day as a shabby scheme but we heard nothing about that until to-day. Deputy McGilligan did not come into this House at that time and say: &ldquo;There is a most disgraceful proposition put up to the Government to deal with the doctors&rdquo;.  He was in the intrigue himself, I suppose.  He did not mind taking part in the intrigue. Now, when it is all over, he is able to quote it as a thing that the Department of Health is capable of doing. Why did he not expose that?  Why did Deputy Mulcahy not expose it?  Or Deputy MacEoin?  Deputy MacEoin above all, should expose it&mdash;a man of his views.  None of them did.  They <Col N="691" /> allowed the thing to go on, that sort of intrigue of compelling the dispensary doctors to accept the scheme and then, of course, the other men must follow suit and everything would be all right.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Department of Health put that up or not but Deputy McGilligan says they did and, by implication, he allowed us to believe that he and the other members of the Government were parties to the proposition and, I suppose, agreed to it without any great objection at that time.</P>
      <P>There were many objections raised to this Bill which are objections that have not been raised in the past.  I want to put it this way: We have the same county hospitals, the same county staff, the same county manager, the same public wards.  There was no objection made to these things as long as the lower income group were concerned but all these speakers got up in this debate and objected strongly to the public wards and to the sort of service we have and to the county managers' interference, when the middle income group are concerned.  Deputy McGilligan spent quite a while on that to-day.  I detest that Fine Gael snobbery. Deputy Hickey would probably call it bourgeois mentality but, whatever he would call it, I detest it.  I know Deputy Hickey detests it too. It is Fine Gael snobbery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was all right, there was no complaint whatever, as long as they were dealing with the poor people in the lower income group but now, when the middle income group are coming in, they deserve better treatment, according to Fine Gael.  It is all right to put these other people into a public ward but surely, they said to me, you are not going to put the middle income group into a public ward.  According to Deputy McGilligan, and some of the other Fine Gael speakers, it is not good enough for them.  Although the county manager was all right, as they say, to herd the <Col N="692" /> lower income group around&mdash;there was never any complaint about that&mdash;when it comes to herding the middle income group around, that is quite a different matter and Fine Gael will not stand for it.</P>
      <P>We should try to get away from that snobbery and try, if you like, to give better treatment all round.  I know, of course, that some of the people over there talk about this egalitarianism&mdash; bring people down.  I think we are making an effort to bring people up.</P>

      <P>There was a lot of talk here about my friend, Deputy Joe Kennedy. Things can be said, approached in a very different way.  I have a very distinct recollection of a doctor friend of mine&mdash;I will mention his name outside this House to anybody who asks me his name&mdash;telling me only a few months ago that he was sorry he left Mayo because, he said, they were the decentest people in the world, they never bring you a ticket; they bring you a creel of turf, a chicken, or something like that.

I have never from the beginning said there was no means test in this Bill or in this scheme.  If I had no means test, it would be a free for all.  It must be very obvious, even to Deputy O'Leary, that if there was no means test it would be a free for all, like the English scheme but it is not like the English scheme.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies ask&mdash;and it is a fairly legitimate thing to ask &mdash;why not improve the existing services before we bring in new ones.  I can understand that point, but I do not think it is always necessary to wait, to complete one chapter absolutely before you go on to the next. There is always a little overlapping. It will take some time to effect the improvement of the present services that we have in mind, and in the meantime we can be building up the services that are outlined in this Bill.  I do not see why that should not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Deputy here can accuse the Government of not being out for the improvement of the existing services. After all, in the Estimates you will find £4,500,000 for capital expenditure and added to that will be the proceeds of the Hospitals' Sweeps.  That will be sufficient to go ahead with the building of hospitals&mdash;you do not build hospitals in a year&mdash;and the reconstruction of some existing buildings.  As well as that, it will be possible to replace half our dispensaries; they will be rebuilt or reconstructed during the coming year.  When Deputy Dr. O'Higgins was talking, he more or less anticipated what I am just saying.  He said this reconstruction was necessary owing to the neglect of this Government over <Col N="695" /> the last 20 years.  But why did he not talk about the ten years before that, when Cumann na nGaedheal was there and when nothing at all was done?</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton and others said this Bill was not as good as they would like it to be, I can assure Deputy Norton I, too, would prefer it to be a better Bill.  It is not for the love of the thing that I am keeping the Bill down to the level at which I am introducing it; but I think that, in the circumstances, it is as good as we can produce at this moment.  The ratepayers have to pay half the cost; and every Deputy who spoke on that point complained that the rates were already too high.  The taxpayers will have to pay the other half; and there is no Deputy will say that taxation could be increased for this or any other purpose. We have to keep in mind that the ratepayers and taxpayers are heavily burdened already and therefore we must keep the cost down to what we think will give a reasonable service for the time being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there are those who want a better scheme.  Deputy Costello, for instance, wants a comprehensive scheme.  He says our present services are not nearly good enough and he desires much better services than we have.  I do not know why he would not vote for this Bill and take it for the time being.  I do not know why any man would not take half a loaf while waiting for the whole loaf to be prepared&mdash;why he should starve in the meantime.  Why will Deputy Costello not take this Bill as it is and say that he hopes that, if Fianna Fáil <Col N="696" /> remains in power&mdash;as I suppose they will&mdash;they will produce something better?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I am fully aware and realise that the particular stand that we take here to-day on this Resolution will be misrepresented by our political opponents.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let me not try to misrepresent him, because if I were an able politician and quoted Deputy Costello exactly in the country I could do him more harm than hours of misrepresentation.  If one goes through his speech, one will find no necessity to misrepresent Deputy Costello, as he misrepresents himself through contradictions up and down his speech.  One could prove anything out of that speech without misrepresenting him at all, so there is no necessity for that appeal to fair play.  He lays down principles.  He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Could we not agree on principles &mdash;(1), that it is nothing but a fraudulent pretence to suggest that there is any such thing as a free service for any section of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Well, of course, that is so elementary that I am surprised at a grown-up man making the point.  Surely we know that services or money do not come down from the air.  Someone must provide the money and no one would say that the Leader of a Party like Fine Gael should think it necessary to lay down a principle like that.  Maybe it was necessary for some of his Deputies, like Deputy Rooney, but for ordinary intelligent men it appears to <Col N="697" /> be ridiculous.  Then he comes to the next principle and says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every Deputy in this House stands for the principle that no citizen of this State is going to be deprived of all necessary medical, surgical and nursing appliances and attention, merely because of lack of means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who has ever denied that?  Is there any Deputy, or will there ever be one, who will deny that principle?  It is so self-evident that it is hardly necessary to lay it down.  He asks: &ldquo;Could we not agree on these two principles?&rdquo; Of course we can.  We will all agree that they must be paid for and that we will not deprive anyone of medical services for want of means.  That is what we are all striving to do.  I do not know why he should go to the trouble of making them first principles.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello's speech was interspersed with some of these expressions &ldquo;fradulent pretence&rdquo; and &ldquo;subterfuge&rdquo; and &ldquo;niggardly service.&rdquo; These things are the stock-in-trade phrases of a man who intends to make a fairly long speech but has nothing much to say.  After all, he was asked to make a denunciatory speech and if he could not do it in the quality of his speech he supplied it in the quantity, by speaking for over an hour.  If one were to go back over his speech to try to find out why he was against it, even an intelligent man would find it hard to make up his mind.  The only thing I know that might have affected it was the circumstances, that he had little notice but an order from his Party to oppose the Bill and he came in and did it well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not fair to a man like Deputy Costello to use him like that.  In years to come when the history of this country is written and somebody reads about the great statesmen who existed, if anyone comes across this speech he will say that Deputy Costello was not a very able man.  It is not fair to Deputy Costello to be giving him tasks like that to perform.  I advise Deputy <Col N="698" /> Mulcahy, who is the Leader of the Party, to get somebody else to do that job in future.</P>

      <P>Did not Deputy O'Leary come in to listen to me?  Deputy Costello went on, as reported in column 56 of the same volume, to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Under this Bill there is not a choice of doctor, of hospital, of maternity service or of anything else.  In theory, there is a choice of doctor.  Neither in theory nor in practice is there a choice of hospital.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton said the same thing. That is wrong.  Deputy Norton is not a lawyer, but Deputy Costello is. Deputy Costello protested in advance against misrepresentation.  He is the Leader of the Fine Gael Party and, admittedly, a very eminent lawyer, and yet he made that statement that there was no choice of doctor.</P>
      <P>For the information of Deputy Costello, Deputy Norton and others, I may say that Section 15 provides for a choice of doctor.  I am advised by my legal advisers that Section 15 gives that authority.  But I do admit and, therefore, I do not blame Deputy Norton because he is a layman, that it is not as plain to me as I would like it to be, but it must be plain to Deputy Costello who is a lawyer and to Deputy MacBride who is a lawyer that choice of doctor is provided for under Section 15.</P>
      <P>In order, however, that Deputy Costello, Deputy Norton or anybody else may not have any misgivings with regard to this, I am prepared to consider the amendment suggested by Deputy Norton and Deputy Larkin, I think, subject to redrafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> Deputy Costello again says that not only choice of doctor but choice of hospital is not provided for.  Deputy O'Higgins also mentioned the same thing.  I am not concerned in this with the question of the ward or private home.  There has been a point made by certain Deputies in regard to choice of a hospital, and I intend to have an amendment prepared to cover the point.  I do not want, however, to be misunderstood.  It is not possible I am afraid to give a full choice of hospital to everybody.  It cannot be done for various reasons which can be discussed when we come to the section concerned. It will, I hope, be feasible to give a subvention to certain people who are prepared to subscribe a certain amount themselves for hospital treatment.  That means, of course, as far as the choice of hospital is concerned, that it will not be very much use to a person who cannot pay something for himself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello also said, as reported in column 47 of the same volume:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are against the proposals in the Bill and the expenditure of money on those proposals because the principle of the Bill, in so far as there is any principle at all in the Bill, is merely an extension of the dispensary services, merely an extension of the public assistance services to a great number of people and different classes and because, based as they are upon that dispensary system, which is the product of an alien Administration in this country, the proposals in the Bill are an enlargement of State control and the forerunner of socialist medicine in this country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello in another part of his speech condemns the dispensary system.  I should like to say that there is another side to that picture and I think it is well worth going into.  I do not want to go into too much detail, but some of the Deputies on the other side did approve of the dispensary system and stated it was necessary to retain it and improve upon it.  As Deputy Costello devoted a lot of his <Col N="700" /> speech to regretting my attitude in not getting advice from the Irish Medical Association, it might be well to give the House some idea of what was got from the Irish Medical Association on this question in the past.  As far back as 1944, the Irish Medical Association were asked for a report.  In that report they say that the dispensary service would continue basically as at present in rural areas with considerable modifications. What are the modifications? That we should provide health centres adequately staffed with one or more nurses, a compounder and secretarial assistance, a fully equipped waiting room and consulting room, laboratory and X-ray, and that the wardens should be replaced by properly trained sanitary officers or almoners.  I was surprised when I read that some time ago.  I said to myself that surely any Deputy from a rural area who would read that report would say, &ldquo;You cannot expect to get any sort of decent advice from that particular body of people&rdquo;.  I am referring to the idea of having X-ray equipment and a laboratory in every dispensary in the country and replacing wardens with almoners all over the country.</P>
    <P>I went on to read about this matter and what was the history of this whole question of dispensaries and I found they made another recommedation, that district midwives should be appointed, one to every 1,000 of the population, which would work out in public assistance cases that every midwife would have three or four cases to look after in the year.  In 1949, again, the Irish Medical Association submitted their recommendations.  They were much the same, except that they dropped the X-ray equipment out of the rural dispensaries.</P>
    <P>In the contributory scheme put up by the Irish Medical Association they stated that the conditions of service and the statutory rights of the dispensary doctor must be safeguarded.  He would continue to treat the indigent persons in his district.  The association was asked whether the public assistance classes would be provided with a choice of doctor.  They replied that they regretted they could not find a means whereby a free choice of doctor <Col N="701" /> in the case of public assistance classes could be reconciled with the statutory authority on local medical officers to guarantee full medical assistance for these classes.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the dispensary system.  My predecessor, Deputy Dr. Browne, was not satisfied with it.  He met the Irish Medical Association and put up three proposals to that body. I am sure any Deputy will agree that they were fairly simple and ought to have been accepted.  He suggested, first of all, the abolition of the red ticket; secondly, that where dispensary buildings were fairly far away from certain areas the doctor should see patients in his own house and he would, of course, be remunerated for that; thirdly that the dispensary doctors should be empowered to authorise the admission of dispensary patients to district and county hospitals.</P>
    <P>The association did not want to abolish the red ticket because, it was said, that people might pass out of the public assistance classes during the year and they would then be using the white card for the remainder of the year when they should not be using it at all.  Secondly, they would not agree to see patients in their own houses and, thirdly, they would not agree to undertake to send patients to the county or district hospitals; they said that was the function of the assistance officer and they would not do it.</P>
    <P>I am sure that many individual doctors would do these things if they were asked but it is the Irish Medical Association that speaks for them and it is with that body that these negotiations were carried on.  Is it not difficult to understand how any man could object to such reasonable proposals as those in an endeavour to improve the dispensary system and make things a bit easier for those who have to avail of that system?  But those proposals were turned down.</P>
    <P>A little over a year ago, when the Irish Medical Association came to me to consider their scheme with me, I put many questions.  I wanted to have a clear understanding of their scheme and I can assure the House I was as sympathetic as any man could be, but I did see insuperable difficulties in <Col N="702" /> working out a scheme of the kind suggested by the association.  Mention was made of a means test and I said there would be no means test as far as their scheme would be concerned. I said I was not objecting to a means test.  I was merely seeking information. The spokesman said that the present form of means test could be dispensed with and he said that under the medical card system&mdash;I found on some further discussion that this was a white card instead of a red ticket&mdash; that would work all right for their own scheme but they rejected it in connection with the dispensary system.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of propaganda about lack of consultation with the Irish Medical Association. There was any amount of consultation with that body.  Deputies may say that I was prepared to listen to but not accept advice.  I am afraid the same charge can be made against the Irish Medical Association: that body was prepared to talk to me only if I would agree to their way of looking at things. It is difficult to see how we could reach agreement in that position.</P>
    <P>Various committees were set up to deal with different matters.  The Child Health Council was set up in 1948-49 and two members of the executive committee of the Irish Medical Association were members of that council It was on the report of that council that the mother and child scheme introduced by my predecessor was largely based.  From that it can be seen that the members of the Irish Medical Association played a big hand in drawing up that scheme.  I need not remind the House of its subsequent reception.</P>

      <P>I will cover all these points in time.  On behalf of the Government I issued a White Paper the purpose of which was to give all interests an opportunity of discussing with me any matter they might wish to discuss. The Irish Medical Association was given an opportunity of submitting its detailed views and recommendations. They came along on the 8th October, 1952, and they made it clear to me at the outset that they were not <Col N="703" /> plenipotentiaries and that the council of the association was to have a meeting at the end of the month but, in the meantime, they wanted my views in regard to certain objections they advanced against the scheme.  They asked for my views in writing and I sent them on to them.  I suggested at that meeting that they might appoint some of their members to meet the officials of my Department to discuss the details of the White Paper.  They refused to do that.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that this was the third successive Government that had proposed a scheme of that kind and surely the Irish Medical Association was adopting an unreasonable attitude in refusing to discuss the details. Since then I have not met them because they said they were against the scheme and they refused to discuss it, but on the advisory council there are members of the Irish Medical Association.  I met them on 4th March and agreed to meet them again on the 11th March to discuss with them any amendments they might like to propose to the Bill.  I met them on the 11th March and there are on the Green Paper some amendments as a result of that discussion.  I want Deputies to note that because many of them have said in this debate that I did not agree to a single suggestion that was made.  I agreed to a number of the suggestions made and tabled amendments to meet those suggestions.</P>
      <P>I agreed to meet them again in the first week of May in connection with enlarging the scope of the council itself.  I said I saw no difficulty whatsoever in having regular quarterly meetings.  I said I saw no difficulty in making a rule that a certain number of the council could call a meeting, if they so desired, outside of the quarterly meetings.  I promised to have all the regulations made under this Bill, or the main Act, submitted to that council for its consideration before the regulations were published but in a case of great urgency where some minor regulation was necessary I suggested it could be submitted to them subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I promised to consider two other <Col N="704" /> matters advanced by them with regard to the secretariat and the annual report.  I do not see any great difficulty about the annual report and I only see difficulty from the point of view of detail in regard to the secretariat. The next meeting, as I have told the House, will take place early in May.  As far as I am concerned, I am quite willing to meet the doctors at any time they want to talk to me, but, naturally, that will be for the purpose of discussing the Bill and not for the purpose of telling me they do not want it.  It will not be necessary for them to tell me that.</P>
    <P>I have agreed to many of their suggestions.  I have agreed&mdash;Deputy Norton raised the point&mdash;to discuss with them in the first week of May the possibility of setting up local advisory councils attached to the various local authorities.  I would, of course, prefer a voluntary scheme if that was feasible, such as the scheme put up by the doctors, but the big objection to that is that we cannot be sure that everybody will join it.</P>
    <P>Many people will remain outside it. Then, when they get sick later, they must be looked after and some such scheme as this will be necessary as well as their scheme on that account. I do not want to go into all the other arguments in detail.  On a previous occasion I went into some detail and in a leading article in the <i>Irish Medical Journal,</i> following that, they called me a corner boy.</P>

They did not agree to the proposition put forward by this Government, by the last Government or by the Government before that.  I do not think a Government should be intimidated by anything like that, or that it should be accused of being non-co-operative. I am quite prepared to <Col N="705" /> meet them as far as I can.  Their editor accused me of departing from the principles of Pádraic Pearse.  I am very proud to be able to say that I was the last medical man to be able to look after Pádraic Pearse.  I am quite sure that if Mr. Doolin had been there he would have been able to do it much better, because he is a very competent man&mdash;but he was not there.</P>

      <P>I come now to the matter of contributions from self-employed persons.  I think Deputy McQuillan is right&mdash;that the fairest way is to get it from the rates.  As Deputy McQuillan pointed out, the large ratepayer is paying more than the smaller ratepayer. If a man has a valuation of £40 then he pays more than the man with a £10 valuation.  It is a contribution for this purpose and it is collected without any charge.</P>

      <P>Deputy A. Byrne said the artisan would have to pay on his rates. Therefore, there is a contribution coming by way of rates from all these people and I think it is the best type of contributory scheme we could get.</P>

      <P>It is regarded by some well-meaning people as a token.  It is not a token.  Anybody can see the statistics which were issued recently. In the <i>Abstract of Statistics</i> for the most recent year&mdash;I think for the year 1951&mdash;there were 242,000 married women under 44 and in that year 63,000 babies were born so that you had an average of one baby born for every four women of child bearing age.  Therefore, in the ordinary way, a woman would pay £4 before she would get benefit under this scheme.  I do not know what the doctors will get under this scheme: <Col N="706" /> Deputy Costello said that they would get £4 or £5 but I think it would be more than that.  I was aiming at a bit more than 50 per cent of the contribution. I believe we are getting that. The position can be reviewed from time to time and based on experience.  Let it be such a sum as would pay about half the cost.</P>

      <P>The question of consultative councils was raised in detail by Deputies Norton, O'Higgins and MacBride.  At my last meeting with the consultative council I told them that I was prepared to go a great deal of the way.  I made it plain that it must be an advisory or consultative council and that it could not be executive in any way.  Under our Constitution, the Minister must have the last word.  In the beginning, they were looking for an executive council but they accepted the other in the end.  A few points were left over&mdash;points which, I said, I would have to consider &mdash;and I said that I would meet them early in May.  I think only two points were left outstanding&mdash;the actual report and secretariat and also the possibility of having these local councils attached to local authorities throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacBride spoke about the maternity hospital in Limerick. A certain amount of reconstruction and building was done in the county home and hospital in Limerick which provided a very nice maternity unit.  When that was done we came to the conclusion&mdash;the local authority and, I think, the various professional experts, both architectural and medical&mdash;that it would be quite suitable and, of course, very much cheaper, to extend them and in that way to avoid the building of a regional maternity hospital in Limerick.  I can assure the Deputy that the beds will be quite satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin asked me whether I had got the approval of the Catholic Hierarchy.  First of all, I should like to correct some of Deputy MacEoin's statements or misstatements.  He gave the impression that the Hierarchy condemned the 1945 Bill.  I must say that I am not aware of that, if they did.  I do not think they did.  I do not think they ever considered the 1945 Bill in any way and, therefore, neither condemned nor approved of it.  He also gave the impression that they had condemned the 1947 Act when it was a Bill and that I knew their views while the Bill was under discussion.  That is not true either.  The Bill went through both Houses and was signed as an Act before any communication was received from the Hierarchy at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the White Paper was issued in connection with this Bill I sent a copy of it to the heads of all Churches, including all Bishops, both Catholic and Protestant.  Subsequently, I met representatives of the Catholic Hierarchy <Col N="708" /> and a representative of one other Christian Church.  At one of these meetings with the Catholic Hierarchy the Taoiseach was present; at another, the Tánaiste was present; and at some others, I was alone, that is, as far as members of the Government are concerned.  I need hardly add that I would have been very pleased to meet representatives of other Churches if they so desired.  I do not want to give the impression that I refused to meet any of them.  As a result of those meetings, I am endeavouring to meet the wishes of the Catholic Hierarchy in some of the amendments which I have already outlined. They have asked for the greatest possible freedom for the person availing of the provision of the Bill, that is, a choice of doctor, a choice of hospital, and they are naturally solicitous lest any person would be obliged to accept treatment contrary to his religious beliefs.  To cover this point, I shall propose an amendment by way of addendum to Section 4, that is, the point that no person will be obliged to accept treatment contrary to his religious teaching.</P>
    <P>They also place great importance on the provision of consultative councils, both centrally and locally.  Whatever our religious beliefs may be, whatever Party we belong to, I feel we can all subscribe to their advice on these matters.</P>

It would appear to me to be most inconsistent for the Dáil to approve the Bill on the Second Reading, which means that they agreed to the Bill in principle, to pass the £600,000 for the implementation of the Bill in the Estimate, and now to stultify themselves by saying: &ldquo;Although you have the Bill and the money, we will not let the Minister for Finance hand you over the money&rdquo; because that, in fact, is what a vote against this Resolution will now amount to.</P>

      <P>The proceedings of the House must have some coherence and meaning.  The motion now moved is: &ldquo;That provision shall be made by statute for the making by the Minister for Health of regulations relating to filling material for bedding, cushions, articles of upholstery, toys or similar articles and providing for the imposition of certain charges.&rdquo;  I have not the faintest notion of what all that is about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that if you went round the House and asked Deputies generally what the meaning of the proposal is, not a single one of them&mdash;and I do not exclude the Minister from my catalogue&mdash;would know what it meant.  All we are asking the Minister is to get up and read his brief.  We will understand the brief as well as he understands it, and, when we know what it is about, it will probably prove to be an uncontentious matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could give a little information about it.  Section 53 of the Bill provides for the control of the cleanliness of filling materials used in bedding.  Under sub-section (2), paragraph (i) the regulations under the section can provide for the imposition <Col N="713" /> of charges in respect of the grant, retention or renewal of licences or registrations.  The amount of any charges under this provision will be specified in the regulations, but no proposals as to their amounts have been formulated, but it appears that, for some technical reason, it is necessary to have this separate Financial Resolution for the purpose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a little better understanding now.  It seems that what we are now being asked to do at this late hour and in this rather quick way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no quickness about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is to give the Minister power to make regulations, which will have the authority of law, to give or withhold licences to any particular person or persons, to fix any particular fee for the licence which the Minister desires to fix and to set down for applicants for licences any conditions which the Minister may by Order or regulation make.  It seems from the limited information we have at our disposal that this is an Order which is going to affect a very big industry in this country, because there are a great number of people engaged and employed in the manufacturing and assembling of some of the commodities covered by this Resolution.  What the House is being asked is to give the Minister authority to make regulations enabling him to give whatever number of licences he may desire to give to whom he may desire to give them and at whatever fee may be fixed by him. I think the House is entitled to a little more information about it.  I see that Deputy Briscoe is anxious to give us all that information and I will give way to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a distinct recollection of reading a White Paper on this matter and it is quite simple to me.  Under the Health Bill, it is proposed to protect people in relation <Col N="714" /> to the use of materials in mattress-making which have been gathered from all directions, second hand materials, which would be a danger to health if there was not some control over the fumigation or even the use of this class of material, and, for the purpose of preventing the spread of contagious diseases through the use of second hand materials, that persons engaged in this business will have to submit to control and operate under licence in order that the health side of it will be properly preserved and protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that Deputy Briscoe has a much quicker intelligence than I have and it is quite clear that the Deputy has taken a much greater interest in this matter than I have.  Apparently he has had information that was not available to any member of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of explanation, Sir, Deputy Morrissey has said that I had information which was not made available to any other Deputy. That is untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say any such thing.  What I said was that the Deputy had made it appear that he had information about this matter that other people had not got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If what he says is correct, may I ask why if it is to preserve public health, to see that objectionable matter is not put into mattresses or other bedding, that is not provided for in the ordinary way in a section in the Bill?  Why have we to bring in this rather extraordinary <Col N="715" /> sort of Resolution to do it?  I think I would be correct in saying that provision has been made in other Bills to meet the point Deputy Briscoe has made, but perhaps there is even more in it than we have heard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe has purported to explain this motion, about which the Minister seems to be rather doubtful.  I take it the position is that this motion was introduced for the purpose of giving the Minister power to intervene in the event of bedding or anything that may be filled with feathers or other material being injurious to health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the section, not in the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious that the Minister cannot personally attend to it.  Is it that the health authority, and, by the health authority, I mean the county manager, is empowered under this to enter any house he likes, seize any article of furniture or bedding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No financial motion would be necessary for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy mind allowing me to continue?  Is the county manager empowered to enter any house, seize any mattress and ask that it be destroyed?  Is that what we are asked to vote for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I now want to make a further suggestion as to what the purpose of a Financial Resolution is.  If <Col N="716" /> I understand the procedure, the purpose of a Financial Resolution is to enable the Minister to collect into the Exchequer the proceeds of a tax or fee levied and it is apparently the intention to defray the cost of carrying out this inspection of the quality of filling material by the imposition of a licence fee which is hereafter to be determined. This Financial Resolution gives the Minister authority to draw those moneys into the Exchequer and to use them for the general purposes of the Exchequer.  That can or cannot be a proviso which has inherent dangers. It can be used very easily, if the licence fee is fixed sufficiently high, to prevent new entrants to the trade, and to create monopolistic practices.  I am not so sure that that is not the purpose of this Financial Resolution. There are a couple of old hakes floating around in this business in this country at the present time.  They are well established.  They have had protection for a long time.  It would pay them well to persuade the responsible Minister to fix a fee of 100 guineas for a licence to enter into this trade.</P>
      <P>If such a fee were fixed farewell then to competition evermore.  I am not so sure that that is not the purpose of this Financial Resolution.  I would like the Minister for Health to guarantee that in regard to licences to be issued in connection with the relevant section of the Act and the Financial Resolution we are now considering he would undertake now to make two provisos.  The first is that the fee should be a nominal fee or certainly a fee which would not exceed a certain figure leaving himself a discretion within that limit.  The second proviso is that the conditions for securing a licence would be uniform for everybody and that once those conditions were laid down anybody conforming to them would have a right to demand a licence as of right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Every rag dealer is entitled to a licence if he fumigates his stuff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want to be sure of.  I have seen several cases before where humble people earning <Col N="717" /> their livelihood legitimately were told that there was no need for apprehension. Licensing provisions were introduced and they discovered that thereafter their livelihood depended not on their own industry but on the nod of the licensee.  There were only very few people entitled to get a licence.  I remember a proviso of this nature under another Bill which may be familiar to some Fianna Fáil Deputies.  There used to be a time here when any man wanting to deal in sheepskins could do so and make a living.  Then a Fellmongers Bill and a Financial Resolution were introduced which provided that the fee collected in respect of licences issued to fellmongers would go to the Treasury.  I have no doubt that Deputy Briscoe made comforting noises and said that there were a lot of people selling sheepskins in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I have no doubt that the Deputy might very well have made comforting noises.  His Government was responsible for that Bill. What happened when that Bill had been in operation for a very few years? There were three or four people in Ireland entitled to deal in sheepskins and they were not little people.  They were very big people, and nobody now can get a licence, and the people who deal in sheepskins in this country rejoice in the title of fellmongers.</P>

      <P>The great danger is that a great many things may be covered that we do not envisage now.  Thereafter, the right to deal in these things will be subject to licence and anyone who wants to deal in them will have to pay the licence fee.  Do Deputies think it is unreasonable in these circumstances that the Minister at this stage should be asked to say to the House: &ldquo;I give two guarantees.  The fee will be nominal so that it will be within the reach of any man's purse; conditions of a uniform character will be laid down and it shall be open to anybody complying with those conditions to demand a licence as of right?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that these are matters about which it is unnecessary to get cross.  Common sense and prudence should suggest the desirability of getting the Minister to acknowledge that <Col N="720" /> principle now.  If it is not acknowledged now it will never again be in the power of this House to establish that.</P>
