      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to answer Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by me to a question he addressed to me in this House on the 4th July, 1951, and to the reply given by the Tánaiste to a subsequent question on the same subject on the 31st October, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I informed the Dáil on the 13th June, 1951, that it was probable that at a <Col N="1005" /> later stage it would be necessary to have separate Ministers for Health and Social Welfare.  Experience in the interval has shown, however, that the existing arrangement under which Dr. Ryan holds both Ministries works very well and I do not, therefore, propose to make any change.</P>
    <P>On the 4th July, 1951, I informed the Deputy that the assignments of the other Departments of State could, at that time, be regarded as fixed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if it is a fact that applicants for unemployment assistance who have been employed in Great Britain must first apply in this country for benefit on British stamps before becoming entitled to unemployment assistance here; and, further, if it is a fact that to qualify for British benefit an applicant must have ten months stamps affixed to his card for the current year which very few Irish migrants have; and, if so, whether, in view of the fact that an Irish applicant generally <Col N="1011" /> has not the requisite number of stamps to qualify for British benefit, he will state why he is required to apply for this benefit thereby holding up his application for Irish unemployment assistance and if he will take immediate steps to remedy this injustice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Unemployment Assistance Acts, a person is disqualified for receiving unemployment assistance if he is entitled to unemployment benefit.  Consequently, before payment of unemployment assistance may be authorised, the question of possible eligibility for unemployment benefit must be determined.  If it appears that an applicant for unemployment assistance though ineligible, on his recent contribution record here, for unemployment benefit under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, may be in a position to qualify for that benefit by reason of a transfer of contributions for unemployment insurance from Great Britain, his position in this respect must be established before his application for unemployment assistance can be determined.</P>
      <P>The contribution requirement mentioned in the Deputy's question is not, so far as I am aware, a condition for receipt of unemployment benefit in Great Britain.  I am aware, however, that a high percentage of the applications for transfer is successful.</P>
      <P>In any case where undue delay is likely to occur in ascertaining whether an applicant for unemployment assistance is eligible for a transfer of British contributions arrangements can be made to pay unemployment assistance pending determination of the transfer position.</P>

      <P>I have had that matter under consideration for some time and if I can find a solution I will be only too glad, but there are difficulties.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state the number of nationals abroad in each country, during the general strike in France last August, who received in response to their applications, less than £5 from our diplomatic representatives and the amounts applied for by these persons in each case; and, further, if he will obtain an indication or explanation from the official responsible as to how these small loans were considered adequate, for applicants with little money in their possession, for the purpose of getting across France, then devoid of public transport, with the extra expense of maintenance on the journey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Of 73 persons financially assisted in France, the number who received less than £5 was 48; of five similarly assisted in Spain, the number was one and of 16 in other countries, the number was three.  In the case of Spain, four of the applicants for help did not, in the event, find it necessary to avail themselves of the offer of financial assistance made to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to indicate the amount of assistance requested in individual cases.  As the Deputy will understand, the aid called for varied according to the need of the individual in his or her particular circumstances, <Col N="1014" /> and it was for the Irish officials concerned to decide how much it was necessary to advance in each case.</P>
    <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to a question from him on this subject on the 18th inst., no complaints were at any time made, either to the Department or any of our Missions in the countries concerned, that the assistance offered in any individual case was inadequate.  On the contrary, I have seen many private and public tributes to the manner in which our officials helped Irish citizens who were in need of assistance during the period of the French strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state (i) what effect the halving of the land annuities has had on the period of repayment and (ii) what effect the funding of one and two years annuity, as occurred during the economic war period, has on the period of repayment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The halving of land annuities has had no effect on the period of repayment.  The funding of arrears in 1933 has generally had the effect of varying the normal period, by increasing it slightly in older cases and reducing it somewhat in later cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain the last point, that the halving of the land annuities had the effect of reducing the period of repayment in some cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The funding annuity runs for 50 years from the date on which it was set up.  It is consolidated with the reduced purchase annuity and the consolidated annuity so formed is payable until the purchase advance and funded arrears have been amortised.  It follows that in those cases where the purchase annuity would normally expire in a shorter period than 50 years from the date on which the funding annuity was set up, which was 1933, the period of repayment would be slightly increased, but where the normal period of repayment of the purchase annuity would extend for more than 50 years from the date of commencement of the funding annuity the period of repayment may be shortened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the whole annuity is continued when the arrears are funded and when the period is less than 50 years?</P>

      <P>I want to reply to the Deputy's question.  These questions are put down for the purpose of discrediting three particular boats for which advances have been made from the Central Fund.  If I am expected to give in answer to this question the details required in respect of these boats, is it not open to any Deputy in <Col N="1029" /> the House to ask for similar details in regard to the many hundreds of boats in respect of which similar advances have been made?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>These are three trawlers operated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. They have nothing to do with boats sold on the hire purchase system to inshore fishermen.  Does the Minister now tell us that the circumstances surrounding these trawlers are of such a character that he is ashamed to inform the House as to what the facts are, and that he will give us no more information?</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to provide that the areas of Circuit Courts will be permissive and not mandatory as is provided in the section as it stands.  I would like to remind the House that I have said that it was not intended to go ahead with this reorganisation until we had a report from this committee. Since then we have had a report of the work of the Circuit Courts, for the last year.  We find in one case the court only sat 73 days; in another it only sat 91 days and in another 85 days.  We feel that even when this Bill is passed there will not be full work for all the Circuit Courts.  Although I hope the findings of this committee will not be too long delayed, I do not know that I could say at this stage whether or not I am committed to having promised not to proceed with the reorganisation.

There is no doubt that under the proposals contained in this measure there will be quite a considerable amount of further work for the Circuit Court, and I think <Col N="1033" /> it would be foolish in the extreme for the Minister to tie this to any hard and fast rule until we have had some experience of the new jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>I have a later amendment which is ruled out of order on the ground that it would increase the charge and I would be glad, therefore, if the Minister would consider the position of a justice whose area embraces part of the borough as well as the county in relation to Dublin and who, in many cases, is giving decrees dealing with matters within the county borough area although he himself is defined for all purposes as a non-metropolitan justice.  In view of the substantial increase in the county borough of Dublin and the fact that some new areas have recently been added to the county borough the Minister might consider defining a justice as a metropolitan justice when his area of jurisdiction embraces part of the county borough as well as the county itself.</P>

      <P>I support the case made by Deputy Cosgrave.  It is well known that there is practically no difference between the work carried on in Kilmainham and Howth and the work done in the Metropolitan District Courts.  It is unfortunate that this matter cannot be discussed on a direct amendment because of Standing Orders.  The reason for the separate classification, if any such reason exists, in relation to metropolitan <Col N="1034" /> justices is based on the type of business that comes under consideration in the metropolitan courts.  If the Minister pays a visit to Kilmainham and then goes on to Morgan Place he will find that exactly the same type of business is conducted in both places and pressure of work is equally high in both.  I would urge the Minister to consider dealing with this matter; perhaps that could be done more suitably when it comes before the other House.</P>

      <P>If the Minister feels inclined to give way to the suggestions made I would like to remind him that in and around Cork City there is a justice operating on lines similar to those who operate in and around the Dublin metropolitan area.  The same is true of Limerick City and Waterford City.  The type of business done is of a similar nature. If the Minister is inclined to give way to the claims on behalf of the Dublin justices who operate partly in the city and partly in the county, similar claims can be advanced in relation to Cork, Waterford and Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views expressed by Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Sweetman.  I take it that the <Col N="1035" /> Minister in deciding to differentiate between metropolitan justices and others took into account the functions exercised by justices in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  If that is so, then a very good case has been made for including justices operating on the fringe of the city who deal with work similar to that done in Morgan Place.  District justices acting on the fringe of the metropolitan district dealing with matters similar to those which arise in the metropolitan area itself should be classified as metropolitan justices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have made myself clear, but a justice described as a metropolitan justice is in enjoyment of some extra emolument.  The same applies to justices in Cork City. If, as a result of increased work, a more concentrated type of work and a greater variety of work it is felt necessary to give slightly increased emoluments to certain justices, I hold that if that argument applies to justices operating on the fringe of the metropolitan area in Dublin then it should equally apply to justices operating partly inside and partly outside the metropolitan area in Cork and Waterford and Limerick.</P>

The case is tried in Kilmainham which is in the borough area but a lot of the work dealt with there is work arising in the County Dublin area and this area also includes part of Kildare and Meath.  If there is a case for doing it in one there is a case for doing it in others.  All this question will have to be considered when rearrangement is being undertaken.</P>

      <P>It is one thing if a certain practice is well recognised with the consent of the parties but it is a very different thing if you recognise that practice without reference to the consent of the parties.  If through any oversight that change is being made, then the House should not proceed to consider this amendment as a drafting amendment.  I would ask the House to remember that when the Public Authorities (Protection) Bill was first brought before the British House of Commons the same question was then <Col N="1040" /> put to the Home Secretary and the Home Secretary's reply was: &ldquo;This Bill makes no alteration in the law.&rdquo; He was pressed and he reassured the House that this was purely a drafting amendment to the existing law.  In fact, it was a revolutionary new departure in law, the nature of which nobody noticed.  All I am trying to do is to secure that if we are going to amend the law effectively by that amendment we ought to know what we are doing and not do it with our eyes closed.  If, as Deputy Moran says, this is giving the right to a district justice to do something without reference to the wishes of the parties joined before him, whereas heretofore he only had the right to do it with the consent of the parties, the House ought to pause and hear experienced opinion before we give the district justice a new power which he never heretofore had.</P>

      <P>In the county in which I have the privilege of practising our Circuit Court sits in three towns&mdash;Donegal, Letterkenny and Ballyshannon.  I know litigants who have to travel by motor car.  They have no public service vehicle.  They have to travel by motor car a distance of 40 miles to attend the Circuit Court. In the areas in which these litigants reside we have monthly sittings of the District Court and we all know that a considerable amount of litigation is now caused in running down actions. A number of the running down actions in rural Ireland are injuries to farmers' stock&mdash;cattle, horses, sheep and other animals.  I have known animals, the property of farmers, which have been injured valued at £15 and £20, and sooner than incur the expense of a Circuit Court action they have waived the excess and sued in the District Court and accepted the maximum jurisdiction of the District Court, namely, £10, because were they to go into the Circuit Court and to succeed in the Circuit Court, having employed counsel, having travelled by motor car the distance which they would have to travel from their residence to the site of the court, they would have incurred greater expense, even though they succeeded, than they did by obtaining a decree for £10 in the District Court.  We all know the value of money is not what it was when the District Court was first established.  We all know that the value of money has decreased practically 500 per cent.  Since the establishment of the District Court way back in the early days.</P>

We are going to make litigation much cheaper for the litigant in rural Ireland.  I know that some members of my profession in the cities and towns might object to it.  Some <Col N="1045" /> of them do not practise in the District Court.  They prefer not to practise in the District Court.  Some of them consider attendance in the District Court is a nuisance, something which they can do without; but we have to take the rough with the smooth.  We have to look after the unfortunate clients. We have to see that they get the litigation to which they are justly entitled as cheaply as possible, and I am giving this amendment my full support.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  My complaint is not like other members of the House, even those in favour of it&mdash;it is that it is not going far enough.  This amendment possibly also gives me an opportunity to refer to some of the statements made in this House during my absence on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I want to make it quite clear to those who suggested that I was running away from the amendments I had tabled that nothing could be further from the truth.  I want to put it on record that it was also untrue to say that I was aware that these amendments would have been discussed in my absence.  It appears to me that there has been a certain amount of indecent haste in dealing with the Bill from all sides of the House and that the minds of a number of Deputies have been confused by the fact that this Bill purported to deal with the question of judicial salaries as well as the question of jurisdiction.  I think this House could discuss the question of increasing the jurisdiction of certain of our courts and of bettering our legal code in a much more efficient manner if the question of judicial salaries were dealt with in another measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this amendment is concerned, when he goes to the Seanad I think the Minister should make the amount mentioned in the amendment £100 instead of £50.  I think when this and the other amendments that he has introduced in connection with jurisdiction in the District Court go to the Seanad he <Col N="1046" /> should reconsider the question with a view to making the amount £100 in contract and tort in the District Court and £1,000 in the Circuit Court.  I could never understand why there should be any differentiation on the question of jurisdiction as between contract and tort.  I am sure that my colleagues will agree, that the law of contract is much more complex and difficult to most of us than the law of tort.  I cannot conceive anything more simple to deal with in the District Court than questions of tort and I could never understand why in the earlier legislation this differentiation should be made&mdash;that a jurisdiction of up to £10 was given in tort to the District Court whereas the jurisdiction in contract is £25.  I am glad that at this stage, at least, the Minister has put both contract and tort on an equal basis so far as jurisdiction is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister has announced that he is setting up a commission to deal with this matter of jurisdiction in general, but I do not believe that it will be of much use.  I do not believe that the Minister for Health, for instance, would have got anywhere if he referred the Health Bill to the members of the Irish Medical Association, and I think the Minister for Justice will get nowhere with law reform if he refers that question to a bunch of lawyers outside this House. This House is the proper body to deal with the matter.  I have been a long time, over 15 years, trying to bring about some of these reforms.  I have no hope in any outside commission to decide this question, because I know the dice will be loaded against those who hold the view that our legal system needs to be recast to suit the needs of our people.  I know the vested interests that exist in this matter and that in any outside body these interests will be catered for and that their view will prevail.  I hold that this House is the proper body to deal with the matter, and I hope to give it an opportunity by way of a private Bill, or whatever other means may be open to me, to ensure that this House will have its say in formulating a legal system for our people that will be within the <Col N="1047" /> range of our people's pockets, so that everyone in the State will be assured of justice, irrespective of the depth of his purse.</P>

      <P>I want to say that I agree with what Deputy Moran said in the later stages of his contribution. Of course, I also agree with what the Minister states: that whatever the recommendations of any outside body may be, the matter must be finally decided in this House.  One of the greatest mistakes we could make would be to leave all these matters to be considered by the profession, simply on the basis of professional interest.  I think that that would be most undesirable and certainly I would be opposed to it.  You cannot bring about reforms simply by asking people who have got into the groove of the machinery to alter it.  They cannot see how it can be altered but a person outside can see how it can be altered.  However, that is neither here nor there as far as the amendment is concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment deals with a very important matter&mdash; as to whether we should raise the jurisdiction of the District Court from £10 in tort to £50.  The general intention when it was being discussed before is that it should go from £10 to £25.  In contract there was an agreement that because of the monetary values involved, we should move on from £25, but we had in the 1924 Act the distinction, tort £10 and £25 contract.  It was agreed that in contract we should move from £25 to £50 and that we should more than double the jurisdiction in tort from £10 to £25.  I think that is reasonable.  I am a great supporter of the District Court and of the idea of giving the District Court <Col N="1049" /> substantial jurisdiction, but I do think &mdash;and I speak now as a solicitor with some experience of the District Court &mdash;that the alteration in tort from £10 to £50 is a big jump.  It is too big a jump at one stage.  Under this Bill we substantially increase the jurisdiction of the District Court.  We are taking away a good lot from the Circuit Court in regard to contract.  In quite a number of matters we are increasing the work, the jurisdiction and the importance of the District Court. I think that perhaps we would be going too far by agreeing at the present moment to increase the tort jurisdiction from £10 to £50.  Every Deputy knows that tort means an action for damages arising out of negligence of one kind or another.  It is a claim for compensation arising out of negligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perhaps excessive simplification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to give the legal definition.  I want to simplify it as far as I can.  Perhaps that is over-simplification.  But that is really what tort is as distinct from contract where an issue arises between two parties on an ordinary matter of contract, say, a bill for goods sold and delivered amounting to £50, which can be easily dealt with by the district justice because there is not very much involved in it.  But, where a motor car strikes an animal or an individual and the individual, say, places his damage at £50&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to meet such an individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does happen. If that individual places his damage at £45, £49 or £50, the whole question is whether the District Court is the right court to deal with a claim of that magnitude.  Under the old jurisdiction, that matter was determined by the Circuit Court judge and, if necessary, by a jury.  The plaintiff had the right in certain circumstances to have a jury to try that issue or the defendant had a right to have a jury to decide it. During the emergency there were certain Emergency Powers Orders which affected the right to a jury and, to a <Col N="1050" /> large extent, juries do not now exist in the Circuit Court except in regard to criminal matters.  It was considered, where you had an issue of tort from £50 up to £300, that that matter would be dealt with in the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>There is this difference between the Circuit Court and the District Court, that in the Circuit Court you have a list of cases for a particular day.  There may be one case or two or three cases listed and the registrar endeavours to fix the list in such a way that litigants know their cases will come off on that particular day.  They have their professional, technical, medical and other witnesses, generally speaking, in an issue of that kind.  The District Court, which is a summary court, deals with cases of no lights on bicycles, cattle wandering on the road, drunkenness, non-attendance at school, and 101 little summary charges.</P>
      <P>Is it right that a tort case involving a matter of £50 and professional witnesses such as engineers and doctors should be thrown into that maelstrom? I do not think it is satisfactory to the litigants.  You have also the mentality of the justice who deals with the matter in the ordinary way.  After all, the success of the District Court is based on this, that the District Court is speedy and quick in its decisions and gives them on the spot and, if you are not satisfied, you can lodge an appeal within seven days and go off to the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>It is not trenchant, it is profound.  As I say, you have the right of appeal where a case is dealt with quickly by a district justice.  Is a district justice with a crowded court the proper person to throw into this matter of a tort action involving damages to the extent of £50?  It may be that, from experience in which we have tried out the District Court, there should be an alteration from £10 to £25.  It may be that this House would come to the conclusion that it was right to give the district justice an increase in jurisdiction from £25 to £50.  But the point I am putting to the Minister is this: Let us be agreed on the £25 jurisdiction.  Let us try out the new machinery, because in this Bill there is some new machinery.  The tort and contract jurisdiction of the Circut Court has gone up to £600. There is provision for a new judge of the High Court and for a reduction in the number of justices.  I should like to see all this machinery put into operation and the increase from £10 to £25 given and if, from practical experience over a couple of years, we think it would be proper to increase the jurisdiction from £25 to £50, then there would be no trouble in doing it as far as this House is concerned.  I have noticed that because of the speed with which district justices are bound to do the work, particularly in Dublin where district justices may get hundreds of cases to deal with in a day; even 300 cases before lunch is not an unreasonable figure to mention for one of our District Courts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have a different mentality in the Circuit Court.  The judges feel that they are not being rushed.  They have not to clear off 300 cases in a forenoon or an afternoon or in a week. The fact is that they have one case opened to them and evidence for the plaintiff and the defendant given and they decide whether there should be an acquittal or a conviction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, to a large extent, and it depends on the defendant, too.  Some defendants can go before a judge and get off, while other defendants go before a judge and get a knock on the head.  A defendant, when he goes out, if he has got a knock on the head, does not care an awful lot for the judge, but if he gets <Col N="1053" /> an opportunity of saying his say he is not as bad as if he had got a knock on the head without having had the opportunity of talking and putting up his case.  For that reason, I think that the Minister ought to give the judiciary a chance of working on the new increased jurisdiction, on working on the £25 tort, until we experience how it may be.</P>
      <P>My general experience of district justices is that they want to try a case as fairly as they can, but if they are going to have hundreds of cases on their list to deal with they will begin to deal with them quickly and without giving proper consideration to the matters that are involved.  I had a case not so long ago of a person who was summoned on a very little trivial summons.  The district justice listened to it, and his decision was such that it shocked me.  He said that, unless there had been something done, the summons would not have been issued, and on that basis, he decided the issue.  Now, I am perfectly certain that when I say that happened not so long ago I am exaggerating a little. It happened yesterday.  That was the basis on which a district justice decided the case, that a summons would not have been issued&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has relation to the competence of particular justices to deal with particular matters of tort which involve questions of damages up to £50.  Of course, I know that Deputy Dillon is going to support me in this. He will be opposed to the increased jurisdiction in tort from £10 to £50. I know that he will support me in this. He knows that it is too big of a jump and that there are too many issues involved.  Where an action for damages amounting to £50 is involved, I say it should get serious consideration.  It just cannot be decided by a snap of the finger as unfortunately it would have to be if we leave it to the District Court.</P>
      <P>I may not advance the same arguments that Deputy Dillon would advance for it.  The fact that I was advancing certain arguments that were in Deputy Dillon's mind would mean to him that they were not good arguments because I had put them forward. What I am putting forward is that this is a serious matter, and that what you have to take into account is one's own experience and the principles that are involved.</P>
      <P>One should do his best to get the House to come to a correct decision on this.  In my view, we are going just a little too far.  Perhaps in a few years, when I see how the thing works, I might be agreeable to a further extension of jurisdiction.  But, for the moment, I would ask the Minister to agree with his first intention of leaving tort at £25, see how it works, and if it works successfully, and you think there should be an increase in jurisdiction, then grant it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>For slightly different <Col N="1055" /> reasons to those advanced by Deputy Cowan, I think that the Minister is unwise in bringing in this amendment. The basis of change of jurisdiction in this Bill is, by and large, doubling it. There never was any discussion in this House on the Committee Stage as to whether the differentiation that was made in the 1924 Act between a limited jurisdiction in tort and a limited jurisdiction in contract was wise or not.  I think that is one of the matters that must come into consideration when we are thinking about the problems on our whole legal system that were before the commission.</P>
      <P>By and large, it is true to say that actions for contract, that is taking the average action, take very considerably less time than an action for tort.  Take actions for contract which come before the District Court, and in respect of which the jurisdiction of the District Court was doubled, I would venture to say that, nine times out of ten, these are actions for goods sold and delivered and that were not paid for.  It is a fair argument, I think, to say that in actions for goods sold and delivered, the same quantum of goods that now cost £50 could have been bought for approximately £25 in 1924.  That, by and large, is a fair argument, and there is a definite case to be made on it.  As regards actions in tort in the District Court or elsewhere, they take time. Of course, you will have a big contract action that will take a very long time, but the point I am making is that it is actions for tort that take time.  If the jurisdiction of the District Court is increased in this way, then the District Courts are going to be absolutely and completely cluttered up, and it is not going to be possible to get the business done in them.  There is also this objection.  When you increase the jurisdiction beyond a certain point, you come to the stage at which it may be more expensive than less expensive to carry out the business.  There is always that danger, though I agree, of course, at once that that danger applies far more to the Circuit Court jurisdiction than it does to the District Court jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have never heard any real solid argument or view put forward by the <Col N="1056" /> Minister as to why the 1924 differentiation between contract and tort should now be wiped out.  That seems to me to be the kernel of the whole matter, and unless we have solid arguments put forward on that I think it would be wrong to do what is being proposed.  If I may be allowed to show the irrelevancies of the previous speaker I personally feel that it is nonsense to have courts of any sort dealing with cases at the rate of two per minute&mdash;I think that was the computation that Deputy Dillon made&mdash;or something like 300 before lunch.  It is nonsense to have any courts working in that way and the only possible way of dealing with that type of congestion is to provide that in regard to certain obvious specific offences such as parking under a &ldquo;no waiting&rdquo; sign&mdash;an offence which I occasionally commit myself as well as many other members of this House&mdash;in some fixed offences, offences like that where there can be no argument, and which can be dealt with by rule of thumb, there could be a fixed fine with the defendant having the right to take the matter into court again.  Unless you do something like that, and if you bring in this amendment in addition, it will merely mean that the work of the District Court will become hopelessly congested.</P>
    <P>There has been no case made for changing the principle that is involved between the two types of claim which has existed since 1924 and though there have been from time to time complaints about jurisdiction&mdash;to get the jurisdiction of the courts extended&mdash; there never has been any complaint that I have had that the jurisdiction of the two in the ratio of ten to 25 was a wrong ratio.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point in respect of this amendment which does give me some real concern as I think it is a matter of principle.  All the discussion heretofore has dwelt on expedition and expense.  There is the question of justice, and it is a very important question.  Because poor people, people of small property, bring their modest affairs to court, we must not, as a legislature, treat their affairs with contemptuous indifference as <Col N="1057" /> being of insignificant value because the amount at stake is small.  I do not think cheap justice, as a rule, is good justice, and when we ask ourselves in the background of rural life in Ireland: what is tort?  We must not accept Deputy Cowan's thumbnail definition of tort.</P>
      <P>Tort in rural Ireland&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;for the purposes of the District Court, excludes trespass and you are left with actions not only for negligence but for assault and a variety of other quarrels that arise between neighbours.  Now, where you get into the sphere of a substantial sum&mdash;and £50 is a substantial sum&mdash; the matters involved in such litigation are not insignificant.  They are substantial.  Does anyone in this House advert to the fact that raising the jurisdiction in tort of the District Court to £50 withdraws from the litigants the right they have hitherto enjoyed of access to a jury?  If your action in tort was in excess of £10 heretofore, you went to the Circuit Court where, at the option of the litigant, access might be had to a jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But can you get them transferred to the Circuit Court if the plaintiff does not want it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>You can initiate the proceedings in the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But suppose I am not the initiator&mdash;can I transfer them?  I may not be a rural solicitor but I am a rural shopkeeper, and I know whereof I speak.  One party is denied access to a jury.  That may or may not be a matter of grave significance but it is a matter to which the House ought to advert.  It is a very grave thing to determine here that in respect of issues in which heretofore litigants had the right to claim a jury we should now withdraw that right from them, because if the defendant finds himself with proceedings initiated in the District Court and is dissatisfied with the verdict and goes on appeal <Col N="1058" /> to the Circuit Court he has not the right to a jury on appeal.  Is not that so?  Do we advert to our intention to do that?  Some of us may think that it is a desirable thing.  I am not so sure.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Cowan's description of the tumult and confusion which characterises the proceedings of the District Court as he knows them is very remote from the truth.  True, the volume of work to be done in the municipal courts is greater than in rural courts.  It is ludicrous to suggest there is anything like the precipitateness of judgment that he refers to in the District Courts in rural Ireland, and that is what I am primarily thinking of.  I am certainly not satisfied and I have heard no argument made here or elsewhere to persuade me that it is a desirable thing to raise the jurisdiction of the District Court to £50 in matters of tort.  Who says it is?  Who makes the case?  I have not heard it made.  The only case I have heard made here to-day was that it might save travelling expenses for those who may have their business discharged in the District Court instead of having to refer to the Circuit Court.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And it may not, because either party have the right to appeal to the Circuit Court and when you get into the range of judgment of £40 with costs, which brings the costs of the whole procedure perhaps into the region of £75, how many people in rural Ireland who have at stake not only a sum of £70 or £75 but also the issue of a quarrel between neighbours &mdash;and mind you it wants to be a pretty bitter quarrel in rural Ireland before two neighbours will go into court&mdash;are they going to let the bone go with the dog on the decision of the district justice when they can have another row, with suitable amendments to their testimony, in the Circuit Court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there will be those who say that in the present system, if they go into the Circuit Court and get their verdict there, they may proceed to the High Court on circuit.  That is true. <Col N="1059" /> But remember, I am not attacking the system.  I am refuting an argument made in defence of the increase of jurisdiction in the District Court, and that argument was that it would save litigants' expenses.  I do not think it would.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that argument is invalid.  I know it is going to deny juries to people who heretofore had the right of access to a jury.  I know it is going to bring into the District Court for summary judgment not only the legal issue joined between the parties but the issue of prestige and the whole riposte that we, who know the country, understand is involved in legal proceedings between neighbours. Now, remember, we still retain in this city the evil, rotten system of appointing temporary district justices.  I do not think that a temporary district justice is a suitable person to decide an issue of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Cowan continues to make observations of that kind, I shall make a tart reply.  Deputy Cowan is a very sensitive man; he likes to make tart observations but he hates to hear tart replies, and I am now trying to exercise forbearance.  I do not believe in the system of appointing judges under the screw of blackmail: we will give you a run and, if you do what you are expected to do, you will get a job; but if you show any independence <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Executive, out you go.  That is no way to appoint judge.  Judges should be independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do not let us forget here in Dublin that an action in tort in rural Ireland means much more than £50.  Do not let us forget that in rural Ireland, if you are a defendant in an action for tort, it may be your reputation that is at stake and the money is of very secondary consideration.  Do not let us forget that if the attack upon your <Col N="1060" /> reputation is one of sufficient gravity, it might be a very great and irreparable disaster if you did not have access to a jury.  Who steals my purse steals thrash, but he who steals my reputation steals all: there may be many, many occasions in which an action in tort may mean the difference between a litigant's reputation amongst his neighbours and his everlasting disgrace.  That man wants the protection of a jury, and he recoils with horror from the thought that so grave an issue may be determined by a district justice with an appeal to a Circuit Court judge sitting without a jury.</P>
    <P>I am simply making the case now against this proposed change.  I have heard no case which holds water for it and I am asking this House not to accept this change.  What has shocked me a little to-day is that we are suddenly presented with an amendment on the Report Stage, an amendment which no one seemed to think was of very great significance.  I think this is an amendment of immense importance. I am against this amendment.  I understand the case Deputy O'Donnell has made for it, but I think, on balance, the argument is against him. I would ask the Minister for Justice to reflect.  I would ask him to tell us has he heard weighty argument for this amendment, for I suggest to him that, without weighty argument, he certainly ought not to increase the jurisdiction of the District Court by 400 per cent. in matters of tort.  I doubt the wisdom of increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court from £10 to £25 in matters of tort but, if all are agreed that it is politic, at least I would ask the Minister to think well and to produce here very potent and very cogent arguments before he asks the House to take the further step of increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court by 400 per cent. on the Report Stage of this Bill when we have before us the prospect of a full-scale inquiry into the whole question of jurisdiction and when, as a result of that inquiry, this further step can be taken if patient and informed inquiry reports to us that such a step is desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few observations on the advisability, <Col N="1061" /> or otherwise, of increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court to the extent sought in this amendment.  I presume that a number of Deputies, principally those who have no legal qualifications, will be attracted by the proposition that the increase in jurisdiction will result is cheaper litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever is for it, I take it that would be the principal ground on which this increase in jurisdiction would be recommended. I have no doubt whatsoever that this increase in jurisdiction will mean increased expenses on litigants because the first thing solicitors will do will be to increase the fees in the District Court for cases between £10 and £50 and that increased expense will be doubled in 90 per cent. of the cases because there will be appeals in 90 per cent. of the cases.  Anybody who thinks, therefore, that this amendment will endure for the benefit of the general public is making a great mistake.</P>
      <P>I have no objection against colleagues in the lower profession making more money or getting more work within their own areas.  That is a perfectly laudible, legitimate and understandable point of view.  Let us examine the matter on that basis if that is the basis on which it is put, and let us not camouflage it on the basis of public interest.  So far as I know there has been no demand of a public nature from people in the rural areas, or elsewhere, for an increase in the tort jurisdiction of the District Court. This proposed change is being made, so far as we know, without any great public demand for the change, apart from certain sections of the legal profession.  Possibly that argument will be open to the rejoinder that if there are cases which are now permitted to be brought within the jurisdiction of the District Court up to a limit of £50, some junior counsel will lose money, but I do not think junior counsel will lose that much money.</P>

      <P>It will mean that people who practise locally will be able to fill in during the recess or even during the sittings of the Circuit Court judge by doing cases in the District Court.  That will impose an extra cost on litigation.  I do not think it can be established that this will mean cheap law.  Irrespective of the value of money or the fall in the value of money, a case involving £50 is a substantial case in this country in the rural areas.  Some years ago I appeared in a case in Cork in which one of the parties to the action asked what it would cost if he took a certain step. He was told it would cost him the price of a cow.  That was the value put on litigation at that time when cattle were running about £30 per head. To-day cattle are averaging £70 to £80 a head.  Country people have a very clear understanding of what it costs to go to litigation and if they go to litigation they are prepared to pay the cost. They do not mind the cost very much because other considerations are more important, for example, considerations of local prestige and so forth.  I want the Minister to put out of consideration as having any valid effect in this argument the idea that this step will reduce the cost of litigation.  It will not reduce the cost.  It will mean that solicitors' fees and barristers' fees will be put up accordingly and there will be a double set of costs because 90 per cent. of the cases will go on appeal from the District Court to the Circuit Court.  In the country a £50 case is a serious case.  Consider libel and slander: £50 damages in a case of libel is a big decree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Then my argument on that particular point is gone. I wanted to be sure that they would not be brought in by increasing jurisdiction in tort because libel and slander are specific instances of the law of tort.  I want to put another and an even greater consideration to the Minister against this proposed jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>When the change was made by the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, providing for the High Court to go on circuit, to go down the country and hear appeals, one of the principal arguments that appealed to me personally above all the other arguments for the change of the system was the fact that it brought the judge of the High Court down to the people, that small cases could be heard by the highest judges in the land, that the members of the superior Courts, Supreme and High, would go down amongst the people.  We had a tradition in this country, stemming from our history and the kind of justice that was administered by the British courts when they were here, of disrespect for the law.  One of the problems that faced this country when we got our own Government and our own Parliament was to change that outlook on the law and to make the people understand that the law and the administration of the law thenceforth was Irish law made by an Irish Parliament and administered by Irish judges and to increase the respect for law and for the administration of the law.</P>
      <P>That is a most powerful argument for sending down the High Court and Supreme Court judges on circuit, so that people with small cases would have an opportunity of having their cases determined by the highest courts and that the people in the country would be able to see the High Court judges and the Supreme Court judges in their own areas and in their own atmosphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A £50 case is a big case and persons involved in that would like to have a decision of the High Court.  Without in <Col N="1064" /> any way aspersing the character or capacity of any of the district justices at present operating, there is no doubt that the people who are operating in the District Court are not as experienced or not as learned as the judges who occupy the Circuit Court bench. There cannot be any doubt about that. Perhaps the Minister knows the old epigram made by the late Arthur Clery that inferior courts were or should be quick, courteous and generally wrong. There is a lot in that.  It is well to have speedy justice, quick justice and courteous justice and even if the judge goes wrong occasionally, on an average he will hit the thing with a certain amount of common sense, which is what district justices ought to bring to bear upon consideration of cases before them.  If you bring these cases of higher jurisdiction mixed up with cases of common assault, mixed up with cases of indictable offences, mixed up with other cases of motor-car offences and all the rest of it, they are just going to get a short knock and there is bound to be appeal to the circuit judge and double costs, and nobody will be satisfied.  I very seldom met a litigant who, when he had the chance of having his case heard by a High Court or Supreme Court judge, was not satisfied that he got a fair run and had done all he could to assert his rights.</P>
    <P>When this system was inaugurated by the passing of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936&mdash;speaking for my colleagues in the Munster circuit, in Cork&mdash;when we met there on the first sitting of the High Court on circuit, we recognised amongst ourselves professionally that the High Court and the Supreme Court judges going on circuit were going down to the people to hear cases and that the people should have their cases heard at the cheapest possible rate, and we agreed to cut our fees to the very minimum, nearly approaching what they were under the old system.</P>
    <P>If there is any substance in the suggestion that there is any number of cases between £25 and £50 that should be brought to the District Court, you are going to prevent those people who have what are regarded in the country as substantial cases from getting access to High Court and Supreme <Col N="1065" /> Court justice.  It is a thing that they value.  I know personally from my own fairly wide experience, practising in every court in this country, that the ordinary country people want to have their cases determined by a High Court judge.  Nobody will be satisfied with the decision of a district justice. Nobody has greater appreciation of the capacity of a person administering the law, whether he be in the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court or the Supreme Court, than the people of rural Ireland.  They have a great interest in law.  They have now a great respect for the law.  But, if they have a case involving considerations between themselves and their neighbour, they will only be satisfied if they get a hearing from a person they respect and in whom they have the utmost confidence.  The circuit judges, in normal cases, do command that respect because the people know that the people who are appointed to the Circuit Court are in practically every case&mdash;not every case&mdash;people of wide experience, people who have made their living as tradesmen at their profession, people who have good knowledge of the law and, if they get a fair hearing before them, the people are satisfied and it is only in a small percentage of cases that there is appeal.</P>
    <P>That is a very important consideration which should be brought to bear on those people who may be deluded by specious arguments about cheap litigation, the poor man's court, and all the rest of it.  They should not attach any importance to them at all.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this extension of jurisdiction will mean increased costs on litigants.  If anybody thinks I am exaggerating, then I will say that it will not in any way cheapen litigation.  I have no doubt whatever about that.  I believe it will increase expenses because I believe there will be increased legal fees.  At all events, I am certain that there will be no decrease.  There will be less appreciation of the administration of justice and people will be deprived of what I consider to be a great privilege for people down the country, namely, that the judges of the Supreme Court and High <Col N="1066" /> Court should come down to them in their own areas and be there available to them at a comparatively cheap rate as they are at present.</P>

      <P>When I introduced the Bill I had proposed to increase the jurisdiction from £10 to £25 and it was largely as a result of the debate that took place on Second Reading that I considered increasing it to £50.  As far as I remember&mdash;I have not looked up the records since this debate started to-day&mdash;on all sides of the House there seemed to be general agreement that we ought to increase jurisdiction in tort as in contract.  In addition to that I have had representations made to me by solicitors' associations down the country and by one district justice who actually pressed me and he said, quite contrary to what both Deputy Dillon and Deputy Costello said, that the cases would be decided more speedily and more cheaply.</P>

      <P>I had thought that Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Moran, who are both country solicitors, made a good case for the increased jurisdiction.  When the Bill was being drawn up we went as far as possible to get agreement.  I am not trying to put in the increase here.  My original proposals were put in as a result of full consideration and I thought myself <Col N="1067" /> that the increase up to £25 was quite adequate.  That was my opinion.  I am not a legal man but I listened to Deputies on both sides of the House and, although I have not got the speeches here, my recollection certainly is that on the Second Reading stage the majority of those who spoke anyway appeared to be in favour of the increase.  I do not know what to do about this now.  I think, having listened to what was said, that the best thing perhaps would be to let the whole thing as it is in the Bill and let the whole question of this increase in jurisdiction go&mdash;let us have a recommendation.  I think this would be the best thing.  I do not want to put it to a division.  It is not by any means a Party matter.</P>

If we are doing it for our own benefit, that is all right, but let us not do it on the basis of the public benefit.  What the Minister said has corroborated me that there was no public demand from the legal profession, but from one district justice.  I repeat that in my opinion not only will there be no decrease in the cost but there will be an increase in the cost.  I have no personal interest in this matter one way or the other.</P>

I want to make it quite clear to this House that there is nothing further from my mind; and I am sure that the same is the case with Deputy O'Donnell, and that we wanted nothing other than to make for speedy and cheaper litigation.  Let us examine for the moment the argument advanced by Deputy Costello.  He says that generally speaking the District Courts&mdash;I think I heard him say that they were supposed to give speedy justice, courtesy, and that they were generally wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest to Deputy Costello that there are far more appeals from the Circuit Court to the High Court and far more appeals from the High Court to the Supreme Court than there are from the decisions of the district justices to the Circuit Court.  I am quite sure that if the figures are got for this they will prove what I am saying, so it would appear that in the superior <Col N="1069" /> courts you get slow justice and that they are generally wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps no justice, at a far greater expense than you do in the justice you get from the District Courts.  The big part of the expenses of litigation is not the costs but the question of witnesses' expenses, particularly the expenses of professional witnesses, and everybody knows who keeps an open mind on this matter that people now under the proposals of this Bill can bring an action in tort up to £50 in their own home-town or their own market town, nearest to them. They and their witnesses, including professional witnesses, are there on the spot, and therefore they will not be put to the expense, and the very great expense, of bringing a similar action in the Circuit Court.  Take the circuit I am used to practising in in Mayo&mdash;the Western Circuit, No. 4, which covers the County of Mayo. Litigants in my own county have to travel distances of 50 and 60 miles to the places where the Circuit Court sits if they are going to bring an action.  If a cow is hit by a car, for instance, as the law stands they have to bring the action in the Circuit Court because the damages are invariably over £10.  They have to travel to the town of Castlebar or Westport or Swinford and travel distances of 50 miles.  Car hire alone for their services is a very big amount.</P>

From Keel in Achill to Westport would be 40 or 50 <Col N="1070" /> miles, and the same to Castlebar. In the same way, people from Shrule, Kilmaine and places of that distance from the town of Ballyhaunis have to come to attend the centre where the circuit sits, a distance of 30 to 40 miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The District Court sits, for instance, in Achill Island, and the local islanders in the Island of Achill have to pay for costly car hire for their witnesses and take them up to the town of Castlebar for their cases, but they will not have to do that if this section goes through.  Take the position of, say, a doctor or a veterinary surgeon or an engineer, three gentlemen you often have to have in some of these tort cases, speaking generally of tort cases. I would like Deputies to know what it costs to bring these men 40 or 50 miles and have them hanging around the Circuit Court for, not perhaps one day, but certainly oftentimes for two days, if not longer.  To suggest that this cannot be fixed in the District Court any more than it can be fixed in the Circuit Court does not bear examination. There is nothing in the world to stop a District Court clerk fixing the list. If the list was in a very crowded condition, there is nothing to prevent the District Court clerk or the professional men in the particular case fixing it for a particular day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily more days at all.  In many country districts &mdash;I am speaking of the parts of the country that I know, the district justices carrying out their job in rural Ireland&mdash;in very many cases, as a matter of fact, it is the exception rather than the rule that the district justice has to sit after lunch.  It would not occur unless there is a deposition case.  But the point I am at is this: that by conferring this jurisdiction in these ordinary small tort cases you enable the people to have their cases litigated in the District Court in their home-town or in the nearest town to them, with a certain saving of all the heavy witnesses' expenses that are involved in making them go along to the centre in which the Circuit Court sits.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon makes the point about a jury&mdash;that you deprive a litigant of the right to trial by jury in cases up to £50 if this section goes through.  Of course, that is true; but I wonder how many people here, including Deputy Costello, ever heard of a jury being demanded in one of these running-down cases in which the amount involved was less than £50.</P>

      <P>At all events, is it not true that as the law stands, not alone in cases of £50 but in cases of up to £300, litigants are deprived of trial by jury when there is an appeal to the High Court against what a jury may decide in the Circuit Court?  Another point which I should like Deputies to bear in mind is: how is it that there was no differentiation between contract and tort in the jurisdiction conferred on the Circuit Court?  If there <Col N="1072" /> was any good reason for a differentiation between the jurisdiction in contract and tort in the District Court, why was the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court not pared down so that it would conform with this alleged principle that was put into operation in conferring jurisdiction on the District Court?  Do not we all know that there is no differentiation between contract and tort in the Circuit Court?  Why, therefore, should there be any differentiation between the figures laid down for contract and tort in the District Court?  From the point of view of expense, from the point of view of expediency, or from any other viewpoint, I can see no good reason in common sense or in law for a differentiation between contract and tort jurisdiction in the District Court.  If it is only a question of £50, I cannot conceive and I doubt very much if Deputy Cowan or any of the other professional Deputies on the opposite side&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if they can really be serious about this opposition. Of course, it may be that these Deputies are not as accustomed as people like myself are to actions in the District Court on the contract side, actions such as breach of warranty and actions where the Sale of Goods Act arises, which we have very often in the country.  Certainly it is my experience and the experience of many of my country colleagues that questions arising under the law of contract with which we have to deal in the District Court, are far more important and entail far longer hearings than any questions of tort which, in the main, are questions of fact.  I am satisfied that this amendment in the terms now suggested by the Minister is long overdue. I suggest that if the House examines it impartially, Deputies will not alone be agreeable to the figure mentioned but even to the introduction of higher figures.</P>

      <P>The second point which I would like to make is that one would get the impression from the speech of Deputy Costello that we were trying to increase the jurisdiction in all tort matters in the District Court to £50.  We are not.  The District Court has no jurisdiction whatever in slander or libel.  It has no jurisdiction in crim. con. or copyright. It has no jurisdiction in title actions. All we do is to give an increased jurisdiction in running-down actions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Breach of warranty is contract but it could be brought in as misrepresentation.  We people practising in the District Court know the difficulty we have been placed in by having to discriminate between contract and tort down through the years. We have brought proceedings for breach of contract but found on going into the details that it was actually a matter of tort and not a breach of contract.  I do not think there should be any discrimination at all.  Again in a running-down action, in 99 per cent. of the cases in which damages are <Col N="1074" /> involved, there are preliminary proceedings on the criminal side of the court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes it does. Again, in cases of trespass, in 99 per cent. of the cases a question of title is raised, and once that is so the jurisdiction of the District Court is ousted. In regard to assault, I suggest that there should be no difficulty in raising the jurisdiction from £10 to £50.  The district justice who is capable of giving a decree for £10 is just as capable of giving one for £50.  I do not want to labour the matter in regard to expenses, but I do know as a fact that the expenses involved very often exceed the costs and the amount of the decree.</P>
      <P>Again Deputy Costello stated that there has been no representations in regard to this increased jurisdiction.  I should like to tell the House that the Bar Association of County Donegal, of which I am a member, are 100 per cent. in favour of this increased jurisdiction, and they have instructed me to come in here and support the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am much obliged for this lecture on parliamentary procedure, but I would much prefer to get it from the Chair.  I must tell the House that I have put the question of this proposed jurisdiction between four meetings of constituents of mine.  I have explained the advantages and disadvantages of increased jurisdiction for the District Court and requested their views on it, and again I have got 100 per cent. consent to my supporting this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>One hundred per cent.  Once it is explained to the people that I can sue or be sued on their behalf in the District Court, that instead of going 30 miles to the Circuit Court in Letterkenny and bringing professional and other witnesses, they can <Col N="1076" /> have their cases heard in the local District Court they say: &ldquo;That is what we want.&rdquo;  That is my sole reason for supporting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Donnell finished on this note about bringing professional men down to a District Court rather than to the Circuit Court.  In actual fact, there would be more expense in going to the District Court in a particular area than to the Circuit Court.  We have had 29 years' experience of the Courts of Justice Act.  It has worked reasonably well in those 29 years.  There is a proposal in the Bill to make an alteration in the tort jurisdiction from £10 to £25.  I consider that that is far enough to go at the present stage.  If the public generally are satisfied with the success of the District Courts in dealing with tort matters up to £25 and that justifies the Dáil in increasing the jurisdiction to £50, well and good, we should do it.</P>
      <P>I am not worried very much about this idea of expense.  We have changed a good deal in the country. The fact that a man has to go ten, 15 or 20 miles to have his case tried does not matter very much.  It is an important day in his life.  In the ordinary way, he would much prefer to have a case of importance dealt with by a judge that he reads about rather than a particular person that he knows.  Our habits have changed. People think nothing of going 50 or 60 miles to a dog race or a football match.  My personal experience is that when they have a court case in which they are very interested all their relations and friends are interested in it and they all go there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>They all hope to win.  But they want to have their case heard, not by a court that is overburdened with matters of children not attending school, bicycle cases, cattle wandering cases, or anything else, but by a court specially fixed to hear their case for the day.  That is my experience.  It may not be the experience of people from the country.  I know the importance which litigants attach to <Col N="1077" /> their cases and they are entitled to have their cases dealt with by a judge who will be actuated, not by the size of his list, but by the principles and elements of justice.</P>
      <P>That is why I say to the Minister, where every section and every improvement in the Bill is agreed, and where the House has agreed to go from £10 to £25, that that is the ultimate measure of agreement as to tort cases and we should stop there.  In other words, let the Minister get the Bill through the House as an agreed measure.  It is possible, when we have some years' experience, that I would support Deputy Moran and Deputy O'Donnell in going further, but I think it would be too much of a jump after 29 years' experience of a system that is functioning reasonably well.</P>
      <P>When speaking earlier, I mentioned certain figures about the work that is done in the Dublin District Court and the figures were doubted.  I said that before the debate ended I would try to verify them.  I have phoned the chief clerk of the Dublin District Court and he told me that one court in Dublin on Monday last, between 10.30 a.m. and 1 p.m., dealt with 261 cases; on Tuesday with 270, and on Wednesday with 159; and that that particular justice dealt with 40,000 cases in a year, or an average of 800 in a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in the morning from 10.30.  He is punctually on the bench at that time and he is finished well before 1 o'clock; I doubt if he is there at 12.30.  I mention that to show the House that, in mentioning the figures, I was talking from my own personal experience, and I have verified them for three days of this week in regard to that court.  I have not the same experience of the District Courts in the country, although I do travel around some areas adjacent to Dublin.  Anywhere I go I know there is a considerable amount of work to be done, and, if a tort case involving £50 is to be properly heard, it may take one day, two days or three days, if the witnesses are to be properly examined <Col N="1078" /> and cross-examined.  There is no machinery, and there could not be any machinery in the District Court for having that dealt with by a district justice.</P>
      <P>The hours and places of sitting of the District Courts are fixed by the Department.  The district justices are in one place to-day and in some other place the next day.  The Department do their best to give them enough sittings in the month.  It is proposed now to cut down the number of district justices and to rearrange the District Court areas so that each justice will be able to work five days a week.  With the ordinary work he has to do, where will he get the time to deal with an important tort action that might last two or three days?  I would strongly advise Deputies who are in favour of the £50 jurisdiction to be satisfied with £25, and I would ask the Minister to put the Bill through as he has brought it so far with the agreement of the House.  We have reached agreement to increase the jurisdiction from £10 to £25.  To go further is asking the House to disagree on something.  We are all agreed to go from £10 to £25. That is the measure of agreement and we should stop there.</P>

I think it could be settled that way.  Personally, I would prefer that it would go to the commission.</P>

      <P>Before this particular amendment is put, might I mention a matter to the Minister which has arisen quite recently in the hope that he will be able to deal with it in the Seanad?  There has been a practice in the District Court for a considerable period that district justices may extend the time for an appeal.  I understand that under a decision given by some higher court recently it has been decided that a district justice has no jurisdiction to extend the time for appeal.  This is a very simple matter and I think it could be very easily dealt with by the Seanad.  District justices have exercised that power for some time and it has proved very convenient and satisfactory.</P>

I think the best way to deal with the situation would be to adopt the procedure that exists in relation to verdicts in the High Court which come before the Supreme Court.  The verdict of the jury in that case stands unless there is a misdirection or unless it is contrary to all sense, so to speak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill, as set out in the explanatory memorandum circulated to Deputies, is to confirm 11 Orders made by the Government under the Emergency (Imposition of Duties) Act, 1942. These Orders cover iron and steel mesh netting, iron and steel wire, bars and sections, single cotton yarns, handbags, <Col N="1084" /> purses, pouches, etc., spectacle frames, sheet and plate glass, asbestos cement goods, tableware, electric wire and cable, glass-packed sterile liquids and toilet paper.  Five of the duties are new duties.  Three Orders effected an extension of the scope of existing duties, and three provided for alteration in the rates of duty prescribed under existing Orders.</P>
      <P>The first two Orders mentioned, Orders Nos. 307 and 308, may be taken together.  These Orders impose a duty of 37½ per cent. full and 25 per cent. preferential <i>ad valorem</i> on certain iron and steel wire, wire netting and barbed wire.  It made a number of minor amendments in the definitions in the duty upon bars, rods and sections, such as are made by Irish Steel Limited, Haulbowline.  The principal changes are, of course, the imposition of new duties upon wire netting and barbed wire.  These are now being manufactured in a new factory which was established and commenced operations this year in County Dublin.  We estimate that the internal market for these goods is valued at about £400,000, and it is, of course, the aim of the producers here to supply the whole of that market.  At present they are employing about 140 people, but that employment will, it is expected, increase to around 200 at an early date. The prices at which these goods are being sold here are competitive with prices in Great Britain.  It must be recognised, however, that in respect of these goods, continental prices are lower than British prices.  In so far as I have expressed the view that it is a fair test of the efficiency of any Irish industry that it should produce goods at the same price as those goods are sold in Great Britain, this factory answers the test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A price understanding has been entered into which calls for a review of prices whenever the price of the raw material&mdash;that is wire rod&mdash;changes. At the present time the steel market is very confused and there is even evidence to suggest that on occasions the manufactured steel products, such as bright steel wire, can be purchased at a lower price than the price of the steel rod from which the wire is made. <Col N="1085" /> We have the position of this concern under consideration in so far as the application of our price understanding is involved.  For the bulk of the products concerned &mdash; galvanised wire, barbed wire and wire netting&mdash;the evidence available to me is that their prices are lower than the British prices.  Of course their prices depend entirely, or almost entirely, upon the price of wire rod and they will, therefore, fluctuate with that price.</P>
    <P>Order No. 309 relates to single cotton yarns.  These yarns were subject to quota on importation here.  Previously this single cotton yarn had been included in the liberalised list supplied to O.E.E.C. and when the matter came for consideration by the Council of O.E.E.C. they decided we were justified in suspending the liberalisation in respect of single cotton yarns up to July of this year.  Under our O.E.E.C. obligation, it became necessary to revoke the quota Order in July and to substitute for it a customs duty.  The duty in force is 50 per cent. full and 33? per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  There are four firms now engaged in the production of single cotton yarn and they are employing, we understand, upon that operation, approximately 560 people. Our estimate of the requirements of the home market is about 6,000,000 lb. weight.  The production of the existing firms for the six months period to the end of September was about 2,000,000 lb. weight.  There capacity is about 4,750,000 lb. weight.  There is, therefore, room for further extension in that industry and I understand that some of the existing firms are proposing to enlarge their capacity.</P>
    <P>At present the prices of their yarns per lb. are slightly higher than British prices.  I expect that situation will be rectified when full production has been attained.  There is no reason that I know of why cotton yarn produced in an efficient spinning plant here should be any dearer than cotton yarn produced in England.</P>
    <P>Order No. 310 was made to amend the existing duty upon leather handbags by extending the scope of the duty to cover those articles when made from artificial plastic materials and <Col N="1086" /> also to bring within its scope certain trunks, suitcases, travel bags and similar articles.</P>
    <P>The old duty was a flat rate of 40 per cent. but under the trade agreement with Britain, when any change is made in an existing duty a preferential rate has to be established and, therefore, the duty will in future operate at the rate of 60 per cent. full and 40 per cent. preferential.</P>
    <P>Some 520 persons are, I understand, at present employed in the manufacture of all types of leather and imitation leather goods and the information available to me establishes that the prices at which these handbags are sold here are fully competitive with prices in England and apparently there is no need for anxiety on that score.</P>
    <P>Order 311 relates to spectacle frames. Spectacle frames and parts of spectacle frames were liable to import duty previously if made of any material other than metal.  The effect of the amendment is to bring metal frames within the scope of the duty.  This is not a very big industry.  There are three firms engaged in it.  They employ on this work about 33 people.  So far as prices are concerned there is an almost endless range of spectacle frames and it would be impracticable to make absolute comparison in detail between Irish prices and the prices of imported frames but, so far as we have been able to ascertain, prices here are as low as and in some cases lower than prices prevailing in Great Britain.  It may be asked, therefore, why an import duty is required.  I think the answer is that there is a certain amount of prejudice in favour of well-established British products and, as the frame is such a small part in the ultimate cost of a pair of spectacles, that an advantage in price does not secure business for the Irish firms.</P>
    <P>The next Order, 312, which relates to sheet and plate glass, raises some issues of a different kind.  May I say that the Order applies to plate glass only, because the Revenue Commissioners cannot undertake to distinguish between sheet glass and plate glass in the administration of the duty but, in fact, all requirements of <Col N="1087" /> plate glass are allowed in duty free? The existing duty, which was not an <i>ad valorem</i> duty, but a fixed amount per cwt. on sheet glass, was fixed following a review of the position under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Agreement made in 1938 by the Prices Commission of that day which was then established as the reviewing body recognised under that agreement.  The duty was fixed on the recommendation of that commission following the review.  Duty at the rate of £1 full and 13/4 preferential per cwt. was established.  With the alteration in values, subsequent to the war, these fixed rates of duties became less protective in their effect and, although the trade agreement made with Britain in 1938 did not, on its face, provide for a review following a review of a duty, nevertheless, the British authorities, when the matter was taken up with them, agreed that there should be another review of this duty.  That review was carried out by the Industrial Development Authority, which is now the reviewing authority under the agreement, and the higher rates of duty which are now operative, 33/- full and 22/- preferential per cwt., are those which were recommended by the Industrial Development Authority following that review during which representations of the British manufacturers were received.</P>
    <P>It was, however, recognised by the Industrial Development Authority that the effect of the higher rate of duty will be a higher price here and that the need for a higher rate of duty was the fact that under the situation existing previously the manufacture of sheet glass here was involving the manufacturers in a loss and that only if a higher price could be secured&mdash;and that could not be made effective unless the duty was increased&mdash;could they continue in operation.  The manufacturers here, in fact, have been getting only about two-thirds of the home market notwithstanding the duty in force and it is hoped that if, as a result of the increase in duty they get the full home market, a reduction in their costs and, consequently, in their prices may be achieved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> The review in this case raised some interesting points.  The trade agreement made with Britain in 1938 and still in force provides, in Article 8, that, on review, duties should be fixed at a level which provides British manufacturers with full opportunity of reasonable competition.  In their report to me the Industrial Development Authority pointed out, however, that in Britain, so far as this industry is concerned, &ldquo;reasonable competition&rdquo; had meant the elimination of all competition, that there was only one producer who survived competition in Great Britain and who now has, apparently, a monopoly position in that country.  They argued that in so far as competition might be assumed to be likely to have the same effect here that they could not accept as reasonable a type of competition which had produced that result in Great Britain, and particularly having regard to another provision of the trade agreement which requires that the Irish producer must be afforded adequate protection having regard to the relative costs of efficient and economical production and taking into account the requirements of a newly established industry.  The review of the position carried out by the Industrial Development Authority established that having regard to all the circumstances production here was as efficient as it could be and as economical as it was possible for the firm concerned to make it.  That firm has, however, certain higher costs which producers in Britain do not have to bear.  These higher costs arise primarily under the head of raw materials, but also under the headings of wages, power, light, fuel and water. The relatively small size of the plant here as compared with the corresponding plant in Great Britain was also taken into account, although it was not suggested even by representatives of the British firm that the plant here was any smaller than plants normally operated in other countries or less economical because of its size than similar plants elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority said that if there was a price of sheet glass brought about by <Col N="1089" /> the free interplay of the forces of supply and demand, then they would regard that price as being an economic price, but in the circumstances prevailing in Britain they could not take the British price as being representative, and they reported that they had ascertained that in other countries where conditions were more similar to those existing here the price was higher than in Britain.  The effect, therefore, of the higher duty was to permit manufacturers here to raise their price from 100/- to 120/- per case.  That is a situation which it was recognised would result from the alteration of the duty.  It represents an addition of £1 to the cost of construction of the average house.  On the other hand, the report made it quite clear that unless that higher price could be secured the manufacture of sheet glass in this country could not be carried on, and as that manufacture is linked in with other glass industries here it is important to preserve it apart altogether from the employment aspect.</P>
    <P>Order No. 313 altered the rate of duty applying to articles made of asbestos and used for building purposes.  The effect of the Order was to substitute an <i>ad valorem</i> for a flat rate of duty.  These goods are made, as the House is probably aware, in a factory in Athy, County Kildare, where there are 340 people at present employed.  There was every evidence that before the duty, which had been suspended, came back into operation the prices of their products were fully competitive with continental prices; and there has been no change in their prices since, and information available to us is that they are still able to produce and sell here at prices as low as those prevailing anywhere else in Europe.</P>
    <P>Order No. 314 may require some more elaborate explanation.  That is the Order which increases the customs duty upon delf and china tableware. That Order received some publicity in the Press after it was made, and it may be no harm to explain a little more fully why it was considered to be necessary.  The effective duties upon imported delf tableware in the past <Col N="1090" /> were the fixed duties of 6d. full, 4d. preferential per article so far as tableware was concerned, and 1/3 full and 10d. preferential so far as teapots and coffee pots were concerned.  These fixed duties were brought into operation before the war and, again, with the alteration in the value of money their protective effect had declined considerably since the war as the general level of prices of tableware has increased by something over 200 per cent. during that period.  Apart from the desire to maintain protection at much the same rate as it operated previously there was evidence that despite the fact that all our information was that delf tableware produced here was competitive in price and at least as good in quality as British tableware exported to this country, nevertheless there was a continuing import of tableware of fairly substantial dimensions, mainly tableware for hotels.  The hotel trade had not been captured by the Irish producers, and it was hoped that by an alteration of the rate of duty that situation would be changed.  Some disemployment had emerged in the industry which was not rectified until the increased duty came into operation.</P>
    <P>Apart from the position in relation to the manufacturers of delf tableware, a new concern for the manufacture of chinaware has been established in Galway.  That concern is now only going into production.  The factory, I understand, is building, and in the meantime operatives are being trained upon imported unglazed and undecorated ware.  It will not be until next year that the full process of manufacture will be carried on there, but having regard to the imperishable nature of the commodities involved it was thought desirable to bring the duty into operation as soon as it became known that such a factory was going to be established because otherwise the market could easily be saturated with imports, which would prejudice the prospects of success of the new undertaking for a long time.</P>
    <P>The Hardware and Allied Trades Association, the organisation representing retail traders handling these <Col N="1091" /> goods, came to my Department to make representations regarding this duty and after full consideration of their representations I decided to grant a certain easement.  Deputy Cosgrave asked me a question regarding this matter some time ago and I told him that it was under consideration.  As a result of that consideration it has been decided to allow duty-free imports for a period up to the end of March next, and subject to review then, on the basis of one complete set for each complete set ordered from Irish manufacturers.  In the case of delf tableware that import licence will operate in respect of sets between 39/4 and 71/5 per set.  In other words, it is the higher grade of delf tableware that may be imported, and licences for other articles caught by the duty will be issued on the same basis, a one-for-one basis, but again confined to articles within the higher grades of quality.  The main manufacturers of delf tableware here have up to the present concentrated upon the cheaper qualities, which represent the bulk of their output, and it is only in the last few months or so that they have extended their operations into the higher qualities of delf tableware.  So far as the Galway factory is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister a question regarding the Galway factory?  With regard to items produced there, whether they are of high quality or not, will the cost of producing the articles in Galway be greater than it would be to import the commodity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not anticipated that it will.  So far as I know the expectations of those responsible for the management of the factory, they hope to be able to produce this chinaware at a price completely competitive with English prices.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That question could be asked in relation to a number of commodities.  The main consideration that <Col N="1092" /> will operate in the minds of traders will be the desire for variety and, of course, when we protect goods of that character here, we do limit the variety available to traders.  The aim must be to ensure that Irish manufacturers will produce in sufficient variety to make competitive trade possible, but the advantage of having an exclusive design, which no other trader can get and which can be obtained if imports are possible, is considerable.  It is in recognition of that desire that this arrangement I mentioned was made. In the case of china, the same arrangement applies as in the case of delfware.  A duty-free import licence will be given for one set of chinaware for every set ordered from the Galway concern.  In that case the condition is that the imported set must exceed 73/4 in value.  In the case of china of a value of more than 120/- per set, a duty-free licence will be given for all sets in that category.  I think these arrangements meet the case made by the Hardware and Allied Traders' Association.  In any event, the operation of this arrnagement can be reviewed in March next in the light of the effect on the trade here.</P>

The Arklow concern is dealing with delf only.

It was only this year that they started to produce a higher type of delf pottery but the cheaper kinds still represent the bulk of their output. So far as the new china factory in Galway is concerned, it is not built yet.  Operations are being carried on in temporary premises and mainly for the purpose of training staffs.

      <P>Order No. 315 deals with electric wire and cable.  The principal effect of the Order was to extend the duty which previously applied to rubber-covered cable, to plastic-covered cable.  We took advantage of it to correct a system of evasion which had grown up under which lengths of flex with a plug attached escaped duty.  We have now applied the duty to lengths of flex with plug attached in order to stop that.  The main purpose of the Order is to bring within the scope of the duty plastic-covered cable which is now being produced by a couple of firms here and which is likely to replace rubber-covered cable to a greater extent in future.</P>
      <P>The next Order, No. 316, represents another interesting development.  It applies a duty of 50 per cent. full or 33? per cent. preferential, or minimum rates of 15/- full or 10/- preferential per 100, to containers of sterile liquids used for injection purposes.</P>

      <P>They are injection solutions, excluding a number of named solutions but covering a number of these injection solutions which are being produced by a firm in Roscrea.  That firm is producing injection solutions of as high a standard quality as any of the imported makes and at prices which are in many cases lower than British prices.  It is, in fact, exporting them also but it has not been able to establish itself firmly enough on the home market.  I am afraid that the explanation of that is that a very large number of our wholesale chemists have connections with British manufacturers.  In consequence, it was necessary to impose the duty even though the quality of the injection solutions produced here is very high and the prices are frequently lower than the British prices, in order that the firm may establish itself on the home market and develop an export trade which is its main objective.  It is a very competent firm and got a very laudatory report from certain American technicians who came over here on an industrial survey.  I think it is very desirable to encourage them to develop this important business in which they are engaged.</P>
      <P>The final Order, No. 317, had the effect of extending the customs duty on toilet paper made up in rolls to toilet paper made up in packets.</P>

      <P>In so far as this Bill is necessary to give protection to firms manufacturing here, I think it will have general assent.  We have always supported the principle of giving protection where necessary. However, there are a few matters I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  Last year, the Minister, when he was replying on the Second Stage of the Imposition of Duties Bill, as reported in the Dáil Debates, Volume 134, column 1718, referred to the fact that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Department of Industry and Commerce is at present engaged in a systematic review of all industries and on the basis of these reviews decisions are being taken as to the action which the industries concerned should be required to take <Col N="1096" /> in order to secure better results than they appear to be getting at the present time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would be glad to know from the Minister what results have accrued from that review, what particular industries were subjected to examination, whether the results will be published, and what conclusions have been arrived at as a result of the investigations carried out.</P>
    <P>It is not possible on a measure of this sort to discuss general matters. Usually when a Bill of this sort comes before the House specific cases are under review.  But the reply which the Minister gave on that occasion referred to a general review and, as just 12 months have elapsed since that statement was made, I think that, in the public interest, the House would welcome any information which the Minister may have in his possession or any facts which have come to light.</P>
    <P>The only specific Order to which I want to direct attention is that dealing with tableware, No. 314.  The Minister referred to the fact that he had received representations from the hardware trade on this matter and that he had made certain modifications in the Order.  As I understand it, the position is, to some extent, as the Minister described it and, to some extent, as Deputy Hickey described it.  I have seen articles manufactured here which were of the highest quality and I have seen other articles manufactured here which did not measure up to that description.</P>
    <P>One of the complaints of traders is it is not possible to get the variety which is available for manufacturers elsewhere.  While we may have sympathy with them in that regard, the fact that the market here is much smaller than that which is available to manufacturers in Great Britain must inevitably place a bigger onus on our manufacturers and must operate against having articles available in sufficient variety or sufficiently varied quantities.</P>
    <P>The other complaint which traders make, and which I think has more substance, is that they cannot, in some cases, get replacements.  If people buy <Col N="1097" /> tea-sets and an article gets broken, they do not want to have to buy a new set, they want to get a replacement. In some cases that is possible, but in other cases it is not.  I think that where protection is afforded there is an obligation on home manufacturers to provide replacements.  A person should not be obliged to buy a whole new tea-set if he wants to replace a broken cup or jug.  Or, on the other hand, be forced to go without the particular article which has been broken.</P>
    <P>As to some of the articles manufactured here, it may be that the articles I was shown were particularly bad cases, but some of them were a long way below what one would regard as an acceptable standard.  On the other hand, the traders concerned made it quite clear that other articles being produced here were first-class and could compete with, and, in some cases, were superior to articles manufactured elsewhere.  The principal complaint, however, from the traders was the lack of variety and the difficulty of getting replacements of the same pattern where articles were broken.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know from what the Minister said that the proposed arrangement will allow of certain imports up to March next.  I gather from the trade concerned that, although the concession is an improvement, there is still a difficulty with regard to selectivity in the case of some high-class articles.  I know that for articles costing £5 or £6 they can get a licence to import them, but I suggest that the Minister should take up with the manufacturers the question of making available as far as possible a wide variety of patterns as well as having replacements available when required.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the Galway company is not yet in production and that it is only doing decorative work.  Some of the articles shown to me certainly had very little decoration on them.  Whether it is justifiable in the circumstances to place, as this Order virtually does, an embargo on the import of certain commodities is probably open to question. If, on the other hand, the firm is expected to get into production in the <Col N="1098" /> near future, with the experience we have had of excessive imports in anticipation of a duty on many occasions, there is probably justification for forestalling them by giving protection in this case.  In the past there were many examples of excessive imports in anticipation of subsequent protection.  On the other hand, there were cases where duties were imposed and, because of delay in production from home sources, the people were obliged to go without supplies.</P>
    <P>I understand that the hardware trade feel that, because of this duty, there will not be available to them the variety of patterns which they feel are necessary, particularly in order to deal with the Christmas trade.  Many people give presents of tea or coffeesets, either of china or delf, at this particular time of the year, and traders are expected to have varieties in stock.  I understand from some representations that have been made, that they are apprehensive that the varieties expected will not be available.  Although the modifications outlined in a recent letter from the Department meets to some extent their requirements, they still feel that in certain respects the varieties required will not be available.  That may mean a reduction in stocks and, possibly, in some cases, a reduction of the number of hands required.</P>
    <P>I noted that the Minister remarked that the hotel trade had not been captured by the Irish producers.  I am interested in that because I remember noticing on one occasion that even the Fáilte hotels had imported china, so that, apparently, the ordinary hoteliers were not the only persons involved in that practice.  I believe that, if the manufacturers advertised the highquality articles that are being produced, they would be bound to capture the market here if the quality was satisfactory.  If, however, articles are produced, such as some of those that were shown to me, then I would say that they cannot expect to get the demand for them here which they would get if the articles measured up to the proper standard.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the <Col N="1099" /> Minister that officers of his Department should consult again with the traders concerned and, if possible, reach agreement on the modifications necessary in order to make this Order acceptable both to the traders and manufacturers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat difficult to comment intelligently on a number of Orders like these presented to the House as the outcome of very detailed technical and expert examination.  At the same time, it is essential that the House should keep final control on the making of such Orders.  For the reason I have mentioned, when members rise to speak on the Minister's submissions in connection with these Orders, it may well appear that they are either speaking somewhat foolishly through ignorance or, possibly worse still, making statements which may quite well appear to be harmful to an industry that they are interested in developing. Allowance has to be made for that difficulty, so far as the House is concerned, when it tries to deal with these Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to examine in detail the case made by the Minister in respect of this general body of Orders. There are one or two points, however, which I should like to make.  In a number of cases where duties are being imposed, it has been indicated that it will not be possible for the home units fully to meet the market demands. Consequently, that will require that some imports will have to be allowed in.  Whether these imports should be allowed in, free of duty or not, cannot be dealt with now.  I am concerned with the mechanics of the matter.  If we take the case of galvanised and barbed wire, I understand there is only one producing unit in the country.  If, for example, there is some delay in meeting the full home demand, and it is decided to allow in duty free imports, will that single producing unit be the channel through which these imports will be made available?  If there is a duty free licence made available, what happens in regard to a reconciliation in the price of the imported article, if it happens to be <Col N="1100" /> lower than the price of the home produced article, on the Irish market, including the duty?</P>
    <P>I think it is important to have regard to the trade channels through which such imports will be placed and to the trade channels through which the distribution of this newly-produced Irish product will take place.  There have been cases, particularly in regard to the delf trade, where established traders, particularly wholesalers, have found that it is no longer possible for them to secure their particular supplies of imported articles.  When they applied to the Irish manufacturers, the case was made that they were not on the list of agents.  Difficulties arose for them in that way.  It also raises the question of price structure.</P>
    <P>Clearly, if we are going to establish the manufacture of a new product here, which has got certain clearly established trade channels for distribution, there should be some regard for those who have an established interest in that distribution whose supplies are now being substituted by the Irish manufactured article as against the imported article.  That has not always been so.  There have been cases of that kind, and I am drawing the attention of the Minister's Department to it, in the case of delf and in regard to the boot and shoe trade.  If we are going to impose duties for the benefit of our economy and, directly, of course, for the benefit of the workers engaged in the new unit, as well as for those who invest money in it, we should have some regard for the people whose normal method of trade and of earning a livelihood is being disturbed by the change over. We should not permit too discriminatory a policy to be exercised by manufacturers to whom we are giving this privileged position in regard to the duty, or allow them to exercise a certain policy in regard to the particular wholesalers through whom they will distribute their products.</P>
    <P>In regard to the duty on sheet glass, the Minister indicated that it was being produced by a manufacturing unit directly concerned in the manufacture of other glass products.  A bell was struck in my mind when the <Col N="1101" /> Minister referred to the question of exports.  We had a question raised in the House in regard to the difference in price of an Irish manufactured article on the English market and on the home market.  There can be a good plausible case made for that.  It seems to me to be a case that has got to be subjected to minute and very careful examination because it is wide open to abuse if we are going to provide protection for an Irish industry, and it is possible, by inflating costs, to secure a higher price on the Irish market and sell on the foreign market at less than the home produced price.  We could get a situation in which not merely were the Irish consumers being provided with an article at an economic price, taking into account the volume of production as represented by the export trade, but where the Irish consumer was being exploited in that the prices charged could only be justified on the over-all costings, while in actual fact no such justification could exist at all. Quite clearly, while we are all for the policy of protection and the development of Irish industry, and desire to see it develop not merely to the point where it can meet the demand of the home market but also of the export market, we have to be very careful to see that we are able to justify to our own people that they are getting the benefit of the development of industry under protection into foreign markets. That is not a very easy thing to explain.  So far as the Minister has dealt with the matter, I feel that he has not carried conviction, and that a good deal more effort will have to be made where we are dealing with a case in which if there is not an actual monopoly there is a very effective single producing unit in a particular trade with the whole of the Irish market available to it.</P>
    <P>In the case of delf, the Minister mentioned arrangements to allow the duty free imports of certain foreign made sets within certain price ranges for every set purchased from an Irish manufacturer.  If a particular merchant has, say, for argument's sake bought 50 Irish-made sets, and on that basis he is entitled to take advantage of this concession to go in for a like number <Col N="1102" /> of foreign-made sets within the price-range set down, what is going to be the price of the imported article?  It is quite possible that apart from those 50 sets imported on the basis of the concession, he may because of the demand among his customers find it necessary also to import foreign-made sets and pay duty on them.  Are we to have two prices for the same article in the one shop?  Or is he going to have to put on two prices, one for the sets imported on the basis of the concession and another for the articles imported with duty paid?  I speak with some knowledge of that because immediately after the imposition of the present duty many people who have various tea and coffee sets went out looking for the replacement parts that Deputy Cosgrave spoke about and these had all disappeared within a matter of hours and customers were politely told that if they came back around December they could get their requirements to make up for breakages in their sets, but it would cost a minimum of 2/6 extra per cup and saucer.  That was getting pretty quickly off the mark.</P>
    <P>It is that which causes so much difficulty in securing and maintaining full public confidence in the general policy of protection but more particularly in its application to individual industries or individual articles, because, while the Irish people as a whole are quite satisfied and quite prepared to give their support to Irish industries and continue that support in ways which we stated in this House would be for the development of Irish industry, they do feel sore when they come across cases of sharp practice by individual traders.  It is the old case of the black sheep giving everybody else a bad name.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to the sterile glass containers.  The Minister mentioned the difficulty of inducing Irish pharmaceutical distributors to take supplies of Irish-manufactured containers and there was a fear that there was a certain preference for English manufacturers or English wholesale houses.  That may be a sentimental interest but it also may <Col N="1103" /> be of another kind.  It is well known in the pharmaceutical trade that there is a reluctance to handle certain products if the gross profit is below a certain figure.  That is a well-established fact.  In this case, it may be that it is not a question of sentiment at all but a very cold and practical business reason that the suppliers of these articles from English sources carry the kind of gross profit that is sought for by, and which is attractive to, wholesale and retail suppliers in the pharmaceutical trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied that the manufacturers are taking full advantage and giving full benefit and passing it on to the customers in ordinary plain wholesale delf?  I am referring to the type of working-class people who do not buy sets but who buy a half-dozen cups and saucers at a time. Is it right that they should have to pay 1/- for a cup, 1/- for a saucer, and 1/- for a plate?  Working-class people and the unemployed generally have large families and breakages are frequent, and is it right that they should have to pay 3/- for a cup and saucer with the small plate thrown in, where their means do not permit them to give such prices for the odd cups and saucers?</P>
      <P>I mention this point because I was at a sale of work with a number of my colleagues.  For a sale of work people give presents of odd articles to some charitable institution to get them sold.  I saw a woman pay 1/-each for two ordinary white plates which in the old days might be bought for 3d. or 4d. and considered dear. These people are saying that there is not sufficient demand to bring these cups and saucers within a price range in which they can buy and in some cases they are doing without cups and saucers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be up to the Minister to ensure when he is giving these concessions and protections to Irish manufacturers that they would be able to keep up the output so that if people run short&mdash;such as an institution which would have many breakages&mdash;they <Col N="1104" /> should not have to wait for six months to replace these breakages with matching articles.  In our own restaurant we have a nice little green and white cup, and in various hospitals and institutions there are similar articles, and if these become broken or damaged they cannot be replaced quickly enough.  We read recently in the papers, and those of us who travel in buses, saw notices underneath the picture of a damaged cup, saying: &ldquo;Break that cup.&rdquo;  People are advised in the interests of public health to break cups with flaws in them, but some of the institutions are afraid to break the cup because they cannot get replacements, which they say they want.</P>
    <P>Any Irish-manufactured tea or dinner-sets that I have seen are of a very high standard and a tribute to the excellent workmanship and quality put into them.  They are a credit to the industry which turned them out and should one say in passing that an industry that deserves the highest tribute that anyone could pay to them in this House is the Waterford glass industry.  I have heard the quality of these goods praised by continentals who were very happy and pleased to be able to bring home small presents of our new Waterford glass.</P>
    <P>But I want to see the Minister, in his very laudable desire to see that employment is given in these new industries, concern himself also with the consumers and see if the industry that is getting the concession gives sufficient output to meet the people's needs.  The type of delf or china that is used by the working-class people in the City of Dublin&mdash;of which I am a member&mdash;is scarce and dear, and because of that dearness I ask the Minister: Will he give that type of person a chance of filling his requirements at a price he can afford to pay?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I am not satisfied that our Irish industry is playing its part in giving the class of material it should give.  Is there any reason why hotels, at any rate, could not be given materials by our own manufacturers?  I feel there is no justification whatever for the present situation.  I want to go further and say to <Col N="1105" /> the Minister that if he and his Department are going to look after hotels, they should see that what is on the table is of Irish manufacture.  Why is it that after so many years they are not able to cater for hotels?  I am amazed, when I look at the china to see where it has been manufactured, to discover that it has not been manufactured in Ireland.  Surely there should be a demand from Irish hotels for our own products.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the question of replacements.  I am informed that these replacements are inferior in quality as compared with the original. I believe that in these factories there is what is known as firsts and seconds and there is a big reduction in the price of seconds.  Those seconds are bought by wholesalers and retailers and I am inclined to think that they are often passed over on to the unthinking customer as firsts.  The result is that, as time goes on, and defects are discovered the Irish manufactured article again comes under criticism and it is said that the imported English manufactured article is better, even though it is often dearer.  I think a good deal of supervision is required and I think there should be some system of supervision in alternate years.  I believe our manufacturers are not inclined to cater for the full market.  I can see no reason why the hotel requirements could not be captured by our own manufacturers. It would be desirable to discover whether it is quality or price that governs choice because I am sure we are all anxious to support Irish manufacture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy A. Byrne in regard to price, there may be a tendency on the part of certain people to believe that because there is protection that is the reason why tableware is now dearer than it was pre-war.  It ought to be accepted that commodities generally have increased in price.  I was speaking to an English housewife about tableware on sale here and she said that our prices compared reasonably with the prices obtaining in Britain.  I understand that all tableware has increased substantially in <Col N="1106" /> price over there and we should not attribute blame to the Irish manufacturer because delf is dearer now than it has been in the past.  Everything has increased in price.</P>
      <P>Anyone who has been through the Arklow factory will admit that the standard of efficiency there is very high.  Good wages are paid.  The plant and machinery is first-class and up to date.  It is an industry of which we have every right to be proud.  We admit that the criticisms offered are constructive and we could err by being too complacent about quality rather than by being critical about it.  I think the manufacturer must accept that his goods will be regarded with a certain amount of criticism and that comparisons will be made with similar goods manufactured elsewhere.  I think that is essential.  Having secured protection, it is up to the manufacturer to give to the Irish consumer high-quality goods.  Even if prices are a little higher than they were some years ago that is a prevailing condition all over the world.  The products of the Arklow factory compare reasonably well both in quality and price with similar goods produced elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The industrial surveys which I referred to on an earlier Imposition of Duties Bill have, I think, been completed.  There can only be one or two left, if any at all.  On the basis of these surveys conferences were held where necessary with the representatives of the manufacturers concerned, primarily for the purpose of pointing out to them the extent to which they were not meeting the market or directing their attention to new lines of production which they might develop.  In many cases I think it is true to say that some industrial progress has resulted.  In other cases I was satisfied that nothing could be done in the direction which seemed possible when the survey was being studied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the present the sole use of these surveys has been to open up for exploration possible new fields of development in the home market.  The Government has decided that it is necessary to hold another systematic <Col N="1107" /> review of the operation of protection. That will be of a different kind and for a different purpose; it will be directed to investigating the efficiency with which productive operations are carried on here and the need for protection at existing rates or the possible consequences of its modification in some cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably the Industrial Development Authority, a body which is empowered to do that under existing legislation; but I do not want to confine myself to that type of survey.  It may be more pointed in a few instances.  With regard to tableware, I was surprised that the representatives of the retailers complained to Deputy Cosgrave about the quality of Arklow products because they made no complaint regarding quality to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is confined to some cases only.  Some were excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Reference was made to replacements but the main complaint was lack of sufficient variety of design. It has to be recognised that some sacrifice of variety is involved in manufacture here but I agree there is an obligation upon manufacturers to produce the maximum number of varieties and designs economically possible and to recognise the need of traders to have variety if they are to maintain sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time last year I visited the Arklow factory and watched operations there.  As a non-expert, it seemed to me that their method of working lent itself to innumerable interchanges of design in relation to shape and so forth and that there should be no real problem on that score if their design department was properly organised.  It is, of course, necessary for any manufacturer to maintain a regular supply <Col N="1108" /> of replacements, particularly to traders in delf.  At our time of life most of us only buy a tea set or dinner set as a wedding present for a son or daughter or friend.  For household purposes it is replacements we are looking for and if delf of the same design cannot be secured the housewife concerned is handicapped.  I know of no reason why Irish manufacturers should not be able to maintain a proper supply of replacements to traders and I intend to investigate their arrangements in that regard.</P>
    <P>At the time I visited the factory there was quite a substantial stock held there.  It was obvious that production was running somewhat ahead of sales.  That is why I am surprised to hear any complaint about delays or difficulty in getting delivery of goods because it seemed to me that in respect of most of the products of that factory delivery from stock at a moment's notice should have been feasible.  The position with regard to the hotel trade is complicated.  I have discussed it with individual hotel-keepers.  I have no recollection of anyone complaining of the quality of Irish delf.  Some of them said to me that it had no price advantage, notwithstanding the duty, over the imported goods.  There is, of course, one very well-known firm which specialises in hotel servicing in England and most of the firms here would have had contacts with that firm over a number of years and it is probably quite a simple matter to place an order with that firm for a supply of so many items of the standard design used in the hotel.  Arklow have told me that they are willing to meet these designs and to co-operate fully with hotel-keepers in ensuring that a change-over to Arklow ware means no departure from the standard designs previously used.</P>
    <P>It has, of course, to be recognised that the cost of delf is higher than before the war and is going to remain so, but my information is that the price at which delfware is produced here is keenly competitive with the price of goods from British potteries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin referred to the fact that in the case of the Galway china <Col N="1109" /> factory the duty on chinaware was brought into operation before the factory was in full production.  I must say that it is, as Deputy Cosgrave appreciates, established practice here not to impose a protective duty on any class of goods until production has actually commenced.  There are obvious reasons for that.  One does not like the prospect of some company proposing to manufacture goods getting a protective duty and then raising money on the strength of the protection which had been afforded.  That is why the normal practice is to require that production should have commenced before a protective duty comes into operation.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Galway factory, however, that was a joint enterprise of the Galway Industrial Development Committee, a private group of people, and Foras Tionscal and it looked at one time as if they might go on the rocks unless they got that evidence of official support which the early imposition of the duty afforded and, in fact, it did contribute, I think, to the completion of the tripartite negotiations which got the factory launched.</P>
    <P>In the case of chinaware which, as I have said, is a particularly imperishable type of goods, there was, of course, far more danger of stocking up against the possibility of a tariff than would apply in other cases, and the circumstances of that enterprise were different in this respect that quite a long period of partial manufacture had to be contemplated, when workers were being trained in the more delicate processes, before full-scale production could commence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Larkin asked about the mechanics for the granting of duty-free licences.  That is an important question.  Normally, so far as I am concerned, I would prefer to relate duty-free licences to orders placed with Irish producers.  That is quite a simple matter where it is recognised that there is a gap between total Irish output and market needs.  If that gap is 20, 25 or 50 per cent. of market needs then the relationship between the quantities to be admitted under duty-free licences to the quantities produced <Col N="1110" /> by Irish manufacturers can be easily established.  In other cases, where no gap, or only a slight gap, is believed to exist, the practice is to require the applicant for a duty-free licence to produce evidence of inability of local manufacturers to supply. Deputy Larkin referred to the case where there was only one Irish producer.  In that case that one producer is required to certify that an order was placed with him but that he was unable to meet it within a reasonable time or for some stated reason.</P>
    <P>In many cases, of course, the standard practice is not to grant duty-free licences at all and to require any person desiring to import goods of the class concerned to pay the duty on them.  The aim in all cases must be to ensure that there is no discrimination as between one applicant and another except upon some obvious and justifiable ground.</P>
    <P>It is true that in the case of delf there were for a time many complaints about refusal of supplies on wholesale terms to individual traders.  The House may have noticed, however, that in the past two or three weeks an advertisement was published in the Press from the Fair Trade Commission to the effect that they have prepared and published fair trading rules for this particular trade.  The Fair Trade Commission expect that the trade will now be operated in accordance with these fair trading rules.  If they find that should not prove to be the case then, of course, the consequential provisions of the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill will become operative.</P>
    <P>In the case where export prices for Irish products are less than the home prices, it is generally true that Irish home prices are less than they otherwise would be by reason of that export trade.  The case made here was the case of glass bottles.  It is true that a particular instance was given of a type of bottle where the differential between the price at home and the export price was quite considerable but, over the whole range of bottles which are exported, the differential between the export price and the home price is very much narrower.  As was explained to me, the cost of production <Col N="1111" /> above home market requirements is considerably less than the cost of producing for the home market only.  The illustration was given of a tank producing glass.  If enough material is put into the tank to take out 15 tons of glass the cost of that glass is determined by the wages paid to the workers operating the tank, the fuel used for firing the tank as well as the material put into it.  If enough material is put into the tank to take out 17 tons of glass, the wages remain the same, fuel costs remain the same, the overheads remain the same and the additional two tons are secured for the cost of the extra materials which went into the tank and the glass products made from that glass can therefore be sold profitably at a lower price than the bulk of the production and, by doing so, the all-over costs of the total production are reduced.  In fact, the firm producing these glass bottles have indicated that if they cannot maintain their export trade the prices at home will go up and that the more they can expand their export trade the lower will the prices at home become.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying.  The additional production is for export and the larger that margin of manufacture for export can be made, the lower the home prices will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not think that they are selling them cheaper abroad because they want to sell them cheaper abroad. It is because it is the only price they can get abroad; but, nevertheless, that price is sufficient to cover part of the overheads and part of the cost of producing bottles for the home market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, on the contrary they offered to demonstrate to my officials that even at the lower price the increased production that the exports provide cuts down the cost of total production of the firm.</P>

      <P>In the matter of delf goods to which reference was made it is of course quite true that one of the main problems of the delf industry is the disposal of seconds, that is products which have a flaw of some sort in them&mdash;the pattern slightly crooked or a slight chip out of it or something wrong with the glaze.  In fact, a large part of the imports which used to come from Britain were seconds, and perhaps a large part of the Irish goods that may be exported to Britain will be seconds, because it is the disposal of seconds without destroying the market for the firsts which is the main problem.</P>

      <P>The Deputy says some retailers buying these slightly defective goods at lower prices because they are defective may be selling them at the top price.  That could be so, but I do not see any way by which that practice could be eliminated except by competition between traders, and I think that answers the point which Deputy Larkin made about the price at which goods imported under duty-free licences may be sold.  Inevitably, competition will prevent any attempt to exploit that situation except a firm importing goods can get some exclusive type of goods that no other firm would have and they can represent them as being of exceptional quality and therefore worth more.  On the whole, so long as we can keep up a full supply of goods at competitive prices, these incidental problems should settle themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to continue the present Rent Restrictions Acts in force for a further period of one year, i.e., up to the 31st December 1954. These Acts, which give protection to tenants of pre-1941 dwellings against arbitrary increases of rent or arbitrary demands for possession, could not be allowed to lapse at the end of the year without causing serious hardships to many tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that the Report of the Rents and Leasehold Commission, which was published in January <Col N="1114" /> last, made a considerable number of recommendations for amendment of the existing Acts including a recommendation that the Acts should be repealed and re-enacted in one statute which would incorporate all the suggested amendments.  The chairman (Judge Conroy) and the members of the commission are to be congratulated on their exhaustive investigation of this difficult and many-sided problem, the outcome of which has been a comprehensive and valuable report.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in the House during the debate on last year's Continuation Bill, I thought it desirable to get the public reaction to the commission's proposals before the Government were asked to take final decisions.  Since the report was published I have received a deputation from a tenants' organisation and two deputations on behalf of landlords, the second of which came to me only a few weeks ago.  I understand that the views of another organisation representing house-owners are to be submitted in the near future.  In the meantime, the recommendations of the commission have been the subject of careful departmental examination.  I expect to have the observations of interested Departments shortly and to be then in a position to submit the major recommendations in the report to the Government for decision.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies, having seen the large-scale changes in the present code which have been proposed by the commission, will appreciate that the preparation of comprehensive legislalation in accordance with the decisions of the Government will be no easy task having regard to the complexity of the code and the need to do justice to both landlords and tenants.  The period of one year for which it is proposed to extend the Acts is not, therefore, excessive and it will not prevent the introduction before then of either the comprehensive measure, if it is ready, or an interim measure to deal with any particularly urgent problem that may arise.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill is the usual provision in Continuation Bills of this <Col N="1115" /> kind.  It amends the provisions entitling landlords to add to the controlled rent a graduated percentage of exceptional expenditure on repairs in specified years by enabling any such expenditure incurred by them during 1954 to qualify for this exceptional lawful addition.</P>

      <P>What I said was that I had already received three deputations, one from a tenants' organisation and two from householders, and another one has asked to be interviewed about the recommendations in the report, and that the Departments were examining the report and until I have got all their comments I was not in a position to put up a proposal to the Government.  That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks.  That view of the Minister, of course, I can understand.  Until he gets them he is not in a position to submit anything to the Government, but I would stress to the Minister that it is a matter of urgency that there would be a more full enactment following the report of the commission.  There are two angles from which it is necessary.  In the first case over the years there have been some cases of distinct hardships that have come to light as a result of legal decisions and so forth.  When the 1946 Act was enacted the Minister may perhaps remember I was in another place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  I well remember it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and gave the Minister a good deal of trouble, perhaps, if I might use that word, on the Bill, and we had very full discussions on it at the time.  In respect of one important particular there has certainly been a decision since which has gone contrary to the entire intention that any of us at that time believed the legislation that we were enacting would provide.  The Minister is, of course, aware that under the 1946 Act statutory tenants are given certain protection and in addition where a <Col N="1116" /> statutory tenant has died the children under certain circumstances are given the benefit of that protection as well. That, of course, is quite understandable and was, if I may use the phrase, the basis of the rent restriction code.  A most peculiar situation has arisen, however, in respect of a person who is not a statutory tenant.  The effect of one decision&mdash;and for the life of me the name of the case escapes me now though I remembered it earlier this afternoon&mdash;has been to provide that where a person was not a statutory tenant the children living in the house have no protection whatsoever.</P>
      <P>The effect of that is best illustrated by an example.  You have two houses side by side in the same street.  The terms of the tenancy and the valuation of each of those houses are exactly the same.  In house No. 1 we have tenant A who does not pay his rent. He gets into arrears and generally, for the sake of example, we will say he is a really bad tenant.  The landlord serves notice to quit on tenant A, and tenant A, with the pistol to his head, pays up.  Then he continues as a statutory tenant under the provisions of the 1946 Act.  He dies subsequently and his child, who has been living in the house with him, remains on as tenant, and under the terms of the 1946 Act is protected from eviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second house you have tenant B who is a model tenant.  He pays his rent on the nail on the day it is due, keeps his house nicely and is no trouble to his neighbours or no trouble to his landlord, and accordingly the landlord has never any occasion to serve any notice to quit on him. Tenant B then dies and leaves his child in exactly the same situation as tenant A, but because tenant B never became a statutory tenant, because no notice to quit was ever served on him, the child of tenant B is not protected and can be put out in the morning. That means a child of a good tenant can be penalised while the child of a bad tenant gets the protection of the 1946 Act.  The Minister will agree with me that that was certainly never our intention in the days we were trying to cover appropriate cases in the Bill <Col N="1117" /> before it became an Act.  I myself have professional knowledge of two cases side by side which I had, one in which there was a good tenant and one in which there was a bad tenant and where there was a bad landlord, shall we say, over each.  The child of the bad tenant is protected while the child of the good tenant had no protection or no redress.  I do not know whether the Minister can now name the case I mentioned a short time ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that these were cases of very considerable hardship and that such cases should be met and met fairly soon.  I think that the Minister is going to find that the preparation of what one might call a codifying or a consolidating measure, a full new Rent Restrictions Act, is likely to take up some very considerable time.  Even when a governmental decision has been taken, inevitably a long time will elapse before the Bill is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the 1946 Act not safeguard tenants against increases in rents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It did if they were statutory tenants but not if they were not.  If notice to quit had not been served in the tenant's lifetime, it did not safeguard his children.  This, of course, is purely a continuing Bill and I do not think that I could, under the terms of the Long Title, propose an amendment that would cover cases of that kind but I would urge the Minister to consider the introduction of an interim short measure to cover that and any other similar type of simple case, leaving aside the whole question of general revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want to make it quite clear that so far as hardship goes, I am entirely on the side of the tenant and anxious to prevent that type of hardship.  I want at the same time to sound a note of caution.  One of the effects of the Rent Restrictions Act up to date has been that there are no houses to rent.  I think we will probably get agreement on all sides of <Col N="1118" /> the House for the statement that where you have good landlords there is no necessity for Rent Restrictions Acts.  The difficulty is that you get a proportion of bad, very bad, landlords. The type of person who deals in slum property almost always comes under the heading of a very bad landlord.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential to provide some means by which a person in the position of a tenant to such a landlord will not be imposed upon.  We, however, must face the situation&mdash; whether we consider it good or bad is another question&mdash;that the continuance of rent restriction has tended to drive people out of having houses for letting at all.  Personally I think it would be far better, if it were possible, that people should buy their houses on an annuity or loan system rather than that they should rent them but there will always be a certain number of people who may feel that their employment in a particular place is not going to be sufficiently permanent to justify their making arrangements to buy their houses.  For such a type of person the provision of houses to rent is not merely desirable but is a necessity.</P>
    <P>Over the years, we have gone to such an extent in trying to protect tenants against bad landlords that we have rather overbalanced ourselves by putting restrictions on the good landlords and the result is that the supply of houses to rent is giving out and that there are practically no additions coming on the market in that respect. That is a matter which obviously has got to be considered in relation not merely to the problem of landlord and tenant, but also in relation to the supplies of homes for our people.</P>
    <P>I would again urge the Minister to consider seriously introducing legislation to deal with some of the more glaring instances that have come before him and that came before the commission, because otherwise I cannot see any prospect of the Minister not coming before the House again with a similar Bill next year and, indeed, the year after.  I doubt if he will get through the various realms of governmental sanction and governmental Departments and then through <Col N="1119" /> this House and the other House to enact a comprehensive measure much short of the year 1956.  I would not like to see children of good tenants penalised between this and then, as they will be under the decision which has been given and which clearly was a decision not visualised by this House at the time and certainly not visualised by the Minister or the other House of which I was a member on the consideration of the 1946 measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to bring in a Bill to cover certain cases.  The best way I can convince him of the necessity for that is to mention cases in point.  I understand that there is no protection under the Rent Restriction Act for houses built since 1941.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the suburbs of Cork a large number of private houses were built since then for which reasonable rents were agreed upon between the landlord and the tenant.  This applies to certain houses built in 1944.  It was agreed between the landlord and the tenants of these houses that the tenants should pay a rent of £75 and that the landlord should pay £17 in rates.  In 1949 he notified the tenants that he would have to increase the rent from £75 to £96.  In 1953 he informed them that he could no longer pay the £17 rates and that the rent of the houses would be £113 per year as against £75 in 1944.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that on account of the increase in the rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  When the last Government were in power deputations were received by the then Minister for Justice and this Bill was promised.  I know that what is happening in Cork is happening all over the State.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman that it will be two years, if not more, before we will have the comprehensive Bill introduced and passed.  The people I speak of require protection, because while some people are protected by the Rent Restriction Acts these tenants are not.  Some of <Col N="1120" /> these people have come to me about the matter.  I said to one of them: &ldquo;Why do you pay rent?&rdquo; His reply was: &ldquo;Where am I to get a house? I had to submit to paying the increased rent because I had no chance of getting any other house.&rdquo;  I appeal to the Minister, and I know he has a good deal of sympathy with people who are treated in that fashion, to bring in a short Bill to give these people protection.  In another case where the rents were increased the tenants told me that one of the houses had been sold at a very reduced price compared with what they have to pay in rent.  I appeal to the Minister to bring in a short Bill to protect those people who require protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the point raised by Deputy Sweetman, there is a recommendation with regard to that.  I agree with Deputy Sweetman that that was not the intention.  We had plenty of advice from lawyers on that occasion and we thought we had everything covered.  The trouble about bringing in a short Bill is that if we do that Deputies will be pressing to have other matters included.  However, I will consider the matter and see what can be done to deal with cases of hardship.  I would prefer to deal with these matters in a comprehensive Bill, but I think it will be a good while before it will be ready.  On the last occasion I think I was unduly optimistic.  I know that I said it would probably be brought in during the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained when introducing this Bill, I have already received three deputations, one from tenants and two from landlords, and a third deputation is now asking to see me to point out how the proposals in this report affect them.  That is one of the reasons why the Bill has been delayed.  In the meantime, the proposals are under examination in the Department, and other Departments are examining them to see in what way they may affect their Departments.  Consequently I have not been able to bring the matter before the Government yet.  I will see what can be done to deal with the kind of cases which have been referred to.  Deputy Hickey spoke about <Col N="1121" /> houses built since 1941.  I suppose, if we brought in a short Bill to deal with them, other points would be raised. That is the difficulty about bringing in a short Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill is concerned with a single type of intestacy and with no other type of case, namely, the case of a man who dies leaving a widow but no children.  It is not a Bill to deal with the law of intestate succession generally.  Nor does it aim at a reform of the law of property, which some people think is overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill differs from the Bill that was introduced in 1951, chiefly, in two respects.  Under the previous Bill the widow was to take the whole of the intestate's personal estate.  Thus, if <Col N="1122" /> the deceased's estate consisted solely of a farm of registered land (which devolves as personal estate) the widow would take the entire estate.  This, we believe, would be inconsistent with the wishes of intestates generally in this country and we have, therefore, proceeded on a different principle. Secondly, the previous Bill would have given the widow a life interest in the whole of the real estate but no other interest therein.  This would put the widow in a worse position than she is in at present in the case of a small estate of real property as it would deprive her of the statutory legacy and a lump sum equivalent to half the value of the residue which would be a much more valuable interest in such a case. Opinion is indeed unanimous that life interests in small estates are most undesirable.  We consider, therefore, that it would be a retrograde step to make such a change in the law.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to make better provision for the childless widows of intestates in three ways.  In the first place it proposes to increase four-fold the statutory legacy payable to such widows under the existing law, that is to say, to increase the statutory legacy from the sum of £500 to the sum of £2,000.  Secondly, it provides that in the case of a partial intestacy the provisions of the Bill will apply to the intestate part.  As the law stands the widow has no right to the statutory legacy in the case of a partial intestacy.  And, finally, it provides that any property which, for want of an heir or next-of-kin, would pass to the State under the existing law shall in future belong to the widow absolutely and exclusively.</P>
    <P>There has been a widespread feeling which is shared by the Government that the present law of intestate succession as it affects the case of the widow of a person who dies without children is not in accord with what such a person would have wished to have done with his property.  Nor is it in accord with what is done by the average testator in making a will.  On the other hand there is no evidence that public opinion is prepared for sweeping changes or would welcome any radical departure from the <Col N="1123" /> principle upon which the property of such a person has been distributed on his death for the past 60 years.  Indeed there is some reason to suppose that any sweeping changes which ran counter to accustomed ways of thinking would be strongly resented. Accordingly it is proposed within the existing framework of the law to increase the statutory legacy fourfold so as to bring it into line with the present value of money and to remedy those defects in the law as a result of which the widow is deprived of some of her inheritance for the benefit of the State where there is no heir or next-of-kin and loses the statutory legacy in the case of a partial intestacy.</P>
    <P>There is one provision in the present Bill that must, I think, be reconsidered and that is the provision which relates to the valuation of real estate. Under the Bill as it stands the value of the real estate for the purpose of determining the widow's rights falls to be calculated in an artificial manner upon the basis of 20 times the rateable valuation.  The effect of this artificial manner of valuing real estate under present-day conditions when the price of land is high might be to produce anomalous results and to make more ample provision for the widow of an intestate than it is thought reasonable to make.</P>
    <P>Let me give an illustration.  Suppose two persons were to die intestate, one possessed of a farm of registered land with a rateable valuation of £100, and the other possessed of nothing but £2,000 in the bank, the widow would take the entire estate in each case, but the saleable value of the farm of registered land might be worth as much as £4,000 or £5,000.  The anomaly would be even greater in the case of two farms of registered land the artificial value of which was slightly below £2,000 in one case and slightly above it in the other, although the saleable value of both farms was much in excess of the artificial valuation.  In the first case, the widow would take the entire farm, but in the second she would get no more than a statutory legacy for £2,000 and half the balance of the market value.  For this reason <Col N="1124" /> we have come to the conclusion that real estate should be valued on the basis of its market value and I propose, on the Committee Stage, to ask the Dáil to amend the Bill accordingly. Subject to this amendment I think the Bill is a good one and I ask the House to give it a second reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Bill can be accepted by the House, but it should not be passed into law without Deputies appreciating that the real tribute for its enactment is due to the efforts made by Deputy John Costello some years ago to have this and other outstanding grievances and defects in our law amended.  Deputy Costello, in this House, has consistently, on a number of law reform measures of this kind, done the work of a pioneer.  It is regrettable that much of his efforts have not got from the draftsman's office, from the Minister's Department, the Attorney-General's Office, and from other bodies and authorities that should give assistance, the assistance that one would expect.</P>
      <P>The Intestates' Estates Bill is introduced by the Minister in 1953.  It was sponsored by Deputy Costello many years ago.  Like many other Private Deputies' Bills, dealing or touching with law reform, the dead hand of the daughtsman's office descended upon it, and it was committed with the Civil Liability Bill, and a variety of other Bills of that kind, into the limbo of forgotten things.</P>

Deputies will recollect that Deputy Costello introduced, I think in 1940, a Tort Feasors Bill, and also a Bill dealing with the position of married women as Private Deputies' Bills.  The present Minister was in charge of the Department of Justice at that time.  Deputy Costello was asked then would he not hand over the first-named Bill to the Minister for piloting through this House.  Twelve years later, Deputy Costello, as Taoiseach, had the obligation and duty of seeing that that measure became law.  That is why I say <Col N="1125" /> that the Minister's office has been responsible for bringing about the complete death of worthwhile measures.</P>
      <P>The Minister now says that this Bill has come to life again.  It has come to life in a very attenuated form.  The Bill proposed in the Seanad by Deputy Costello's Government, the Intestates' Estates Bill of 1951 which is still on the Order Paper, proposed to give to a widow, if her husband died intestate and where there were no children, his entire personal estate. That, if one likes to say it, indicates a very marked departure from the present state of the law.</P>
      <P>I have yet to hear any convincing reason why, when a man dies intestate, having no children and leaving a widow, the widow should not get all his personal property.  It seems to me only reasonable that that should be so.  The case might be made that, if he died with real estate and personal property, his real estate should legitimately descend to his blood relations.  Accordingly, in the Intestates' Estates Bill of 1951, it was provided that the widow, in addition to taking all his personal property, would have a life estate in his real estate, and in his landed property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that there can be any very cogent reasons advanced against that proposal in the other Bill which is still on the Order Paper.  The Minister apparently does not agree with it, and suggests, instead, that where a man dies intestate, leaving real estate and personal property, or merely one or the other, of a net value that does not exceed £2,000, then the widow will take all absolutely.  That, of course, is sound as far as it goes.  But we must not forget that we are dealing with something very trivial.  Nowadays, with the fall in real value in money and the increase in market value of houses and bits of land that a few years ago would not be worth much, there are very few estates that do not exceed £2,000 in value, and we should not forget that the reform proposed here in its full degree will apply in very few cases.  It is provided, then, that where the estate exceeds £2,000 the widow will have the first £2,000 and <Col N="1126" /> will then take whatever share she is entitled to under the Statute of Distributions.  Of course, the Intestates' Estates Act is, or will be, repealed by this Act.  In other words, she will share with the next-of-kin of her husband all his property in excess of £2,000.  Again, there is a difference of opinion.  The Minister apparently holds one view; Deputy Costello and I would be inclined to hold a different view.  The Minister thinks it is reasonable that the widow should be compelled to share with her husband's next-of-kin the real and personal property which perhaps herself and her husband acquired or worked together to acquire over a long married life.  I do not think that is sound but that is the Minister's view.  His proposal here is that after the £2,000 charge&mdash;the statutory legacy, I think the Minister called it&mdash;is satisfied, the widow will then share with the next-of-kin of her husband whatever is surplus to that.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is any other matter that requires comment in this Bill.  I am glad the Minister referred to Section 7 because certainly as the Bill stands at the moment the valuation of real estate would be a matter that might cause considerable difficulties.</P>
    <P>Might I just say this?  I have frequently referred in this House on matters of law reform to the very considerable lead which the neighbouring country of Great Britain has on us in the reform of law.  We here carry on under a common law very similar to the common law of England, but more important than that we carry on under a statutory code passed by the Imperial Parliament in many instances over 100 years ago, often longer.  Many of our statutory conventions, regulating the duties and obligations of one citizen to another, are enshrined in very old British statutes.  Now it is quite commonplace for Deputies when they are candidates at elections to say it is wrong for us to be carrying on under British statutes; why do we not change it?  That, of course, is true, and I have often asked: Why do we not change them?  The British themselves changed them years and years ago.  The British do not carry on in <Col N="1127" /> their modern society under aged statutes passed in the days of Queen Anne or in the early years of Victoria's reign.  They have recognised that those statutes are out of accord with modern requirements.  This particular matter of succession of a widow to the estate of her intestate husband was dealt with in England first of all in 1925. It was later amended by the Intestates' Estates Act, passed by the British Parliament of 1952.  It is only another example of the manner in which in Britain they have consistently ensured that the law is kept in accordance with the modern requirements of their society.</P>
    <P>We here&mdash;and it is unfortunate&mdash;are very much behind, but so far as this Bill is a little step, perhaps a faltering step, in the right direction, we welcome it.  We wish the Minister had taken the stride that Deputy Costello proposed should be taken.  But even the little step is a welcome one and we recognise that even Ministers must crawl before they walk.</P>

      <P>This Bill, as the last speaker has said, is definitely a step in the right direction, and I just want to ask the Minister a few questions on points on which I am not too clear. The changes that are proposed under Section 6&mdash;could the Minister give us any idea of what that will cost the State each year?  Could I put it this way, what will the annual&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Not that I am by any means interested in widows.  The second thing is: seeing that we are dealing with the matter of intestacy in any case, I have another group of people in mind who are concerned in cases that we come up against in the country very often.  As a matter of fact the titles to most of the land of this country, due to an unfortunate feature of our life, i.e., emigration, are in a serious muddle in many cases. Father or mother or both parents in many cases died without any will.  A son remained on in the holding.  The result was that there might be two, three, four or sometimes more children <Col N="1128" /> in England, America, Australia, or scattered all over the globe and the son or daughter who stays at home and looks after the old couple in their last days and looks after the farm or holding, cannot get title without going to extraordinary rounds.  I could quote one case where the owner of the holding died without a will, with a son who went to England 27 years before and married a widow who had children by her first marriage.  In turn that son died, and the son who remained at home in charge of the holding tried to take out title. The court held that not alone must the brother's widow, but even the children of her first husband, who never stood inside this country or knew they possessed relatives here, must be considered as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is well aware that that is a very serious flaw and it is preventing the occupiers of holdings from getting Government grants or availing of loans because they cannot prove title.  Would amendments along these lines be acceptable to the Minister to make the proving of title easier?  Would the framework of the Bill permit such amendment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider bringing in a Bill to cover the cases I have mentioned?  I got an insight into the position while I was Minister for Lands and I think I am safe in saying that eight out of every <Col N="1129" /> ten holdings are without title.  The Land Commission is sometimes blamed for being slow but one must admit that the Land Commission and the Land Registry, an office for which the Minister is responsible, have done an excellent job of work in giving title to all registered farmers.  Now, due to various unforeseen contingencies, titles are slipping back into a hopeless state of chaos.  I am sure some legislation to meet that situation would not be outside the scope of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The best that can be said for this Bill is that it is an improvement upon the existing position.  Under the Constitution every citizen is supposed to be equal and to have equal rights before the law.  Yet, here in this Bill we have a continuation of the theory that the female of the race has not equal rights with the male.</P>
      <P>If a woman dies without making a will her husband gets her full estate. When he was getting married he made a pledge to his wife: &ldquo;With all my worldly goods I thee endow&rdquo;, but the Minister now says: &ldquo;Only to the tune of £2,000.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution says we are all equal and we all have equal rights.  Here is a Minister of State coming in and saying: &ldquo;No, it is only the male of the race who has the right of succession to the whole estate; the female has not.&rdquo; I can see <Col N="1130" /> no reason in that.  I cannot understand why the Minister could not have accepted Deputy Costello's Bill because that was rectifying the situation.</P>
      <P>Another point is that this Bill will not take effect until the 1st January next.  If I die intestate before the 1st January next my widow will suffer because the old law will be still extant, but if she could keep me alive until the 1st January next she would get £2,000 instead of £500 according to the Minister.</P>

      <P>It should apply to all intestate estates that have not yet been wound up.  If that is accepted justice will be done to people who might otherwise not get justice.  I think that is a reasonable line of approach.  I have known cases in my constituency where a man and his wife built up a big business.  They worked hard and I can safely say that the wife worked as hard as he did, if not harder.  He died intestate and people who were away for years came home and succeeded to the business; the widow got her £500 and the door. There were no children, of course.  I know cases in which grave hardship has arisen because of the state of the law.  I cannot see why estates that have yet not been wound up and the assets distributed cannot be brought under the scope of this measure. There will be no difficulty in getting a certificate from the registrar that these estates have not yet been wound up.  There should be no trouble about that and I think it is a reasonable line of approach.  It is the Minister who should put down these amendments. If the Minister does not do so, then the Whips will be on and we will be back where we started.  This is a type of legislation where no Whips should be on because this is legislation for the benefit of all, no matter whether you are Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Labour or anything else.  Therefore, the Whips should be taken off and the Bill should be discussed on its merits to make it a better Bill and to make the law in respect of the administration of estates equitable and just.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, so far as it goes, as an undoubted improvement and advance but on some of the more glaring injustices existing under the Intestate Estates Act it is unfortunately silent.  One of the most glaring injustices has always been that in the case of pure realty the heir-at-law or the eldest son will inherit, irrespective of what he may have contributed to the family or whether he has been the greatest blackguard of the family.  It is an extraordinary survival of the old feudal law that we still have here that, where you have pure realty and somebody dies intestate, the eldest son, even though he has gone away from the home and has been away all his life, can walk in and collect all the real property irrespective of the position of the other members of the family or, if it is the father that dies, irrespective of the position of the widow or, if it is the mother that dies, irrespective of the position of the widower.  Possibly this can be cured on the Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not see why, even so far as this Bill goes, as far as the first £2,000 is concerned, this old position that has been created in feudal times in the English law and taken over by our legal code should not be cured.  It is high time it was cured.  This law often gives rise to very grave problems of title.  In trying to make title to pure realty it is sometimes impossible to find where the heir at law is.</P>
      <P>The Bill purports to be an Act to make better provision for the widows of persons dying intestate and I would suggest to the Minister that on Committee Stage he would abolish the special privileged position of the heir-at-law as it exists under our code to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that it is open to me on this Bill to mention another matter. I think it has been mentioned by Deputy Blowick.  It is true that there is immense confusion and immense expense incurred by people under the law as it stands in regard to registered land and ordinary yearly tenancies that we meet from day to day in the country.  Deputy Blowick and I would be merely concerned with the small <Col N="1132" /> type of farmers in the West of Ireland. Owing to the historical conditions there, we have and will have for a long time, a large number of people emigrating from small farms under £10 valuation.  It is often virtually impossible to make title to these small farms when parents die.  There may be five or six members of the family scattered all over the world, in Australia, New Zealand, America and England, who have not been in touch with their homes for a great number of years. The boy who has waited at home and has worked the farm since his father's death, if he has the misfortune to take out administration, becomes express trustee and cannot acquire title without endeavouring to trace the members of the family who are all over the world, in order to get releases from them.</P>
    <P>That causes him tremendous expense.  In some cases the people who are abroad may not hear of the parent's death for some time and, when they find that they have a right, even though it may be only a nominal right, to a release in some of these small estates, they start trouble and refuse to sign deeds.  The member of the family who stayed at home would be in a far better position if he never took out administration and just stayed on for 12 years.  Something should be made more definite in ease of these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>In a Bill of this kind there should be a simple section inserted to provide that where there has been no adverse claim from any of the other next-of-kin within a period of 12 years, automatically, under this new particular section which I would suggest the Minister might put in, the man on the land would be entitled to file a simple affidavit in the Land Registry and be registered as full owner without having to go to the expense of applying under the Local Registration of Title Act or having to go to the interminable rounds involved in endeavouring to trace brothers and sisters who have left the farm perhaps 40 or 50 years before that.  Some reform of that kind is long overdue, and I would ask the Minister to consider it before the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> I know that there is a great number of our laws that need reform and that we very badly need a law reform committee but, if we wait for the work to be done by such a committee I am afraid we will have a very long time to wait.  In so far as we are curing defects under this Bill, I would ask the Minister to consider, in particular, the privileged position of the heir-at-law as he now exists at law and, if he can see fit in this Bill to bring in such a section as I have suggested to enable the man who waits at home on the small West of Ireland farm to get his title put in order without the interminable legal rounds and the tremendous expense he is put to as a result of these people being all over the world and making trouble when he tries to get registration in respect of that small farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Great improvement has been effected in the Bill as introduced by the Minister.  Would it be asking too much to ask the Minister to agree to the suggestions that have been made to make the Bill retrospective? Perhaps the Minister would reconsider that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general principle that the provision of a mere £500 for the widow under the Intestates' Estates Act, 1890, is insufficient, everybody is in agreement.  Personally, I think the Minister should have gone the distance that was visualised in the other Bills introduced in the Seanad. If a man does not want to leave all his worldly goods to his wife, we are not seeking to make him do so by will. But, if he neglects to make other dispositions and if he has no children, it is reasonable&mdash;and the balance of hardship would certainly be alleviated most&mdash;that his entire estate should go to the widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two points which may be committee points but which I wish to mention.  I do not understand Sections 1 and 2.  Section 1 is phrased that the Act comes into operation on the 1st day of January, 1954.  Section 2 refers to a man dying after the commencement of this Act.  I cannot understand the difference between the two dates. <Col N="1134" /> Supposing we pass this Bill before Christmas and a man dies on the 30th December, under Section 2 of the provisions of this Bill it applies, but under Section 1 the Bill does not come into operation until January 1st so I just do not understand the drafting of it.  Perhaps I am extremely dense about it but it is quite clear that under Section 1 it does not come into operation until January 1st. It is equally clear&mdash;oh, yes, I see it suddenly as I am talking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I skimmed it too quickly; but what I really wanted to say arises out of that.  The type of person to whom this Bill applies is a type of person who does not read desperately carefully what is taking place, and a great many people of that class are under the impression at the moment that there has been a change in the law because of what they saw publicised in 1951.  Quite a lot of people believe that the old provisions of the 1890 Act have been extended for the last two years though, in fact, they have not.  Quite a lot of people saw references to an Intestates' Estates Bill in 1951 in the newspapers and believed that the law was changed.  The type of person who would be affected by this does not, perhaps, understand and appreciate the difference between a Bill being introduced and being passed into law, and I think there is a very real case to be made for having the effect of this Bill retrospective to that date where at least the grant of administration has not been extracted since 1951 and the present time.  If the estate has been distributed then, of course, I agree that you can do nothing about it, but if the estate has not been distributed then I think we might assume quite fairly that no action has been taken on foot of the rights that were created.  The only way you can tell with any certainty that an estate has not been distributed is where the grant of administration has not been taken out, and I think we might quite fairly use that as the datum date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether under the Long Title of this Bill we could do what <Col N="1135" /> Deputy Moran has suggested, but quite candidly I am in entire agreement with him that the provision by virtue of which a person extracting administration to an estate is thereby made a trustee in perpetuity is something that is without reality in regard to small holdings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is monstrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It involves the people concerned in quite unnecessary expense.  I am afraid, however, candidly, that we are bound by the terms of the Long Title of this Bill, and we can only deal with cases where there was no issue, and, of course, it is very seldom in the cases where there is no issue that the title difficulty arises. It is nearly always where there are children who have gone away to America.</P>
      <P>It would be outside the terms of this Bill, but there certainly should be some provisions that a person would be enabled to commence their squatter's title notwithstanding the fact that they had extracted a grant of administration perhaps for the purpose of dealing with a very minor type of asset which has been distributed&mdash;largely, I think, by paying funeral expenses and the debts in particular cases.  Having to make application under Section 52 in those cases is putting very unnecessary hardship and cost on the person concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It did occur to me when I read this Bill first of all that perhaps we might be running into some difficulty under the terms of it from a technical point of view.  It is quite clear that we are not affecting the provisions of the Statutes of Distribution by the Bill by not expressly excluding them, because it is under the 1890 Act that the £500 came in for the widow and we are expressly repealing that and providing this provision instead of it.  As far as my memory goes the 1890 Act did make some rather more express references to the Statutes of Distribution than is made in the drafting of this Bill.  I have not looked it up and I am relying on very vague recollections of a date at a time when I was reading for examinations, which unfortunately is a <Col N="1136" /> long time ago.  Is the Minister absolutely tied to the question of leaving this on the basis of the £2,000?  I really think that there is no case for the husband taking all the wife's assets on intestacy and the wife only taking part of the man's assets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the husband should not be allowed to take all the wife's money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be at least more logic in introducing a section in the Bill side by side to that effect than doing it in this way.  It is not a matter about which we want to make a political discussion on Party lines, and I really think that there is more logic in having it that if the man does not go to the trouble of making a will the wife would take everything where there are no children.  I know that certain bodies supposed to be very learned in these matters have said differently, but very often these bodies are not as close to the realities of problems in the country as sometimes the people who have to see the countryman and to explain and to break, shall I say, the bad news.  I really think that the Minister might do something on those lines.</P>
      <P>I was not quite clear as to what the Minister said in regard to the change of market value.  Am I to take it that he is changing Section 7 on the basis of valuation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <P>Then I agree because the basis here would be an invalid basis.  I hope it is going to be possible to have no basis at all, because if you wipe out the £2,000 and make it the whole estate then you have not to consider market value and the Bill becomes an even more simple Bill still.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly think that <Col N="1137" /> this is an improvement on the other Bill.  The Attorney-General who drafted this Bill made inquiries as to what the general practice was about people making their wills in the cases where there are no children, and he says that they generally provide for some of their near relations.  It could happen that it might be an old mother or an old father or an invalid brother that he would like to make some provision for &mdash;and first of all he would make sure that his wife was fairly well provided for.  That at least is something which has been the practice where they have estates which are fairly valuable.  A person after making a will may often die off.</P>

      <P>I am personally satisfied that this is not alone an improvement on the existing position but also an improvement on the Bill that was introduced by the last Government.  I am somewhat surprised at the attitude of some speakers in regard to making the Bill retrospective.  I have here an explanatory memorandum which was circulated when the last Bill was introduced in the Seanad.  Deputy <Col N="1138" /> O'Higgins said that it was due to Deputy Costello that that Bill was brought in.  Part III of the explanatory memorandum issued in 1951 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 1 provides that the Act shall come into operation on 1st January, 1952.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill was introduced in April, 1951. The statement continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This is to allow persons concerned an opportunity of making a will if they do not wish their property to be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the new legislation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In other words, Deputy Costello thought it only fair and right that notice should be given to everybody, or at least to married people with no children, that this Bill was to come into effect.  Now I am attacked by my predecessor for not making it retrospective.  This is a non-Party matter. I do not say that everything that the last Government did was right&mdash;far from it&mdash;but in this matter they thought it well to give due notice.</P>

      <P>It is a different question altogether.  Everyone knows how difficult it is.  I have known cases in the West of Ireland where people came back from other countries after a number of years and claimed their <Col N="1139" /> rights to the detriment of people who had been there all their lives.  They told the people who had been there all their lives that they were required to deposit a certain sum of money in court to cover the value they have got out of the land.  One finds these cases but this is not a Bill to deal with them.  This is a Bill simply to deal with a case where a man dies intestate leaving no children.  I think we have improved it very much by increasing the widows' share fourfold.  Also, half the residue which formerly went to the State will now go to the widow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  The Bill now before the Dáil is designed to complete the revision of the law which was begun when the Conditions of Employment Act was introduced here almost 20 years ago.  In fact, I might reveal now that at that time it was my intention to have one law dealing with the hours of work of industrial workers and the working conditions under which they were employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I worked upon the preparation of that one comprehensive Bill it became obvious to me that giving effect to that intention involved very considerable delay and, therefore, I decided then to divide the task into two parts.  One part was completed when the Conditions of Employment Act came into operation in February, 1936, and we are only completing the second part now.  The long delay which has taken place in the introduction of proposals for legislation to amend the Factories Acts was, in part, attributable to the complicated nature of the task and the pressure of other business at the time and, in part, to the intervention of a war period.  It was considered impracticable to enact new legislation of this kind at a time <Col N="1141" /> when scarcity of supplies and other difficulties might make it impossible for a factory owner to comply with its provisions.  I took up the matter of preparing this legislation again when I resumed office in 1951 and the Bill, a very long and intricate Bill as Deputies will have noticed, is now before the House.</P>
    <P>The existing Factories Acts in operation here were inherited from the British administration and they have worked on the whole reasonably well. This Bill introduces no radical change in principle.  I think it is well to state that straightway.  It is not intended to introduce any radical change in principle.</P>
    <P>The existing Factories Acts, as they stand, give to workers employed in industry a very high degree of protection against risks of accidents and of disease.  However, it has been recognised for many years that the revision of these Acts is necessary to bring them into line with modern ideas.  But when we got down to work it out, we found that the revisions which were necessary and practicable were not as far-reaching as has sometimes been suggested as necessary.  The enactment of this Bill will, however, have one very beneficial result in that it will bring into one statute all the obligations of factory owners.  The existing law is scattered round a number of enactments and regulations made under statutory authority.  This Bill not merely sets out to revise and improve the Factories Acts, but also to codify them.  It will, also, extend the protection of the law to types of employment to which the Factories Acts do not now apply.</P>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum was circulated to Deputies with the text of the Bill.  That memorandum sets out the provisions of the existing law and the respects in which that law will be changed if this Bill is enacted. Deputies who are interested in this legislation will, no doubt, have read that memorandum and I assume, therefore that a detailed explanation of these matters is not necessary at this stage.  I may say, however, that in framing the provisions of this Bill I <Col N="1142" /> had regard, first of all, to the requirements of various International Labour Office Conventions and recommendations which this country has not yet been able to ratify because of the conflict between the provisions of our legislation and the terms of these conventions and recommendations; secondly, to the Report of the Commission on Youth Unemployment which was published early in 1951 and which made various comments and recommendations on matters concerning the health and welfare of workers; and, thirdly, I had regard to the law in Britain which was amended in 1948. Up to recently, as I stated, both countries have been operating the same law.  The same standards and the same practices have, therefore, tended to develop and become established in both countries and amendments of the law deemed to be desirable in Britain are worthy of our consideration when we are amending the law here, notwithstanding the differences in the degree of industrial development in both countries.</P>
    <P>The principal changes which will be made in the Factories Acts under this Bill can be summarised under five main headings: First, health; second, safety; third, welfare; fourth, application; and fifth, administration.  The main changes which are proposed include a more precisely defined obligation on factory owners to keep factory premises clean and increase in the air space required per person employed from 250 to 400 cubic feet.  The Bill makes provisions for the delayed application of that new provision in relation to existing factories.  It gives the Minister for Industry and Commerce power to prescribe the standards of temperature to be maintained and it requires that there shall be sufficient and suitable light in all places where people are engaged upon industrial work.  The existing law makes no provision with regard to lighting at all. It is proposed that medical supervision may be required in a factory where there have been outbreaks of disease recorded or where the processes which are operated may be in any circumstances dangerous to the health of the workers engaged in them.  The requireter' <Col N="1143" /> ment of the existing law in regard to the medical examination of young people before entering industry, to establish their physical fitness for industrial employment, will be extended. The present law requires pre-entry medical examination before 16 years of age.  The new requirement will be pre-entry examination before 18 years of age and annual examination between 16 and 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>In respect to safety provisions, the Bill before the House makes much more precise the requirement of the existing law regarding the fencing of machinery and of moving parts of machinery.</P>
    <P>It gives power to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prescribe the compulsory use of approved safety devices.  It makes better provision for ensuring precautions against explosions, for structural stability of factory premises, and for the safety of hoists and lifting tackle generally.</P>
    <P>The fire-escape provisions are stated in much greater detail than in the existing law and are extended to cover smaller factories than are within the provisions of the existing law.  The use of unsuitable underground premises can be prohibited altogether.</P>
    <P>The welfare provisions of the Bill include the extension of requirements, which at present operate only in respect of certain factories, regarding drinking-water, washing facilities, accommodation for clothing, the provision of seats and first-aid equipment, to factories generally.  As regards the extension of the application of the Factories Acts, there is a number of changes: first, these Acts will in future apply to building operations generally; secondly, to works of engineering construction; thirdly, to the construction and repair of ships in wet dock, and, fourthly, will also protect young persons employed as messengers or porters about a factory and not directly engaged on industrial work. In respect to administration, the changes are, in some respects, of a detailed nature which may, perhaps, be more conveniently discussed in Committee.</P>
    <P>I might draw attention to this <Col N="1144" /> change, however, that while under the existing law specified duties are given to designated officials, such as the chief inspector of factories or factory inspectors, these powers in this Bill are being transferred to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That proposal is in accord with recent practice here.  Contrary to the British procedure, our practice is to give statutory obligations and powers to a Minister rather than to designated officials of the Minister, and, from the point of view of the Minister's responsibility to the Dáil, I think our procedure is the better.</P>
    <P>At present, local authorities are responsible for enforcing the provisions in the Factories Acts as regards the sanitary conditions in workshops.  Under the present law, there is a difference between a workshop and a factory.  A workshop is a premises in which no mechanical power is used.  The enforcement of sanitary regulations in workshops was the responsibility of the local authority.  This Bill proposes to abolish the distinction between a factory and a workshop, and, consequently, transfers to the Minister for Industry and Commerce the functions in regard to workshops previously discharged by local authorities.  Local authorities will, however, continue to exercise certain responsibility regarding sanitary conveniences and fire precautions.</P>
    <P>I said that, in preparing this Bill, I had in mind, first of all, the provisions of the International Labour Office Organisation Conventions, and, secondly, the report of the Commission of Youth Unemployment.  A very large number of International Labour Office Conventions have been ratified by the Irish Government because the existing law was in conformity with them, and ratification was possible.  Ratification is only possible where legal arrangements have been made in conformity with the requirements of the conventions; but there were some conventions which we were unable to ratify without making legislative changes here.  The first is the convention dealing with safety provisions in respect to building.  It was known as <Col N="1145" /> the Safety Provisions (Building) Convention, and proposed a code of safety for building operations.  The existing law is only of very limited application to building construction, but under this Bill the whole factory code has been extended to building undertaken by way of trade or business or for an industrial or commercial undertaking; and, after the enactment of this measure, the ratification of the International Labour Office Convention will be practicable.</P>
    <P>There is another International Labour Convention dealing with the medical examination of young persons &mdash;the Medical Examination of Young Persons (Industry) Convention.  In fact, that convention goes somewhat further than providing for the medical examination of young persons employed in industry.  It has always been a weakness in the International Labour Office practice to complicate their conventions by introducing some extraneous provisions which have deterred various States from ratifying them, because they found it impracticable or undesirable to bring their law into conformity with them.  So far as the International Labour Office Convention, to which I have referred, requires the medical examination of young persons employed in industry, this Bill will bring our law into complete conformity with the provisions of the convention.</P>
    <P>That convention also contains, however, provisions relating to the vocational guidance and the physical and vocational training of young persons who are regarded as unfit for employment in industry.  These are matters which are outside the scope of this Bill.  Whether the provisions in other enactments, for which other Ministers are responsible, are such as to permit of our ratifying that convention, following the enactment of this Bill, I cannot say at the moment.</P>
    <P>There was an International Labour Office recommendation concerning the health of workers in their places of employment.  So far as factory workers are concerned, the requirements of the recommendation are met in full by the provisions of this Bill. There is another convention which I <Col N="1146" /> might mention, although it is not very important nowadays, and that is the White Lead (Painting) Convention. That is the convention which prohibits the use of white lead in the internal painting of any building other than a railway station or an industrial establishment.  Our legislation does not deal with railway stations, and applies only to industrial premises. Consequently, it is still unlikely that we can ratify that convention, but, in fact, paints containing white lead or sulphate of lead are now rarely used for internal painting in this country.</P>
    <P>There is another convention to which I might refer, although its relevancy is equally doubtful, and that is the one dealing with maternity protection.  It seems to me that such a convention has not got much relevance to conditions in Ireland or to factory legislation either.  It is concerned more with the scope of social insurance or with public welfare schemes.  The existing law makes it an offence for an employer to employ a woman within four weeks of her confinement.  Under the Social Welfare Act, an insured woman worker becomes entitled to maternity benefit for a maximum period of 12 weeks but there is a condition in the Social Welfare Act that while in receipt of that maternity benefit she must not be gainfully employed.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Youth Unemployment, while it was mainly concerned with the specific problem on which it was asked to report, made some general comments, observations and suggestions on factory legislation to which we have given attention. They recommended that the law should be changed so as to raise from 14 to 16 the minimum age of entry into industry and quite clearly that recommendation was bound up with the recommendation that the school-leaving age should be raised to 16.  The present school-leaving age is 14, and that has not been changed.  The minimum age of entry into employment is 14 under a whole variety of statutes in force here.  I think it will be agreed that nothing can be done in the matter of altering the age of entry into industrial employment in advance of raising the school-leaving age.</P>
    <P>The commission made a number of <Col N="1147" /> recommendations concerning accommodation for clothing, facilities for drying clothes, the lighting of work places, and the supply of drinking water, all of which are covered by provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>They made recommendations concerning rest-rooms for female workers which can be met under Section 56 of the Bill which permits regulations to be made requiring the provision of rest-rooms.</P>
    <P>The commission also recommended the change which we are now proposing to make in regard to the medical examination of young persons entering industry.  But they went further and recommended that advice and treatment should be given to young persons who on examination were found to be in need of advice or treatment.  That is not a matter for factory legislation but for the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>In other respects the recommendations they made for the medical supervision of young persons are being fully met.  I should, perhaps, emphasise&mdash; because I am sure the fact will be raised on the debate&mdash;that this Bill is confined to factory workers.  The Commission on Youth Unemployment referred to what they regarded as the need for similar legislation applying to office workers, and similar representations have been received from trade unions catering for office workers.  The view is that office workers should also be given statutory protection in respect of such matters as overcrowding, ventilation, temperature, cleanliness and suitability of premises.  I do not think the Factories Act is the appropriate place to deal with office workers, and personally I would hesitate to propose such legislation until its possible consequences had been fully examined&mdash;its consequences upon employment as well as other things.  I would be apprehensive about the effect of such legislation until the whole position had been more fully investigated.</P>
    <P>One member of the Commission on Youth Unemployment&mdash;by himself and without the support of the other members&mdash;recommended that factory premises should be inspected and certified <Col N="1148" /> as suitable before being occupied and before any industrial work is allowed to be carried on in them.  I gave very careful consideration to the practicability of doing that, and I decided against it.  I dislike the prospect of some industrial enterprise being delayed by the necessity of getting a prior certificate of suitability from a factory inspector or from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It is almost certain allegations of undue delay would be made in any event.  It seems to me also that such a provision is of no great value, because in practice it would be almost impossible to proceed against an employer on the ground that he had commenced industrial operations in some suitable place that had not been certified and who was giving employment in accordance with the Act to some workers.</P>
    <P>The danger that employers would start operations in premises or under conditions which would not conform to the requirements of this Bill is not very great.  They must notify the Minister for Industry and Commerce within a month that operations have begun.  They know that they will then be subject to inspection and can be forced to comply with the requirements of the Act.  It is true that the recent British Act provides for the giving of notice of occupation in advance of the commencement of operations, but whatever considerations led the British Government to adopt that course, I, having given the matter consideration, decided that here at least the weight of argument is against it.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, appreciate that this Bill is primarily one for Commitee Stage discussion.  The principle of the Bill, which is to codify and improve the provisions of the existing Factory Acts, will not be contested by any Deputy in the House.  I propose to ask the Dáil to give the Bill a Second Reading now and postpone the Committee Stage discussion until after the Christmas recess.  That will give ample opportunity to all Deputies and to all interested organisations to study the provisions of the Bill very carefully and put forward proposals for its amendment.  I hope all organisations of factory owners and of workers employed <Col N="1149" /> in factories will give it very careful attention and send in their recommendations for the extension, improvement or amendment of the Bill.  When considering their recommendations they must bear in mind that there are two possible points of view regarding legislation of this kind. The first viewpoint will be that of those who desire that everything practical should be done to secure the safety and health of the workers employed in industrial operations, and the second will be that of those who desire to minimise the burdens placed by law on the operations of industry and who wish that reasonable liberty should be allowed to factory owners to run their own businesses.</P>
    <P>Both points of view have something to commend them and both will have to be taken into account here when the terms of the new legislation are being settled.  We have to keep in mind that the main Factories Act now in force has operated for a period of practically 50 years.  I think it is quite possible that whatever Act emerges from the Oireachtas as a result of our deliberations now may last another 50 years.  On that account I think we should take our time over it and ensure that we produce a measure that is both workable and reasonable.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that members of the R.I.C. who resigned from that force at the request of the First Dáil rendered meritorious service to the nation by so doing and requests the Government to consider the introduction of proposals for legislation to enable pensions to be paid to all such persons irrespective of the length of their service in the R.I.C. at the date of their resignation.</P>
      <P>That motion has been put down at the request of a body representing the few remaining members of a force of men who were members of the R.I.C. during the period prior to the Truce in 1921 and who resigned from that force or were dismissed from it by the British Government at that time because of their national outlook.  I understand that originally there were 1,000 persons affected and Dáil Éireann on three separate occasions passed legislation to deal with these resigned and dismissed members of the R.I.C.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under legislation that was passed nearly 600 had their national service recognised in one way or another, and there was left round about 400 whose services to the nation were not considered <Col N="1151" /> at the time worthy of recognition.  Men who had less than four years' service in the R.I.C. were debarred from pension; subsequently that was reduced in 1934 to less than three years' service.  As a result of that limitation round about 400 were eliminated.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are less than 30 of the affected men alive, and only within the last few days some of those who were instrumental in briefing me have themselves passed away.  There is, therefore, a very small number left but they are anxious that the Irish Parliament should recognise their services, because whether they served two years, three years, or four years the fact that they resigned as a protest or were dismissed because of their national activities or their suspected national outlook should commend them to this House.</P>
    <P>I think it may be accepted that we are always generous in recognition of services rendered to the country.  This small body of men showed their support for the national cause in a very practical way during those vital days in 1920 and the early part of 1921.  I think every Deputy would be anxious that the Minister should have the facts reconsidered now in the light of the knowledge that aproximately less than 30 of the men concerned are alive to-day.</P>
    <P>The moneys involved will be negligible, but the individuals concerned would like to have that practical recognition from the State.  I understand many Deputies are anxious to support this motion, and a recommendation to the Minister to have the case of this small number looked into at the earliest possible moment.  As time goes on we are, I think, inclined to put a more favourable construction on the services that were rendered in those days, a more favourable construction than we were inclined to put on them after 1921 and right up to 1932 or 1934. Time has mellowed the views of quite a number of us.  It would be a magnificent gesture if these men, who have been fighting their cause for almost 30 years, should now be given recognition by the State even at this late hour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> Undoubtedly &mdash; and this is well known to the Minister, to Deputies and to the country generally &mdash; very valuable national service was rendered by the men who served in the R.I.C. at that critical period in our history.  They showed their support of national ideals to the extent of being dismissed for them or of themselves resigning out of sympathy with the cause.  Not only will the Minister find that all these men rendered services of that particular kind but he will also discover that on leaving the force they supported the National Movement.  Many of them became members of the Volunteers.  Many of them became supporters of the Volunteers. Generally speaking, all of them rendered national service.  Though it was not sufficient to entitle them to the recognition contained in a certificate of military service under the Pensions Acts nevertheless, taken in conjunction with their previous action, it was such service as would, I think, entitle them to recognition at this stage.</P>
    <P>These cases were originally investigated by what was known as the Batt O'Connor Commission in 1923.  There were subsequent commissions in 1929 and 1934 but the result of the findings of these commissions was to leave out approximately 400 and it is that 400 that has dwindled down now to approximately 30.</P>
    <P>There is a debt due by the State to these men.  Their action at the time was very valuable from a national point of view.  It deserves public recognition.  As to what form that recognition would take, I do not want to say at the moment but I do think that the Minister ought to say that he would have the position reconsidered now.  If he does, he may find good grounds on which pensions should be paid to these particular individuals now.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of delaying the House in regard to this matter.  I understand that quite a number of Deputies are anxious to speak on the motion.  I certainly recommend it very strongly to the generous consideration of the House.</P>

      <P>I second the motion. There is no man in the House who knows more of the service given by these men than the present occupant of the front bench.  These men got certain guarantees and promises from the men who were active at that time. I remember the late Michael Collins promising the civil servants and members of the D.M.P. as well as the R.I.C. that any risk they took would not be forgotten by the State.  I hear that there are only 28 of these men alive now, some of them in great want. It would be a very handsome gesture and a generous action on the part of the State to give these men substantial grants, if they do not give them pensions.  These men are reaching an age that prevents them earning their own living.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the promises made, the men who took the risk should be rewarded.  Time has mellowed most of us, even those who may not have agreed in those days.  I am of the opinion that these men should not suffer hardship.  They should be recognised by the State which was established because men took risks.</P>
      <P>I have heard of individual cases, not only of men but of women, who are at present suffering very grave hardships and living in unhealthy surroundings in the City of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite clear to me what is envisaged by the mover of this motion.  I assume, from the wording of the motion, that a number of the people contemplated would be in receipt of pensions in respect of their service when they resigned from the R.I.C.  If that is so, members of the House would like to see the motion recast.  If the proposal was that these persons might qualify under some provision, such as the special allowances for medal-holders, if they are in bad health or unable to earn their livelihood, in the ordinary course, possibly, a good case could be made for them. I understand that quite a number of these people draw I.R.A. pensions.  A number of them would have qualified for service pensions under the Military Service Pensions Acts.</P>
      <P>I am rather at a loss to know the particular class that Deputy Cowan is endeavouring to benefit by this motion. It appears to me that the motion would cover a man who, possibly, had 15 or 20 years' service in the R.I.C. and who, therefore, would have qualified under their regulations at that time for the rather generous and substantial pensions that were provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I could express my view by vote on this motion I should like to know exactly the type of people the Deputy has in mind.  If they are people with a small number of years' service in the R.I.C., who resigned at the request of the First Dáil, I imagine that there would be very few of them left who are not provided for in some other way.  At this hour of the day, possibly a better way of dealing with the few people who are left would be to bring them within the benefits of the special allowances.  I would have great sympathy with men who were disabled in any way.  From the way this motion is drafted it is not clear as to the class that is in mind.  I had not an opportunity of listening to Deputy Cowan when he was speaking on the motion.  I should like to have more information before definitely committing myself one way or the other. It seems to me that the motion is much <Col N="1155" /> too wide in its present form to get my support as an individual in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years we in this House have heard a great deal about dismissed members of the R.I.C. and members of the R.I.C. who resigned. In the very first year of the State, 1922, a commission was set up to consider this matter and that commission made certain recommendations to the then Minister.  As a result, many allowances were paid.  On the change of Government, about 1934, another commission of inquiry was established by the House.  Recommendations were made.</P>
      <P>As a result of both commissions, many men who had established that they had resigned for patriotic motives and had suffered serious loss arising out of their resignations, got pensions and allowances.  I think it would be correct to say that those who had not three years' established service or who had less did not get any allowances. Whether it is for that section that Deputy Cowan is moving his motion I am not quite clear but I infer that it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion does not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion does not exactly say that but I assume it is, because those are the only sections after two commissions of inquiry examined carefully into each indidividual case and on hearing evidence reached certain conclusions.  It must be recognised also that there were representatives on each commission who had been closely connected with the national struggle at that time.  I believe that their recommendations would be tempered in favour of those who established that their resignation arose out of their national sympathies. I cannot see where there is any big grievance for the remainder of those who had less than three years' service. After all, 1916 took place, and we had a progressive effort from that date on to win the independence of this country, and where a young man saw fit to go into the R.I.C. after 1916 or 1917 it is very hard to imagine how they can establish that, even if they <Col N="1156" /> came out afterwards, their service arose for patriotic reasons alone.  I feel that way about it.  We all remember those years&mdash;a big number of us here remember them&mdash;when thousands of other young men gave of their best. I assume that if those men with less than three years' service joined the I.R.A. and served in the I.R.A. during the years up to the Truce of 1921, they could establish having military service under the Military Service Pensions Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any of them who joined were young men of military age and if they joined the R.I.C. after 1916 or 1917 and then resigned I assume that if they did it for patriotic motives they joined the I.R.A. then and that would be proof, if it was necessary, that they did resign for that purpose.  If they gave service in 1920 or 1921 they could establish military service, and, as Deputy Moran has pointed out, be entitled to military service pensions under the 1924 Act or the 1934 Act. Like ourselves and like most of those who took part in that time they are going on in years, and if they are broken down in health and entitled to service medals and to special allowances after having served in the I.R.A., even if they did not establish military service under the 1924 or the 1934 Act they would be entitled to special allowances, having broken down in health and being unable to earn their livelihood at the present time.  The House over the last 30 years having established two commissions of inquiry which contained men who had taken part in that effort at the time, my mind would be that the reports and recommendations they made to the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Justice, whoever was responsible&mdash; the Minister for Finance, I think it was&mdash;would have been accepted and as far as was humanly possible justice was done at the time both in 1924 and in 1934 to all those who had a reasonable case; and I doubt if those other young men who joined after 1916 or 1917 have much of a case.  We all felt at the time that men who joined the R.I.C. then were enemies of this country.  That was the feeling of the rank and file of the people, and if they <Col N="1157" /> came out afterwards and joined the I.R.A., well they took their place in the line with the Volunteers in this country who gave the same service as thousands of others and took their chance whether they got broken in health or in limb or otherwise, without hope of fee or reward for their service.</P>
    <P>I doubt if Deputy Cowan in introducing this motion has established any case.  We all have sympathy for those who served the nation and who lost their health or their means of livelihood.  There was always great sympathy in this House for that section, and if an outstanding case could be made at any time we would never lack sympathy in that direction. But different Governments set up those commissions of inquiry, and both Governments, it would appear, were sufficiently interested to set them up and have those investigations made; and, the Minister for Finance having honoured the recommendation made in each individual case, it is very hard to see at this stage what more could be done for the ones who were left out.  After all we had the Military Services Pensions Act for I.R.A. men who served the country, and many thousands of those who did give service, outstanding service, in many directions to the nation, in the Volunteers, in the Republican Army of the time, failed to establish their right to service pensions.  That is going on still.  There will be many thousands of those men who we all know did give a big lot of service but will be unable under any possible code and with the best will in the world from everyone to establish their right to military service pensions.  I take it that those R.I.C. who resigned at that time failed to establish that they were persons who came within the code or within the Act as it was passed at the time.  That is my opinion about the whole thing, and I do not think there is anyone in this House or any group in the slightest degree hostile to those men.  We would be quite willing to help them.  If the right was established to get help at State expense it would be forthcoming.  It is now, I suppose, 35, 36 or 37 years since the events of that time, and the fact that it was taken up so early <Col N="1158" /> after 1922 and that those commissions of inquiry were held showed that there was ample opportunity and ample evidence available fresh in people's minds to establish the motives that influenced them to leave that force at the time.  I have not a bit of doubt about that.</P>
    <P>For that reason I cannot see how Deputy Cowan can or could hope to have a motion like he has proposed passed and the whole thing opened up again.  I am sure that he has probed into this matter fully and that he realises the efforts that have been made by Dáil Éireann over the last 30 years to do justice to individuals and groups of individuals who were in the R.I.C. at that time and claim to have served the nation afterwards.  I am sure that if he gives it further consideration he will not pursue that motion any further.  There is nothing more I have to say on this matter but that I am satisfied in my own mind that anyone who examines it will be convinced that members of the Governments here over the last 30 years did what they could to ensure that no one who had a good case was left out or was not fairly treated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of the country and the representatives of the people were very grateful to the men who had been in the R.I.C. prior to 1916 and who, when the revolution started, resigned their posts in that <Col N="1159" /> British organisation and helped the people to get rid of foreign occupation in this part of the country.  Round 1919 an appeal was made to them by the Dáil or the Sinn Féin organisation to throw off their uniforms and to go out and join the forces of the country fighting for freedom at that time.  In 1922 a committee was set up consisting of three men who were sympathetic to any of the applicants who could prove to their satisfaction that they had resigned from political motives or motives of sympathy with the national cause.  They were also sympathetic, of course, to such members of the R.I.C. as were dismissed by the British Government because they displayed sympathy with the national cause.  The first committee, the committee of 1922, which went into this matter had before them in all 1,136 applications and they recommended awards to 631 of these applicants.  Their terms of reference were to go into all these applications and make a recommendation to the Minister for Finance of the time.  The recommendations they made were accepted by the Minister and pensions were granted.</P>
      <P>In 1934 another committee was set up to review the cases of those who had been turned down by the 1922 committee.  Again that committee was manned by people who were sympathetic to any member of the R.I.C. who had resigned or who was dismissed for political reasons.  They examined each case very thoroughly.  They had before them 330 applications.  The original committee had 1,136 and they recommended awards to 631.  About half of those who had been turned down in 1922 appealed to the 1934 committee. Going into these 330 cases, the 1934 committee found that 115 were outside their terms of reference&mdash;I shall explain that term shortly&mdash;and they gave awards to an extra 50.  So we have the situation that of all the members of the R.I.C. who had resigned during the Black and Tan War or who were dismissed and who came before the committees about half of them had their applications accepted and got pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1934 the present Minister for <Col N="1160" /> Finance was Minister for Finance also, and he included in the terms of reference to the committee a direction that no claim should be entertained in respect of any ex-member of the R.I.C. who had completed less than three years' service before his resignation or dismissal.  Now, we can see the reason for that; Deputy Allen alluded to it.  When the 1916 revolution occurred, most of the people of the country revolted against the action the British Government took to suppress that revolution and to punish the leaders, and it was felt that if a man joined the R.I.C. after 1916 it would be very hard to prove that his resignation within a few years was due to political motives.  That was the reason for imposing a limit of three years.  The 1934 committee when presenting their report to the Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In a case where an applicant has joined the Constabulary after Easter Week, 1916 and had little more than the minimum three years' service, the committee required the clearest evidence of the applicant's national sympathy before deciding to report favourably.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The fact is that no Minister for Finance has been prepared over all these years to issue the necessary certificate for the grant of a pension to men who served in the constabulary for less than three years.  Deputy Allen pointed out that there are large numbers of people all over the country, indeed the majority in one way or another, who gave service to the cause at that time.  Very few of them gave service of the nature required to qualify for a pension under the Military Service Pensions Act.</P>
    <P>In 1946 or thereabouts the present Minister for Defence introduced legislation to secure that men who had given service in the Volunteers of a type that did not qualify for an active service medal, even though they had not the active service required for a pension, would be taken care of if they fell ill if they could prove that they had such service.  No one can say that was ungenerous.  Indeed, I do not know of any country after a revolution or a war which has made such provision <Col N="1161" /> for those who fought in the revolution or in the war, or who served without having been on active service, as this country has.</P>
    <P>Over the years, we have paid many millions of pounds.  Governments always find it hard to get money.  They incur certain opposition when they propose taxation, but no Government here has refused to take the responsibility of proposing the taxes necessary to provide for the military service pensions, or the special provision made for the members who fall ill and who are unable to work, or for those members of the R.I.C. who proved their case either to the committee in 1922 or to the committee in 1934.</P>
    <P>It is not because of the money involved that any Government refused to grant those pensions.  All the Governments were anxious to make provision for those members of the R.I.C. who were able to convince either of these committees that they had a case.  The Governments were sympathetic to the applicants and were prepared to make the money available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan stated that we are inclined as the years go on to put a very favourable construction on the services rendered in those days.  That is true.  But we cannot allow our sympathy for the case of any individual at the moment to draw us back to reopening and rehearing the cases 30 years after the events, when evidence is becoming difficult to collect and when recollections of the events of these times are getting somewhat dim in the memory of any possible witnesses.</P>
    <P>The committee in 1922 held their sessions, made their inquiries and examined the witnesses within a few years after the applicants had resigned or been dismissed.  They were in a position at that time to collect evidence from people who could be depended upon reasonably to remember the events of those days.  It would be very difficult at the present time, even if we were convinced that there was some merit in Deputy Cowan's proposition, to get reliable evidence.  I agree with what Deputy Cowan said, that very valuable service was rendered by a <Col N="1162" /> number of the men who were in the R.I.C. in those days and who resigned or were dismissed and that has been recognised by the State in the provisions made for the pensioners who proved their cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan's motion asks that legislation be introduced to deal with this matter.  He requests the Government to consider the introduction of proposals for legislation to enable pensions to be paid to all these applicants.  The fact is that, if the matter were to be reopened, no legislation would be necessary.</P>
    <P>Legislation was passed in 1923 which enabled the Minister for Finance in 1934 to review these cases.  All these applications were dealt with both in 1923 and again in 1934 under Section 5, sub-section (1), of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, and that subsection reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister for Finance may from time to time by Order authorise the grant of pensions, allowances or gratuities to persons who resigned or were dismissed from the R.I.C. on or after the 1st day of April, 1916, and before the 6th day of December, 1921, and whose resignations or dismissals from that force are certified under the hands of the Ministers for Home Affairs and Finance to have been caused by their national sympathies, and may by any such Order regulate and appoint the rates and scales of such pensions, allowances, or gratuities, and the conditions under which the same are to be payable, and may by any such Order prescribe the penalties for any fraudulent conduct in relation to an application for any such pension, allowance, or gratuity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Orders that have been made under that section from time to time do not specify any minimum period of service for a pension.  The refusal of pensions has been the result of Ministerial policy.  I have pointed out that the two committees of inquiry, one appointed in 1922 and the other in 1934, were asked to report favourably in cases in which they considered the resignations and dismissals were caused by the national sympathies of <Col N="1163" /> the resigned or dismissed men.  There were no instructions issued to the committee in 1922 that any differentiation should be made in their report based on the length of service of the applicants, but when their report came to the Department of Finance at that time it was decided that no pension would be awarded to a former member of the R.I.C. who resigned between 1919 and 1921, the years of the Black and Tan war, whose service amounted to less than four years, and no former members, with less than three and a half years' service, were granted a pension.</P>
    <P>The differentiation that was made by the Minister at that time was made on the basis of the discretion which was allowed to him under the Act, and he was not obliged to grant a pension in any case, but he did take a decision to grant a pension where a favourable report was made and the applicant had more than four years' service in the R.I.C.  Four years, of course, would have meant that the applicant concerned had joined before 1916 and before the revolution at that time started.</P>
    <P>When it came to 1934, when there was a great deal of agitation to review these cases, the Minister for Finance of that time appointed another sympathetic committee to go into the matter, but he did give them as terms of reference that they were not to consider the case of any man who had less than three years' service in the R.I.C. It was, as a result of that direction to the committee, that they turned down as being outside their terms of reference 115 of the 330 applicants, but they did grant awards to a further 50 applicants.  When one takes into account the circumstances of the time in which these men resigned and when one takes into consideration that the group of which this motion speaks joined tht R.I.C. after 1916, I think no one can say that either of the committees approached their work other than with sympathy or that they had any bias against the applicants who had asked to have their cases looked into.  Indeed, I think that in all the circumstances any person from outside who examines this matter will <Col N="1164" /> say that the members of both these committees must have been extremely sympathetic when they granted pensions to more than half the applicants.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan seems to be basing the case in this particular motion on a wrong assumption, and that is that legislation would be required in order to review these pensions.  Legislation would not be required.  I do not think that any Minister for Finance could be more sympathetic than the present Minister for Finance, and in what he would regard as legitimate cases I do not think that any Minister for Finance would be more generous in a directive to a new committee, if it were set up, than the present Minister for Finance was in his terms of reference to the committee in 1934 when he reduced the standards and the period of service from four years, as it had been under the committee of 1922, to three years.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I doubt if we went to the rounds of appointing another committee 30 years after the event and nearly 20 years after the appointment of the committee that reviewed the cases in 1934&mdash;if we picked at random, from all sides of the House, a committee of three or six or any other number&mdash;that their report would be in any way different from the reports of the two committees that reviewed the cases in 1922 and 1934.  I think that Deputy Cowan introduced this motion because he thought that legislation would be necessary.  It would not be necessary.</P>
    <P>I think it would we unwise for the Dáil, if another motion were put down, a motion asking the Minister for Finance to set up a new committee, to vote for such a motion.  The present motion, in any event, is unnecessary. If a motion to set up a new committee were before the Dáil, I feel that most members would feel like myself about it, and that is that there must be finality to these reviews at some time or another, and that we here, so long after the event, are not in a position to deal any more generously or to give any more favourable consideration to these cases than that which was given to them by the two committees in 1922 and 1934.</P>

      <P>I was particularly <Col N="1165" /> interested in this motion for a number of reasons.  I was glad to hear the Minister speaking before I attempted to say anything on it.  As one of the new members of the House I would not have had the experience which the Minister obviously has and, in fact, I was not aware of the different attempts made at different times to appease the grievances of these people throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Since my election to the Dáil I received a good many representations from members who claimed to have very good cases and who, so far as I was concerned, were able to put forward very impressive cases which I thought would command any special attention which any Government could give.  But in view of what the Minister has said and particularly in view of his statement regarding the question of legislation&mdash;that it is not necessary to have legislation introduced to cover these cases at all&mdash;I do not really see that I can be as enthusiastic about the motion as I might have been.</P>
      <P>I do know that the activities of certain members of that force during those years were such as to cast the position of those who are in the category we are discussing now into contrast with those who remained in the force loyal to the Crown, and to put them in a very favourable light indeed.  I would be inclined to be very sympathetic to any member of that body who at any stage in the fight for freedom came out in sympathy with the comparatively few people who were making the struggle at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But when one considers the statements made now by the Minister, a point which did not strike me forcibly if at all, until now, is the question of those who joined after 1916.  It is indeed difficult to see how those men could have any good, sound grounds to establish a just claim to any reward even though they relinquished their service as they claimed in sympathy with the national movement at that time.  The fact that they joined after the Insurrection of 1916 would indicate that their sympathies were not so much with those who had initiated that movement, and it is doubtful and I could easily see it would be very <Col N="1166" /> difficult for those to make a case for any reward as a result of any action no matter what it might have been after that.</P>
    <P>We all realise that many of these men were of inestimable value to the movement at that time.  They were just as valuable as other members were destructive.  Without the services of these men on the side of the Crown it would perhaps have been impossible for strangers fighting in another country to meet with any success. They became the eyes and ears of the enemy and in view of that, those of them who were big enough and brave enough to come out in sympathy with the movement, particularly those who took an active part in the movement after relinquishing their service, would at all times deserve any consideration any Government could give them.</P>
    <P>Two committees were set up, as the Minister pointed out, and these have carefully sifted all the information available to them and no doubt they must have had some good reason for not meeting all the case that came before them at the time.  I can easily see Deputy Captain Cowan's point that as time goes on we can see these men's cases and the whole position in a different perspective but I can also see the Minister's case when he says that as time goes on it is more difficult to establish facts.  Many of those who might be in a position to verify facts have passed away.  Many of the circumstances surrounding the cases have become so obscure that it would hardly be possible to verify things that could have been easily verified when the actions were fresh in the minds of the people and which could have been dealt with by the original committee.</P>
    <P>There is something to be said for Captain Cowan's remark that as time goes on we shall see these men's cases in a new perspective.  At least time does give us the opportunity to appreciate more fully the worth of the services they rendered, even those who relinquished their service and abandoned the force and did not become what one might term &ldquo;active&rdquo; in the I.R.A. movement afterwards.  A great many of them did become most useful <Col N="1167" /> members in the guerilla tactics which were being pursued at the time.  Others remained inactive but were helpful in the matter of intelligence.  Since legislation is not necessary to have their cases examined as to what reward may be due to them, since such legislation as is asked for in this motion is not necessary, it might be possible for the Minister at some stage to examine the question and ascertain if any injustice has been done by the actions of the previous committees. Some 1,500 cases were dealt with, but it must be remembered that a large number of that 1,500 did not succeed, and one can easily visualise the position of a man who had remained in the R.I.C. at the time.  He would now be in receipt of a rather generous pension.  One can visualise the position, then, of those who did not, as a result of their action, qualify for such pension and subsequently failed to qualify for any reward, pension or remuneration whatever from the native Government in this country.  Those people, too, no doubt, find themselves in a rather peculiar position, and it is only natural to expect that they would be anxious to have their cases reviewed.  As I said, I have had a number of such cases. I have had people putting their grievances before me, grievances that I believed were well founded.  However, as a result of what the Minister has said, I have learned a good deal with regard to the attempt that was made in the past to meet all the cases that came before the two committees set up to sift the evidence.  The Minister has said that finality has to be reached at some stage in all these things, but I would be rather sorry to think that finality has been reached in this particular matter.  We know that legislation is not necessary and it should be possible, therefore, at some stage to re-examine these cases in order to ascertain if an injustice has been done.</P>
    <P>I would be anxious to learn if the particular cases that were put before me came before either of these committees.  If they did go before those committees, what was the result? There was a right of appeal.  I can <Col N="1168" /> hardly believe that any ex-member of the R.I.C. would have neglected to have his case examined by one or other of these committees.  If they did neglect to put their cases before these committees and have them examined it would be very difficult for them at this stage to satisfy another committee or investigating body that they really have a claim.  We must take it, then, that these people had their claims investigated and possibly appealed. Alternatively, if they did not do that they must not have gone before the committees at all, and their case for recognition at this stage would be a rather weak one.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that there is a number of people who failed to qualify for an R.I.C. pension, the kind of pension that many of their comrades are enjoying who served until they were disbanded.  There are others who not merely were entitled to a pension owing to relinquishing their posts but also failed to qualify under any legislation enacted by our own Government.  These people have a genuine claim.  They have a grievance.  Perhaps a small number resigned at the time and are not able to prove that their action was prompted by sympathy with the movement.  Possibly there are some whose subsequent actions did not justify their claim being listed amongst those successful in securing pensions.  Whether that is so or not, as the Minister has pointed out, the number in that category is comparatively small.  Probably there are some genuine cases and it may be possible to have these cases investigated again with a view to ascertaining whether or not there is a grievance.</P>
    <P>As I said, I was particularly interested in this motion because of the number of cases that have been put to me.  Only a month ago, I wrote to the Minister asking if it would be possible to have these cases reviewed.  I gave a few examples and I asked him to let me know the facts.  Some who took an active part in the movement after resigning from the R.I.C. qualified for pension under the Military Service Pensions Acts.  Others, who relinquished their posts in sympathy with the movement, did not subsequently <Col N="1169" /> take an active part in that movement, and possibly it is difficult to draw the line as to where one should stop.</P>
    <P>I am genuinely in sympathy with those who may have a genuine claim and whose cases deserve further consideration, but I would be interested to know whether those who are seeking redress would come into the category of those who did not ask to have their cases reviewed by either of the commitees set up for that purpose.  We have a certain amount of sympathy with those we know are genuinely aggrieved.  Legislation is not necessary in this particular matter and, bearing that in mind and the fact that the number is small, I would like to know if the Minister will consider at some stage reviewing any cases that yet remain to be dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years we have had to deal with a variety of claims for pensions from people directly or indirectly associated with the fight for freedom.  People lay claim to pensions because of actions of the most tenuous nature and I think that many are now depending rather on the compassion of the Government than on any real concrete basis.  I believe that the people on whose behalf Deputy Cowan has put down this motion come within that particular classification.  He is not quite clear about the type of person for whom he wants to legislate but it would appear that he is pleading a case for those who had only three years' service in the R.I.C., before resigning from that body at the request of the First Dáil.  It is probably fair to say that people with only that service joined the R.I.C. at a time when such joining would be a sign of lack of sympathy with the national movement. While at this time we may have compassion for the present position of these people, it is quite clear that the earlier commissions set up to examine their cases regarded these people as not acting for nationalistic motives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Cowan made a good enough case or gave sufficient information.  I would be very interested to know the career of this particular group of men after they had resigned from the constabulary.  At <Col N="1170" /> that time they were young men, fit men, and there was a fight on in this country.  If they took part in that fight then they are already provided for in the Pensions Acts.  If they did not take part in that fight, presumably, they went into other employment and did not suffer hardship such as one might conjure up when picturing a man resigning from a job which was his only source of income.</P>
    <P>The wording of the motion would give the impression that we are discussing all these people who resigned.  It is difficult, therefore, to criticise the people on whose behalf the motion is put down without seeming to criticise the long established officer or constable who resigned his post at great personal loss.  I am satisfied that the earlier commissions were sympathetic towards all these people because nobody could be other than sympathetic towards the people in the Constabulary at that time who fell in with the movement for independence. Apart from the loss of livelihood, these men had a very big decision to make.  Those who were established in the Constabulary must have found it much more difficult to take the side of the rebels than it would have been for a man who had not been on the side of law and order before that. Such considerations would have been very lively in the minds of the members of the commission who examined these claims and I doubt if they overlooked the claims of such men.</P>
    <P>The motion calls for legislation, which is not necessary.  It would be possible for the Minister for Finance to question again the possibility of giving pensions to men who were overlooked at that time.  There are others who had connections with the national movement much less tenuous than the connections of these men who joined the R.I.C. and almost immediately resigned from it.  There are people who were not directly active in the fight for independence but who so aided those who were active that they are far more deserving of our consideration, if we do continue to supply pensions to everybody connected in any way with the movement.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that Deputy Cowan should press this motion.  He has no <Col N="1171" /> basis for it since it calls for legislation which is already in existence. But, if there should be among those people anybody who now suffers grave hardship as a result of his resignation from the R.I.C., I am sure nobody in this House would wish that his case should be overlooked.  In a private way, without setting up any big machinery, the Minister could further investigate the claims of these people. It is hardly necessary to have a discussion in this House.  We all have acquaintances who resigned from the R.I.C. and who felt that by doing so they served well and who now feel that the country is not doing right by them.</P>
    <P>As a State, we are more generous to those who served our country in so far as we are able to be than other countries are with people in a similar position.  I suggest to Deputy Cowan that he should withdraw the motion and that he should ask the Minister privately to make his own investigations to ensure that anybody who deserves, not our compassion, but our justice, for what he has done, anybody who has served the cause of Irish freedom should not suffer now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Representations have been made to me also on behalf of these men.  Our sympathy goes out to them.  I was interested in their case but, having heard the Minister pointing out the difficulty of reopening this matter and saying that legislation is not necessary, I am convinced that Deputy Cowan would be well advised to withdraw the motion and to ask the Minister to ensure by some other means that no injustice has been done to any of these men.</P>
      <P>A short time ago a very peculiar case came to my notice.  I received a letter from a constituent who was Battalion O/C in County Sligo informing me that on the instructions of the then Dáil he wrote to a young man who was a neighbour of his and asked him to resign from the R.I.C. I want to say in passing that I believe this young man did join the R.I.C. after 1916.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be prepared to go as far <Col N="1172" /> as some Deputies went to-night in that connection.  We must remember that at that period we were in the throes of a European war.  We must remember that in this country men who up to that time had been our leaders were asking the young men of this country to join the English army.</P>
    <P>Many a young man joined the English army and many another young man joined the R.I.C., as he thought, as a police force, and it was only when they were in and found the work they were expected to do that they realised their position.  This man whom I am telling you about who resigned and came home at the invitation of the battalion commander of the I.R.A., joined the I.R.A.&mdash;I am not sure of the date&mdash;and served until the Truce.  He was reared in an out-of-the-way place in the country, and during this period he was left on his own.  While he was in the R.I.C. his mother died and she was the only relative he had in the world.  After the Truce, upon the outbreak of the civil war, when he saw the position he cleared out to America like many another young Irishman.  I do not know whether this man's case ever came before any of the commissions.  I do not believe it did; but he now finds himself after all those years, after resigning a good job, looking at men who stuck on in the R.I.C. drawing pensions while he finds himself neglected and forgotten.  This man who asked him to resign feels that he is responsible for his position, and I may tell you that he feels very sore about it, and had written me some very sore letters.  I know the difficulties in this case.  I can see the position of the Minister and of the Government, that after 30 years it would be difficult to start the whole thing over again, and that it would be practically impossible to get proper evidence, but I would like to be satisfied that there is no injustice done to any of those men through no fault of their own, being away in America.  This man did not have an opportunity of making his case, and I was just wondering while the Minister was speaking if the recommendations of the commissions were still in existence or if this man and others like him could still put their cases before the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> The motion as it stands asking for legislation is not necessary, but if there are cases like this, as I am sure there may be, I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to receive representations on their behalf?  Deputy Moran in the course of his speech suggested that these men who resigned and who served in the I.R.A. were debarred from receiving a pension because they did not take part in a major action during their term with the I.R.A., but on the other hand they are now eligible, owing to recent legislation, if they are in receipt of a medal, to receive a special allowance.</P>

      <P>While this young man I mentioned had activity he had no major engagement, and for that reason he was debarred from receiving a pension, but resigning from the R.I.C. and joining with the I.R.A., and serving with them for a number of years would, I think, entitle him to a service medal. I do not think that the Minister, or any member of this House, would like to think that after all those years that man would now be badly in want and broken in health.  He will say to the man who asked him to resign: &ldquo;Well, only for you I would now be drawing a good pension and I would be independent."  I think that figures have been given here to-night that there are only 28 men now left out.  If there are any special cases like that I would ask Deputy Cowan if he was here to withdraw this motion and to appeal to the Minister, even at this late hour, that it was the desire of the members of this House if they knew any injustice was done that these men should be brought under a scheme for special allowances.  That is all I have to say. I think the motion as it stands is not necessary.  Deputy Cowan deserves the thanks of this House for giving an opportunity of discussing these things and of airing the grievances of any men who think they have a grievance.</P>

      <P>I would like to join with the other Deputies in having this <Col N="1174" /> matter dealt with sympathetically.  I am aware of a few cases where the men in my opinion were very harshly treated, and I think that through no fault of their own the commission of inquiry at that time could have done better for them.  At the same time I have in mind men in other organisations who were also harshly treated in my opinion&mdash;the I.R.A. men who lost out under the various Pensions Acts, and who simply because of some technical point in regard to the interpretation of "active service" at one period or another were deprived of their right to a pension.</P>

      <P>I know that the Government have done their utmost, and that all Governments have tried to do their utmost to be fair to all concerned. The plea that I would make would be that Deputy Cowan would withdraw this motion asking for legislation.  In my opinion there is no necessity for it. The Minister for Finance has stated that commissions of inquiry have been held, and it is a matter that cannot be dealt with by further legislation.  The plea that I would make in the circumstances is that the Minister and the Government should consider cases where it can be proved beyond doubt that the R.I.C. men&mdash;and they are very few, in my opinion&mdash;who lost out their cases should again be dealt with and reconsidered at least, and side by side with them, with that type of case, I would also appeal to the Minister if it were possible to deal with men who served in the I.R.A., and who, like the men I have referred to, lost out through one reason or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appealed some time ago to the Minister for Defence on behalf of a man who served in the Munster Fusiliers and who came back to fight with the I.R.A., but simply because he was not in the district at the particular time when a major engagement took place&mdash;it was during the Black and Tan period&mdash;he was debarred from receiving a pension.  In my opinion, he was justly entitled to it, but once the decision of the Referee was arrived at his case <Col N="1175" /> could not be reconsidered.  I still believe that something should be done for cases of that type.  The same remarks apply to a few of the men covered by Deputy Cowan's motion.  I am aware of the case of one man from County Kerry who served in Galway. This man was transferred to different areas, but through lack of evidence from the officers concerned, there was a missing link, if you like.  There was no continuing evidence to show that he had resigned at a certain period, and his application was rejected.  He is now in very poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>I think the suggestion made by Deputy Gilbride, that we should appeal to the Minister again in particular cases is a very good one.  There may still be a way out of the difficulty.  I realise that the Government have done their utmost in their efforts to be just to all citizens of the country, particularly to members of the I.R.A.  However, as in other countries, there are bound to be harsh decisions sometimes which are the fault of nobody in particular but which generally arise because of the different interpretations put upon the Pensions Act.  I believe that this motion, taking everything into consideration will serve a useful purpose in so far as it will direct the attention of the Government to cases of the type which have been mentioned.  Everyone here is in sympathy with these cases.  I hope something can be done, at least to have them reviewed and to see that justice is done to the applicants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the various Deputies who spoke to this motion, I think that the I.R.A. and the services rendered by them should not be coupled with the motion at all and that we should deal with the motion on its own merits solely.  We have been informed by the Minister for Finance that previous Governments in this country set up two commissions, one in 1922-23 and another in 1934, to deal with this matter of former members of the R.I.C. who resigned at the request of the First Dáil or because of pressure brought to bear on them.  I come from an area which is in close proximity to <Col N="1176" /> a district where one of the biggest mass resignations took place during that period.  Many Deputies may remember when Divisional Commissioner Smith came down to Listowel. At that time his instructions and his advice to the R.I.C. were somewhat similar to that which we read of in the papers the other evening as being given by a particular British officer to his men out in Africa.  That officer gave instructions to his subordinates to shoot at whomsoever they liked, provided they were black men.  Divisional Commissioner Smith came to Listowel and his instructions to members of the R.I.C. who were mobilised and paraded at that centre, were to go out, at night singly to the cross-roads, remain inside ditches, listen to conversations and without giving an order or a command to halt, to shoot with effect at anybody who came along.  Evidently it was hoped that, especially in North Kerry and the areas adjoining, amongst the young men who might receive the fatal bullets, there would be a large number of Volunteers or men associated with the Sinn Féin movement.  To their credit be it said, over 20 men who listened to that address in the barrack square immediately downed their arms. They were placed under open arrest but eventually at great risk and great peril to their lives they got out of the force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The one objection I have to the findings of the commissions in 1922-23 and 1934 is that these men were not treated equally favourably with the men who served with the British Forces up to the 11th July, 1921.  I have in my native town one of the men who came out at that period.  After he came out, he gave service to the I.R.A., not possibly sufficiently active to come within the category which Deputy Flynn mentioned.  He might not have the chance of taking part in a major engagement but still he served with us until 11th July, 1921, and rendered us great service.  We had another case in North Kerry of an R.I.C. sergeant <Col N="1177" /> who arranged with the boys in County Clare to hand them over a police barrack.  He was also from my area.  He and the men who resigned in Listowel were very badly and poorly treated by successive Governments we have had in this country.</P>
      <P>We have, thank God, as a result of the agitation carried on by the Fianna Fáil Administration, cast back on the British Government the onus for the payment of the R.I.C. pensions. They now hold themselves responsible for the payment of the pensions to the men who served them loyally during that period.  I think it is particularly unfair to the men I have mentioned who resigned, that neither of the Governments here brought the pensions payable to them up to the standard of the pensions payable by the British to men who served the British Forces in this country up to 11th July, 1921.  At the same time, I think it is not fair to try to couple this motion with I.R.A. activities.  I can see no analogy between the services rendered by the I.R.A. and the services rendered by men who resigned in sympathy with the Volunteer movement and the Republican movement at that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would support this motion of Deputy Cowan's in so far as it recognises that the Minister and the Goveernment already have powers to deal with the matter, as they already have given pensions to men who had served in the R.I.C. for longer than three years.  I think it was very unfair of the commissions to isolate or ostracise men who, possibly through no fault of their own, in the period between 1916 and 1919, just because they did not recognise the seriousness of their action, joined the R.I.C.  I have had personal experience during that period when in the I.R.A. of visiting the homes of some of these men in West Limerick and I say this to the credit of their parents, that when the position was put before them they had no hesitation in writing to their sons to get them to resign from the R.I.C.  In at least six cases that I know of men who had served one and a half years or two years, and some of them possibly only six or nine months in the <Col N="1178" /> R.I.C., resigned in support of us.  I believe it was drawing the line very fine that these commissions who reported on these cases did not give some recognition to these men for the service they rendered in resigning at that time from the R.I.C.</P>
    <P>Although Auxiliaries and Black and Tans were brought into this country we all know it was the R.I.C. who hunted down and spied on the Volunteers and led the others to the homes that were destroyed.  The men who remained in the R.I.C. were men who did their utmost to cripple the Volunteer movement by leading the onslaught of the Auxiliaries and Black and Tans on the homes of the Volunteers and our supporters.  We are dealing now with about 100, or maybe 120, men who came out of the R.I.C. at that time when requested.</P>
    <P>We find that the commissions in 1922 and 1934 did not consider these men worthy of being given some little bit of recognition.  I therefore ask the Minister for Finance and the Government to reconsider the position even after 30 long years.  They have some statutory provision by which they can give some consideration to these men whom, I am sure, Deputy Cowan had in mind when tabling this motion.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Cowan is not in the House at the moment but, with my colleague Deputy Gilbride, I would ask him to withdraw the motion and leave the matter to the Government and to this House, composed as it is of all Parties, who I am sure will give sympathetic consideration to the handful of men whose cases we are now discussing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather at a disadvantage in regard to this matter.  I realise that many of the Deputies spoke from their own personal experience during the years in question of the force known as the R.I.C. However, during my short period here I have had brought to my notice on very many occasions the claims of a few men who come into the category of those referred to in this motion.  Not knowing very much of the events of that time, their cases appear to me to be sound and in at least some cases <Col N="1179" /> they appear to have a grievance.  Some of the things I have heard to-night have cleared my mind at any rate.  The commissions set up in 1922 and 1934 were empowered to hear and report on the cases of all applicants for pensions who had resigned or were dismissed from the R.I.C. at that time.  I gather that possibly all these cases were gone into fairly well.  Despite that, there are still a number of cases, not very many possibly, in which probably a mistake was made.  The number of cases outstanding in which applicants have a grievance is not numerous. Under the system of Government which we have, when there are not a great many people who are complainants, very often it is not true to say that justice is always done or done as expeditiously as it might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>References were made to-night to the question of resignation between the years 1916 and 1921 and the fact that unless there had been a minimum service of approximately three and a half years prior to resignation very little could be done for such people, and that in fact nothing was really done for them.  There is, perhaps, some basis for the suggestion that it is rather difficult to understand how men came to join the R.I.C. after 1916 and within three and a half years decided to resign for political reasons.  It occurs to me that possibly there may be something wrong about that.  I wonder would the circumstances of these particular people and the environment in which they were brought up have had anything to do with that.  Possibly these men were very young and, due to their environment and their circumstances, they were not fully aware of the true position at that time and it was only when they became members of the force and were asked to partake in some of the brutalities perpetrated that they realised it was their own flesh and blood, their own people, to whom they were actually causing suffering and hardship and as a result of that and their more mature years they thought that they should get out of the force.  That is one point of view which can be put forward in <Col N="1180" /> extenuation of those who joined after 1916 and subsequently resigned.</P>
    <P>There is another point of view, of course.  The older men in this House are in a much better position to know the full facts than I am.  But it occurs to me that possibly some of these men who joined after 1916 did so because they felt that the revolution or the rebellion in this country had been put down and would not occur again, but later it became evident to them that it was a dangerous thing to be in the R.I.C., and for that reason they got out.  That is the other side of the picture.  As I say, I do not feel competent in any way to come to a decision with regard to these matters. But if there are, as I believe there may be, some men who resigned or were dismissed at that time and who did not have the requisite service subsequent to their joining after 1916, then, as no legislation is necessary, I think that something should be done for them.</P>
