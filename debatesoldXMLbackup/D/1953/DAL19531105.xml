      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has received, as head of the Government, a request from the anti-Partition elected members to enter Dáil Éireann; and if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>A request has been conveyed to me to receive a deputation of certain members recently elected in the Six-County General Election.</P>
      <P>As regards the position of the Government in relation to the admission of Six-County representatives to Dáil Éireann, there is nothing that I can add to the reply given to a question that was addressed to me in this House on the matter on the 9th December last.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that the case for anti-Partition could be very much assisted by the first-hand information which these elected representatives from the Six Counties could undoubtedly give to the Dáil?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. That is only one aspect of the matter. There are other aspects which would have to be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Taoiseach and the Government really sincere with regard to the campaign they carried on when in opposition when they went over to England and addressed meetings in Coventry, Birkenhead, Liverpool <Col N="1466" /> and elsewhere and when they make no effort to help the people in the Six Counties to bring about the unity we all desire?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Flour Infestation.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that practically all flour used in this country is infested with mites and that this infestation is seriously affecting the health of many, leading in some cases to internal cancer, and is causing wastage and loss of flour and bread; and, if so, if he will take immediate steps to ensure that the large flour millers will cleans and purify all wheat for human consumption before milling in the same way as millers in the U.S.A., Canada, France, Britain, etc., are obliged by statute to cleanse their wheat, whether for home consumption or export, so as to eliminate effectively both mites and their eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no foundation for the suggestion that flour used in this country is infested with mites.</P>
      <P>All flour millers are equipped with plant to cleanse wheat before milling, as well as for periodic purification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the Minister's reply as being correct.  It is known to every housewife all over the country that if whole flour particularly is kept for any length of time in the house, having been purchased a short time after milling, it develops these mites which could almost walk it out of the house.  The Minister must be aware of that.  Is he further aware <Col N="1467" /> that in most of the other countries I mentioned flour millers are compelled to cleanse the wheat on the outside before milling to eliminate the mites which come in every farm crop off the land?  I am asking the Minister to take this up as a serious matter, because any housewife in town or country can assure him of the truth of what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that all flour millers in this country are equipped with plant to cleanse wheat and there is no foundation for the suggestion that flour as delivered from the flour mills is infested.  It is quite true that if a trader or householder keeps flour for an unduly long period it will deteriorate.  May I say also that there is a strong volume of opinion which argues that the insecticides and chemicals used in some countries for cleansing wheat do more damage to health than the mites they are intended to destroy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not referring to the use of insecticides, but to the practice in the United States by which a miller is compelled to wash the wheat before kiln drying and milling.  I want to assure the Minister that I have on several occasions examined samples of flour under a microscope and have found it to be literally crawling with mites which come from the threshing, which originate in the land and which are necessary for the growth of the wheat.  The Minister and his Department must be aware of that and what I am asking the Minister to do is to insist on millers cleaning the wheat before milling to eliminate these mites or weevils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied, following inquiries by inspectors of my Department and of the Department of Agriculture, and by officers of the Flour Millers' Association, that there is no foundation whatever for the suggestion Deputy Blowick has put forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMHession" hpid="Mr. Hession Mr. Hession">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hession</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will outline the representations made to the Government of the United States of America against their proposal to withdraw their weather ships from the Atlantic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not caused any representations to be made to the Government of the United States of America against the proposal to withdraw their weather ships from the Atlantic.  I do not consider it would be appropriate that such representations should be made as the arrangement for the maintenance of these ships was made at meetings sponsored by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and I propose to await the consideration of the matter by that organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMHession" hpid="Mr. Hession Mr. Hession">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hession</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The main advantage secured from the operation of these ships is to companies operating transatlantic air services and unfortunately we are not in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that we are spending between £300,000 and £400,000 a year to maintain very substantial conveniences at Shannon Airport for American transatlantic airlines and if a small country like this can make that liberal contribution to the safety of transatlantic travel, surely the United States might be asked to make their contribution by <Col N="1469" /> maintaining these weather ships which, in some degree, help us to operate Shannon Airport for the general safety of transatlantic aeroplanes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The International Air Transport Association which represents the airlines has issued a statement indicating that it is not unduly concerned about the suggestion that these weather ships should be withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMHession" hpid="Mr. Hession Mr. Hession">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hession</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hession</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the present freight rates and other dues charged on motor vehicles on the routes between Great Britain and this country militate against an extension and development of our tourist trade in that many intending motoring visitors to Ireland have cancelled their arrangements because of the high charges in operation for some time past; and, if so, if he will make appropriate representations to have the existing rates brought into line with charges operating on continental routes.</P>

In these circumstances, will the Minister recommend to the sympathetic consideration of the E.S.B. the early extension of current to these areas?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.  The importation of phosphatic fertilisers, free of customs duty, will be permitted under licence, if necessary, to supplement the production of Irish manufacturers and stocks in the country.  Duty-free licences are granted freely for the importation of double and treble superphosphate for use as raw materials in the manufacture of concentrated granulated compound fertilisers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is the policy of the Government and the Oireachtas to increase agricultural output and, to that end, to induce farmers to put out more superphosphate on their land, surely it is wholly inconsistent to levy a tariff of 20 per cent. on a commodity which we exhort them to buy more of and to use more of?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not levy a tariff <Col N="1472" /> of 20 per cent. upon superphosphate used by farmers.  We can produce most of the country's requirements of superphosphates in Irish factories.  If supplementary supplies are necessary, duty-free licences are given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that the capacity of Irish factories is not one-quarter of the total quantity that should be put out on the land and that the impact of the tariff is not represented by what the Revenue Commissioners collect at the point of importation, but that it is reflected in the price maintained by the tariff imposed?  Is it not the experience that a sufficient quantity of superphosphates is not, and will not, be put out on the land while that price is maintained?  Should it not be our purpose to subsidise phosphates rather than tax them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the net liability of the Exchequer in respect of the Marshall Aid Loan and interest thereon over the full term provided for repayment and allowing for prospective income earned by assets of Marshall Aid Loan Counterpart of £41,397,268 as set out in Account XXV of the Finance Accounts for the financial year 1952-53.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The gross liability of the Exchequer, at the present rate of exchange, on foot of Marshall Aid Loan proceeds of £40.7 million is £45.8 million in respect of principal and £25.8 million in respect of interest for the full term of the loan, i.e., to 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy was informed in reply to his question of the 22nd October, 1953, that the assets of the American Loan Counterpart Fund, to which the loan proceeds were transferred, consist as to £630,000 of Agricultural Credit Corporation Stock and as to £40.5 million of Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer.  These advances, with other Exchequer borrowings, were utilised to finance capital and other services during the period from December, 1949, to December, 1951.  The particular services financed by these Ways and Means Advances were not segregated and it is not, therefore, possible to say what <Col N="1476" /> are the actual or prospective receipts of the Exchequer from the expenditure of £40.5 million.  What is certain is that the interest and principal repayments on the loan as they fall due must be discharged in U.S. dollars and that these dollars must be bought at the ruling rate of exchange with funds provided by the Exchequer out of current revenue.  In so far as the income and principal repayments derived by the Exchequer from the assets created by the expenditure of the £40.5 million&mdash;as supplemented by the receipts from the investment in Agricultural Credit Corporation Stock &mdash;are insufficient to meet the loan charges, the deficiency must be made good from taxation.  The prospective deficiency in the assets available in the fund for repayment of the principal of the loan will also have to be made good from the same source.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say, when he describes the charge coming in course of payment as having been redeemed out of current revenue, does he include in the description of revenue the heading Sundry Receipts of £3,379,865 as set out in the receipts and issues out of the Exchequer Account published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> on November 3rd and, if he does include that, does that figure of £3,379,865 include the draft from the Central Bank account to the Minister for Finance of £550,000 drawn by the Minister for Finance from the assets lying to his credit in the Central Bank; and, if he does, does he not think he is misleading the House when he says that the principal and interest of this loan must be redeemed out of the annual revenue of the State without telling the House that the annual revenue of the State includes the drawings made by the Minister for Finance out of the Loan Counterpart Fund to his credit in the Central Bank?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMHession" hpid="Mr. Hession Mr. Hession">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hession</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been directed to Press reports of the recent annual meeting of An Taisce, in which it was suggested (a) that expenditure on works of art should be exempt from tax: (b) that expenditure on the repair of buildings, which were the subject of a preservation Order, should be free of tax, and (c) that gifts for the public good should, to a limited extent, be exempt from income-tax and death duties; and, if so, if he will indicate the extent to which he is prepared to afford such suggestions appropriate implementation if necessary by the introduction of proposals for legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is yes.  As regards the second part, the newspaper report is doubtless a summarised one and it is difficult to gather the precise nature of the suggestions and therefore difficult to comment upon them.  Suggestion (a) in the first part of the Deputy's question may mean that a wealthy taxpayer who purchases works of art out of his surplus income or who spends money in the preservation of works of art should get, for income-tax purposes, a deduction from his income of an amount equal to the amount so expended.  If so, it is scarcely a suggestion that commends itself.  As for suggestion (b), I should like to point out that in arriving at the valuation, to which the taxation of buildings is related, an allowance must, under the Valuation Act, be made for the probable average annual cost of repairs, etc., necessary to maintain <Col N="1479" /> the property.  As regards (c), there would be serious objections to any proposal to enact that, when a taxpayer subscribed money for the public good, he should automatically be entitled, in connection with income-tax, to claim a corresponding deduction from his income.  So far as death duties are concerned the Deputy will be interested to know that, under existing law, gifts <i>inter vivos</i> made for &ldquo;public or charitable purposes&rdquo; more than 12 months before death are exempt from estate duty and that gifts by will for charitable purposes in Ireland are exempt from legacy or succession duty.  There is also, subject to the provisions of the statute, a general exemption from death duties in respect of such &ldquo;pictures, prints, books, manuscripts, works of art, scientific collections or other things not yielding income&rdquo; as appear to the Minister for Finance to be of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMHession" hpid="Mr. Hession Mr. Hession">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hession</NameTxt>
      <P>May I point out to the Minister that the suggestions contained in the question did not emanate from me but from responsible members of a responsible body, An Taisce, and that they appear to be meritorious and well-intentioned and might receive more sympathetic attention than they have received?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will notice that in the reply I admitted that these suggestions came from a responsible body and from a responsible Deputy, and that is the reason I gave him such a long explanation of the state of the law and the Government's attitude towards it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will set up a commission to inquire into the desirability and practicability of providing in rural areas parish houses, one for every three parishes, to accommodate the aged and infirm in their own neighbourhood instead of requiring them to go long distances from their own home to antiquated central county homes when they are no longer able to look after themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not consider that a commission of inquiry is necessary.  The provision of improved accommodation for old and infirm people who come under the care of local authorities has been examined fully in recent years, and a scheme for improved care for these classes is set out in a White Paper published in October, 1951.  It is indicated in the White Paper that sympathetic consideration will be given to proposals for a limited number of subsidiary institutions in the larger counties where residence <Col N="1483" /> in the county home might involve for some old people a removal to too great a distance from their friends.  It is also indicated that voluntary agencies and local authorities might make a small but valuable contribution to the solution of the problem by providing, in suitable circumstances, accommodation in colonies of small dwellings, or in flats in adapted country houses, with, in either case, a communal kitchen and dining room.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangements outlined in the White Paper the cost of providing, where necessary, alternative accommodation for persons hitherto accommodated in county homes, as well as the cost of modernising and improving county homes, is to be defrayed from loans raised by public assistance authorities.  The loan charges on the moneys borrowed will be substantially subsidised from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I have suggested to local authorities through the county managers that they should give special consideration to this question and I have informed them that I will welcome any reasonable proposals for the provision of small colonies which the local authorities may submit to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing grants for tenants whose holdings are being rearranged must be related to the requirements of the particular rearrangement scheme.  For example, some tenants may be vacating the sites of existing buildings and may be removing to new sites quite a distance away; in other cases, however, such complication may not arise.

They do not grasp the niceties that have led the Land Commission to adopt such a policy. Would the Minister consider making an Order giving an equal grant to all in the case of houses built, after rearrangement, by the tenants themselves? If the Minister would do that, I can assure him that it would speed <Col N="1488" /> up the work of getting agreement from the tenants in practically every single case.</P>

      <P>The townland that I have in mind is that of Kilvine (Irishtown) where you have one of the most congested villages in the whole of the West of Ireland.  A different scale of grants has been given in that village and has caused a grave upheaval.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that grave discontent exists among forestry workers in many centres owing to the discrepancy in wage rates and that in Cong forest, County Mayo, the rate is £4 per week while in all other forest centres in Mayo it is £4 8s. per week, and if he will take immediate steps to have the higher rate paid in all forest centres where such centres overlap a county border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The present wage structure under which the rates of pay of road workers in each county are applied to forest lying wholly or mainly in the county has operated since April, 1950.  Liability to discrepancies in wage rates between forests in adjoining counties was an inherent feature of the arrangement from the time of its inception and could not be overcome by the expedient the Deputy suggests.</P>
      <P>Cong forest lies mainly in County Galway and the rate of wages paid is that of the road workers employed by the Galway County Council.  This follows the general arrangement introduced in April, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that, for the sake of the few pounds extra involved, the rule that obtains ought to be reversed in this particular case?  It would appear that the Department is taking advantage of the fact that lower wages are paid in one county than in another in cases where a forest centre lies on a county boundary.  That is causing great discontent in Cong and in many other similar centres.  Would the Minister consider changing the system by paying the higher rate of wages in all forest centres that happen to be on county boundaries?  The present system is causing discontent, and rightly so, amongst the workers in the various centres.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will state why recipients of service medals are not eligible for pensions in view of the fact that their service to the nation in the War of Independence is recognised and admitted by the award of the medals, and if he will take steps, if necessary by introducing proposals for legislation, to remedy this disparity as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Unless a person is granted a certificate of military service under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, or a service certificate under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934, he cannot be granted a pension.</P>
      <P>The service (1917-1921) medal without bar is issued to persons in respect of continuous membership of the Irish Republican Army, Fianna Éireann, Cumann na mBan and the Irish Citizen Army, during the three months ended on the 11th July, 1921, and without any condition as to the nature and extent of service.  The medal without bar does not carry any entitlement to pension and it is not proposed that it should do so.</P>

      <P>It is correct that national teachers retiring on or after the 1st January, 1950, have in accordance with the terms of the national teachers' superannuation schemes operative at the time of their retirement, received lump sums and pensions or gratuities, based on the average of their last three years' <Col N="1493" /> salary.  Under the National Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1953, teachers who retire after 30th December, 1951, and in whose case the conditions laid down in that scheme are fulfilled, are entitled to receive superannuation awards calculated by reference to their retiring salary as defined in the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the balance of lump sum or gratuity due to such teachers under the revised calculation will be paid before the end of the present month and that arrears of pension where due will be paid before Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in Sections 1 and 2 of this Act the rates of charge for telegrams which are in the Irish language shall not exceed those in operation before the coming into force of this Act.</P>
      <P>I propose this amendment because I believe that, if adopted, it will give the House an opportunity of furthering the interests of the Irish language.  We know that millions of pounds have been spent during the last 30 years subsidising the effort to restore the Irish language and this amendment is not going to involve any great cost. It will not be substantial, especially in view of the fact that it is not probable that a large number of persons will avail of the advantage proposed in this amendment, that is, by sending the telegrams wholly in Irish.</P>
      <P>The suggestion in the amendment is that if a telegram at the present time, whether it be in Irish or English, costs 40d to send, when the new rates are adopted they would apply to telegrams sent in the English language and that a charge of only 40d would be applied in respect of a telegram with the appropriate number of words if it were sent in the Irish language. That is the purpose of my amendment. The Fianna Fáil Party claim to be interested in the restoration of the Irish language or pretend to be and I think the adoption of this amendment will be an appropriate gesture that will further the effort to restore it.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Rooney is serious at all in this amendment.  I think it is a ridiculous suggestion and I do not believe the Minister would have any hesitation in saying: &ldquo;No, I will not <Col N="1503" /> accept this amendment.&rdquo;  I suppose the majority of us in this House want to see an encouragement of the Irish language, to say the least of it, and its ultimate restoration, however long it might take.  I do not think this is the proper way to approach it.  There are so many people in Ireland who, through no fault of their own, have not two words of Irish.  Is it suggested by Deputy Rooney therefore that we should penalise those who have not had the advantage of being born in the Gaeltacht or of learning some Irish in the last 20 or 30 years?  Does he suggest that because others can address their telegrams in the Irish language, the price of the telegram to them should be less than it would be for an unfortunate person who does not know the Irish language?</P>
      <P>If we are to encourage the language by that particular method, it would mean that, if the principle were to be carried out in full, if I made my application for a driving licence in Irish it should be cheaper; or if my conversation over the telephone were in the Irish language it should be cheaper; or even if Deputy Rooney made his speech in Irish his Dáil allowance should be doubled.  There is quite a number of different forms of encouragement to those people in the Gaeltacht to spread the language and I would suggest that this Government and previous Governments since 1922 have done a considerable amount by way of financial encouragement in an attempt to preserve the language.  But we can go a little too far.  If this kind of suggestion were accepted by the Government, there are 89,000 people in the County of Wexford who would not be at all pleased and many thousands in County Dublin who would object to this preferential treatment in a purely commercial transaction of people who are lucky enough to have the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I would, therefore, suggest that this is hardly worthy of discussion, as if we do this we will have a very disgruntled section of the people, who will be absolutely correct in their objections to this form of encouragement.</P>

      <P>This Bill which we are discussing is introduced for the purpose of wiping out a deficit.  We discussed that on the Second Reading of the Bill.  Amongst the items which are causing this deficit there is the considerable telegraph service between this country and other countries in connection with the news agencies. Does the Deputy think that the countries that are getting news from us would expect their correspondents to send the news in Irish to them so that they might avail of a cheaper rate?</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to increase charges particularly where there is a large-scale commercial use of the particular service in connection with the sending of telegrams abroad, and it would be ridiculous to think that we would derive any benefit at all by introducing such a section or the second amendment suggested by the Deputy. I hope the Minister will have no hesitation in rejecting this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Corish and Deputy Briscoe have answered Deputy Rooney very adequately.  We could not possibly set a precedent that might be adopted by other Government Departments in order to encourage people to get financial benefits in the nature of grants or anything else. I have the gravest doubts that this would serve any purpose in stimulating the language.  Apart from that, the purpose of this Bill is to remove statutory limitations on telegraph rates and place them on a level with telephone and postal charges.  These changes will be varied by means of statutory regulations but the Dáil will still have a measure of control in such regulations and will be able to remove them if they are in any way harsh.  This Bill provides for changes in the operation of the charging system and the adoption of this amendment would be completely anomalous under the circumstances. That is the principal reason for resisting the amendment.  The other reason has been very adequately set forth by both Deputy Corish and Deputy Briscoe, namely, that this would set a precedent of very doubtful value.  It might involve us in all sorts of difficulties and inevitably people would ask for an extension of the principle.  I do not believe that this principle, if adopted, would serve any useful purpose.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House can appreciate the Minister's desire to have telegraph charges and the increases thereon made simpler, but I am afraid we cannot agree with the proposed changes. Personally, I think the modern trend is to take more and more power out of the hands of Parliament and place it in the hands of a Minister or perhaps in the hands of experts who advise the Minister.  In certain circumstances, that can be quite a useful way of conducting State business.  It can be very expeditious but, nevertheless, I do not agree that it is the best method in a democratic State.  Although the Dáil will have the right to interfere in and discuss increased charges&mdash;the Bill obviously contemplates increased charges&mdash;the Dáil will not have the same opportunity for discussion as it has in existing circumstances.  I can sympathise with the Minister in wanting to make the work of his Department more expeditious, but this is something which will impose a charge on industry and on the country generally and, as such, I am afraid we cannot agree with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the attitude taken by the Fine Gael Party in this matter.  Deputy Dockrell says this will remove from the Dáil the control which exists at the present time.  At the present time no changes can be made because of the statutory position, and this Bill is introduced to enable the Post Office to make changes in the rates charged from time to time.  The Minister pointed out on the Second Stage that Parliament will still retain control.  The regulations made will probably lie on the Table of the House for a number of weeks and if any Deputy wishes to challenge them by resolution they can be discussed <Col N="1508" /> here in full.  Indeed, the matter can be discussed every year on the Minister's Estimate.  I cannot understand, therefore, how it can be argued that this Bill will take away parliamentary control.  There is nothing to prevent Parliament at the moment putting down a motion that all letters shall carry a 1d. stamp in future instead of 3d.  I cannot understand the objection to this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this measure because it is asking the Dáil to give the Minister the right to determine charges.  The Minister did not indicate on the Second Stage when he was introducing this Bill what the proposals were.  He merely told us the gap which he proposed to fill.  If he intends to balance charges, he proposes under this Bill to get the people who send telegrams to pay an extra £400,000 for that particular service.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of the use of the telegraph system by wealthy newspapers. Mention was made of its use for the purpose of sending birthday greetings, Christmas greetings and so on.  The Minister said that charges for that type of telegram could be increased but not for those in connection with accidents, death, or matters of great urgency.  When it comes to birthday greetings and that sort of thing, I am in favour of the suggestion of the Minister that perhaps some kind of adorned greeting could be issued for an extra charge.  I would not be opposed to the imposition of extra charges in respect of such telegrams. In the ordinary way these charges will be passed on.  It means that £400,000 will be collected from somebody and it usually comes from the taxpayers.  It may be said that it will come out of the profits of the newspapers, out of the profits of commercial firms and out of the taxpayers' money that is used in the Civil Service for the purpose of sending telegrams.  For that reason I am opposed to the idea of allowing a Bill of this kind to go through.  We should not establish the practice of giving one Minister after another a blank cheque and full authority to fix his own charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1509" /> It would have been better if the Minister had been in a position when introducing the Bill to indicate what the service is costing.  He should have put before the Dáil for discussion the scale of charges which he would propose to apply.  That would give the Dáil an opportunity of debating each aspect of the new scale of charges.  If this Bill goes through it means that the Minister can decide on the charges and can come into the House and carry them on a Vote.  This is the time, before this Bill goes through, when the House and the public should be made aware of the scale of charges which the Minister proposes to implement. We are asked to pass a Bill without being given any indication as to what the scale of charges may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene lest by silence I might be presumed to be accepting the rather ghostly stories which Deputy Rooney is endeavouring to spin around this Bill.  This is not a political Bill in any sense of the term. It is purely a business method of dealing with a particular problem.  The Post Office Department say that on the telegraph side they are inhibited from making flexible charges in respect of ordinary or Press telegrams because of the fact that the rates are fixed by legislation and can be amended only by legislation, which involves passing a Bill through five stages in this House and four stages in the Seanad&mdash;nine stages in order to change the price of a telegram.  Everybody will agree that in 1953, Parliament intervening on a greater scale than ever in social, domestic, industrial, economic, financial and agricultural affairs, it is not a sensible approach to the question that it should be necessary to pass a Bill through nine stages in order to enable the Post Office to fix telegraph charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that this Bill is doing&mdash;I do not think Deputy Rooney adverted to this fact&mdash;is giving the Post Office on the telegraph side the same flexibility as it has on the postal and telephone side. At present the telegraph legislation is not running in step with the postal or telephone legislation.  The telegraph legislation may be said to be archaie from the standpoint of its approach to <Col N="1510" /> the whole question of telegraph charges.  This Bill lines up telegraph legislation with postal and telephone legislation.  It does not even do that because under this Bill the Minister is merely taking power to revise telegraph charges upwards or downwards at any time it is thought desirable.  In order to make the revision operative he has to come to the House with statutory regulations which must be laid on the Table of the House and, presumably, must get the authority of the House, so that at that stage every Deputy will have all the opportunity he wants to express his views as to whether the telegraph charges should or should not be increased and he can consider the matter against the background of the financial position of the telegraph service.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had been able to give the House a detailed explanation of the loss per telegram and the general distribution of telegrams, such as was furnished some time ago by the British Post Office to a parliamentary committee in England, Deputy Rooney's views on this matter would have undergone a substantial change.  One does not need to go into details but it seems to me, from the figures given by the Minister, that the loss per telegram amounts to much more than the Post Office is receiving for the transmission of the telegram.  That situation ought to be corrected.  It has not been corrected on the telegraph side for more than 20 years in one case and 40 years in another case.  Having regard to the altered value of money in the interregnum, quite clearly there is a case for revising these charges, as I am sure Deputy Rooney would revise the charges in similar circumstances in a business with which he was associated, or as any other sensible person would do.</P>
    <P>We must face the problem in either of two ways.  The more you develop the telephone service the more you injure the telegraph service.  In every country in the world the telephone has proved to be a very serious competitor of the telegraph service and in many countries it is recognised that it is only a matter of time until there will be <Col N="1511" /> further and more serious deterioration in the telegraph position in consequence of development of the telephone. You can probably save the telegraph service and might avoid increased charges to some extent if you damp down or cut back telephone development.  Nowadays the telephone is universally regarded as an almost indispensable item of equipment for getting through the business of life and doing the things that must be done from day to day in a quick and efficient manner.  There is no question of being able to cut back on the telephone side.  In respect of the competition which the telegraph service experiences from the telephone there is no question of a solution being found by reducing charges.  Every telegram that the Post Office handles increases the loss.  If it handles 10,000,000 telegrams to-day and 20,000,000 telegrams to-morrow the loss to-morrow will be almost twice as much as the loss to-day because there is a loss per unit handled.</P>
    <P>The only other way of dealing with the problem is the way envisaged in the Bill, that is, by increasing charges. If the charges have not been revised in one case for 20 years and in another case for 40 years it is difficult to argue against their being revised now.  I do not consider that we should continue to accept this deficit, which must be paid in the long run.  It ought to be paid by the quite well-off sections of the community who avail of the telegraph service so that as balanced a budget as practicable may be secured in respect of the telegraph service.  I am afraid, however, that we will reach a stage, if we have not reached it already, when there is a limit to the charge you can make for a telegram. Britain and other countries feel that that stage has been reached.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the stage will probably be reached under the new charges proposed in this bill, but it is pretty difficult to see what you can do about the matter.  However, what is before us in the Bill is to permit the Minister to make statutory regulations permitting greater flexibility in the <Col N="1512" /> fixing of telegraphic charges on the one hand, preserving the power of Parliament all the time to be able to examine those statutory regulations, and on the other hand to see whether we are going to allow the present substantial deficit on the telegraph service to continue because of the non-revision of telegraph charges over a long number of years or face up to the problem by increasing the charges, as has been done in every other single public utility in this country, and as has been done by every person who uses the telegraph service, whether he is a private individual or a newspaper proprietor.  In all the circumstances, we feel that a good case is made for the Bill, and, frankly, we are in favour of giving the Minister the power under the Bill for use in the way indicated by him on the Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton really more or less gave the House an indication of what my view is with regard to this matter.  In the course of the Second Reading, I indicated quite clearly that we are making consistent the whole position of the postal, telephone and telegraphic charges.  Deputy Dockrell may not be aware that postage rates were fixed by finance warrant under the Post Office Acts, 1908 and 1951.  The 1908 Act fixed a general maximum for a number of different types of charges, and the Bill to enable us to increase charges in respect of a number of other postal items other than telegraph charges was left to me to implement in this House which passed it, if I correctly remember, unanimously.  We are only completing a process that has been going on for a number of years in accordance with modern practice in regard to anything in the nature of a semi-commercial organisation such as the Post Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated before, these statutory regulations providing for increased charges will be available to the members of the House and if they feel that the charges proposed to be made for telegrams are too severe, too high, they can move a special resolution if they wish.  As I have indicated also, the percentage of telegrams dealing with matters where one could say that the person sending them could <Col N="1513" /> afford to pay the maximum charge that might pay for the cost is a very high proportion of all telegrams.  I have not got the exact figures for what it costs to send a telegram, but I made a statement on the Second Reading that if a telegram cost, say, 1/6, the cost of sending it was, say, 1/6 plus very nearly another 1/6.  That I regard as absolutely ridiculous, and the taxpayer could not be expected to defray losses of that kind.</P>
    <P>The passing of this Bill, as I have said before, would place telegraph charges on the same basis as all postal and telephone charges, and merely follows on the one which I introduced here in 1951 which had been drawn up by the previous Government and which dealt with postal order poundage, inland printed packets, inland and foreign newspaper rates, and inland postcards, in all of which there was a maximum charge and in connection with all of which unless the 1951 Act had been passed there could only have been increases by separate Acts of the Dáil.  That to my mind would be a waste of the time of the Dáil, making the procedure cumbersome, and therefore I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplies and Services Act is due to expire on the 31st of December and the purpose of this Bill is to continue it in force for a further period, namely until the 31st March, 1955.  As I informed the House when speaking on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Government has decided that this will be the final extension of the life of the Supplies and Services Act and that it will be permitted to lapse not later than the date mentioned in this Bill, namely the 31st March, 1955.  Each Minister concerned with the operation of power under the Supplies and <Col N="1514" /> Services Act has been directed by the Government to review these powers and to decide whether they are to be let go or, if they have got to be retained after the 31st March, 1955, the form of legislation which is to be prepared and submitted to the House to give these powers on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>At the present time the main controls exercised under the authority of the Supplies and Services Act are administered by five Departments of Government.  The Department of Agriculture is utilising Orders under the Act for the purpose of maintaining certain controls relating to the dairying industry and the marketing and distribution of agricultural produce. The Department of Finance operates under the authority of Supplies and Services Orders exchange control, guarantees on borrowing by certain statutory bodies and the regulation of tobacco clearances from bond.  The Department of Local Government is using the Supplies and Services Act for certain road traffic matters and to authorise acquisition of bogland by local authorities.  The Department of Social Welfare under this Act operates cheap fuel schemes, food centres and footwear schemes and the provision of school meals.  The Department of Industry and Commerce maintains price control, which is under the authority of the Supplies and Services Act, and suspends the operation of certain customs duties and quotas and exercises a control over exports.</P>
    <P>Some progress has already been made in the preparation of the necessary permanent legislation to replace the Supplies and Services Act Orders. There is the State Guarantees Bill before the Oireachtas which will, if enacted, replace the powers at present exercised by the Minister for Finance under the Supplies and Services Act; and apart from the permanent legislation for price control to which I referred yesterday I hope to have available for the consideration of the House soon a Bill consolidating the powers required to maintain export controls.  I am, therefore, on this occasion asking the Dáil to continue <Col N="1515" /> the Supplies and Services Act for a final period of 15 months.  It is a slightly longer period than the usual extension of one year.  That longer period is, we think, necessary to allow time for the preparation and consideration by the Dáil of whatever alternative legislation may be needed when the Act has expired.</P>

It is important that we should appreciate the really serious unemployment situation which has been facing this country in the past year or so and the importance of bringing up this subject for discussion as frequently as possible as I feel it cannot be stressed too often.  It is the duty not only of the Government for the time being but of every Deputy in this House to keep an active interest in and a watchful eye upon the level of employment and industrial activity in this country so that, when we find the Government of the day at fault, we will be in a position to point out as strongly as we think proper where the Government have failed and why we believe the economic policies of the Government are at fault.</P>

      <P>You are aware, Sir, I am sure, of the practice which existed heretofore of discussing the unemployment situation on this Bill.  The relevancy of that matter to this Bill is very clear.  As the Minister has frequently pointed out, this Bill gives very wide powers&mdash;indeed, almost autocratic powers&mdash;to the Government to deal with the economic situation.  In that regard, I am directing my remarks&mdash;and I submit that, in so doing, I am relevant on this Bill&mdash; towards the unemployment situation as it has existed in the past year or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not creating a precedent in so doing.  Unfortunately I have not got the Official Reports with me, but I looked them up and I found that last year's debate was a very lengthy one on unemployment and the cost of living, as was the debate the year before and the year before that.  I am relating my remarks to this Bill and suggesting that the reason it is being continued for another year is that it gives tremendous&mdash;almost autocratic, as I have said&mdash;powers to the Government to make regulations for the supply of goods and services and we are entitled to comment on the lack of certain regulations, or on the fact that certain regulations were made which should not have been made.  We are entitled to draw deductions to the effect that, as a result of the failure of the Government to utilise the Bill, unemployment has increased.  What I <Col N="1521" /> am endeavouring to point out is the course of events over the course of the past year since the passing of a similar Bill and to point out that we have had a critical unemployment situation because the Minister has not utilised the powers given to him in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The importance of the unemployment situation must be obvious to the Government and to every Deputy, and it is no good saying, as has been said recently and earlier, that this Government is in favour of full employment, of increasing production and of increasing exports.  These are matters on which every Deputy will agree.  We are all agreed that the powers conferred by the Bill should be utilised to see that the maximum level of employment is provided in this State, and where we differ from the Government, where the Opposition join issue with the Government, is in pointing out that this end, which we all admit is a desirable end, has not been attained, and we are entitled to point out the reasons why it has not been attained.</P>
    <P>It is no use our arguing here on questions of ends and principles on which we are all agreed.  What we should be discussing here is not whether it is desirable for us to increase industrial production, because we all admit it; not whether we should be increasing agricultural production, because we all admit it; and not whether we should have full employment, because we all admit that is a desirable end, but how these should be achieved and how the Government of the day has failed to achieve them. Any Government is entitled to be judged on a very few simple facts. One of the most important of them is whether it has secured a high level of employment in the State; another is whether it has seen that prices have been maintained at a level which is not beyond the ordinary incomes of the people; and a third is the question of agricultural and industrial production. In all these spheres, if we examine the results of the past year and further back to the point at which this Government came into power, we will find that the Government has failed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> It is no use our being told that they are in favour of obtaining these ends and no use in saying that things are going to improve.  There is no use wishing for a state of affairs if the right policies are not put into operation to bring about that state of affairs, and our criticism of this Government over the past two and a half years has been that the wrong policies were put into operation, and because the wrong policies were put into operation these desirable ends have not been achieved.</P>
    <P>The past two and a half years have witnessed a striking and distressing failure of the Government to control prices and to provide for an adequate level of employment for our people.  We had in June, 1951, 35,000 people unemployed, and over that month we had reached an average level of unemployment which was the lowest which this State ever experienced.  After the change of Government, and coming into 1952, we had that situation, in which we were getting very close to a position of near full employment, reversed.  As Deputies know, there is always a cyclical upward movement in unemployment in the winter months and the summer months are usually the best as regards unemployment figures. If we compare the best months of 1952 and the best months of 1953, we will see the lamentable failure of this Government to utilise the very great powers it has to bring about full employment in this State.  Unemployment in June, 1951, was 35,000; in June, 1952, it was 45.9 thousand; and in June of this year, 63.9 thousand&mdash;an increase of 28,000 on two years previously. If we compare the winter months &mdash;the bad months&mdash;we will see a similar increase in unemployment.  In February, 1951, shortly before the change of Government, the unemployment figure was 65,000; in February, 1952, it had gone up to 74,000; and in March of this year&mdash;the worst month for many years that this State has experienced&mdash;the figure was 85.5 thousand. We had in this country in March of last year 11 per cent. of our industrial insurable workers out of employment, which I regard as a scandalous situation and one which should not <Col N="1523" /> obtain in a Catholic and Christian State.</P>
    <P>We have had excuses from this Government time and again for the rise in prices and in unemployment, and we have had this extraordinary situation that over the past two and a half years we have had rising prices and rising unemployment, and every time rising prices were mentioned the Government said they were due to the post-Korean boom, the post-Korean inflation; and every time rising unemployment was mentioned the Government said it was due to the post-Korean deflation, the post-Korean slump.  They have tried to have it both ways.  I went to the trouble&mdash;and I suggest that other Deputies should do so too&mdash;of comparing the figures of unemployment in other States over the past two and a half years.  If Deputies look at the figures given in the O.E.E.C. report, the recent statistical report, they will see these startling figures that this country has had the worst percentage increase in unemployment since 1951 of any western European country, and that several of them&mdash;many of them comparable with us, such as small countries like Denmark&mdash;have had reductions in the level of unemployment during that period.  Any examination of what has occurred in other countries, any examination of the figures in our country, must show that this Government has failed to maintain the level of employment and that other European countries have been more successful than ours in this respect.</P>

There is no other purpose in this Bill.</P>

      <P>The extraordinary powers given to the Government to deal with the unemployment situation are contained in this Bill and that is how with your permission, Sir, I propose to relate my remarks on unemployment to this Bill.  However, I have said what I wished to say on the unemployment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pass now to a second matter, the second striking failure of the Government, which has arisen in connection with the control of prices. Quite clearly that is a matter which comes within the orbit of this Bill and it has been a subject for discussion every time the Bill has come before the House in the last three or four years.  The cost-of-living index figure in this country was 109 in the June quarter of 1951, and it had increased to 125 in the September quarter of this <Col N="1525" /> year&mdash;an increase of 14 per cent.  It is not irrelevant at this point to remind the House that one of the clauses in the programme published by the Government before they came into office and when they were endeavouring to get the support of the Independent Deputies, was a promise to maintain an effective system of price control. It is quite clear that there has not been an effective system of price control for the last two and a half years.  The fact that the cost of living has increased by 14 per cent. in two and a half years is ample proof, if proof were needed, that the Government has failed to maintain price control. Their failure has been a lamentable one and has wrought great hardship amongst the people of the country.</P>
    <P>Again we have had the excuse that the rise in the cost of living was due to the post-Korean war inflation.  It was alleged that we had a world increase in prices due to the post-Korean war situation, but the facts are against any such interpretation or any such excuse for the rise in the cost of living.  The import index figure is the means by which we can find how that situation influenced the cost of living.  I think it is worth pointing out that the highest point reached by our import price index figure occurred in September, 1951, over two years, when it stood at 324.1 points.  Since that time our import prices have been going down, and the latest figure I have been able to get, that for July of this year, shows that the import price figure stood at 284.8, a reduction of nearly 40 points in two years.  We have the extraordinary situation that during these two years import prices have been declining by as much as 40 points but, in spite of that decline, the cost of living has been going up here.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting to note that the index figure for wholesale prices reached its highest point in December of last year, and the latest figure for July shows a decline of eight points. Despite that decline, since December of last year, the cost of living went up by two points in the same period. Again I think it is worth while to make a comparison with the experience <Col N="1526" /> of other European countries in the last two and a half years.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;how the cost of living stands in other European countries.  The importance of these figures must be obvious to Deputies because the excuse that has been made by Government spokesmen for the rise in the cost of living in the last two and a half years has been the post-Korean war inflation or world events of one sort or another.  The rise in the cost of living in this country has been blamed on these factors but it is a remarkable fact that this alleged Korean war inflation, which has caused a 14 per cent. rise in the cost of living here, was not found in other European countries with the one exception of Greece.  Again, I should like Deputies to look at the recent statistical report of O.E.E.C. and they will note that since 1951 there has been a greater percentage increase in the cost of living in Ireland than in any other western European country included in that report with the one exception of Greece.  That is an extraordinary fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, of course, know that modern Governments in democratic States have very wide powers in regard to prices and the level of prices generally, <Col N="1527" /> and our criticism of this Government has been that they have not utilised the powers, that they have badly administered the powers which it is proposed to give them in this Bill and which they had for the last two and a half years.  As a result of their economic policy and of their failure to grapple with the question of rising prices we have experienced in this country a rise in the cost of living comparable with that of no European country bar Greece.  The figures are remarkable. The increase in the cost of living for the comparable period in Switzerland was 2 per cent.; in Denmark 3 per cent.; in Germany it remained static; in Italy there was an increase of 6 per cent.; in Norway an increase of 7 per cent.; in France, and surely our economy cannot be judged by the French economy on a similar standard, the increase was 12 per cent. Our increase during that period was 14 per cent., and during that period we had a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Deputies must be aware when dealing with this question of prices that one of the main reasons why prices have increased over the last two years was the deliberate action of the Government in their Budget of last year in cutting the food subsidies.  When discussing this problem of the rising cost of living in this country we must bear in mind always that the cost of living was deliberately increased by the Government in April, 1951, and that that automatic increase in the cost of living, due to the cutting of the food subsidies, was followed by the cost inflation which we again experienced with the rising wages demands and a second rise in the cost of living. I think that we are entitled to question the decision of the Government in bringing about the rise in the cost of living by their deliberate action in 1951 and to ask the Government if the policy then enshrined in the Budget speech of the Minister in 1951 is still the policy of the present Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It has this relation, that this Bill gives wide powers to the Government in relation to price control. The Government failed to exercise them or were miserably inefficient in exercising them for the last two and a half years.  I am asking at this stage if the Government are going to change their policy and, as I was saying, this is a matter which is not only of interest to Deputies on the Second Reading of this Bill but of vital importance to the people outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been carrying on here passing Supplies and Services Bills for the last two years under the present Administration.  Each year that these Bills have been passed we have been dealing with the Government policy as it was then enshrined in the Budget statements and in the statements of Ministers at other times as well.  If there is a change of policy, I am asking that the Minister should tell us what it is.  I am asking that, not because we are academically interested here, but because the people outside have been suffering from the rise in the cost of living for the last two and a half years.  The deliberate Government policy which is relevant to this Bill has been to reduce consumption. The deliberate Government policy which arises on this Bill has been to reduce imports, and I am asking has there been a change in that policy.  I was trying to urge on the Government to change their policy in regard <Col N="1529" /> to the manner in which they utilised the powers given under this Bill, to endeavour to reverse the trend and the policy which they had in the last two and a half years, and to increase consumption in this State and to increase imports.</P>
    <P>One of the bogies of the present Government has been their fear of imports.  One of the ways in which they have used their powers or failed to use their powers under this Bill has been the manner in which they have deliberately sought to cut down imports. As the House knows, they were remarkably successful in that policy. As the House also knows, such a policy was regarded by us as being unnecessary and undesirable and as being a policy which would naturally lead to the hardships we have experienced in the last two and a half years.  You cannot reduce consumption without reducing employment and you cannot raise the cost of living without reducing the purchasing power of the people.  If you deliberately set out to reduce imports by reducing the power to consume in the country, then you will have the results that we have experienced in the last two and a half years.  Not only we on this side of the House but the people throughout the length and breadth of the country want to know if that policy is finished.</P>
    <P>The fundamental error which has been behind the whole Government policy was contained in the White Paper on the balance of external trade issued in 1951.  The whole basis for the present policy of the Government was the fear of the large imports which were experienced in 1951 and the fear, which was contained in that White Paper, that exports would not expand. We have debated the position of our balance of payments before on the White Paper of 1951.  We pointed out then that our imports in that year of 1951 were extraordinary and excessive and would not be continued in the following year.  We also pointed out that the figures then available to us and to the Government showed that exports must expand in 1952, as, indeed, they did.  We pointed out then that the fear of the Government <Col N="1530" /> regarding the balance of trade and the deficit on our balance of payments was unwarranted.</P>
    <P>We pointed out in the Budget of the following year that it was unnecessary to reduce consumption in order to bring about a better equilibrium in our external payments.  I believe that the deterioration of our economic position over the last two and a half years has flowed from the misconception of our balance of payments situation and has resulted from the desire of the Government to reduce imports which they brought about not by import restrictions but, as was stated by the Minister in his Budget speech of last year, by a policy of reducing consumption in this State.</P>
    <P>I want that policy reversed.  I want the policy of reducing imports changed.  I think this country can import many million pounds more worth of goods both of a consumption and of a raw material nature than it did last year or than it is doing this year.  The justification for increasing our imports brought the remarkable expansion in our agricultural exports last year and again this year&mdash;an expansion which we pointed out in 1951 would come about.</P>
    <P>The position of near equilibrium, which was arrived at last year&mdash;we had a deficit of £8.9 million in our balance of payments&mdash;had this striking result: that last year this State accumulated sterling assets.  We had this Government, when pressed for its views on the subject, stating that it was in favour of the prudent repatriation of sterling assets, a policy upon which we certainly agreed but which the Government were very slow to make any definite statement on.  The Government stated, however, that it was in favour of the repatriation of sterling assets.</P>
    <P>Our contention is that the only way that you can bring about a repatriation of sterling assets is by a deficit in the balance of payments.  If it is the end of your policy to bring about a repatriation of sterling assets that is usually done not by reducing imports but by deliberately having a planned <Col N="1531" /> deficit in the balance of payments, a policy which we advocated in the past.</P>
    <P>I think it is noteworthy that we have had this strange conflict between theory and practice.  We have had the Government stating that they are in favour of the repatriation of sterling assets and, in fact, piling up sterling assets.  Admittedly, it was a small sum last year but the latest figures in regard to the balance of payments published in <i>The General Statistical Quarterly</i> for June demonstrated that there was an increase in our sterling assets last year.  I am fully aware that it is always dangerous to prophesy on economic factors.  Indeed, the dangers of prophesying were demonstrated by the Government's White Paper of 1951.  I think the figures which are available at the present time show that this year again we are going to increase sterling assets.</P>
    <P>The latest figures in respect of our imports for the first nine months of this year show that our exports are at £81,000,000.  Our exports are, in fact, going beyond the level at which they were last year.  But even if they only maintain the same level in the last three months of this year as they maintained in the last three months of last year, our exports are going to be many millions more than last year.  On the other hand, it is clear that our imports are, at the present time, running at slightly less than they were last year.  In recent months there has been an increase in our imports but, even allowing for an increase, it appears likely that our total imports are going to be only slightly over what they were last year.</P>
    <P>I think it is possible at this stage to forecast that the deficit in our trade balance is going to be less than it was last year.  Of course, it is impossible to know what the outrun of the year will be on the other items of current account, invisible exports and imports. They have been running round a surplus of £61,000,000 for the past few years.  If we continue to have a favourable surplus on invisible account of £61,000,000, it is quite clear that this year we are going to have a very small deficit in the balance of payments and we are <Col N="1532" /> going to increase once again our sterling assets.</P>
    <P>That is a policy which I am against. I am against a policy of increasing sterling assets.  I am against a policy of getting an equilibrium in our balance of payments.  I am in favour of a policy of planned deficits in our balance of payments in order to repatriate our sterling assets.  That is the only way it can be done.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that the Government has also failed in regard to another very important <Col N="1534" /> aspect of our economic field, a portion of the working of a Government which is almost vital to the existence of a high level of employment in this State. The figures which were recently published some months ago show that the gross physical capital formation in the State last year declined over 1951 by 14 per cent.</P>
      <P>I think that the failure of the country to increase, in real terms, its gross capital formation last year was one of the greatest failures of the Government in regard to its economic policies.  Deputies, of course, know the importance of capital formation in a State, and they know the importance of expanding capital formation every year.  It is the only means by which you can bring about a satisfactory, a stable level of employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Any time the Minister discusses the question of unemployment, he always goes back to the textile trade.  I think it is worth pointing out&mdash;if Deputies look at the <i>Trade Journal</i> they can see it for themselves&mdash;that there is not an industry producing transportable goods in the State which had not a reduction in employment last year.  One of the reasons why there is such very large unemployment in the building industry at the present time is because of the slowing down of capital formation in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And the other is the high cost of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Capital formation has been slowed down.  There can be absolutely no doubt about that.  I do not know whether the Minister regards that as desirable or not.  If he <Col N="1535" /> does not, will he tell us how he is going to increase it?  It seems to me that the drop off in employment last year in, as I say, every industry producing transportable goods was directly attributable to the falling off in gross physical capital formation which occurred last year.  We have not the figures for this year of gross physical capital formation, but I sincerely hope that there has been an increase over last year. The signs at the present time, however, do not give much grounds for hope.  This country is most anxious to know what steps the Government are going to take to deal with the fact that capital formation declined last year by as much as 14 per cent., whether it is increasing this year, and whether they propose to take one of the many steps which they could take to see that it is encouraged and fostered.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of Government policy which, I think, is worth commenting on is the fact that last year, for the first time since the war, there was a very large flight of capital from this country.  Deputies know that one of the means by which we help to bridge the deficits in the balance of payments, and one of the means by which we finance these deficits, is by the inflow of foreign capital, of one sort or another, to the country.  That foreign capital has been coming in for years, and it has been assisting us in maintaining our external position.  The movement of capital into this country in 1949 was £15,000,000; in 1950, it was £13,000,000, and in 1951, it was £15,000,000, while last year there was a striking decline in the inflow of capital.  It amounted only to £12,000,000.  An even more striking figure than that is the fact that there was a very large overflow of capital from this country.  In 1949, a little over £1,000,000 left this country; in 1950, only £74,000, and in 1951, £174,000, while last year over £3,000,000 left this country.</P>

      <P>I hope he does.  The Minister has raised this question of the American loan.  I think I am entitled to say that it was a most extraordinary thing to have this present Government complaining about it.  Admittedly, the first time they complained was when they got into office.  They made no complaint at all at the time the Marshall Aid Loan was granted, or after it for many years.</P>
      <P>But we had the extraordinary position of the Government complaining about the American borrowings and loans from the American Government after they came into office.  Very recently, the Minister was in America and in Canada, and he was asking the Americans for American capital to come into this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On certain conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions would be that you would pay at least 5 per cent for it.  Does the Minister think that American businessmen would invest capital here at <Col N="1537" /> 2½ per cent. which is all that we are paying on the American loan?  We had the extraordinary position of the Minister asking for American capital on which, as I say, we would have to pay at least 5 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was commenting on the fact that the Government, through its Tánaiste, had asked for American capital to come in here in the form of investment, and I was saying that we would have had to pay 5 per cent. on that, while we are paying only 2½ per cent. on the American loan.</P>
      <P>We had the extraordinary situation of the Minister for Finance talking about foreign capital coming into this country and saying that it was a sterling debt.  He used to refer to this movement of capital into the country as a sterling debt, and yet we had the Minister for Finance, when floating his recent National Loan, asking British investors to invest in it.  What do we find?  That his recent National Loan is the only Irish National Loan which is quoted on the London Stock Exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to be misunderstood by the Minister or by this House.  I think it must be quite clear that we, on this side, would welcome a change in the economic conditions from which this country has been suffering for <Col N="1538" /> two and a half years.  We would welcome a change in Government policy.  We would welcome any improvement in the economy, and we are glad to see that industrial production has risen now to the level it was at in June of 1951, before the change of Government.  I do not think that we can get the progress, or that this country can develop on the lines that we desire unless, as I have said, there is a change of policy by the Government from that which they have been operating over the last two and a half years.</P>
    <P>I suggest that one of the things the Government should do is try to encourage consumption in this State and not be afraid of the imports which would result from an increase in consumption. I suggest that its policy should be directed towards increasing purchasing power in this State and not towards trying to mop it up.  It would not be very difficult to reduce taxation and to help to bring about an increase in purchasing power and an increase in industrial activity.</P>
    <P>One of the most important things that has to be done is to reduce the interest rates.  Some of the ways that these ends could be brought about would be by seeing that the banks hold a larger portion of Government stocks in their portfolios than they do at present and that we would arrive at a situation, which obtains in England and America, by which the banks are holders of the State debt and not the public.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I think one item of policy which can assist our economic situation would be that of investing some of the assets which are held by the Central Bank in Irish Government securities.  The position now is that we have had a period of two and a half years of a different financial policy from that which was operating before the change of Government.  We are anxious for a change.  I do not think that I am speaking merely for my Party or for Opposition Deputies&mdash;I think I am speaking for the many thousands of people who have been put out of employment, or who are now under fear of being out of employment, as a result of the changed circumstances which <Col N="1539" /> this State has experienced in the last two and a half years.  I think I am also speaking for the thousands of people in this State who have been hit so adversely by the rising cost of living over the last two and a half years. I think they, just as we, would welcome a change of Government policy.  If it brings us back to the position of progress, of near full employment, of expanding industry and agricultural production, we certainly on this side of the House would welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to hold the House very long on this matter.  Deputy Costello has put his finger on a very important point, namely, the reduction of imports which the present Government has brought about as a cardinal point in its economic policy.  It is a point to which I have referred on a couple of occasions before. Government spokesmen from time to time have referred with great pride to the reduction in imports which they brought about in the last 12 months and the Minister has said that the economic position was helped by that reduction.  In fact, of course, the exact opposite occurred.  I would have thought that every person, whether an economist or an ordinary man in the street, would have realised that when you are dealing with industries and trade generally you are dealing with a certain volume of finished commodities or of raw materials. When raw materials are brought in, they are processed in various ways, made into manufactured articles and then sold to our people or, in certain cases, they are exported.  If you cut down those imports of raw materials, you are bound to cut down the amount of manufacturing done and therefore you are bound to affect the level of employment.  To say that you are bound to affect the level of employment is somewhat of an understatement: you are bound to create unemployment.  That happened as a direct result of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce cannot but be aware that that happened and that it was brought about by Government policy.  It has <Col N="1540" /> had the most terrible effects on trade and industry.  I am glad to say that, as a result of the hammering away at that economic factor by this side of the House, the Government has somewhat changed its policy and there is more industrial activity now than there was a few months ago, or slightly more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="A Deputy A Deputy">
      <NameTxt>A Deputy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are not more imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Not more imports, somebody says, but the restrictions in that respect have not gone on in the same way.  The change in policy has resulted in a slight increase, but we on this side are afraid that the Government will swing back again.  I might mention that, as a result of the unemployment caused by this restriction of imports, we have found ourselves with a higher level of unemployment, with more people to carry on the backs of those who are employed and consequently an increased cost of living.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Costello said with regard to the increase in the cost of living, the comparison he made between this country and the other Western European States, is of very great significance.  It is something that those on the Government Benches should take to heart.  Quoting from unimpeachable sources, he told us that Greece was the only country in Western Europe which had a comparable rise in the cost of living in the last few years.  I would point out to Deputies on the opposite benches that Deputy Costello has been unusually kind when he includes Greece amongst the western nations.  Greece is really more of a Balkan State and we are accustomed to expecting a somewhat less skilful handling of State and economic matters by Balkan countries than we are by those of Western Europe.  I personally am very sorry to see that we find ourselves in the same position as Greece, a country which may have had a glorious past, but by no stretch of the imagination can it be thought that it has a very sound economic present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That rise in the cost of living which the last Deputy pointed out does show that certain peculiar factors have been <Col N="1541" /> present in this country which were not present in any other European country to the same extent except, perhaps, in France, which was a few points behind us, but France has had grave economic difficulties to deal with and has had political instability of the type which I am happy to say we have not experienced so far.  Again, therefore, for us to be close to the French economy in this connection is not a matter on which we can take any great pride.  We have had nothing like the difficulties which post-war France has so tragically had to deal with.</P>
    <P>We have pointed out two cardinal matters which have affected both the cost of living and the general policy of the Government in relation to economic matters, namely, the credit position and the restriction of imports. Those two things have brought about the position which has slowed down the wheels of industry and has inevitably created increased unemployment. The Government should, consequently, take all the steps that it can to mend matters in this respect.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I know some little thing about the building industry.  If you look at the over-all figures of the building industry you will see they are somewhat down.  Actually the drop in figures does not really show the actual change that has come about in the building industry in the last two or three years.  There is a drop shown now, but, in fact, what has happened is that local authority building has been pushed forward, so has Government building, but private building has fallen away tremendously.  The net result is that there is a decrease in actual building and the Government's policy has this conflicting effect: on the one hand because of the drop in employment in the building trade the Government has, where it is the employer itself, pushed forward schemes and encouraged local authorities to go forward with schemes in order to create employment.  The employment it wished to create in order to deal with the unemployment situation came about as the result of its actions, and we have the very peculiar position of one part of the Government saying: &ldquo;We must push forward public <Col N="1542" /> works of all kinds in order to keep up the level of employment&rdquo;; whilst on the other hand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The policy of the Government as put forward by the Minister under this Vote has meant that there has been a slowing down of the wheels of industry and that has necessitated every branch of the Government pushing forward with schemes in order to create employment.  That is the ridiculous situation which has been brought about by the Government flying in the face of economic laws and economic effects generally.  I trust that the Government will take steps to see that the cost of living is dealt with and kept at the present position if not reduced and that unemployment is handled in a proper fashion.</P>

      <P>The people for whom I speak directly in this House care very little as to the name of the Party in power or the names of the Ministers that make up the Government responsible to the members of this House and to the country.  What we are concerned about and what I personally am concerned about as a fairly old member of this House is the policy of the Government of the day.  This Bill, which contains more power than most members realise, merely proposes, as far as I understand, to continue the policy of this mixum-gatherum Government which came into office in June, 1952.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise it proposes to continue certain powers and to continue <Col N="1543" /> a certain policy, and what is hidden is much more important than what one can read into the Bill.  The principal matter concerning the people as a whole, and particularly those living in the cities and towns, is the ever-increasing cost of living, I want to know&mdash;I do not put this as a personal matter; nor am I putting it for the purpose of scoring any political points against the Minister or his colleagues in government&mdash;why he and his colleagues have failed effectively to control the cost of living?  A very definite pledge was given on that matter by the Minister himself.  More emphasis was laid on that pledge by the Minister than by any of his colleagues but, notwithstanding that, people do not know to-day where they stand in relation to the cost of living. I do not say that the policy of the Government has been deliberately framed for the purpose, but it has in effect paralysed the power and the object for which trade unions were originally established.  The majority of the wage earners, especially those in industrial employment are members, and rightly so, of the unions that cater for the particular industries in which they are employed.  The main purpose of those unions, as originally established, was to bring the standard of living and the wages of the workers up to a figure which would enable them to maintain themselves and their dependents in decency and comfort.</P>

    <P>That was the position to a great extent up to the commencement of the last World War but the trade unions of to-day and the leaders of the unions to-day can go in and negotiate what may be regarded and accepted by their members as a reasonable settlement so far as increased remuneration or wages are concerned, but on the following day the Minister, who is now occupying the Front Bench and his colleague the Minister for Finance, can come in here with taxation proposals and nullify the work done 24 hours previously by trade union leaders on behalf of their members. If there is anything, and it is a good thing that it did happen, that has made trade unionists and wage earners think and think hard it is the <Col N="1544" /> cruel, callous and revolutionary budgetary policy enunciated in the Budget of 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>To his credit let it be said, he is an extremely hard-working member of the Cabinet.  He is carrying at least three-fourths of the Cabinet on his back.  I say that to emphasise another point.  It is because I believe he is such a powerful and influential member of the Cabinet that I must now accuse him of responsibility for the position as we know it in relation to the cost of living to-day. Does not the Minister know perfectly well, as well as anyone sitting behind him or over here, that the by-election results, especially of the by-elections held in the urban areas, and the overwhelming majority achieved by some of the candidates who are now members of this House in those by-elections were mainly due to the overwhelming vote of the women because of the cost of living.</P>
      <P>I do not care personally, or, if you like, politically what Government is sitting over there or who the Ministers are.  All that counts as far as I am concerned and the people for whom I speak is the policy of the Government and not the personalities of those who occupy certain ministerial posts.  I would welcome from the Minister&mdash; and I say this without any political prejudice or personal prejudice against the Minister; I think it is the Minister's duty to give the information to the public&mdash;the reasons why he has not been able to carry out his clear-cut pledges in relation to the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came into this House in the early days and when we repeatedly <Col N="1545" /> from the Labour Benches demanded increased old age pensions we talked about the miserable amount that the famous, or infamous, Lloyd George had given: 10/- a week in the days when our people were represented in the British House of Commons.  What is the purchasing power of the £1 1s. 6d. that we are giving to old age pensioners to-day as against the purchasing power of the 10/- that Lloyd George gave in response to the demands of the Irish Parliamentary Party?  The 10/- in days gone by had a higher value from the point of view of purchasing power than has the £1 1s. 6d.  for which the Minister is responsible to-day.</P>

      <P>I want to know from the Minister is it not a fact&mdash;and let him be realistic in this matter, because the people who go into the shops to-day know the value of the £&mdash;that the 10/- 30 years ago was more valuable than is the £1 1s. 6d. to-day?  Who is responsible for that?  Who carries the heaviest load of responsibility for that? It is the Minister who is now asking us to give him a renewal of the drastic powers contained in and hidden behind this Bill.  I do not accuse the Minister when he promised more effective control of the prices of essential commodities of deliberately misleading the people to whom he gave that pledge, <Col N="1546" /> but will he tell us what steps he will take to implement that pledge?  That is definitely related to the powers contained in this Bill.  Will he tell us even now what steps he proposes to take to honour that pledge given over two and a half years ago?  I do not speak with any great authority or inside knowledge, but the Minister knows that the Prices Advisory Body was set up for a specific purpose and that it has been prevented, and deliberately prevented, and I accuse the Minister definitely of that, from doing the work for which it was established.</P>

The Minister is not responsible for the creation of the body to which I have referred, but he is responsible for giving them work to do so long as they are there and so long as he continues to pay them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many applications have been made to the Department of Industry and Commerce for an investigation of prices apart altogether from the work that could properly be initiated by the Department in matters of that kind?  Is there a dual authority inside the Department in relation to the control of prices?  Is it a fact that a section of the Department of Industry and Commerce has responsibility directly to the Minister for endeavouring to control prices?  As far as I am aware, the Prices Advisory Body was set up for that particular purpose.  I hold they can serve a useful purpose, but it is unfortunately the fact that since this mixum-gatherum Government came into existence in June, 1951, most <Col N="1547" /> of the time of the House has been taken up by the Government in an effort to justify the reversal of the policy of their predecessors and by those on this side of the House in defending the policy of the Government that preceded the present one.

      <P>I suggest&mdash;I hope that you will agree that it is relevant&mdash; that there would have been no necessity <Col N="1548" /> to reduce food subsidies and thereby increase the cost of living if the excess profits tax had been reimposed during the period of office of the inter-Party Government or since this Government came into office.  Do not this Government defend their present position on what was not done by the inter-Party Government?  That is not a realistic way to regard things.  If the inter-Party Government were wrong in doing certain things or in not doing other things, is that any justification for the present Government to follow in their footsteps?  Certainly not. Deputy Allen is on a very slippery slope.  He must remember that the Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;and this is not a Fianna Fáil Government&mdash;had 16 or 17 years to do everything that was good.</P>

There are other things that should have been done by the inter-Party Government. Who prevented them?  The Minister, Deputy Allen and those who are sitting on the far side of this House.  Do they not remember the number of times they marched into the Division Lobby against the Local Authorities (Works) Act, which provided work in this State during the period of its full operation for about 25,000 persons? How many people are employed as a result of the allocations under that Act to-day?  Let Deputy Allen answer for his own constituency.  I will answer for mine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Davin has paid a well-deserved tribute to the Minister, one in which the House will join, but my complaint about the Minister is that he is dominated by a city mentality and cannot see outside this city.  I do not blame the Minister for that.  His natural environment may have brought about that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emphasis has been laid on the <Col N="1550" /> degree of unemployment in the city. I do not want the Minister to imagine for a moment that unemployment is confined to the city.  There is a dismal winter facing the young men of rural Ireland and very little hope of their being able to carry on for the next three or four months.  Every rural Deputy must have the same experience as I have had for the last two or three weeks of men looking for employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has centred around the question of unemployment. City unemployment has been dealt with at great length and I thought the Chair would permit me to deal briefly with the situation in the country and to direct the Minister's attention to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If it can be related to supplies and services, I am prepared to allow the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>If supplies and services can be related to the cost of living, surely unemployment must affect the cost of living.  To that extent it can be related because the cost of living will be a terrible bugbear for the man who has no employment for the next three or four months.  I know dozens and dozens of them in my constituency and there are many such men in every constituency in the country who will be on the verge of starvation for the next few months.  The county councils are the only big employers in rural areas.  Although the Minister for Local Government has provided extra funds for road work, that is not sufficient to counteract the reductions that have been made in other directions, particularly reductions in the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the reductions in the special employment schemes.  I think it is correct to say that in the special employment schemes there has been a reduction of £20,000, and under the Local Authorities (Works) Act a reduction of £250,000.  Where will the young men of the countryside find employment?  The county council cannot employ them all?  How can they live without employment?  During the <Col N="1551" /> summer months they are employed on their own small holdings and during the winter months they are available for work, if they can get it.</P>
      <P>It is all very well about the difficulties of the man on small pay, but are not the difficulties far greater where there is not any pay at all?  Is it the policy of this Government to substitute for that a type of unemployment relief, to call it by its proper name?  Is that a wise Government policy?  Is it a good thing for the Minister to be able to say: &ldquo;We have increased unemployment assistance&rdquo;?  Is that a defence of government?  If this is the line that they intend to take I submit that it is a wrong one.  I repeat what I said here before, when in a answer to a question put down by me some time ago I was told that £1,365,000 was given out in unemployment assistance, that it would be better if that money was put into productive work and improving the land of this country, making it produce more food instead of beggaring those men, dragging them to the police barracks once or twice a week for a mere pittance which is no use to them. If that money was put to providing productive employment I would say that the Government was following a sane policy, but to suggest that because there has been a rise in the cost of living&mdash;which nobody can deny&mdash;but that that has been offset by increased payments in added social welfare schemes, then that is an insane policy and the sooner the Government leave it the better for the country.  I endorse what Deputy Davin said.  As far as this Party is concerned we do not care in the slightest what Party is running the Government.  It is a matter of indifference to us what Government is in the country as long as it is a good Government.</P>

I challenge the Minister to defend a policy which provides for the disposal of £1,365,000 for nothing, for no reward, no return whatsoever, as against the investment of that £1,365,000 on good productive employment.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy agree with me in this, that it would be better to expend £7,500,000 to provide employment for the 50,000 who are unemployed than to leave them unemployed at the moment?  Will the Deputy accept that?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also feel that the Minister and the Government may overlook the fact that there is unemployment in the rural areas as well as in the cities. If the opportunities presented themselves in the rural areas as they do in the cities, we might have masses of people, perhaps, who would have demonstrations in the rural areas such as we have seen in the cities.  I do not want to see that, because I do not want to see demonstrations of that kind even in the cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House or the Minister on this question.  There is very little I have to say on it, and I would not have intervened at all but for the fact that I want to draw attention to that particular matter.  I do not blame the Minister entirely for the increase in the cost of living.  The Government embarked on a certain policy which in their view was the correct policy.  I do not share the view of Deputy Davin that they embarked on that policy for the purpose of discrediting <Col N="1553" /> or disgracing the Government which was in office before them.  I do not think any sensible body of men would embark on a policy like that. Probably they embarked on this policy believing that it was the right one, and, as I said last year, I would not blame any Minister or any Government for embarking on a certain policy and giving it a trial.  Any Government ought to give a certain policy a trial. If in the light of experience gained over one year or over two years or more they find that it is not a good policy for the country, that it is every day putting hardships on the citizens, that it is creating more unemployment, that it is bringing about an increase in the cost of living, that the £ has a lower purchasing power than it had the year before, cannot it declare that it is going to abandon that policy and try a more sensible one?</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Ceann Comhairle would rule me out if I referred to the financial policy of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

There is no doubt that the present policy of the Government has created an increase in the cost of living and increased unemployment, and I would like an indication from the Minister that such measures will be taken as will remedy those two very serious aspects of our economic life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise one particular matter on this Bill.  The Minister stated, when he was introducing his Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, that the Prices Advisory Body was still in existence, and in reply to the debate yesterday he said that that body was still in existence and that he had not interfered with it in any way but that he contemplated permanent legislation and that a measure would be introduced in the future, that this Bill before the House would expire in March, 1955, and that on that account permanent legislation would be necessary. I do not know whether there is any particular merit in permanent <Col N="1554" /> legislation merely because it is so described. In suggesting that permanent legislation would be introduced, the Minister went on to say that the future consideration of prices would be examined on the basis of costs rather than on the effect which price fluctuations would have.  I want to urge on the Minister and the Government the desirability of considering this question now rather than waiting until permanent legislation is enacted. The import prices published show that between 1949 and 1953 there has been a rise from a base of 100 in 1938.  The figure in 1949 was 248; in 1950, 271; in 1951, 331, and in 1952, 334.  Figures recently published show that there is a slight drop this year and that on an average the import prices last year were about 1 per cent.  higher than in 1951, and that in April of this year import prices were 11 per cent.  lower than the peak, which was September, 1951, after the Korean war.</P>
      <P>The O.E.E.C. recently published a survey for Europe which was quoted during the debate on the Estimate recently, and it showed that the cost of living in this country had increased by nine points in the first six months of this year compared with four points, the highest figure for any other European country, those for Norway and Britain.</P>

      <P>Their basis is slightly different from ours, but it shows a plus of nine points for the first six months of this year.  The highest figure for any other country was four points for Norway and Britain, and some others showed some slight changes.  The index, of course, is not the same as our index, but the point is that the rise in this country was the highest of any European country according to their statistics, and I have no doubt it must be based on information supplied at O.E.E.C. meetings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not that plus nine based entirely on the removal of food subsidies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>They took into account the figures of the cost of living here and in Britain.  The point was that it was for the first six months of this year.  Those of the food subsidies which were removed were removed in July of last year.  If that assessment is correct&mdash;that the cost of living here has risen higher than in any other European country in the first six months of this year, with the exception of Greece where it is probably as high&mdash;is it not time, taking into account the fact that import prices have fallen, we should have considered how prices, and especially how import prices, are affecting the cost of living? In most of the European countries the cost of living is substantially lower than it is here.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated he did not interfere with the matters which are being considered by the Prices Advisory Body.  I suggest that these factors should be placed before the Prices Advisory Body and that they should be asked to investigate them.  Whatever data are available to the Department and whatever O.E.E.C. publications are available should be furnished to them.</P>
      <P>They can then consider the position. Recent figures published by the Central Statistics Office show that this year our imports both in value and volume have tended to rise and that, in fact, I think in value and volume, they reached the highest level for any comparable period.  What I want to impress on the Minister to put before the Prices Advisory Body is that if import prices show a reduction&mdash;as they have showed a continuous reduction over the past 12 or 18 months but especially in the nine months of this year&mdash;it should be possible to assemble the facts on which the costs of many commodities, influenced by import prices, are based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, either at question time or later on during the evening the Minister referred to the fact that increased <Col N="1556" /> mechanisation had affected the price of wheat and consequently affected the price of flour.  I do not know whether that is any significant factor in the cost of flour available from the mills here but, on the basis of the present world prices of wheat, it would appear&mdash;certainly up to recently&mdash;that the tendency is for prices to fall.  I do not know whether or not, under the new wheat agreement, we will be obliged to pay more. As I understand that agreement, and how it worked in the past, whenever there was a fall we got the benefit of it.  When prices rose after the Korean war the effect was felt in some cases immediately: in other cases it did not take effect for some time.</P>
    <P>We have now seen falling prices for quite a considerable time and, to all intents and purposes, there has been no significant effect in the cost of living.  Odd commodities have shown a drop here and there although import prices have shown a substantial reduction for many commodities.  The recent cost-of-living index figure showed a drop of only one point&mdash;after it had reached, in May of this year, the highest level ever.  The drop which occurred in August was probably seasonal and may have been related to milk or potatoes or something else like that.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to put before the Prices Advisory Body the various statistics, publications and data which are available, together with the reports compiled by O.E.E.C. and the figures available here, and to ask that body now to investigate the costs rather than defer the matter until a permanent measure is introduced next year.  I do not believe that there is any particular inherent virtue in waiting for permanent legislation.  The Prices Advisory Body have full powers and they have available the staff of the Prices Section of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It ought to be possible for them to consider the effect which costs have on prices and to take particular articles&mdash;especially essential foodstuffs or any other commodities that come within the ambit of the cost of living figure&mdash;and examine the whole matter.  If particular instances <Col N="1557" /> affect costs it ought to be possible to examine them.  So far as the public are concerned, the Prices Advisory Body appear to have been dormant for the past nine months.  There is no use in saying that because that body are still in existence they are still functioning. The figures I have referred to and the publications quoted here show that up to May of this year there was a steady rise in the cost of living.  There has been a slight drop since then, but, for all practical purposes, the present cost of living is at the highest level ever recorded in our history.  That is happening at a time when world prices are falling and when our own import prices in respect of a great many commodities are falling.  We have had lower import prices for successive months over a period of approximately 12 to 18 months.  It ought to be possible to get an accurate assessment and examination by the Prices Advisory Body of prices on the basis of costs and any other influences by which prices are affected.</P>
    <P>I want to put the specific proposal to the Minister that prices of essential commodities should now be referred to the Prices Advisory Body for examination and report.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I want to refer to a particular matter that was raised during Question Time here to-day.  It concerns fertilisers. There is no doubt in the world but that, for the past few years, greater quantities of fertilisers are being used year after year, in the agricultural industry. It seems obvious that an opening exists for the establishment of fertiliser factories in this country.  In my own county, some enterprising businessmen started a fertiliser factory and, frankly, I want protection for it. I believe, from his reply to-day, that the Minister is more or less of the same opinion.  The amount of fertilisers being produced in this country to-day may not be sufficient to meet the absolute requirements of our agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern <Col N="1558" /> is to ensure that these fertiliser factories will be built up and put on a sound footing.  Until that is done, and until they are able to compete with the imported fertilisers, I would be thankful for any protection that the Government or the Minister for Industry and Commerce can give.  I do not know whether or not the concentrated granulated compound fertilisers, to which he referred, are being manufactured here at present.  I only know that the factory which will be in operation in January in New Ross, County Wexford, will specialise in that particular type of fertiliser.  If there is no protection at present for that particular type of fertiliser I urge the Minister, when this factory is in operation, to give it the protection that he gives the ordinary fertilisers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to raise one matter that I referred to here last night by way of question when the Minister was speaking.  It concerns the prices that are now being charged for mineral waters and the methods under which mineral waters are sold.  It seems to me to be extraordinary that it costs as much for a bottle of lemonade which is free of tax as it does for a bottle of stout which is subject to a tax of approximately fourpence a bottle. There appears to be something radically wrong that stout, which is costly to produce, should be sold at the same price as lemonade, although the stout bears a tax of approximately 50 per cent.  of the cost to the consumer of the bottle of stout.  It seems to me that this is a matter that should be referred to the Prices Tribunal to inquire into.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the second matter comes within this Bill or not. I refer to the restrictive practices employed for the purpose of keeping up the price.  There is a particular ring associated with the business which prohibits a particular type of vendor of lemonade from selling it at a price less than they lay down should be charged. It is in the public interest that these matters should be inquired into, and I avail of the opportunity afforded by this measure to draw the Minister's attention to it, so that steps will be taken to investigate it.</P>

      <P>The introduction of this Bill by the Minister did not produce anything in the nature of a hope for the many people who have been awaiting the realisation of the promise by this Government of good things around the corner.  We remember, when the general election campaign of 1951 was in full swing, the criticism there was because the price of butter was increased from 2/8 to 2/10 per lb.  That increase of 2d. per lb. was made the subject of a very violent campaign against the inter-Party Government, which, in fact, had succeeded in keeping the cost of living down to within 3 per cent. of the figure at which it stood when they took over.  When that Government took over, the figure was around 101 and towards the end of 1949 it had dropped to 99 or 98.  I think it was 99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Say 99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave it at 99. We then had the situation in which the Korean War developed.  A stockpiling campaign was carried on, and, in spite of the best efforts of the inter-Party Government, the cost of living rose 3 per cent. to 103.  In the meantime, however, wage levels had been increased on the average 20 per cent. during those three and a half years, and with an increase of only 3 per cent. in the cost of living, the balance of prosperity was in favour of all classes of people, whether wage-earners, traders, farmers or other persons receiving incomes or deriving benefit as a result of these increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> When the general election campaign was in full swing, the cost of living was the real issue and the increase of 2d. per lb. on butter was used most effectively in Dublin City, and probably in Cork City and Limerick City, but when the change of Government took place, the first action taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce was to decontrol certain prices, with the immediate result of increasing the cost of living.  People were not warned during that campaign that this decontrol was going to take place.  It is a remarkable fact that the improved situation, with the emergency long passed, has not come about and that conditions at present are worse than they were.  I heard the Minister say that the trade recession had passed and that things were better, but, if they are better, why have we more unemployed this year than last year, if the trade position last year was worse than it is this year?</P>
    <P>In considering prices in relation to this Bill, we must remember that no effort has been made by the Government to keep prices down. In fact, looking over the record of the past two and a half years, it seems that the Government deliberately decided to mop up the margin of prosperity which was brought to the people during the inter-Party Government régime.  It is being mopped up now by the increased prices and higher cost of living.  When the Government was being formed, point 15 in the Fianna Fáil programme, published at the time with a view to securing the support of persons other than Fianna Fáil Deputies, set out that it was the policy of the Party to maintain food subsidies and to control the prices of all essential commodities, but that clause has long since been deleted, because, only a few months after the change of Government, the prices of many essential commodities were decontrolled, and only a year after, in the Budget of 1952, the prices of other foodstuffs were increased.  The price of butter was increased from 2/10 to 3/10 per lb., and, during the last 12 months, the price of butter has been further increased by 4d., making it 4/2 per lb.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1561" /> The housewife of 1951, before the change of Government, could buy three pounds of butter for 8/- and at present that amount of butter costs 12/6.  She could buy a lb. of butter and a loaf of bread for 3/4½d. which is now 5/-, all but a halfpenny.  Similarly, the price of sugar has been almost doubled, and by ministerial Order.</P>
    <P>It has increased to 7½d. per lb. compared with 4d. per lb. before the change of Government.  When it was decided to decontrol tea which was available at 2/8 per lb., it was suggested that the decontrol of price would mean that there would be competition and that consumers would get cheap tea.  Instead of that, it is a very poor type of tea that can be got at less than 5/- per lb. as compared with the previous price of 2/8.  Again, the housewife who normally uses flour for the purpose of home baking paid only 2/8 a stone for flour before the change of Government.  Flour at the present time costs 4/9½ per stone, while the price of the loaf of bread has been increased from 6½d. to 9½d.  Taxes have been imposed on spirits and beer with a consequent sharp increase in prices.  The result is that the purchasing power of the week's wages has been considerably reduced.  In fact, we saw that in the first 18 months' administration of the present Fianna Fáil Government, the purchasing power of the pre-war £ fell 2/-.  It fell from 10/10 to 8/8, taking the 1939 purchasing power of the £ as the basis for that calculation.</P>
    <P>The increase in food prices particularly had the effect or reducing the value of wages and bringing down the standard of living of the people.  The first concern of any Government&mdash;and it was the first concern of the inter-Party Government&mdash;should be to improve the standard of living of our people, to give them a greater margin over and above the cost of bare essentials, in order that they would be able to improve their standard of living.  The deliberate decision of the Fianna Fáil Government to withdraw the subsidies meant that, in fact, they were deducting so much from the incomes of our people, whether their incomes took the form of wages or <Col N="1562" /> profits.  They had to meet those extra costs from the margin left to them over and above the cost of meeting bare essentials.</P>
    <P>I consider that we had not reached a stage in this country when it was proper for us to withdraw the food subsidies overnight without arranging to compensate for that loss in some other way.  If we were to embark on a policy that would bring general prosperity to the country, it might be urged that people could participate in that prosperity and that they might be compensated in some respects for these increased charges. but the policy that was pursued had the effect of bringing about a serious trade recession, the restriction of credit and a standstill in the business world.  We have not yet recovered from that position.</P>
    <P>These conditions were deliberately brought about by the Fianna Fáil Government when they came into office in order to make people believe that the inter-Party Government had not done a good job during their three years' administration.  The people have had time since to sit back and judge for themselves.  The verdict we got from the people of Cabra-Glasnevin district only this time last year showed clearly that they did not approve of the policy of the present Government, particularly in relation to food prices and the decontrol of prices in respect to many essential commodities.  They did not approve either of a policy which caused so much unemployment amongst the people.  We cannot say at this stage that the position has improved since last year.  We can produce figures to show that, in fact, the position this year is worse than it was last year.  For instance, we can take the figures for unemployment and we can say that there are more people working on relief schemes at the present time than ever before.  Many of these schemes were introduced simply and purely for the purpose of absorbing unemployed workers who would otherwise have no alternative but to draw unemployment benefit and sign on at the exchanges.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister did not indicate in his speech this evening that <Col N="1563" /> there is any prospect of improvement in relation to the standard of living of our people, the purchasing power of wages and stability in the matter of prices.  The only stability apparent, so far as prices are concerned, is that they just cannot go any further as the people would not be able to bear a higher level than exists at the present time.  During the last year it is significant that tariffs in respect to many goods have been increased.  They have been increased by remarkably high percentages.  The Minister, I am sure, will argue that these increases were justified and that if they were not applied there might be greater unemployment.</P>

      <P>I just wanted to point out that these increased tariffs must be borne in the long run by the ordinary consumer in the form of increased prices for the various commodities to which these tariffs are applied. As I say, it might be argued that they were justified, but when we consider the high cost of living at the present time and realise that these extra burdens must be carried by ordinary consumers in the form of higher prices, the question arises whether, in fact, such high tariff levels as have been applied in many cases were justified.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think, so, Sir. Then during the last year we had an increase in the price of gas to the consumers and E.S.B. charges in some respects have increased.  The price of <Col N="1564" /> coal has not shown any encouraging drop.  I believe that during the last year bus fares were also increased. All these increases must be borne by the ordinary consumer but it appears that the Government is not concerned about the heavy burdens these people must carry.  When the Budget of 1952, which caused so much consternation in the country, was introduced, the only compensation in their allowances which the poorer sections of the community got was 1/6 per week, whether these allowances were in the form of old age pensions, widows' pensions or other allowances.  That 1/6 a week was supposed to be the amount which would meet the increased cost of living at that time.  But we are told by old age pensioners and widows that, in spite of the 1/6 per week increase which they got to meet the increase in the cost of living, it is more difficult for them to feed and clothe themselves than ever before.</P>
      <P>Then we are importing more butter than we ever imported before in spite of the assurance given by the Minister for Agriculture in the autumn of 1951 that after the spring of 1952 we would not be importing butter any more.  We are importing more butter now than we ever imported and the prospect for the production of our home butter is not bright.  The Minister for Agriculture indicated that arrangements had been made to import a further 500 tons of butter, in addition, I think, to 400 tons on order and 500 tons in store. That butter is being purchased at 3/3 a lb.  and the difference between that and 4/2 is to be carried, apparently, by the consumer to meet the cost of distribution and to give profits to those engaged in the trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen from the statistical survey that the average price of imports has fallen 14 points in the last year.  Although import prices have fallen and should be reflected here in the form of reduced prices, we find the cost of living tending to rise.  During the last 12 months the cost of living has been inclined to rise instead of to fall, although there is a definite fall in the cost of imported goods.  The advantage of the fall in the price of imported goods is probably offset by the tariffs imposed in respect of many of them <Col N="1565" /> During the last year also the road tax on motor cars, lorries and vans has been increased, particularly on agricultural lorries which were increased from £25 to £75 in many cases. The tax on some private cars was increased and it was reduced on others. The tax on tractors was also increased from £6 to £8.  All these things have their effect, because the traders using these lorries and vans must pass on these increased costs to the consumer and in the long run it is the consumer who has to meet them, and the cost of living must continue to rise when these increased taxes are being imposed. Postal charges have also been increased and they must also have an effect indirectly on the cost of living.</P>
    <P>When you add up all these increases it means that impossible conditions have been created for many people, particularly the wage-earners.  It may be argued that the increase in the children's allowances had the effect of reducing the burden for many people with families.  Certainly if the increase had not been given the position would be very much worse.  But the steep rise in the cost of food and clothing has offset any advantage which the increased children's allowance might have given.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister was so brief in his introductory statement, because if ever the economic situation in relation to prices and supplies and services needed to be reviewed it was this year.  I understand that many butchers have gone out of business although the price of meat has been decontrolled; that there were more butchers in business when the price of meat was controlled and that the decontrol of meat prices has caused many butchers to go out of business.</P>
    <P>A few years ago when Fianna Fáil were on this side of the House the Government at that time were obliged to meet much criticism and controversy in relation to the cost of living.  Some of the increases which were the subject of controversy at that time were the direct result of the Korean war. The Fianna Fáil Party, however, denied at that time that the Korean war situation and the position <Col N="1566" /> generally in the world had the effect of increasing prices.  Looking back now we find that the inter-Party Government were unfairly criticised by Fianna Fáil Deputies at that time, I would even say unscrupulously, because when we examine the facts now we can see that the Korean war had much to do with the difficult situation which it was necessary for the inter-Party Government to handle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It continued afterwards. It was argued by the Minister in the debate on his Estimate that many of the difficulties which our people are obliged to face in relation to the price of consumer goods were caused by or resulted from the Korean war.  The Budget of last May was heralded as a great success because there were no increased taxes imposed. But the fact was that the very steep increases which were applied to the Budget of 1952 were maintained in the Budget last May and since that the prices of several commodities have been increased by ministerial Order.</P>
      <P>With restriction of credit, the trade recession and the high cost of living, business is almost stagnant.  Business people are complaining that there is no stir and that people are not spending money.  They are not spending money because they have not got a margin to spend after they have met the ordinary essentials by way of food, clothing and rent.  It is regrettable that the Minister did not on this occasion indicate whether any steps would be taken by the Government to improve business and bring back the prosperity we enjoyed some years ago.</P>

Christmas spending is the only relief which the business community can expect this side of 1954, because there is a very serious stoppage in the business world at the present time.  Public houses only have visitors now during the week-ends and never during the <Col N="1567" /> day-time.  A publican may have a few customers late at night but in the ordinary way there is no business done during the day-time.  There are other examples.  Take drapers' shops, for instance.  They are almost in the same position except that drapery is the one business which can have some hope this side of Christmas as a result of a boom in business.  We can take other classes of shops which used to be crowded but in which, on an average day, there is very little stir now.</P>
    <P>The fact that the loan was not fully subscribed recently shows that the money is not there.  It is being absorbed by the increased cost of food, clothing, rent and the ordinary bare essentials associated with the maintenance of family life.  I trust, when the Minister is replying, that he will give us some hope that the Government will take steps to improve those conditions.</P>
    <P>The relief schemes upon which they have embarked very vigorously in Dublin City especially and possibly down the country, too, are not going to last for ever.  Even though the people engaged on those relief schemes at the present time are able to get their week's wages, there is not much prospect of constant employment on works of that nature.</P>
    <P>I think it was unfair of the Minister in his speech on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce to mention that the trade recession had passed and business was better. If that was the case, there would be fewer unemployed to-day than there were 12 months ago when, in fact, there are more, in spite of the very great number of panic relief schemes that were devised in order to absorb as far as possible the very large number of unemployed people, apart from the many people who are obliged to emigrate.  Emigration during the past year was never so great.  It can be traced in great measure to the very high cost of living, which was the deliberate policy of the present Government which they decided upon themselves.  They had a choice of either maintaining subsidies, and providing butter at 2/8 per lb., sugar at <Col N="1568" /> 4d. per lb., tea at 2/8 per lb., bread at 6½d. or abolishing the subsidies and increasing those prices.</P>
    <P>The time had not come when those subsidies could be abolished, as the Government had not made any arrangements to provide for the loss which would be suffered by the people who were obliged to meet those increased prices.</P>

      <P>At the present time we see that a very high tax is being applied in respect of spirits.  We have seen it demonstrated that if the tax on spirits, particularly whiskey, were reduced, the revenue from the lower tax would bring in a greater return. The law of diminishing returns has certainly demonstrated itself in respect of the tax on whiskey.  It has been clearly shown that if the tax on whiskey were reduced it would be possible to get a greater revenue.</P>
      <P>The tax on the pint of stout was a cruel blow to many of the working-class people, particularly in the North Wall area of Dublin City, who always depended on the pint of stout and a sandwich for their dinner.  Those people are now obliged to pay a higher tax on this beer.  The tragedy is that in spite of those increases the tax on dance-halls was abolished.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister, when he is replying, whether there is any prospect of the prices of the various commodities coming down and whether the Government proposes to take any steps which would have the effect of bringing those prices down.  His reply might be that this time last year the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill was brought in to <Col N="1569" /> create a measure of competition which might have the effect of bringing down prices.  The Restrictive Trade Practices Bill was only a gesture.  It was not effective.  Whether it was intended to be effective or not is another question, but there is a feeling amongst traders that the Restrictive Trade Practices Bill was not the way to tackle the question of reducing prices because in many respects it would encourage the establishment of hucksters' shops.</P>

      <P>I want to say in relation to the prices of food and clothing that we had a housewives' association in the country a couple of years ago.  They were very interested in the price of food, and rightly so. They showed themselves to be particularly active in regard to food prices and clothing prices in 1950, and carried on a vigorous campaign at that time. Since then, as we know, prices have been increased considerably, but now we never hear a word from that <Col N="1570" /> association.  In view of that one wonders whether, in fact, they were inspired by the Fianna Fáil Party in 1950, or whether they were the Fianna Fáil Party under cover carrying on that campaign.  In fact, they are not now showing the same vigorous interest in keeping down prices.  I hope that the Minister will indicate, when replying, whether there is any prospect of the price of food, clothing and rent coming down in the coming year.</P>

      <P>When speaking on the Estimate yesterday I made an effort to draw attention to the conditions of the unemployed in this city. The Minister, when replying last night, glossed over the points that I had made, and evidently did not think them worth replying to.  I still think that the biggest problem which this House has to face is that of unemployment, especially in the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1571" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply asking how, with the cost of living at the present figure, people can afford to buy the ordinary foodstuffs.  You have men drawing unemployment benefit, 38/-per week for themselves, a wife and a family of four, six or more children. There is no increase in the payment to the man with the larger family.  How can they live in reasonable comfort with the loaf which used to cost 6d., now costing 9d.?</P>
      <P>The last speaker attempted to draw attention to the increase in the price of butter.  Bacon and eggs, at to-day's prices, no longer appear on the table of the unemployed working man.  I think something should be done to make our people in the City of Dublin more contented.  That would be a big step in the right direction and would help to bring peace and happiness to the country.</P>
      <P>We should not shut our eyes to the fact that big numbers of our people are obliged to go to foreign countries to earn the living which they should be getting at home.  One can see at the North Wall or at Dún Laoghaire how the country is being denuded of its population.  I think it is the duty of any Government, no matter what Government we have, to see that men will get an opportunity of being able to earn a decent living in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have read in the newspapers that certain new industries have been started.  I hope they will continue to grow in number.  I am afraid, however, that the new industries will not be able to take the place of the building industry from the point of view of providing employment.  So far as the building industry is concerned there has been a depression in it lasting over the last couple of years.  When speaking yesterday, I indicated that, in my opinion, that depression was largely due to the curtailment of credit by the banks. The small builders, in consequence, have been unable to provide employment. The result is that we have men who used to be employed on that industry leaving the country and going across the water.  This Government, and all Governments, should realise that our population to-day of 3,000,000 <Col N="1572" /> is just the same as it was over 30 years ago when this State was set up.  It is no greater, and there is no use hiding the fact that in the years that have intervened conditions have not improved in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to make my own line of argument on behalf of the people whom I represent by drawing the attention of the Minister to the conditions under which they are living.  Two years ago, the price of the loaf was increased from 6d. to 9d. The people are complaining about the prices they have to pay while their income is becoming lower and lower every day.  They are able to buy less with the money they are getting.  Take the case of an old age pensioner with 21/6 a week.  Will anyone say how he can live on that?  First of all, the rent amounts to 4/- or 5/- for a room in the tenement quarters in the city. What is happening is that our gracious board of assistance officers are called upon to subsidise these people by giving them an extra 4/- or 5/- a week or maybe 10/-.  But that extra 10/- is taken out of their hands by the increase in the cost of living over the last year or two.  The Government should do something, and do it quickly, as far as the City of Dublin is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Dublin Corporation have started relief schemes with the idea of giving those people something better than they would get in the way of unemployment benefit.  These relief schemes, however, can last only for a couple of months.  The Government is now getting notice in advance that it must prepare and do something for those people.  It must give them decent employment at decent wages when the temporary schemes on which they are <Col N="1573" /> employed are finished, as they soon will be.</P>
    <P>We are doing our best to provide employment for 1,000 men in the City of Dublin, but how long it is going to last I do not know.  In the meantime, the cost of living position has not improved and industries have closed down.  Take the case of a well-known Dublin firm in existence over 100 years which had to allow 100 of its staff, earning fairly good wages, to go on to the unemployment market. It is no harm to mention the name of the firm; these people went into voluntary liquidation, and this old Dublin firm, McMaster, Hodgson, was respected by all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly have no respect of mine for the way they treated their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I meet these people and I hear their grievances.  It is my duty to listen to them, to give advice and help wherever I possibly can. Surely it is my duty, when I hear of a firm like that going into liquidation and causing unemployment for 100 men, to make an inquiry and put in a word for them?</P>
      <P>Take the case of the theatre business. I understand that about 100 members of the staffs of our theatres have gone within the last couple of weeks.  What is to become of these people?  They are not going to sit back and rest content because they have a native Government.  Is it not up to the Government to devise ways and means of securing employment or of encouraging others to find suitable employment for the people so dismissed? What one feels alarmed at is that if one stands up in this House to put a case forward reasonably and state what is going on around the corner they jump at you and make a political issue of it.  The difficulties in Dublin do not involve a political issue.  We must tell whatever Government is in power that they must face this problem, that they must give employment and give people an opportunity of rearing their families in Ireland instead of having to emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> The conditions around the City of Dublin are well known to everybody. The cost of living to-day is higher than ever it was.  Bacon and eggs are unpurchasable by the working classes, the prices are so high.  It is up to the Government to give some encouragement to the people that things will be better and to make them better without delay.  It is unwise to delay in bringing down the cost of living and providing employment or encourageing others to provide employment for the people.  I referred yesterday to the fact that the money is tied up, that banks have restricted credit and will not help those engaged in industry on a small scale to provide employment. They have fabulous security.</P>

      <P>With respect, Sir, I would point out that the problem with which I am dealing is not one for any particular Minister.  It is a Government matter; it is a matter for the 14 or 16 members sitting on those Front Benches to devise ways and means which will bring comfort to the people. That is not going into politics.  I do not wish to touch on politics at all.  If <Col N="1575" /> you go down to the North Wall you will see splendid men there unemployed. It is due to the position in regard to imports and exports.  These men were engaged in loading goods on ships which industrial firms were sending away; they were also engaged in taking goods off ships and they now find themselves out of work.  Our shipyards and dockyards and other places of employment are waiting for some kind of encouragement.  I hold it is not necessary to find a superman to put forward schemes to solve the problem. The 16 or so expert members of the Government with expert advisers should be able to cope with the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In my humble estimation the three outstanding problems that any Government must face at the present time are, first of all, the cost <Col N="1576" /> of living, secondly, the 60,000 or so unemployed and, thirdly, a rural problem, the flight from the land.  These are three problems that must occupy the attention of any Government who want to retain the confidence of the people or of this House.  I hold that the Government with its niggardly, tight-fisted policy has definitely taken the wrong road.  On several occasions they were given advice to follow the line their predecessors took but it is only now they are beginning to realise the harm they have done by their close-fisted policy, cutting down on everything and restricting credit which has brought hardship and privation into almost every home in the country. I want to tell the Tánaiste that one of the results of that particular policy is that the bulk of the people appear to be growing steadily poorer to the advantage of a very small handful. That is not a desirable situation.</P>
      <P>If I may digress for a moment, I want to refer to the question Deputy Cowan posed to Deputy Finan of this Party as to how £7,500,000 provided by the Government would give employment to 50,000 men.  Putting a fool question like that would not catch anyone. The answer is that we did not provide £7,500,000 in the period 1948-1951, but we provided conditions that allowed people to give employment and to take in a number of employees they never had before.  I advise the present Government to go back to that policy. No Government can undertake to provide wages out of taxation for every worker in the country.</P>

I did not stand up for the purpose of blaming the present Government or to play politics.  What I want to do is&mdash;and I believe it is my duty to do it&mdash;to give my ideas and views on how this country should be run to the best advantage.  Even though Fianna Fáil might then regard themselves as picking our brains or my brains, they are very welcome to do so, as it is our duty to do it.  I have never been one, when sitting on this side of the House or on that side, who would say that anything that came from political opponents was all wrong and all rotten, because it was from political opponents.  The Tánaiste knows quite well that before the inter-Party Government time, from 1943, when we first came in, and since then, in any measure which was for the good of the people we have always clapped the Government on the back and supported them.</P>

      <P>No, I doubt if we have made you dizzy, because since you got into office you have been so busy trying to malign your political opponents that you have done damage to the country.  I could very easily take the easy political road that a person in opposition can take and say that the Government should provide £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 to give work to every able-bodied man.  I see an easier method, that is, to bring about a set <Col N="1578" /> of conditions the same as obtained a few years ago just before the present Government took office, whereby people could employ one another.  There was such a wave of prosperity and building-up and development that the trouble was, during our term of office, that we actually had to advertise for men and women in England and ask them to come home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Give us the figures.  A short time ago they were up to 90,000. The highest in our time was 30,000. The Minister knows quite well that the unemployment register can never be broken down completely, that on the unemployment register there are always some who, through an act of God or through no fault of their own, are not capable of employment.  On another Vote I will give my ideas on that.  Nevertheless, during our period in office unemployment was never as low.  We had left office only a very short time when it started to soar, due principally to the cost of living created by the hard-fisted policy the Government has adopted since it came into office.  There were 60,000 unemployed in 1953.  If that is a credit to the present Government, I have to learn a whole lot over again.  It is well within their power to stop the high cost of living that has not contributed anything to the welfare of the nation. In 1947, long before the inter-Party Government took office, that policy was beginning to manifest itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said here on previous occasions that I blame the present Government for taking advice that some of them surely must know is all wrong. We were given the very same advice and rejected it, and I am proud now that we rejected it&mdash;as the people on that side of the House have proved we were right, in a much better way than ever we could prove it ourselves. The food subsidies were completely abolished and there was no compensating <Col N="1579" /> adjustment to balance what was taken from the people in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister must regard the present flight from the land as making a very dangerous situation.  Every train and boat that goes out carries some away who will never come back, and the unfortunate part is that it is the youth that are going.  The Government is chiselling down on all works. I do not know whether it is the advice that caused the present Government to put the taxes on tobacco, drink and cinema seats in 1947 that is inducing them to do the same to-day.</P>

When the Parliamentary Secretary made his tour of the West last spring 12 months I think he learned quite a little about forestry. He must realise now that the people regarded it as a first-class means of checking unemployment and the flight from the land.  I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary yielded to the Minister for Lands and the pressure of the Minister for Finance; forestry does not count any longer and it must be cut down.

Some of that increase was due to increased productivity but, when the Minister for Finance broke down the figure, we found there was only an increase of £2.8 million and the remainder&mdash;that is, £17.2 million-represented the food that our own people were denied the right to purchase and consume.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen will not draw me from the point I am making. I am blaming the present Government for accepting a policy from people behind the scenes.  I know what I am talking about because I know the advice that we got from these people when we were in office.  We were strongly advised to continue the tax on tobacco and drink, to chisel down expenditure, to restrict everything, to reduce expenditure all round.  We see what that policy has meant.  In two years they borrowed £45,000,000 and <Col N="1585" /> have raised in taxation, by increasing the cost of food, another £30,000,000. The Minister will not tell us that that is to pay off the debts that the inter-Party Government left because all the debts that have been paid for as yet was £500,000.  To pay off £500,000 the Government has blistered the people by raising the cost of living to the tune of about £30,000,000 in one and a half years and have borrowed £45,000,000. That is a new type of finance.  I do not claim to be a financier, but that strikes me as being rather strange.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste may tell us when he is replying why it is necessary, in order to pay off £500,000 interest and principal of Marshall Aid which fell due this year, to borrow £45,000,000 in two years&mdash;£20,000,000 before it fell due at all&mdash;and, at the same time, to impose taxes on food and petrol, and to increase the road tax.</P>
      <P>I recall the nightmare of last summer and winter when Minister after Minister and Parliamentary Secretary after Parliamentary Secretary came in here to impose fresh taxes, running into about £30,000,000.  I would like someone to break down the £45,000,000 that was borrowed and the £30,000,000 taxation into easily digested figures.</P>

Does the Tánaiste remember that?  There was a biscuit factory proposed for Ballina.  The biscuits have gone so mouldy that I will not mention them.</P>
      <P>To-day I asked permission of the Ceann Comhairle to raise a question on the Adjournment.  The Chair kindly gave me permission to raise it.  In order to spare the Minister and the House, I shall refer very briefly to it now.  I have received further proof that the Minister has not the correct information on this subject.  All I ask him to do is to make inquiries.  Will he buy an ordinary sample, say, a halfstone or a stone of ordinary whole flour as it comes from the mills, leave it in a warm place in the kitchen for four to six days, put a pane of glass over the vessel that contains it and leave it undisturbed for five or six days?  If it does not walk the pane of glass off I will take back every word I said.  I hope the Minister, in his reply, will have something to say on that matter. I do not raise this as a joke.  I have medical authority for saying that what is happening is injuring the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, under the Supplies and Services Bill, has power to make an Order compelling millers to clean the wheat in the way that neighbouring countries do it.  I want to see wheat grown here.  It will give employment and provide food for the people and will earn a profit for the farmers.  The millers have enough profit out of flour to enable them to clean it before they mill it.  It is not good enough, for the sake of making the millers' lot easy or allowing them plenty of profit, to allow them to sell flour that is not clean.  I read in a West of Ireland paper about an unfortunate shopkeeper who was fined because there were weevils in the <Col N="1587" /> flour.  That shopkeeper had no more responsibility for that than I have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 2 of the Principal Act the Minister has power to make an Order in respect of this matter.  I am asking the Minister to make an Order under this Act compelling millers to clean wheat before grinding it.  If millers in neighbouring countries have been doing that for 50 to 60 years, it is not too much to ask our millers to do it.  I am assured on good authority that the cost of cleaning will not be more than 3d. per cwt. If 3d. per cwt. will make too great an inroad on the millers' profits, the millers can give up milling.</P>
      <P>That is what I have to say on this Bill.  I do ask the Government even at this late hour to change their policy, this policy of the restriction of credit which is freezing up the whole lifeblood of this country, and give a free hand to the banks to make loans available for building and for employment and so on, because the restriction that has been imposed by the present Government has done nothing except to bring about forced unemployment.  I want to bring to the Minister's notice also that the day has come when the banks will not now give a loan to a man with a vested farm in his name. That is a pretty desperate and a pretty bad situation, to think that if a farmer who owns a holding or a farm of £600 or £700 worth goes into a bank for a loan of £100, £150 or £200 the bank will not give it, and the reason they give is that the Government have told them to restrict credit.</P>

Every Deputy knows as well as I do that no farmer, vested or unvested, will find his land taken as security for a loan by the banks.  That has had bad effects in many ways.  The owners of property, and builders, cannot get credit, and the result is that <Col N="1590" /> as soon as their little private funds are exhausted they must lay off men. Another result is that because the working men feel this uncertainty in the air we cannot expect them to give of their best while working with that sword held over their heads, suspended by a threat of being sacked on a Saturday night or told: &ldquo;I am sorry, I have nothing for you to do on Monday.&rdquo;  I say to the Minister in all sincerity: &ldquo;Go back on that policy and reverse all that policy.  The worst that can be said is that you are following a policy of your predecessors in office, but that will be easily got over, and the good that will accure from that will flow into every home in this country and will more than offset any criticism that may come from that action.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Supplies and Services Bill.  I believe that every Deputy in this House should make a particular case for his particular constituency or in a particular way. When speaking here last week on the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, I made a particular plea for the town of Fermoy, one of the towns which I have the honour to represent here in Dáil Éireann.  I would like for a few moments this evening to refer at this stage to the unemployment problem that prevails in the very same town on which I spoke here last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot go into detail of that kind, and will not be permitted to do so, on the Bill.  The Deputy must relate his remarks generally to the Bill, but not in the detail into which he would like to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I bow to your ruling, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I still believe that I can call it any name I like.  The town of Fermoy can be called anything, and if not referred to as any particular town in this country or mentioned by name, then I take it that I can say that the unemployment problem in this particular town in which I have a particular interest is greater now than ever before since the foundation of the State.  I suggest in all seriousness to the Minister that there is a solution for that problem, and that there is a general solution for the unemployment problem throughout the country.  Deputy Blowick mentioned a figure of 60,000, but with all due respect, I think he underestimated that figure.  I believe it is 75,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Have it between you. The actual figure is 51,000 at the <Col N="1592" /> moment.  That is the number registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Minister knows as well as I do, and every member of the House, that you may add at least something to that.  There is a difference between your 51,000 and my 75,000, so I will compromise and say 60,000.  In all seriousness, I suggest that there is a solution for this problem.  I think it should be tackled again, and that it can be tackled in a serious and effective way if, rather than seeing the people fleeing from the provincial towns to the cities or from the cities to England, some definite attempt should be made to establish some kind of industry by which those people could be kept in gainful employment in their own towns.  I mention no town in particular. I really suggest that there is that solution to the problem.  I do know that the Minister, even though I was not here last evening, in his reply to the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce made some reference to the fact that some Deputies thought that he could pull factories out of his pocket and establish them in various parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Possibly I was one of those Deputies whom he had in mind.  During that debate I made it very clear that I did not believe that the Minister was entirely responsible for the establishment of factories in any particular area but I believe&mdash;and here is where I correlate my remarks&mdash;that more factories could be established in provincial towns if a lead were given by Government Departments.  I agree with the statement made by the Minister last evening that it is not his job to pick a factory out of his pocket and to place it in any specific town, North, South, East or West&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not believe that what <Col N="1593" /> I am about to say now is a repetition of what I said last week.  I believe that the perfect solution for the unemployment problem is the decentralisation of industry and the establishment of factories throughout provincial Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest conscientiously and seriously to the Minister&mdash;and I believe that I am entitled to refer to this matter on this Bill&mdash;that the present high cost of living is responsible for many of the difficult problems in rural and provincial Ireland.  I do not believe there is any justification for the high cost of living and it is the duty of any Government and any Minister for Industry and Commerce to take immediate and effective steps to reduce it.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that I can see no evidence whatsoever that any steps are being taken to reduce the cost of living. It is unanimously admitted that, as a result of increased and extra taxation, money is extremely scarce.  It has, in addition, declined in purchasing power.  Yet no effective steps or, for that matter, no steps at all are being taken to improve conditions and to try to lessen the hardships that our people are suffering from.  I say now to the Minister that if I were a Minister&mdash;it may be too much to hope for but maybe I will be some day: at any rate, I know all the snags&mdash;I would take immediate steps on the lines I have indicated to keep our people at home in rural Ireland.  I believe that despite the high cost of living, so long as we can keep our people at home and in useful and gainful employment we will be doing a good day's work.  If the Minister takes action on the lines I have indicated I believe that the conditions which exist throughout the country at the present time will change to such an extent that it will be very easy to keep our people there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country has three very grave problems at the present time.  These are the high cost of living, rampant unemployment and the flight of our people <Col N="1594" /> from the land to our cities and towns or, worse still, to Britain.  A few hundred years ago, our poet Oliver Goldsmith said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A bold peasantry, their country's pride</P>
    <P>When once destroyed can never be supplied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement is more true to-day than it was when it was written by the poet.  Taking all these facts into consideration and bearing in mind that the manhood and the life power of our country is ebbing with continuous emigration, then, whether we be in Government or in Opposition, we must do our utmost to tackle the problem and to try to arrest the tragic flight from the land.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that the main theme on which I wanted to speak this evening was the rampant unemployment throughout the country and my belief that there is a solution for that problem.  I have made suggestions to the Minister and to the Government and if they will tackle the problem in the way I have suggested this evening and in the way I have been suggesting since I came into this House a short time ago, that is, to desist from centralising every industry in Dublin, which is already topheavy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If, this very evening, we could decide here and now in this House that so many fewer people will be unemployed to-morrow, we would be doing good work.  I have suggested a way to the Minister and to the Government to enable them to do so.</P>

      <P>Much can be discussed on this Bill.  I am satisfied that it more or less covers the life of the people.  I listened to the speeches made during the course of this debate and I am convinced that it is essential to bring home to the Government the serious plight of a vast number of people in our rural areas.  The wage packet of the worker is too small.  It is not sufficient to pay for the necessaries of life and the result is that many unfortunate people are in sore want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on behalf of workers who have not continuous work the whole year round but who get a few months casual work and are then unemployed for a while and are taken on again later.  Those people are in a sore plight at the present time.  A few years ago it was possible for those people to supplement their meagre earnings by keeping maybe a pig or two or maybe poultry.  That was at a time when meal and oats were reasonably cheap in price.  The ordinary cottier I knew in the past was able to keep a pig or two in his little byre and, after fattening it up, he <Col N="1596" /> would sell it, and with the money he would get for it he would buy clothes and footwear for his children.  Then, again, his wife used to keep anything from five to ten or 20 hens which supplied them with eggs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that nowadays these people's sole income is whatever they get in their wage packet and that they are unable to engage in a little private industry as they were in former times.  They cannot have the little private industry now because the cost of feeding-stuffs is too high for them to rear pigs or to keep poultry.  Therefore, they are utterly dependent on their week's wages.  The position is getting very serious indeed, and that is true not only of the under-dog but also of the white-collar workers.  Take, for instance, the teaching profession.</P>
      <P>Is it not a fact that school managers all over the country can hardly get a teacher to fill a position in their schools?  They have to advertise for months before they can get one and we know that teachers are resigning, getting out of teaching and going into other employment inside and outside the country because the wage packet they receive is too small to enable them to make ends meet.</P>

      <P>I want to say that the wage packet of these people is so small that they cannot make ends meet and they have to get out of teaching.  I saw a Guard in my own area having to leave the force and going over to England to seek bigger wages.  That is a serious position.  The Government may say that the country is living in the lap of luxury.  That is so for many people, people flying around on wheels to-day who, a few years ago, were on asses and carts.  They, however, are not the type of people who make up the nation and it is the under-dog and the great mass of the people who feel the present position most severely. <Col N="1597" /> They see their children hungry and they see dry bread being given to them as they go out to school.  Forty or 50 years ago, children went out to school with what we call &ldquo;a clout of dry bread in the corner of their fists&rdquo; and now that day is back again.  I see them in my own area going out with the dry bread and without the bottle of milk they used to have.  In these circumstances, it is very unfair for the Government to talk about the comforts of the country and the progress that is being made.</P>
      <P>We can see poverty rife in every area as it was in the past and I blame that situation on the policy of the Government.  The restriction of credit has been the cause of it all.  The Government may argue as they like that they did not restrict credit and did not interfere with the banks in regard to it.  We say that is bunkum.  There is not a bank in the country that wants to give a penny to a farmer, unless he has big money in the bank at the time.</P>

      <P>If the cost of living continues to rise as it is rising, we as Deputies will have to demand an increase, because any of us who live in the country and have to keep a car know that we have to wait anxiously for the cheque to come at the end of the month in order to pay for petrol, tyres and insurance.  If it goes on as it is for a year or two, many of us will have to let our cars go.  That is not mere high-falutin' talk.  There are Deputies who have several sidelines, but there are many poor Deputies who had to give up their way of life at home to carry out their duties as Deputies and who are having a hard time.  There are other people who are having an even crueller time, ex-soldiers in this country.  There is a vast number of them in this country and I know scores of them.  Some of them served under me and I met them a few days ago.  I see them now as ushers in Government Departments. These men are hungry&mdash;there is hunger in their faces&mdash;and there is not even the butt of a cigarette in their pockets. These are the men who gave us the <Col N="1598" /> right to speak here and the treatment they are getting is a disgrace.  They have to bring up and rear families on about £3 a week and I ask that there be a full investigation into the position of all our ex-soldiers in Government Departments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>The wages these people are getting are nothing less than a disgrace and had it not been that they send their children to England to send home a remittance at the end of the month their families would be broken up.  Family ties all over the country are being broken by the present situation.  Families which should be united and living in reasonable comfort are breaking up because there is not enough to go round, and the sons and daughters must go out and fend for themselves in another country.  In those circumstances, it is a disgrace that any Government should sit here complacently and say that the country is doing well.  Things are not well for this country.  Things are well for a minority who can fly round in luxury and comfort, but too many people at present are hungry, too many people have no work and too many people are leaving the country, not because they want to leave it but because they must.  Their parents have to ask them to go away to England, to Brazil or Canada, so that they can send back remittances which will keep the old home from breaking up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time the Government woke up to the seriousness of the situation.  I can understand that, when there is a change of Government, there is a big upset, but this Government brought about too big a change and, in future, where there is a change of Government, whether there is a change of policy or not, it should not be a change overnight.  There should be a transition period to give the people time to settle in, but the removal of subsidies and the restriction of credit almost overnight destroyed the hopes of tens of thousands of people.  Yet the Government sits quite satisfied, while they know in their hearts that there is <Col N="1599" /> misery and want in the homes of the people they struck down.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to go down the country and stand up in any village and ask the workers around them how they are faring.  They will hear, not alone from people who do not support them but from their own people: &ldquo;If you do not do something, you will get to hell out of this.&rdquo;  One thing was certain in the case of the inter-Party Government&mdash;they gave employment. I am not saying that the wages were mighty, but where there were groups of men unemployed they were not allowed to go to England.  All that was necessary was a list of the unemployed&mdash;the work and the money were provided.  Good work was done, and I saw almost full employment in my own area, with the result that you can cross the country now with dry feet in the depths of winter because of the draining of the marsh land and bogland by the work of these people.</P>
    <P>They got their wages on Saturday night and spent them in the local shops.  Money was circulating then, but what is the position to-day?  Is the publican not scratching his head and wondering when his next customer will come in?  Is it not a fact that he has the customer only once a week instead of three or four times a week as heretofore, when he put two large packets of Players in his pocket and three or four paints down his gullet and paid for them with good cash which he earned himself?  He cannot do that to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>These are facts which I want to put before the Government. I ask them in all seriousness to change their policy.  They must do so, because, if they do not, there will be nobody left in the country but the idle rich, who blew in here a few years ago, together with the old, the simple and the afflicted.  We want to see family ties kept intact in our country areas. I see to-day old homesteads ruined and the people gone because they cannot live in this country.  Why cannot they <Col N="1600" /> live here?  Is it not a grand country? Have we not got finances, manpower, ability and leadership enough?  What is wrong that we allow our people to go out and to drift away from the land? It is all because of Government policy. Year in and year out, we hear of a £25,000,000 loan, a £15,000,000 loan and a £10,000,000 loan.  We see all these loans being floated, but that money does not enter into the lives of the masses of our people.  Why float all these loans if they are not going to give some service to the people who should count?  Is it not the people who toil with their hands and by the sweat of their brows that we ought to think of?  We are not thinking of these people.</P>
      <P>If it were not for a few country council workers, scarcely anybody would be left in the country at all. There is very little farm work available now in the country or very few workers left to take up such work as is available.  The middle-class farmer cannot get workers.  What does the big man do?  So far as I can see, he writes out a cheque and sends it across to Germany or some other country to purchase a combine with which he can reap and thresh his wheat in a few hours, so that he will have to give only the minimum employment.  Is that not a serious position?  I see a number of these combines travelling around the country during the harvest time.  One or two men can operate a machine which does the work that it took seven or eight men to do formerly.  In former times when we had the threshing mill travelling from farm to farm, it gave employment to seven or eight men for a period of about three months, and they were able to earn anything from 18/- to 21/- per day.  The Government will have to wake up to the fact that these changes are taking place.  If these combines and master machines are going to displace the people in the villages of Ireland, where is the Ireland that we all dreamed of and fought for?  These are pertinent questions which it is necessary to put to the Government.  It makes no difference to me what Government is in power, I shall continue to put these questions to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> I try to take a balanced view of the whole situation.  I have been 30 or 40 years in public life, and I know what we went out and fought for and what many of our people died for.  It was for a balanced Ireland in which the plain simple people could get a living on their native health.  I see these people being uprooted now because of a restriction of money.  What is money but a medium of exchange?  I know that money is king of the country at present, and that a few people hold it in their grasp.  We have to smash that grasp and let the money circulate to assist the people generally.</P>
    <P>We see tens of thousands leaving the country as fast as they can and settling down in other lands.  The majority of the people who remain are the aged and the sick who are depending on the few remittances sent home by their children to keep them in their little homesteads.  On top of that they receive some few allowances by way of social service from the State, just merely to keep them alive.  I live in the midst of what used to be the wealthiest area in the country, an area which embraces perhaps the best land in Europe and I see desolation all around me.  This was the land of the Pale and so far as those who control it are concerned I see practically the same position as existed 50 years ago-big men with big machines giving the smallest amount of employment possible because they want to reap the biggest profit they can in the shortest time.</P>

      <P>I think it has.  So far as I can see, the over-all picture is one of misery and gloom for the mass of the people and I would ask the Government to see that something is done to relieve that situation. There is no use in going around the country and boasting that things are all right when we know that they are all wrong.  As I said a few moments ago, I often meet old soldiers and I hear their stories.  I see hunger and misery on their very countenances. When I ask one of them: &ldquo;How is <Col N="1602" /> the family?&rdquo;  the reply usually is: &ldquo;The family how are you.  I did not see my sons or daughters for years. We had to let them go as there was no living for them at home.  If we did not let them go, how would we live?  Do you think I would let them go if we could get little jobs for them here at home?&rdquo;  These poor men are left high and dry with a miserable wage on which they are not able to live while we are floating loans for millions.  What are we going to do to relieve their position?</P>
      <P>I should like to mention that for the last nine months in my county we have been endeavouring to secure an increase for county council workers. We considered, as a council, that these men had not a sufficient wage and we gave them an increase of 5/- or 6/- a week.  We sent that proposal along to the Minister for sanction.  What was the result?  We had to send appeal after appeal to him every month to sanction that proposal but nothing happened until a few days ago when, after nine or ten months, the increase was sanctioned. During these nine or ten months the unfortunate workers were left high and dry, trying to exist on dry bread and margarine, if they had any.</P>

      <P>I am not travelling far away from the hunger and misery that exist in this country.  When we get up here to call attention to these matters, it is not for the purpose of lambasting the Government or throwing out the Government but for the purpose of doing our duty and letting the country see the position as it exists.  I have lived in the centre of Ireland all my life and I can say that things are not healthy there now.  I can see on Sunday, outside the church gate, scores and scores of cars and, to judge by appearances, everything looks very rosy.  You would almost want a policeman on point duty to direct the traffic outside the church gate.  I would say that is not a healthy position because 90 per cent. of these cars have been obtained on the hire purchase <Col N="1603" /> system and very few people are absolute owners of their cars.  The slightest blast of depression will put them back on shanks's mare.  Perhaps it would be better if they never left shanks's mare.</P>
      <P>I think that the policy at present operated in this country is a Tory policy.  It is a policy for the rich.  The Government has done everything it can for the industrial magnate and the land magnate living on his money.  What more can the Government do for them? Nothing more.  There are ample opportunities for big money and big business.</P>

I would say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government that he is in a responsible position.  He should go out and make every effort to do his particular job and he will require to do it very speedily.  He will require to open up avenues of employment, not alone for the people in the West but for the people of the whole of Ireland.  If he does not do that, a change of Government means nothing.  What the people want is the wherewithal to keep the home fires burning and to preserve the old family ties intact.  They love all their children and would like to keep them at home.  They do not want to send them across the water if they can keep them at home.  The Government gave certain promises when they assumed office and they should fulfil these promises.  They got into power by a swindle.</P>

      <P>I say the Government ought to be ashamed of themselves. They are brazen and hard-necked to allow this country to drift into the condition in which it is now.  No Irishman would expect them to sit there with such complacency with the credit restrictions, the low wage policy, the emigration which we have, and all the things which are so necessary to make a happy Ireland being broken up because of the policy of Irish and British banks and of the money lenders.  They cower before money. Their duty is to face money and put money second and the people first.  The people do not care two hoots who is in power if money is put in its proper place.  Let it be the servant of the people and not the master.  It has been the master of the Government and our people feel it very sorely.  I say, shame on the Government, for their cowardice.</P>

      <P>As this Bill deals with supplies and services, it is only right that major consideration should be given to supplies in the nature of food, clothing and shelter for the people.  Deputy Giles has dealt with the circumstances under which the vast majority of our people are labouring. Every year when this Bill is introduced it brings forth very strong criticism from the Opposition.  While speeches criticising the Government are being made from the Opposition Benches no constructive speeches have come either from the Front Bench or the back benches of the Government to present a picture of more favourable and brighter days for this country in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking recently in this House, said that while some prices of raw materials have fallen recently the over-all price position did not encourage the hope of any reduction in the cost of living in the future.  The cost of living to-day should be the major concern of the Government.  But all the people in our towns and cities are certainly alarmed and astonished that the Government have failed to fulfil <Col N="1605" /> their obligations with regard to the cost of living.  The cost of living is the responsibility of the Government.  It is as a result of their administration that we have the highest cost of living of any country in the world.  No matter what juggling the Government may do with figures or in what way they present statistics to prove the contrary, one has only to hear the protests and the volume of criticism from all sections of the people to know that it is true.  Nobody can say that there are not supplies of food available, but there is little use in having supplies available if the people have not the purchasing power to buy the food. What consolation is it to a hungry man to see a shop window full of bread and butter when they are not within his reach to satisfy his hunger?  There is very little use in having bread, flour, tea and sugar available in large quantities when the people have not the means of purchasing these commodities.</P>
    <P>Then, on the other hand, one hears the Taoiseach and the members of the Government continuously repeating that the people are living beyond their means.  Everyone who has any dealings with the people knows that there are very few of them living beyond their means.  The Government have never told us what section of the community were living beyond their means.  Is it the old age pensioners who are in receipt of 21/6 per week?  How can it be said that a sum of 21/6 per week will provide bread, butter, tea, sugar, fuel and clothing and a roof over their heads for the old age pensioners?  Are those the people who the Government maintain are living beyond their means?  Is the agricultural worker living beyond his means?  The agricultural workers are put to the pin of their collar to eke out an existence with the low wage they are in receipt of.  In many instances they have to depend on the kindness and generosity of their employers, who may be generous farmers.  In parts of Ireland, however, these are very scarce.  On the whole, however, if an agricultural worker gives good service, his employer will not see him short of a pound of butter, a dozen of eggs or a <Col N="1606" /> bag of potatoes.  If farmers were to pay their workers according to the strict letter of the regulations there would be no agricultural workers left. They would get out of rural Ireland as the wage is not sufficiently attractive. That is why we have such a continuous flow of emigration from rural Ireland. They cannot be expected to live in contentment with the cost of living as it is and the wages as they are owing to the attractiveness of the wages which are available on the other side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The Government did not tell us whether that was the section of the community they were referring to when they said that the people were living beyond their means.  If it is not the agricultural workers and the old age pensioner, is it the widows and orphans who are living beyond their means?  Surely we must have some sense of responsibility towards that section of the community.  While the widows may get pensions and allowances for the children and help from such charitable organisations as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, it cannot be said that they are living in the height of luxury and comfort which the Government tell us the vast majority of our people are enjoying to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to demonstrate to the Government the necessity for an alteration in their policy with regard to these services, and it might not be any harm if the social services were overhauled and reconstructed at a very early date.  The cost of living is having a very serious effect on the poorer sections of the community, and the Government have failed to bring in any measure of relief despite the numerous promises they made and the way in which they criticised the last Government in regard to the cost of living.  During the last election and at by-elections since, the Government made repeated appeals to the workers.  It was a great boast of theirs that Fianna Fáil began the system of food subsidies to keep down the cost of living by reducing the <Col N="1607" /> prices of essential foodstuffs.  It is not very long ago that the Front Bench members of the Government spoke in very loud tones of voice, saying: &ldquo;Do not let the Coalition propagandists deceive you.  The workers' interests are safe with Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  Instead of the workers' interests being safe with Fianna Fáil, we have over 52,000 unemployed to-day.  In addition to the 52,000 who are registered unemployed, we surely have an additional 30,000 who are not registered in accordance with the unemployment regulations. Unemployment, the cost of living and emigration show that we need a complete change of policy by the Government.</P>
      <P>The question of credit was mentioned in the course of this debate.  We all know that the astonishing and alarming rates of interest charged by the banking institutions of this country are a hindrance to the farming community from the point of view of increasing production.  In addition, they are a considerable hindrance to the agricultural community from the point of view of the numbers of live stock on the land.  If we want increased production and increased numbers of live stock on the land, the least we can expect is that funds will be made available at reasonable rates of interest.</P>
      <P>Time and again the Government told us that there was no restriction of credit in that respect.  Every farmer in the country knows there is restriction of credit and so does every businessman.  If people engaged in agriculture, industry or any other profession need financial assistance and if they apply to any of our banking institutions to-day, they will be told that there is no credit available and that substantial securities would have to be offered before any credit could be given.  There is a considerable restriction of credit by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and other Government concerns which are alleged to provide cheap rates of money for farmers to increase production, sow more and till more.  There is a considerable restriction of credit even to those engaged in industry to extend and promote their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> No matter what the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste may tell the House it can be proved beyond yea or nay that the banks and banking institution of this country, whether on the instructions or advice of the Government, or with or without the knowledge of the Government, are restricting credit.  The Government know that the restriction of credit is having a very serious effect on the business life of this country. They know that the farming community cannot increase production and that live stock cannot be purchased to graze the lands of this country.  It should be the duty of the Government, when their attention is drawn to the seriousness of the restriction of credit, to have an investigation held.  Furthermore, the Government should not have to ask those engaged in the banking business if there is a restriction of credit.  Were we to take the words of the Taoiseach there is not.  I should like to hear from the Government what investigation is being carried out to prove there is no restriction of credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about that.  If there has been no credit restriction it would be very interesting for the information of the Government themselves, if not for the information of the general public, and for the confidential information of Deputies in this House to know what moneys have been advanced by the Irish banks during the past two years. There is little use in the Government talking about increased production; there is little use asking the farmers to increase the production of live stock for export unless there is capital available.  The sooner the Government realise their responsibilities in that respect the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one sees our workers flying from the country as a result of the high cost of living, not in dozens or in scores but in hundreds, it is about time some serious action was taken.  But unemployment, emigration and the high cost of living are nothing new to Fianna <Col N="1609" /> Fáil.  Since they took office they have fostered no other policy but emigration. They have endeavoured to deny the people a decent standard of living in their own country.  It is because the Government have made so many blunders in that respect and because their actions have been so irresponsible that they are afraid to face the people at general elections.</P>
    <P>We all know the small section of the people who are alleged to be living beyond their means.  We all know that section well.  No section of the community can live beyond its means but that which has so generously subscribed to the Government's various loans and who have got so much easy money from the big interest that is paid by the Government on the money they invested.  They are the people who are getting rich quick.  They are the people who can get rich quick overnight. They are the only section of the people for whom this Government has done anything.  They are the people who invested tens of thousands of pounds in the various Government loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not expect to see agricultural workers, old age pensioners, widows and orphans, the blind, the sick and the lame, subscribe to the Government loan.  The people who are getting rich quick overnight are the people who invest in the Government loans at 5 per cent.  They are a very small section of the community. That small section of the community are living well, growing fatter and fatter and richer while the ordinary working-class citizen and taxpayer are growing thinner and thinner and poorer.  The Government is inclined to cater more for the well-to-do section of the community.  Despite the fact that the well-to-do section is a very small section, it is the most influential section of our people to-day and it holds the present Government in the hollow of its hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is deplorable that we should have one section of the community getting rich overnight and another section either forced into emigration or unemployment.  The low <Col N="1610" /> wage policy of the present Government is something to be very much deplored. In the course of his speech a few moments ago Deputy Giles spoke of the slowness of certain Government Departments to seek increases in pay for various workers.  If the people are to cope with the cost of living as it is there will have to be all-round increases in wages.  What surprises me is the slowness of the various organised sections of the community, the trade unions and other organisations in authority, to demand such increases for the workers which would enable them to cope with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>One cannot be satisfied with the manner in which the Government are carrying out schemes at the moment. A few weeks ago, we had the Emergency Employment Schemes Vote before the House.  If we are to provide a solution for unemployment it must be in some way other than by emergency relief schemes.</P>

      <P>I should like to call attention to the statement of the Minister in his opening speech on the Estimate for this Department to the effect that the trade recession had come to an end, and that we had turned the corner.  That seems to be a stock-in-trade phrase with the Minister. The people are fully aware that the trade recession in business is as acute to-day as ever it was.  I know people who, a few years ago, were in business and pretty well off, and to-day they are trying to sell their houses so that they can clear out and emigrate.  That is the story in my constituency and in my native town.  I know a number of people who have their houses up for sale, but they cannot get rid of them.  They are on the verge of bankruptcy.  That is not a happy position for the Government to be in, and I would like to know what steps they propose to take to remedy it.</P>
      <P>When the inter-Party Government was in office it was severely criticised for the rise in the cost of living.  I would like to remind the House that, during its three and a half years in office, the cost of living increased only by nine points, while in the two and a half years that the present Government have been in office it has gone up by 14 points.  That is not a happy position for the Government, in view of the fact that at the last general election they promised from every platform and at every chapel gate throughout the country that if returned to, power they would bring down the cost of living immediately. They criticised the inter-Party Government for their capital development schemes, for borrowing money and for accepting the Marshall Aid, but now they themselves have accepted responsibility for the repayment of the principal and interest of the Marshall Aid money because before they left office they had agreed to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marshall Aid money was very <Col N="1612" /> useful at the time and was prudently spent by the inter-Party Government. It was responsible for the increase that has taken place in our export trade during the years 1951-52 and in this year, and that increase in the export trade brought about the reduction in the balance of payments about which the present Government were very worried when they returned to office. That money was, in fact, borrowed at 2½ per cent. and was used for productive purposes.  I am sure the Minister regrets having criticised the inter-Party Government for accepting that money, as well as other statements which he and members of the present Cabinet made about it.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to Canada and America recently to explore the possibility of getting markets for our industrial products.  He held out inducements to the Canadian and American capitalists to invest their money in this country, but at what price?  At the rate of 5 per cent.  Who was right or who was wrong in 1951 when the inter-Party Government was defeated all through false propaganda?  I am sure that the present Government regret that because, occasionally, they have been adopting the schemes and policies which the inter-Party Government had been working successfully.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies know that the cost of living is connected with the question of unemployment, which has increased very much in the past couple of years.  When the inter-Party Government were in office they had schemes to provide work at a fair wage for every individual who was willing to work.  There was food in plenty to buy. The housewife was not worried in the purchase of food which she was in a position to buy for her family every week.  Now, the position is reversed. She has no money to purchase food. We have nothing now, as other Deputies have said, only complete poverty.  The labour exchanges are working overtime to deal with the number of applicants for the dole. That is the position at the moment.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Government are devising any scheme to alter that situation.  I think that the Government quite recently got a severe warning that the people are definitely <Col N="1613" /> dissatisfied with their policy.  Even though a high rate of interest was offered in connection with the last national loan, it was not oversubscribed. That is not a happy condition of affairs.  I fear it is an indication that even the moneyed and the capitalist classes have lost confidence in the Government.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to make a serious effort to provide some employment in my town and stop the flow of emigration from it.  There were hopes some time ago of getting an industry started there.  There is an energetic committee there who have procured the necessary local contributions, but every time they are about to realise their ambition some snag crops up and they are back where they started.  I know the Minister is sincere in his industrial drive. and if he is satisfied that industrial production in this country is increasing I would ask him to give Sligo a chance of participating in that industrial drive.  Unfortunately, I want to remind him of a statement he made on industrial development&mdash;I think it was in Clare, when he was opening an extension to a textile factory&mdash;that the West did not lend itself readily to industrial development.  I think that was a very damaging statement, particularly in regard to the West of Ireland, where the Undeveloped Areas Bill is supposed to operate.  If there are any snags the capitalists who are willing to invest their money in the West should be left to discover those snags rather than that the Minister responsible for industrial development should forewarn them: forewarned is forearmed.  I am sure that on reflection he will admit that it was a rash statement to make.</P>
    <P>When the Minister visited Sligo last he gave a warning&mdash;and he repeated it here last week&mdash;that undue publicity should not be given to the starting of a factory because no one knows what snags will crop up.  We did observe that warning all along.  No public representative that I know spoke of it or made any great shout about it; notwithstanding that the delay persists and, as far as I know, there are serious snags.  I make a special appeal to the <Col N="1614" /> Minister to do everything possible to have that factory established there.</P>

      <P>This debate is generally availed of by Deputies to discuss the more pressing problems associated with rising prices and matters of that kind.  I think it was on this occasion last year that the Opposition expressed considerable anxiety as to whether or not the Government had any effective policy for dealing with the question of rising prices.  We can recollect that it was last year that the Minister, in effect, said to the people: &ldquo;Sit tight and whistle, keep up your spirits, because things are going to be better; they certainly could not be worse.&rdquo;  Some months have passed since and I do not know whether the Minister still thinks that there is a ray of sunshine around the corner.</P>

      <P>There are plenty on this side of the House; I am not worrying about the Minister's Party.  The position does appear to be that very little effort has been made to deal with the problem of the cost of living.  There is naturally a feeling in the country that a Government, no matter how long it may be there, should at least have some policy for dealing with these matters.  As I interpret the Minister's attitude to this question of rising prices and things of that kind, it is this: do nothing; leave things as they are, sooner or later a level will be found.  That is sound enough if you have all the time you might desire available.  It is sound enough if you are not concerned as to what the price level eventually obtaining might be; and, of course, it is sound enough if one does not concern oneself at all with the real value of workers' wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose in recent months a certain uniformity of prices has been attained but it is a price level that is far above the capacity of the people to bear.  I would like, and I think the House would expect, the Minister when concluding this debate to show some hope with regard to price levels. Examples have been referred to here <Col N="1615" /> from time to time by Deputies.  We can recollect that the decontrol of meat that was effected by the Minister some time ago was hoped by him to end in a reduced price of meat to the ordinary consumer.  Deputies will recollect that the ministerial announcement informing the people of the decontrol of meat contained the expression of belief by the Minister that this would result in a fall in meat prices.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>With regard to this Bill introduced by members of the Opposition, while it does not go far enough to cover every section of the community the sponsors of the Bill deserve the highest credit for opening up discussion on a very vexed question throughout the country.  Even though it is not a fully comprehensive Bill, it could be amended on the Committee Stage.  It is well worth spending the time of the House to debate it, as there is definitely a crying need throughout the country for such a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Deputy and every local representative at some time or other has been approached to make representations to arrest the soaring rates, especially by those people who have reconstructed their houses or built new ones.  Of course, provision is made in the present system for appealing against the increase of rates, but although you lodge the appeal the rate must be paid and very often the appeal is not successful.  The present system of assessing the valuation of property needs very badly to be repealed.  It works inequitably and causes very irritable discussions at meetings of local bodies.  To my mind, it is a tax on initiative, on enterprise and on improvements.  I know the Government is satisfied that the valuation <Col N="1616" /> generally throughout the country should be revised.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Allen is to be accepted as the mouthpiece of the Government, then if this Bill is not accepted by the Government the Bill which the Government will bring in will give no relief to the ratepayers.  He stated definitely last night that the value of property has gone up and therefore the valuation should be increased.  That is a rather harsh statement for any public man to make.  At the moment, the rateayers are over-taxed.  Even members of the Government and the Taoiseach have said that taxation has reached its limit and that the community could not bear any further increase.  Yet we have the local authorities and the county managers advising the rate collectors and rate inspectors in the different counties to make an inspection and to report on any improvements that have been made on property.  Of course, we cannot blame rate collectors&mdash;it means increased pounds for them and they are only too glad to avail of the opportunity to increase their annual salaries.  It would be all right if the increase of rates took place on houses that were renovated, but I know cases in my town of property almost 100 years old and where it is probably 100 years since any repairs were carried out&mdash;yet they were reported for an increase of rates. Some have appealed successfully and others unsuccessfully.  That is a state of affairs that should not be allowed to continue.  Some of those people are not in a position to meet the increased demand.  The alternative is to let the house collapse, to apply for a corporation house or, if they are old and feeble, retire to the county home or the nursing home.  That is the position as I know it in Sligo.  There are some derelict sites in Sligo which are an eyesore, especially to strangers coming into the town during the tourist season.</P>
    <P>If the Government intends to intro duce legislation to amend the present system, I would advise them to start at the foundation and value the whole country.  That will be costly, but it will at least satisfy the people that each and every one is getting a fair <Col N="1617" /> deal.  Those responsible for introducing this Bill deserve the greatest credit and I am sure that, by the time it is fully discussed, the Government will realise that there is a serious problem which they must face.  The onus will be on them to introduce legislation to provide a more equitable system of valuation throughout the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies have taken part in this discussion from all sides of the House and their approach has been in some instances very different. I want first to express our appreciation of the number of people who have taken part, whether they took part against us or with us, because by and large most of them dealt with it in a very calm and constructive way.  Unfortunately, I must except from that statement the speech of the Minister for Finance.  We all hope that he will soon be recovered from his illness and personally I would prefer that he were sufficiently recovered to be here to-night, so that he would hear what I am going to say about him and his approach to this Bill.  It is unfortunate for him personally that he is laid up and I hope he will be back again soon. When he does come back I hope he will take advantage of the opportunity to read some of the speeches of some of his own back benchers and the more reasoned criticisms that came from them.  I would be ungenerous also if I did not say that we appreciate the constructive line taken by Deputy S. Flanagan last night; I do not agree with all that he said just as he does not agree with all that we say, but he did approach this matter in a constructive way.  The same applies to Deputy Colley in the earlier stages of his contribution, though I differ from some of the opinions he expressed; nevertheless he did try to consider the problem on its merits and see what solutions could be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is by no means a new problem. It is not a problem that was hurriedly considered by our Party.  This Bill was not produced in a hurry.  When our Party gave us directions to go into the matter and when we were considering the problem, there were <Col N="1618" /> two ways in which we could have brought it to the attention of the House.  We could have dealt with it by means of a motion but it was inevitable that a motion would not pinpoint the difficulties and that we would not be able by means of a motion to offer any constructive solution to some of our difficulties.  We decided, therefore, to do it by way of a Bill because we felt that in that way we would at least be putting some of our proposals before the House in a concrete and constructive form.</P>
    <P>We did not think for one moment that the Bill we would produce would be the be-all or the end-all of the matter.  Private Deputies have not got anything like the advice and facilities available to Governments and for that reason they are not in a position to see all the implications and ramifications of the proposals that may be put forward.</P>
    <P>We fully realised that because of that disability we might be told that some of our proposals had not been examined home in the way in which they could be examined home by a Minister with all the resources of the Civil Service behind him.  But we did think it was at any rate worthwhile. We still think it was worthwhile to come to the House with these proposals, partial though they may be in respect of one section of what is an extremely complicated code.</P>
    <P>I was very amused in the earlier stages of this debate to hear Deputy Briscoe&mdash;I think he was the first speaker on the other side&mdash;say that the type of Bill he wanted dealing with this matter was an extremely simple Bill and, subsequently, to hear the Minister for Finance in the next few minutes say that this was a most complex code and that the matter could not be dealt with in a simple fashion. I think that was about the only remark made by the Minister for Finance with which I was able to agree completely.</P>
    <P>The valuation code is a most complex one and it is one which it is difficult to deal with without all the resources that are available normally at any time to a Minister.  Before one considers any question of revision of <Col N="1619" /> the code, it is necessary, first of all, to clear one's mind as to the approach from the local authority point of view. There are two approaches in every local authority problem; there is the short-term view and there is the long-term view.  The short-term view is typified by the speech we had last night from Deputy Allen.  It is his view that members of a local authority should seize any and every opportunity to get as much as they possibly can through valuations being raised as often as they can.  It would be necessary for me, perhaps, to deal with that approach of his in greater detail were it not for the speech that followed from Deputy S. Flanagan; he made the true position quite clear.</P>
    <P>The long-term approach in relation to the problems of a local authority is, we suggest, the approach that should be adopted as regards the aspect of this problem that we have put before the House in this Bill.  I, indeed, suggest that that is the approach that should be taken to all the problems that come before a local authority.  As individuals we may be here only for a short time.  County councillors are in the same position.  A local authority has to go on and the affairs of a county have to be considered on a much wider basis than a short-term basis.</P>
    <P>If a local authority sets out deliberately to encourage development and to encourage building, then obviously that encouragement will show results in the form of revenue at a later date.  Speaking as a member of a local authority I suggest to the House that to grant a remission of rates for a short period is a small price to pay if, by doing so, modern buildings will be erected which, in turn, will produce revenue over a long period of time.</P>
    <P>That viewpoint is not now being put forward by this Party for the first time. In the original Local Government Act passed after the foundation of this State provision was made for the remission of rates on business premises under Section 69 of the Act of 1925. That provision was not exclusively restricted <Col N="1620" /> to a remission on residential premises and I think it was re-enacted and continued in Section 12 of the Local Government Act, 1927.</P>
    <P>As far as I can remember the first time that the restrictive scope of remissions was introduced was in the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Act, 1940.  The whole basis of those earlier remissions was that by encouraging building the result would be that in the long run we would not merely be able to modernise our buildings and develop our towns but, in addition, it would have the effect of ultimately bringing to the local authority more revenue arising out of the new buildings that had been erected.  Some three and a half years ago when one of the annual renewal Bills was before the House I endeavoured to bring an amendment that would extend the scope of that Bill to include business premises.</P>
    <P>My amendment was ruled out of order on the grounds that it would extend the scope of the Bill.  Nevertheless, there was a certain amount of discussion on it, and anyone who is interested can see the viewpoint that was put forward on behalf of our Party on the 8th March, 1950.</P>
    <P>The objection that was put forward at that time seemed to us a valid objection for the time being.  The objection was that materials for building were in short supply, that it was still necessary to ensure that all the available materials would be utilised in building homes for our people rather than that there should be widespread encouragement to build business premises. When that point of view was put forward we agreed that it was better to defer that encouragement, because at that time the question was how best to control the volume of material available so as to ensure that it would be put to the best possible use.</P>
    <P>For the last 12 months at least, that position has altered.  For the last 12 months and more there has been an ample supply of all materials required for building of every type and kind; there has been an ample supply of skilled labour&mdash;not merely has there been an ample supply of skilled labour over and above what was needed for <Col N="1621" /> building homes for the people but, unfortunately, a large volume of that skilled labour has been unemployed and has been forced in some cases to emigrate in search of employment.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances it seemed to us that the position which operated in 1950 no longer operated and that it was essential to do something which would encourage and urge people to modernise and improve their premises, both from the point of view of the employment thus created and the point of view of the long-term benefit to various local authorities in whose areas the buildings are situate.</P>
    <P>No matter on what side of the House he is, no Deputy will deny that it is absolutely desirable in the present position to take every possible step to encourage building, no matter of what kind, so long as it will be useful to the community in the long run. Such encouragement will assist in the creation of employment and will therefore help the general economy of the country.  That view being universally held, it is unnecessary for me to stress that aspect of the situation further.  If we embark on a policy of inducement, the revenue of local authorities will increase and they will derive that revenue in a way that will make it easier on those who have to pay it. Therefore, I would strongly urge the House not to adopt the short-term view, the hand-to-mouth view that was urged here by Deputy Allen last night. Not merely will it not solve any valuation problem or solve the problems of the local authorities but rather will it make them increasingly difficult every year.</P>
    <P>Having accepted the position that it was desirable that something should be done to create that urge, we wanted at the same time to try to do away with one of the difficulties and one of the injustices that, I am sure, has been brought to the attention of almost every Deputy.</P>
    <P>As I said a moment ago, the question of valuations is a complex one. When I say that it is difficult for us to understand how valuations are fixed, I do not suggest for one moment that the Commissioner of Valuation and his staff are fixing valuations other than in accordance with the law, but I do <Col N="1622" /> suggest that the law is so complex that it is difficult sometimes for people to understand it.  I suggest further, that valuations, being fixed in accordance with the law, it is nonsensical for Deputies to suggest that the fact that there is only a small number of appeals against valuations is a sign that everybody is quite happy about them.</P>
    <P>Obviously, when a person receives a notice of an increase in valuation if, indeed, he gets it within the 28 days provided for appeal, he must consider whether the increase in valuation was made in accordance with the law.  If it was, it is quite useless and a waste of money to appeal against it.  I am surprised that certain Deputies who take every opportunity of having a crack at the lawyers should have been the Deputies who would state that the fact that there was such a small proportion of appeals meant that everybody was satisfied.  What it did mean was that people felt that the valuation may have been fixed in accordance with the law, that the law was unfair and should be varied.</P>
    <P>It is because we felt that the law should be varied that we brought this Bill to the House.  Time after time people who have made small additions to their business premises and who budgeted for an increase in valuation of £2 or £3 having regard to the size of the addition, found, when the valuation of the holding was revised, that it was not the valuation of the addition that was considered but the valuation of the entire premises. We found more and more resentment throughout the country on the part of people who had made an attempt to modernise their premises, whether they were small premises or not, against the manner in which the valuations had been increased out of all possible proportion.  That resentment had become so great, with the rates at the figure they are at to-day, that it was beginning to act as a very strong deterrent from the carrying out of any type of improvement or extension.</P>
    <P>I quite understand, and I think it is fair, when a person builds on an addition to his business premises, that that addition should be valued.  It is a building that has been put there for <Col N="1623" /> a purpose and it is only right that an estimate should be made of the improvement or the value of that building but I do not think that it is right or that it makes for progress that when a small addition is added to a business premises of any sort the valuation authorities should take advantage of that, particularly&mdash;as indeed they are entitled under the law so to do&mdash;to go in and revalue the entire premises.  That is a method of getting piecemeal revision which is objectionable and unjust, and which more than anything else will stand as a bar and act as a deterrent to progress.</P>
    <P>We had during the course of this discussion some considerable debate as to the manner in which valuations are struck.  As I understand the position &mdash;and I do not pose at all as being an expert on it&mdash;there are three bases on which valuations can be determined: the letting value, which is simple enough when the property is let or when it is capable of being let; the contractor's value, which is, I understand, taken by arriving at the capital cost and taking a fixed percentage of that capital cost; or the profit basis, which, of course, is arrived at by estimating what profit can be made out of the particular building that may be there.  Exactly how those methods are put into operation is a problem that has defeated many people who have studied all the Acts and who have made an attempt to investigate as fully as they can.</P>
    <P>The figures that come to us from the Valuation Office are largely a question of opinion.  Leaving out purely values for rateable purposes, if anybody asks for a valuation of a farm before they decide that they want to sell it, or if a valuation of it has to be made for probate purposes, it is always in the long run a matter of two people's opinion.  One person will have a lower opinion than the other.  Usually in a probate case the auctioneer or the valuer who has been asked on behalf of the estate to suggest what his opinion is will be lower than the official figure; but it is always a matter of opinion.  While it would be <Col N="1624" /> desirable, if we could, to get this whole question and problem of valuation out of the realm of opinion it is difficult to see how it could be done. I merely mention that in passing because of the suggestion that was made from time to time on the other side of the House that it was desirable to shelve the particular aspect of the problem that we have put into this Bill until there had been a new conception of value introduced.  A new conception would be entirely desirable.  If one could find that conception it would probably save many people headaches, but I do not see that that conception can be got in any reasonable time.  If it cannot be got in any reasonable time, surely it is better to endeavour to remedy some of the injustices that exist at present without waiting to be able to make a perfect job of the whole thing. After all, in any walk of life if we are going to wait until we can get a perfect solution it will usually mean that we will wait until we will never get any solution at all.</P>
    <P>This Bill, therefore, does not attempt to deal with every aspect of the problem.  It only attempts to deal with certain limited aspects.  It does not deal with private houses because those are covered by the 1940 Act. which is automatically renewed every year.  While in its primary wording in the Long Title it deals with business premises and certain farm buildings, yet we deliberately included in the end of the Long Title the phrase, &ldquo;to amend the law generally relating to the revision of valuations&rdquo;.  We did not restrict, as we might have restricted, that final phrase in the Long Title to business premises and farm buildings such as are mentioned in Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill.  We wanted deliberately when we were phrasing the Long Title of the Bill to leave it in such a way that on the Committee Stage, if it were not killed by the Government before then, any and every suggestion that might be coming from any side of the House in regard to valuations would be in order under the phraseology of the Long Title.</P>
    <P>So far as we were concerned we felt that it was undesirable to have <Col N="1625" /> the piecemeal type of revaluation that has been going on for some years. Some Deputies with whom I have been discussing that problem agreed with that point of view but felt that it was unfair to stop that piecemeal revaluation to-day, and that we should go back and make the Bill retrospective from any particular date that the particular Deputy had in mind.  There was an instance of piecemeal revaluation to some extent in the town of Buncrana in Donegal, I believe, some little time ago.  I heard something about that. It might be felt that by stabilising valuations now, as Section 2 of this Bill provides, it would be unfair where piecemeal valuation had already taken place.</P>
    <P>I do not think that view can hold water, because we must always make a start at some point of time.  There will always be hard cases and hardships, no matter when one makes the law operative, with a commencing day. The fact that it might not deal with injustices that have already taken place is surely no argument to prevent one now bringing in a measure that will prevent further injustices of the same nature taking place in the future.</P>
    <P>Under Section 2 of this Bill we suggest that unless a building is improved or enlarged or unless a new building is erected the valuation of the holding should not be increased.  There is, of course, no power except in very limited instances such as coast erosion and so forth, to change the valuation of land.  Therefore, any question of changing valuations really applies only to buildings.  I heard the Minister for Finance making a case here on the second day that this Bill was before the House that it was possible for a person to go into a private house and without making any improvement to it at all or any enlargement of it to convert it into substantial, satisfactory and almost luxurious offices.</P>
    <P>Of course, anybody who knows anything about Dublin business premises knows that that is not true.  He mentioned premises in Merrion Square. Often and often I have had occasion to go into premises in Merrion Square that <Col N="1626" /> were once private houses and that are now being used as offices.  I venture to say that if the Parliamentary Secretary and I took a stroll round the square some day, and went into any house that he or I might choose, we would find that in 99 cases out of 100 there had been structural alterations. It stands to reason that the structure that is satisfactory for a private house &mdash;particularly for a private house of that type&mdash;is entirely unsatisfactory for an office building.  Therefore, I think we may take it that when the Minister for Finance was saying that under Section 2, people could change a house from a private dwelling-house into an office without spending anything &mdash;without, to use his own words, &ldquo;even using a pot of paint&rdquo;&mdash;it was one of these far-fetched flights of fancy to which we have often listened from that particular Minister.  It was one of these far-fetched flights of fancy of which he, with the undoubted powers which he has as an orator, likes to avail himself but which we all know have no relation to the ordinary hard and practical things we meet in everyday life.</P>
    <P>Why should the owner of a building that has not been improved or enlarged suddenly find himself faced with a very substantial addition on his overheads, not merely in rates but in income-tax &mdash;which, of course, is assessed and based on the valuation of the building &mdash;and in E.S.B. charges which, likewise, are based on the valuation.  If the premises happen to be a licensed premises there is an additional tax on the licence duty that is payable out of it.</P>
    <P>These are four separate impositions and they are four separate sources of revenue.  It is for that reason, and only for that reason, that we had the impassioned oration by the Minister for Finance when he spoke on the Second Reading of this Bill but never spoke about the Bill at all.</P>
    <P>If it had any inherent defect of its own then we would have been entitled to hear from the Minister some reasoned analysis of the provisions of the Bill and some reasoned analysis of the objections which he saw to it.  The Minister confined himself to a flowery political diatribe, interspersed now and <Col N="1627" /> again with personalities about Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Morrissey and occasionally even about myself.  That is not the approach that the country wants to this problem of valuations.  I know that the Minister's approach is that there should be a general revaluation all over the country.  As far as I can gather, that is the approach of certain other Deputies who have already spoken in this debate.  I think it was the approach that was indicated by Deputy Allen when he was speaking here last night.</P>
    <P>Theoretically, if a valuation of, say, £12,000 in a particular town, where a rate of, say, 30/- in the £ brings in a sum of £18,000, is increased overnight to £18,000 then, theoretically, a rate of only £1 in the £ should be needed to meet the services in the town.  But we all know perfectly well that one of the real brakes on unnecessary extravagance and unnecessary spending by local authorities is the fact that we consider the figure of the rate that is being struck in the £ too high and that if that figure were brought down, on an increased valuation to bring in the same amount of revenue, there would not be the same curb on rate assessment that there is at the present moment.  It is, if you like, a psychological problem.  It is not a mathematical problem.  Mathematically, it should be exactly the same.  But there is more than that to it.</P>
    <P>The effect of a general uplift in the way that has been suggested as the solution for our valuation problem by the Minister and by other Deputies would also have the effect of increasing electricity charges, of increasing income-tax charges and of increasing licence duty charges, to mention four aspects of it that readily come to my mind.  Naturally enough, I suppose that, in these circumstances, Ministers for Finance will shrink from the problem. But shrinking from the problem and making a political diatribe about it will not ultimately bring us nearer to a solution of the problem.  I think it is fair and reasonable that we should agree that it is improper that one particular house in any street should be <Col N="1628" /> picked out by the local authority and, having been picked out by the local authority, sent forward for revision of valuation without the adjoining house in exactly the same position being so sent forward.  We were told by some people in the course of this debate&mdash; and, of course, they were right&mdash;that the principle of taxation was to ensure that it would be just all round.  Is it a just principle of taxation for an authority to be in a position to say, in regard to two absolutely identical and equal premises in every respect, that they will send one of these premises forward for valuation revision, with the consequent increase that is inevitable thereupon, and that they will not send the other forward?  Could any of us who brought it down to that close analysis accept the proposition that that is just or proper?</P>
    <P>Section 2 of this Bill endeavours to provide that where work is not done on existing premises, where they are not improved or enlarged, the valuation will be kept at the present figure. It does not, as I heard Deputies suggest, state that the valuation must be kept to the same figure where improvement work or enlargement has been carried out or where, by structural alterations, the premises are made suitable for another user.  Where these premises are structurally improved, or extended, or enlarged, it is clearly provided that the valuation can be increased in respect of that improvement, but we do say that, particularly at the present time, it is essential that every possible inducement should be given towards the employment of men, towards new buildings, towards modernisation of our buildings, many of which are now becoming far too old and are getting worn out.</P>
    <P>It is because we feel that inducement should be there that we have provided the method suggested in Section 3.</P>
    <P>We suggest in that section, in the first place, that, when an addition is placed on a building, it is the value of that addition that should be considered for the new valuation.  The fact that some small addition is made to a particular business premises does not justify the old premises as well as the new being revalued and the valuation <Col N="1629" /> substantially increased, with a resultant addition to the overheads on each of the four bases I have mentioned.  We suggest, too, that with the aim and object of improving the revenue of local authorities, taking a long term view, a further inducement should be given to people to modernise and improve their premises in the form of a remission of rates on the addition over the first seven years.  That period of seven years is the period already operative in relation to residential premises under the Act of 1940, and it is because that period is enshrined in that Act that we suggest a similar period here.  Whatever we do, it would be desirable so far as possible to simplify it by making the two run side by side in the matter of terms, so that people will know and understand readily what period of remission they will get.</P>
    <P>We have heard suggestions in regard to Section 4 that it was entirely unnecessary and was already the law. What the law is in regard to the revaluation of farm buildings&mdash;not using that term in the sense of residences&mdash; has been shrouded in mystery for some little time.  We were approached by a deputation from an association of certain farmers who gave us facts and cases where farmers had added a new bay to a hay-barn, had increased the size of a cowshed, had made an addition to a barn and so on, and in all cases there had been a revaluation and, in addition, they did not get a remission of rates for any period.  When those cases were brought to our notice &mdash;it was not a matter of a single case but of many cases&mdash;we were bound to assume that there was some deficiency in the existing law which some people believed did grant that type of building a remission of rates, and, to put the matter beyond yea or nay, that aspect has been included in Section 4.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest barriers to our agricultural production is that we have not got adequate farm buildings on our farms.  Surely it is worth while doing everything we possibly can, not merely by means of grants under the farm building scheme, but by means of easing the load in respect of valuation, for the purpose of encouraging <Col N="1630" /> farmers to improve their buildings and, with improved buildings, to bring about increased production.  We are often told that in Holland and Denmark they are getting ahead with agricultural production to a much better and much greater degree than we are.  The Minister for Agriculture recently paid a visit to these two countries, and anyone who has been through Holland and Denmark must agree that the one thing that stands out, the one thing that strikes the traveller in the eye, is the fact that their farm buildings for their stock and for their grain are infinitely better on the average than ours.</P>
    <P>If we are to say we want to improve our agricultural production, to bring it to the pitch to which we all believe it can be brought, we must remember that the best way of doing it is to improve the buildings on the farms.  Many people will agree that, so far as the winterage of our cattle is concerned, we feed them on the dearest food of all&mdash;their own fat and their own flesh &mdash;because we have not got proper houses in which to accommodate them against the rigours of a winter's night.</P>
    <P>We all agree that we must deal with that problem, and is it not better to be certain beyond question in respect of the buildings around a farm that they will get the inducement that a remission of rates and a stabilisation of valuation will bring rather than that we should merely push that section aside because the Minister for Finance wants to be somewhat clever at our expense?</P>
    <P>This section provides, in respect of farm buildings, just the same easement as Section 3 provides in respect of business premises.  If a man has a three-bay hay-barn at the moment which has a certain valuation on it, and if he adds a fourth bay, as the law stands, the whole shed will be revalued and the whole valuation increased.  We provide in this section that that cannot happen, that all that can occur is that the additional bay, and only the additional bay, can be valued and that it is only in respect of that addition the new valuation will be placed upon the building in question.  It is exactly <Col N="1631" /> the same principle as we suggest for business premises&mdash;that where a small improvement is carried out, it should not be the excuse for an overwhelming impost being placed on the building there already.</P>
    <P>There is no use in our endeavouring, on the one hand, by grants under the farm building scheme, by verbal urgings from Ministers, Deputies and everyone else, to get farmers to improve their buildings and, at the same time, whenever a farmer does improve his premises, hitting him as hard as we can with an increase in his valuation.</P>
    <P>When that has been done once or twice in a parish and news of it gets around, we know only too well what the effect of it will be&mdash;that no one else in that parish will go in for the same sort of improvement.  That, very shortly, is our aim in introducing this Bill.</P>
    <P>We do not suggest for one minute that it is perfect.  As I say, we quite deliberately introduced into the Long Title of the Bill the last phrase: &ldquo;to amend the law relating to revision of valuations generally&rdquo;, so that the Committee Stage could be as wide as anyone would wish.  But we did bring in the Bill because we felt that there is an essential need at the present time to do everything possible to urge and encourage people to modernise their premises.  Whether by reason of the hygiene regulations or for any other reason, the modernisation of business premises is a thing that all of us would wish to see if the country is to improve and go ahead as we would desire.  We are all agreed on the necessity for the encouragement of agricultural production.  We should also, I suggest, be all agreed on the necessity for the provisions introduced in Section 4 of this Bill.  Every one of us who is a member of a local authority at the present time knows and understands these problems.  It is not merely those who are in this House who are faced with these problems.  When I say &ldquo;understands the problem&rdquo; I mean acquainted with the problems, because the problems are sometimes difficult to understand to the full.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> Everybody will agree that there is universal dissatisfaction throughout the country in regard to the valuation code, a dissatisfaction which must be remedied in some shape or form.  The problems with which we are endeavouring to deal in this Bill are, we suggest, the source of the worst forms of that dissatisfaction&mdash;the method by which, because a local authority arbitrarily decides that a particular building should be revalued, that building is selected and sent forward for revaluation although a neighbouring building may not be so sent forward; the method by which, when small structural alterations are made, these structural alterations are seized upon as an excuse for putting an intolerable rate on the building as a whole; the method by virtue of which a man, having improved his land to carry ten cows instead of six, and then extends his cow-barn to provide for the additional four cows, he is hit with a new and additional imposition.  That is not the way to secure progress; that is not the way in which the local authority can ultimately get its revenue most satisfactorily. The way in which the local authority can get its revenue most satisfactorily is to encourage enterprise and the erection and modernisation of building by every means in its power The most beneficial and efficacious method, the one that operates most in people's minds, is to ensure that for the first few years after the additional expense has been incurred, there shall be a remission of the annual burden so that the business will be enabled to stand on its feet.  In that way we shall ultimately secure a greater revenue for local authorities.</P>

      <P>From the discussion in this House I think everybody will agree that this valuation code of ours is a subject for thought.  It has its problems but does this Bill present the answer to them and, if so, is it a workable answer?  I trust that Deputy Sweetman will not take offence at the statement that this Bill is a typical Opposition Bill.  It is typical of the sort of Bill that Oppositions bring in because Oppositions do not have to think of all the ramifications and the problems involved.  I think it is fair <Col N="1633" /> comment on my part to ask: Why, when Deputy Sweetman and his friends were on this side of the House, this Bill was not introduced?  I think, too, I can give Deputy Sweetman the answer out of Deputy McGilligan's mouth, when Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not in the House when I gave the reason why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be but I think I know the explanation from the records.  I am not saying that it is not an unreasonable explanation.  What I am trying to suggest is that the complications involved in this problem are such that this Bill does not answer the problem that is there.  The answer I am giving Deputy Sweetman will be found in the Dáil Debates of the 6th December, 1950, Volume 123, column 1751 in which it is reported that Deputy Pádraig Ó Cuineáin asked the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;If he will take steps, if necessary by the introduction of proposals for legislation, to ensure that the poor law valuation of premises, which will have to be altered to comply with the requirements of the food hygiene regulations, will not be increased?&rdquo;  That is one aspect of the problem and mind you I have a great deal of sympathy with anybody who wants to save people in such circumstances from a compulsory increase in valuation.</P>
      <P>The answer given by Deputy McGilligan who was then Minister for Finance was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Legislation would be required to give effect to what the Deputy has in mind and as many premises, in addition to those referred to in the Deputy's question, are subject to regulations which may necessitate alterations involving an increase in valuation, I regret that I cannot see my way to introduce proposals for the necessary legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So that, presumably, if it came to a division, Deputy McGilligan in Opposition would undoubtedly vote for the Bill but, when he had responsibility as Minister he regretted that, because of the complications and the ramifications involved, he could not <Col N="1634" /> introduce the necessary legislation.  I am afraid that pretty well sums up the position, that the problem is so complex, that, frankly, I do not think a simple Bill like this will meet the problems of our valuation code.</P>
    <P>I need not go over all the things that have been said in the debate already, but there are problems.  The question of ultimate fairness which Deputy Sweetman referred to, a proposition to which I think everybody would subscribe, means this, that if you strike a certain valuation at any particular time it cannot go on for ever.  As a matter of fact it is the age of this legislation that has created one of the difficulties.  Presumably in the original valuations there was a certain equitable apportionment which pretty well reflected true values at the time.  It has been the efflux of time, with a number of other factors, that introduced the disproportion, and disproportion there is in certain cases. Therefore, the essential thing in the valuation code, because it is a form of taxation, is to secure a balance of fairness, a balance of equity.</P>
    <P>Leaving improvements and enlargements for the moment, does anybody suggest that the equitable thing to do would be to freeze at this late stage all valuations when already, through the passage of time, a great disproportion has entered into the picture? That is point number one.  Is not that the approach of the first effective section? Section 2 really proposes, short of anything else, to freeze the present position.  A moment's thought and reflection would show that that particular approach is hardly the best one.</P>
    <P>What we are up against, and I think the reason why Deputy McGilligan shied at it and why any other Minister would approach it with caution, is that what is involved here is really a question of a complete revision of valuation on some new equitable basis, which is so formidable a task and has so many ramifications that it cannot be disposed of in a simple Bill like this, and could not be disposed of without a great deal of preliminary inquiries, statistical and otherwise.  That is the first thing I see wrong with the Bill.  It <Col N="1635" /> does not meet the basic problem which is there and, in so far as it legislates to freeze the existing position, it is consolidating and perpetuating whatever injustices there are at the moment.</P>
    <P>The exception which is made in this Bill is in regard to improvement and enlargement.  It has been suggested that structural improvement is what is intended, but it might be capable of wide interpretation.  I concede to Deputy Sweetman that very possibly some particular cases which are in mind at the moment would be covered. For instance, the food regulation one. I have a great deal of sympathy with anyone objecting to that.  If the State steps in and compels a person to do something, then there should not be indirect penalisation for the carrying out of a legislative provision under compulsion such as an increase in valuation.  Personally, that would be my view.  To a certain extent the Bill would achieve that.  But that can be achieved in another measure which would be more equitable without doing the other things that this Bill would do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman and other Deputies advocating this Bill have, very naturally, stressed the fact that there are cases where an increase in valuation has been disproportionate to, say, the valuation of similar premises in the town and even, in fact, a discrimination. There is, however, another side to the picture, which was mentioned by the Minister for Finance in his remarks on this Bill in the opening stages, and it is this.  Supposing you have a premises which is a private dwelling-house and you have next door to that premises another house of exactly the same type but intended to be a private dwelling-house and somebody starts a remunerative profession or business in it and uses it for business purposes. That can be done.  We need not go into the argument as to whether it is or it is not, but it can be done without any alteration.  Let us take a hypothetical case.  Supposing the person was a solicitor, then in the face of this Bill, knowing the law, he would take care not to do anything which would mean an increased valuation.  Therefore, you <Col N="1636" /> would have another type of disproportion. There is an arguable case on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman may say that it is a hereditament&mdash;that he did not see why it should make any difference with that building&mdash;that that building is not an office, but a habitation.  That case could be stated and is one for argument.  But suppose you start thinking of it in terms of real return from the business, you have another point of view completely.  I leave these arguments as something that could be developed and talked about. But the fact is that in freezing valuations at that particular stage, you are perpetuating, short of actual reconstruction or improvement, whatever disproportions there are to-day.  In fact, you are doing something to inhibit a revision, because fundamentally what is needed is an equitable revision of the valuations, which is a very formidable task.</P>
    <P>Now coming to another angle of this Bill, I wonder if Deputies have thought of the effect of Section 2.  Very recently some of us, on this side of the House anyway, have been concerned about employment and the incidence of employment in the building industry. Some of us put up a proposal&mdash; I think it has been acted upon in the Dublin Corporation and other places &mdash;that if one could stimulate private interests to renovate and reconstruct, or even construct new premises, that you could probably contribute towards the employment of that floating pool of labour that needs to be employed in regard to building, perhaps more effectively than some local authority or State schemes.  Not only would you be doing that, but you would be getting work of lasting value done for the community; in other words, the real wealth of the community so far as it is in buildings would be preserved, if not enhanced.  In order to stimulate that it was proposed, and I think the Government have made some statement on the matter&mdash;I think I saw an announcement published&mdash;in which a remission of rates for a period for anyone who would embark on such a scheme was stressed.  Now, if that argument is valid, and it seems to be good, then it carries certain grounds for criticism of Section 2.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1637" /> I know remissions are provided for in Sections 3 and 4.  But, if you give a man a guarantee of his existing valuation, presumably for all time, as this Bill stands, provided he does not improve or enlarge his tenement, are you not practically inviting him to ensure that he does not improve his premises?  I have not the Valuation Act here, but the word &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; is pretty wide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a tenement house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it is pretty wide.  Take the question of agricultural holdings.  One of the things we have deplored and commented upon right through the years was the horrible situation in regard to Irish holdings in the last century whenever an effort for improvement was made.  We have often expatiated on the need for stimulating a farmer to improve his buildings and his holding.  We talked about the unfortunate effect of tradition from these other days.  If you guarantee a man that his valuation will not go up provided he is careful not to do anything to his holding, surely that cannot be called encouragement. I know that can be pursued too far.  At the moment there is the deterrent that the valuation can be increased if a person improves his property.  I know there are provisions to meet that but by putting it in that blunt, definite form in this Bill and in legislation you are contributing to that effect whatever contribution there is in the direction intended by Deputy Sweetman or the other sponsors of this Bill.  Whatever about whether or not we are in sympathy with the general approach, I should certainly like to find some other formula from which to start than the wording of Section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Section 3, the large class of dwelling-houses is covered.  As to Section 4, if my information is correct&mdash;I have not yet checked on the legal end&mdash;there is a deferment of seven years in the case of farm buildings, so that Sections 3 and 4 do not introduce anything very novel beyond the restriction of the effect of revaluation <Col N="1638" /> to the actual improvement or enlargement.</P>
    <P>The actual remission provisions&mdash;I may be wrong but I think I am right &mdash;are already in force so far as private dwellings and farm buildings are concerned.  The case in respect of business premises has been met very recently as a result of the activities I mentioned, so that, when we examine this Bill, we find it confers no very great benefit on the three most important classes of property, farm buildings, business premises and ordinary houses.  After that, I leave you to see what are the important hereditaments to be covered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision remitting the incidence of increased valuation in view of improvement, there may be a point there which should be considered for the future.  There are many people who might think there was a point there but that point of itself is not enough, in view of the other defects in the Bill, to get the Bill through in its present form.  This Bill fails completely to meet the fundamental trouble in regard to valuations, the disproportion that has entered into the picture with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him&mdash;referred to houses recently built and old houses and the disproportion in their valuations.  That is one thing that I cannot see this Bill do anything for.  If there is a house recently built with a much higher valuation than an equivalent older building&mdash;I think somebody made the point that the older buildings are more substantial and would last much longer&mdash;you are going to freeze that disproportion.  Is that desirable?  What is the answer to that vexed question?  It is a thing that has arisen from the passage of time.  Somebody may still preserve a private house in a Dublin street as a private house at a certain valuation and somebody next door may have let his house in offices.  Its letting value as a premises is about four times that of the other building.  In one case you have the value of the premises as a dwelling and in the other it is a business return.  After the passage of this Bill that situation would be <Col N="1639" /> frozen.  What is the answer?  As I say, the position could be faced squarely if somebody could argue that that was an equitable situation but if it is argued that it is not an equitable situation, then the Bill falls by the board completely.</P>
    <P>I can only say that this Bill is a typical Opposition Bill.  I say that in all seriousness without intending it to be a jibe.  When I say &ldquo;typical Opposition&rdquo;  I mean opposition generally, no matter who occupies the benches.  The Bill is typical of the type of Bill an Opposition will bring in.  In many ways I cannot blame the Opposition for that.  They have not all the resources for bringing in a Bill to cover a matter of this nature.  I do not want to be too hard on them by talking about the bluff of trying but the fact is that they have not got the resources to go into a problem of this nature.  The only one who has the resources is the State.  Deputy McGilligan's answer is on the record. He realised what he was up against when he had the responsibility.</P>
    <P>I will go this far with the Opposition. I think this problem, as Deputy Sweetman said, will have to be looked into sooner or later but what our approach is to be I do not know.  I think it is no harm that the subject should be brought up.  Perhaps it is the function of the Opposition to raise such matters.  It is no harm.  This is a very big problem and if we are going to tackle it seriously we must realise the fundamental problem in it is something in the nature of a revision to secure at the present moment an equitable distribution of the rate burden.  It does not matter an awful lot what the actual value of the valuations is.  I know Deputy Sweetman has answered it in regard to the incidence of remission.  In actual fact it does not matter an awful lot.  Let me put it this way to Deputy Sweetman.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are going to collect what they need for running their business.  That is what it boils down to.  The rates struck will be struck to meet that and the only effect of an increase in valuations would be <Col N="1640" /> to reduce the incidence of the rate.  A decrease in valuations would simply mean that the rates would go up. There is no answer to it.  It is not the valuations that determine the rates at all.  It is how much money the local authority wants or needs to do its business and pay for its outgoings and commitments.  The actual rate of assessment is largely a matter of secondary importance.  If by any scheme or device you were to lower generally all valuations the net result would be to put up the rates and the net collection would be the same.</P>
    <P>Now, the net conclusion being the same, it is questionable whether any other approach, except that of an equitable revision, should be the approach to this problem.  Incidentally, another objection that I would have to Section 2 would be this: Suppose you do what Deputy Sweetman has in mind in Section 2 and that the effect of it would be, as I think it probably would be, to inhibit an enlargement, you would then freeze valuations, so that the incidence of rates would lie in the same pattern more or less permanently. Any increase in rates, and there may be an increase in rates in the future, I am afraid, would fall more heavily on those people who have suffered an injustice in that freezing, so that, if one may put it this way, people who should not be getting away with murder would be getting away with it.  Therefore, in all seriousness the point on which I join issue with Deputy Sweetman on this Bill is on this question of the tendency to freeze.  I think that a far better approach would be on the basis of revision which might very well include a number of provisions rather similar to some of those in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I might point out that remissions are nothing new.  We already have remissions in the case of new houses that are being built, and some on the same lines as the Deputy provides for in Section 4, in the case of farm buildings. Therefore, there is nothing new in that, and as the House knows, remissions have already been announced.  We are providing remissions regarding business premises.  I cannot see that there is very much else in the line of new <Col N="1641" /> improvements where remissions are not about to be provided for.</P>
    <P>To sum up, I suggest that the Bill fails, and fails completely because of the fact that it fails to meet the problem of an equitable revision of valuations.  I do not blame those behind it for not wanting to tackle that chestnut.  Frankly, I do not see how they could, nor do I know how any private group of people would have the resources for tackling that colossal problem.  I have a great deal of sympathy with Deputy McGilligan and with other Ministers who thought twice before they would embark on that problem.  Apparently, Deputy McGilligan, when Minister for Finance, thought so much about it that he went so far as to say that he regretted he could not see his way to introduce proposals for the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a problem here, and there is no harm in talking about it.  Perhaps it is legitimate tactics for the Opposition to bring in their Bill as a device&mdash;Deputy Norton called it a device&mdash;to talk about the problem. Therefore, I do not think that Deputy Sweetman can, in all seriousness, ask us to pass it into legislation and inflict it on the community.  If he wants support for it, he probably will get it from a number of people on the argument that, having regard to the efflux of time and the disproportions that have taken place with the passage of the years, and with the situation as it is to-day, it is perhaps time now that the major task of reviewing our whole valuation code not by an amending Bill like this but with something much more substantial and comprehensive and much more effective, was undertaken so as to redress whatever want of equity there is at the present moment.  That is what I think is needed, and that is what this Bill does not give us.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the people opposite on this, more sympathy than perhaps Deputy Sweetman might give me credit for.  I, too, have suffered in another place in going through that code.  I know a little bit about its difficulties and a lot about what the citizen is faced with.  I know <Col N="1642" /> of cases that could hardly be called equitable, but even though all that may be so, I feel that this Bill would provide no solution to the problem, and that to support this Bill would do the reverse.  Therefore my voice must reluctantly be added to those who say &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me. Deputy Byrne moved the adjournment of the debate last night, having spoken for about five minutes.  He was not in his place this evening when the debate was resumed at 9 o'clock as he was under the impression that the time fixed for the resumption of the debate was 9.30 p.m.  For that reason alone, the Chair is disposed to allow the Deputy to conclude his speech, but the Chair wishes it to be understood that this is not to be taken as a precedent, particularly as the House is not in Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to make my apologies to the Chair for not being here in time.  I understood that the debate would not be resumed until 9.30 p.m.  I spoke for about four minutes last night and during that time I tried to put forward the point of view of Dublin people, and to indicate why the House should accept the Bill that is now before it.  There is one section of the Bill which appeals to me and must appeal to every representative of the City of Dublin, no matter what Party he may belong to. That is the section which seeks for permission for business people to improve their premises, so that if a man puts in a new window&mdash;one six by six to replace one four by four-he will not be immediately subject to an increase in his valuation.  That is what is happening every other day, that reports of improvements of that kind are being sent into the Commissioners of Valuation, and in due course, valuations are increased.  The people who carry out those improvements very probably have done so on borrowed money.  The Bill certainly recommends itself to me if that sort of difficulty can be got over, and if, in cases where improvements are carried out, people <Col N="1643" /> will not have their valuations increased with a consequent increase in rates and taxes.</P>
      <P>I submit that people who do good work of that kind should be exempt from an increase in their valuations and from the payment of increased rates and taxes for a period of at least seven years so as to enable them to recover the amount of money they have spent on the improvements.  Very often people have to borrow money from the banks to carry out these improvements. Therefore, they should be exempt in the respects I speak of until they have paid back to the banks whatever money they may owe them.</P>
      <P>The putting in of a new shop front may cost a man £400 or £500.  That is a class of work that provides good employment for carpenters, bricklayers and others, and it is work that should be encouraged.  It can be of great help in relieving the unemployed. The Taoiseach and the members of the Government have appealed to the corporation to go ahead with schemes to provide work for the unemployed. Here we have an opportunity of doing so knocking at our door.  If the concessions asked for in this Bill are granted they will be an encouragement to the people to carry out improvements and alterations to their premises and so will be a means of providing work for the unemployed.  We all know that under the food and health regulations it will now be necessary for people to carry out improvements to business premises.  That provides another reason why the concessions asked for in this Bill should recommend themselves to the House.  If there is no increase in their business by the new improvement in the premises, and if it is only a replacement of an old frontage or something that will not add to their profits, those people should be encouraged to go ahead.  We should not step in and increase the valuation at least for seven years, as in the case of houses. There could be a graded system over ten years&mdash;one-tenth the first year, two-tenths the second year, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a desire for the type of Bill <Col N="1644" /> Deputies Sweetman and O'Higgins have introduced.  It is one of those measures that the Government might have brought in, and they should not have hostility to this because these Deputies brought it in.</P>
    <P>I am afraid there is an atmosphere being created in the House for a revaluation of the whole country. That would mean increases everywhere and no decrease.  It would mean an increase on big shopkeepers, small shopkeepers and business people, taking money from an already overtaxed and overburdened people struggling to maintain a business.</P>
    <P>In Dublin City, the customers of most of those shops are being sent to the outskirts to live.  The houses around the business premises have been left empty, and are going into decay, yet the shopkeepers are paying the same high rents and high taxation.  Their customers are being pushed out of the city altogether to new areas.  In Dorset Street the traders see their customers pushed out, with heavy bus fares to come in, and high rents; and those shopkeepers are left without their customers.  The Government themselves may have to give instructions to another authority not to do that, but to build up the old city again, to give the people a chance of carrying on their business and of keeping assistants employed at decent wages.</P>
    <P>I am afraid an atmosphere is being worked up for a general revaluation, which would mean that all our constituents would have a further tax placed on their shoulders.  In 1938&mdash;I wish Deputy de Valera were here now, but it is well for the new members to know this&mdash;a Revaluation Bill was brought in here.  It was carried forward on the Order Paper from 1938 through 1939 and then the Second Reading was passed by 67 votes to 51. That is a substantial minority, is it not?  Having carried it by 67 votes on the 1st of March, 1939, the Committee Stage was ordered for the 22nd March. I looked up all the documents for the 22nd March but, would you believe it, the Government had not the courage to go ahead with it, because of the indignation <Col N="1645" /> that, within a week, had spread over the whole country.  It frightened every member of the House.  Constituents were wiring and telephoning and writing to say this would ruin them.  As a result, there was a Party meeting in this House that night and on the 22nd March the Order of the House was not given effect to, and a measure that was carried by 67 votes to 51 never came before the House. There is no Order on any document of the House dealing with the matter&mdash; the measure just fizzled out, because of the fear of the harm it would do all over Ireland.</P>
    <P>If that was the position then, what has happened to change the people now?  They are now more heavily taxed than ever and their customers in Dublin have drifted to the outskirts. More are being sent out, but they will not be sent out much further if I and one or two others can stop it, as the old Dublin shopkeepers must be protected. That Bill got a good discussion from both sides.  I remember that the points I am trying to make now were well put at that time, that a revaluation would ruin the people.</P>
    <P>I wonder if even 1 per cent. of the appeals made to the Commissioners of Valuation ever brought about a reduction for the unfortunate businessman or the owner of property.  I will take a chance and say that not 1 per cent. was successful.  Last night when speaking I was touching on a point that I think most unjust.  I see one of my Dublin Corporation colleagues here, Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll; it is a pity there are not more of them.  People have written to us sending a notice they got from the city treasurer for the rates and they express horror and surprise that the rates have gone up £10, £15 and £20 without their knowing a word about it.  Under the code they have, the commissioners increase the valuation and they do not give notice to one person to appear in court or show cause why the valuation should not be increased.  The first time they hear of the increase is when they get the notice for the rates.</P>

The city manager and city treasurer write and say: &ldquo;We can do nothing in the matter; you must pay this increase and take steps to appeal.&rdquo;  Some of these people have no money to take an appeal to court.  They go to court but in the meantime they are already stuck for the extra £20 or £40 on the half-year's rates and must pay, as I understand there is no way of getting out of it.</P>

They are told to look up some public list.  They know nothing about it.  I earnestly hope my colleagues of this Dáil will recollect what happened on the 1st March, 1939, when the <Col N="1647" /> Revaluation Bill for the whole country was carried by 67 votes for to 51 votes against.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember well what took place, that the Government of the period would not go on with the Bill because of the indignant protest all over Ireland.  Dublin was revalued about 1905&mdash;at any rate, between 1900 and 1910&mdash;and Waterford was revalued within a few years afterwards.  Therefore, it is not back to 90 or 100 years, as some speakers have said.</P>
      <P>I greatly fear what is going to happen if revaluation occurs.  These people will have no money to bring an appeal to court.  They will have to accept the increase and the harm will be done.  The Government was afraid to go ahead the last time.  I remember the night well, when there was a meeting of the present Government Party in their own rooms in this House and the majority of the members protested so severely that the Government let the Bill fizzle out without making an Order.  I remember, as I was present here that night.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Government to accept the section in this Bill that will give permission to shopkeepers and business people who are anxious to improve their properties.  It will give work to carpenters and bricklayers who are unemployed.  Those people should be given at least the protection that will allow them to pay back the interest on borrowed money to carry out these improvements, spread over a period of seven years.</P>
      <P>I have little further to say.  Maybe I am speaking the way I am because of my recollection of the speeches I heard then and that I heard here last week.  I remember the things said on both sides, those for and those against, the difficulties that arose and that became so great that the measure was allowed to fizzle out, so that nothing was heard of it from that day to this.</P>

      <P>Deputies who have introduced this Bill are rendering a distinct service to the country.  The speech we heard just now from Deputy de Valera was a reasonable one.  Anyone listening to him would read between the lines that he really was in agreement with the Bill to a large extent.  Undoubtedly the majority of people are apprehensive of an increase in rates.  We know there will be a further increase in rates and the Deputies opposite know that, too. This is affecting the country seriously, no matter what arguments Deputies across the way may produce.  It is seriously affecting reconstruction and the building of new premises.  It affects agriculture, industry and business as a whole.</P>
      <P>This is a reasonable Bill.  No Deputy on these benches claims to be perfect; we claim only that we are trying to do our duty by the people.  I have no doubt that if Fianna Fáil produced the Bill it would be perfect and every Fianna Fáil Deputy would have to accept it as being perfect; but, being a Fine Gael Bill, it is not to be supported by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>It would be far more reasonable for the Government Party to accept the fact that a revaluation or a control of valuation is necessary.  If they let this Bill through its present stage, and if they are not fully satisfied, they can improve it on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Long Title of the Bill itself says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An Act to amend the Valuation Acts so as to provide certain reliefs in respect of increased valuations resulting from improvements to business premises and to certain farm buildings and outhouses and also to amend the law relating to revision of valuations generally.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> Section 2 would stop the activities of the revaluing officer, whose duty it is to increase valuations at present, whether the buildings are touched or not.  The fact that it will do that will establish security in the country.  No one knows at the moment how he is going to make ends meet.  Added to that, people have the fear that overnight an increase may be made.</P>
    <P>Even a neighbour, who may have a grouse against a particular businessman may try to persuade the revaluing officer to re-inspect the premises and increase the valuation.  Everyone is fighting hard to make ends meet.  Fianna Fáil Deputies, although they say they believe the situation has improved now&mdash;we cannot see it personally&mdash;know how hard it is to make ends meet.  It would mean something if a Bill like this went through and people knew that, as long as they did not extend, alter or improve their premises, their valuation could not be increased.</P>
    <P>I know the reason the Government <Col N="1650" /> do not accept this.  They want to increase the load of taxation on the people.  We are told by the Leader of the present Government that the limit of taxation has been reached.  At the same time, Deputy Vivion de Valera says this evening that he believes the rates will go up.  We all know they are going up, but at least we would like to know where we stand in relation to things generally.</P>
    <P>The argument has been adduced by the Minister for Finance&mdash;I was not here when he was speaking, but I read the record of what he said&mdash;that it would be possible for anybody to convert part of a premises&mdash;he cited the instance of Merrion Square&mdash;for other purposes without any structural alteration whatever.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 10th November, 1953.</P>
