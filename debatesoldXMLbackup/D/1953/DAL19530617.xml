      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will indicate (a) the total consumption of beer, spirits, stout, tobacco and cigarettes for the financial years 1951/52 and 1952/53; and (b) the revenue derived from each commodity for each year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Minister for Finance (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>Particulars of the consumption of the commodities mentioned are not available.  The net duty-paid quantities <Col N="1396" /> retained for home use are ordinarily an approximate guide to consumption but the pattern may at times be disturbed by any substantial accumulation or depletion of duty-paid stocks.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement showing in respect of beer, spirits and tobacco for the years 1951/52 and 1952/53 (a) the net duty-paid quantities retained for home use, and (b) the net receipts of duty therefrom.  The figures for 1952/53 are approximate, as final figures are not yet available.</P>
      <P>Tobacco duty is charged mainly on the unmanufactured leaf and it is not possible to apportion the quantities and revenue receipts as between cigarettes and other forms of manufactured tobacco.  Similarly, the term beer for the purposes of duty includes ale, stout and porter and it is not possible from official statistics to make any apportionment as between the various categories.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood from a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government that some major development works were to be carried out in the case of at least six harbours in the South of Ireland. I was mainly interested to know what harbours in West Cork have been suggested for major development.  As regards the works mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary, I suggest that at least one of these harbours in West Cork should be developed in a big way so that it will be capable of meeting the requirements of modern fishing fleets calling there.  Representations have already been made to the Parliamentary Secretary's office about the pier at Baltimore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware that the courthouse building in Ferbane, County Offaly, has been refused to responsible local organisations as a place for occasional meetings during hours in which it is not required for public business; and, if so, whether he will take steps to make this and other similar buildings so available on terms to be specified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The courthouse accommodation provided in Ferbane consists of a building that was formerly a school which has been let to the county council by the owners under an agreement which stipulates that the letting is for holding monthly District Courts and six special courts and for no other purpose. On these days the custody and <Col N="1400" /> control of the building is vested in the District Court clerk but for the rest of the year the owners are free to grant or withhold permission for its use as they may think fit.  A lease of the building on different terms, if it could be secured at all, would cost more and there does not appear to be any good reason for putting the county council to this extra expense or to the even greater expense of providing alternative accommodation, if such could be found, when the existing accommodation is reasonably satisfactory for the transaction of the business of the court.</P>
      <P>On the general question, county registrars and District Court clerks are empowered to make lettings of courthouse accommodation of which they are the legal custodians to such persons and on such terms as they may think proper, and courthouse accommodation is regularly let to local bodies for occasional meetings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of some seriousness.  Is the Minister aware that, ever since 1914, this courthouse has been available to local bodies in Ferbane, to different trade union organisations, to parochial committees and to bodies of that kind, for the purposes of ordinary peaceful meetings and in the last month this new restriction was imposed?  I would ask the Minister to inquire into the reason for it and why, suddenly, the policy with regard to the use of the building has been changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my speech on the Estimate last night, I indicated that I hoped to make a statement to-day on our trading <Col N="1407" /> relations with Britain.  I am now in a position to do so as an agreement on future trade was formally concluded in London this morning, when Notes were exchanged between our Ambassador and the British Minister of Food, on behalf of the Irish and British Governments, setting out the terms of a new annex to govern the trade between the two countries in a number of agricultural commodities, in substitution for the existing annex.</P>
      <P>The principal features of the new annex are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  The British Government undertake to accept all the fat stock and carcase meat offered by this country for export to Britain.</P>
      <P>2.  The British Government undertake that the difference between the prices paid by them for British-bred fat cattle and those paid for cattle bred in Ireland and fattened for a minimum of two months in Britain shall not exceed 4/6 per live cwt.  (The differential is at present 5/- per live cwt.).</P>
      <P>3.  The prices paid for fat cattle exported from Ireland for immediate slaughter will be equivalent to those paid for cattle bred in Ireland and fattened for a minimum of two months in Britain.</P>
      <P>4.  Exports of live cattle and carcase beef to countries other than Britain shall not exceed 10 per cent. of the total Irish exports of live cattle and carcase beef.  This provision will not, however, apply to cows or bulls or the carcases thereof, and there will, therefore, be no limitation on the export of these to countries other than Britain.  Hitherto, the limitation has applied to all exports of live cattle.</P>
      <P>5.  The relationship at present existing between the prices paid for fat sheep and fat lambs imported for slaughter from Ireland and those paid for fat sheep and fat lambs bred in Britain will be maintained.  (The existing prices for fat sheep and fat lambs from Ireland are only slightly below the prices for British bred animals.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.  The prices for dead meat (beef, mutton and lamb) will be arranged on <Col N="1408" /> the basis of equivalence with live-stock prices.</P>
    <P>7.  The new annex provides for discussions between the two Governments as to the arrangements in regard to exports of eggs after 31st December, 1953, for such time as eggs continue to be imported into Britain on Government account.</P>
    <P>8.  The British Government will purchase such quantities of butter as may be offered for export from Ireland subject to agreement on prices, as soon as the possibility of export arises.</P>
    <P>The trade in canned meat and poultry has been removed from Government control in Britain.  These products may, therefore, be exported freely to Britain, and the new annex does not contain any provisions in relation to them.</P>
    <P>The new annex is expressed to operate for three years as from 29th June, 1953, with provision for extension for a further period by mutual agreement.  If any of the products covered by the new annex is returned to private trade, the provisions of the annex will no longer apply to such product but the British Government will give prior notice to the Government of Ireland so that the two Governments may consider together the arrangements under which the trade in that product will be continued.</P>
    <P>The Notes now exchanged and the new annex have been laid on the Table of the House.</P>
    <P>I should now like to make a few comments on the new arrangements which I have just summarised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The annex which has now been concluded after considerable negotiation constitutes a significant advance in the arrangements governing the export of our most important agricultural commodities to Britain. The new document is particularly significant in relation to the trade between the two countries in live stock and meat.  The British Government has undertaken to purchase all the fat <Col N="1409" /> cattle, sheep and lambs and all the carcase meat that we are in a position to supply to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the 1948 agreement there was provision for the restriction of our exports of carcase beef to 200 tons per week, with an overriding annual limit of 4,000 tons. We have a separate agreement with them on pigs, pork and bacon.  I need not stress the importance to the farming community or to the economy of the country as a whole of the assured market thus provided for all the live stock and meat we can produce and in which we are assured prices directly related to the prices paid to British farmers for their produce.</P>
      <P>In particular I wish to stress the benefits to the farming community of the undertaking by Britain that the difference between the prices paid for British-bred cattle and those paid for Irish-bred cattle fattened in Britain will not exceed 4/6 per live cwt.  Up to now the position was that the difference was 5/- per live cwt. and Britain was entitled, if she so desired, under the terms of the 1948 annex to widen that differential, with serious consequences for our cattle industry. At the time this 5/- provision was agreed in 1948 the level of cattle prices generally was considerably below the present level and, as a percentage of the price obtainable, 5/- per live cwt. represented a much greater difference than the present 4/6.  The new document firmly links the prices to be paid for fat cattle to the prices payable for cattle bred in Ireland and fattened in Britain on their purchase by the Ministry of Food, and this ensures that the prices payable for fat cattle will directly correspond with the prices payable for Irish store cattle fattened in Britain on the one hand and, therefore, with the prices obtainable by the British producer for British fat animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very important feature of the new agreement is the recognition given to, and the assured market provided <Col N="1410" /> for, our greatly expanded trade in dressed beef, mutton and carcase lamb.  The British Government, in this agreement, has subscribed to the general objective of developing the trade between the two countries, not only in live stock but also in meat, and has undertaken to purchase all the carcase meat which we can send them. At the same time, the provision in the previous agreement that at least 75 per cent. of the total number of cattle exported to Britain should be store cattle has been eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices to be paid for carcase meat will be calculated on the basis of equivalence with the prices payable for fat stock exported to Britain for immediate slaughter.  The arrangements now made will, I am satisfied, provide for the maintenance and development of the carcase meat industry in this country which plays an important part in the agricultural economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On our side we have undertaken to limit to 10 per cent. of total exports the quantity of cattle and carcase beef to be sent to countries other than Britain.  This undertaking, however, although it extends this limitation provision to carcase beef as well as live cattle, does not apply to cows or bulls or carcase meat thereof.  The earlier limitation provision applied to live cattle only, but included cows and bulls.  On this question I should like to point out that one of our most <Col N="1411" /> valuable trades with countries other than Britain is the export of manufacturing beef to the United States, and this trade is entirely based on exports of cow and bull meat.  The type of meat generally in demand on the Continent is of a lean type for which cows or bulls are found most suitable.  The trade in live cattle to the Continent also to a considerable degree consists of cows or bulls, large numbers of which are taken for the manufacture of foot and mouth vaccine.  I am satisfied that the restriction need not and will not operate to prevent full exploitation of market openings outside Britain.</P>
    <P>In the last two years and more recently in particular, the British Government have moved towards the removal of price and distribution controls in Britain on a number of agricultural commodities and feeding stuffs and have proceeded to terminate the bulk purchase of certain of these.  Since March price control and rationing of eggs in Britain has ceased but imports are still being centrally handled pending the working out of final arrangements for the import trade.  The current arrangements with Britain about eggs operate until the 31st December, 1953, and the new annex provides that the two sides will meet before that date to settle the arrangements to obtain after the 1st January, 1954.  In the event of Britain deciding to terminate the bulk purchase of other commodities, she will consult us beforehand as to the arrangements under which trade will be continued in such commodities.</P>
    <P>With these satisfactory arrangements made for our agricultural exports, I can confidently ask farmers to increase production on the basis of more tillage, more live stock and better grass.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I was in process of trying to persuade the Minister that the new amendment introduced here, suggesting that the health scheme should be reviewed at five-yearly intervals, that in respect of certain other services the scheme should be reviewed in three years' time and the fixed charge proposition now before the House, would mean that a fixed charge of 50 <Col N="1416" /> per cent. would be levied from the mother who would be attempting to benefit under the scheme.  My suggestion is that this in effect destroys the only real benefits that I have seen in this proposed scheme, in so far as I consider that this amendment will entail the re-creation of the existing scheme of medicine where, in effect, there will be a means test.  My contention is based on this fact.  If the Minister in three years' time is bound by this amendment and if he must assess the total cost of the scheme and distribute that cost over the beneficiaries, this would be a charge to be levied on the mother.  Deputy Morrissey is quite correct in saying that this amendment is slipshod in many ways, particularly in regard to the fact that we do not really know what is in the Minister's mind in relation to the expenses which he will take into consideration in assessing the total cost of the scheme.  If the Minister means that he would levy half the cost of the doctor's service, that would not be very much possibly.  I do not know what fee is to be paid to doctors.  Again he might decide to take in the doctor plus the midwife. That will increase the cost.  Then he might include the cost of the doctor, the midwife, the consultant and the specialist who might be required from time to time.  He might again include the hospital charges bringing in all the ancillary costs which are now going to be levied by the medical profession&mdash; and in my view rightly so.  That would bring in payments made to the pathologist, bacteriologist, chemist, radiographers, etc.  Again the then Minister might decide to include administrative costs and of course there is no knowing what the administrative costs would be assessed at and what they might total.  They might include the salaries of the county manager and his staff.  They might include the salaries of clerical workers and 101 other things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, Deputy Morrissey is correct in that regard.  It is a slipshod amendment because it seems to me that the costs could rise to any unpredictable figure, that the charge in a single case might be anything from £2 10s. to £25 or £50.  That point was made by a <Col N="1417" /> member of the Medical Association in the Health Council in support of a somewhat similar point made by myself.  I think it is substantially true; it is a substantially fair comment. I can visualise the assessment in such a case being £50.  I can visualise the lady being asked to pay £25 and saying that she cannot pay it.  She is then covered by the means test and thrown back on the ordinary public assistance services, as we have them to-day, and the position is that the health services are the same as they were before the introduction of this.  On those grounds I think the amendment is objectionable.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Morrissey's objection in relation to the fact that the Minister is, in effect, introducing an insurance scheme; indeed, he is deliberately attempting to introduce what he considers to be an actuarially sound insurance scheme.  Nobody pretends for one moment that the £1 payment is actuarially sound.  I do not think anyone would suggest that. Deputy Morrissey, I think, made the point&mdash;but even if he is not prepared to accept responsibility for it, then I put it forward on my own&mdash;that one cannot have an actuarially sound maternity scheme.</P>
    <P>Again, if the Minister now brings in what is in fact an insurance scheme he must go before the public as having been extremely unfair to the Irish Medical Association.  It may surprise him to find me defending that body but the fact is that they did put forward an insurance scheme and the Minister rejected it, on very good grounds I believe, namely, the grounds on which I rejected the Irish Medical Association scheme.  It would be practically impossible, I believe, to have an actuarially sound maternity scheme because the insured persons would be, to use the ordinary terms, a bad risk. I cannot see how any pool of wealth could be built up in order to run such a scheme and, therefore, from the point of view of an actuarially sound scheme it seems to be a lunatic proposition. On those narrow grounds I take the same exception to this amendment as the Minister took to the Medical Association scheme and I take <Col N="1418" /> consolation in that from the fact that I am now joined by Deputy Morrissey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I objected to the Medical Association scheme because it was an insurance scheme.  I do not wish to use anybody else's arguments. I am prepared to stand over my own. This section is the most important in our health legislation.  In it there was a tiny modicum of the health scheme that I believe to be the only proper health scheme; that is a scheme which will give all our mothers and all our children an equal chance.  There is no doubt at all that the Minister in his 1947 Act was with me up to the hilt in that regard.  It can be said with truth that most of the politicians here have at some time or other called for a &ldquo;no means&rdquo; test principle in relation to health services.  I could quote several of them: Deputy MacBride, Deputy Costello, the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Norton.  I am quite sure Deputy Norton would not oppose such a proposition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>And myself.  I believe that is the soundest principle on which to base a good medically workable health scheme.  The Minister was responsible for laying the foundation of the present T.B. scheme.  That scheme has been invaluable and the death rate this year has been reduced by 50 per cent. so far as T.B. is concerned. Deputy MacEntee titled at me in relation to that scheme:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He asks why:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mother and child welfare scheme provided for in the 1947 Act introduced by Dr. Ryan just before Fianna Fáil left office would have been brought into operation if Fianna Fáil had been returned to power....  It was under that Act, which, owing to the Fine Gael opposition, had to be withdrawn and reintroduced, that he said all the allowances to T.B. patients were being paid and all Dr. Browne, Minister for Health, had to do now to bring in the mother and child scheme was to sign the regulations under the <Col N="1419" /> Act.  He had not done that, and if questions were asked on that subject the answer might be that it was on account of the vested interests which Dr. Browne was not able to stand up to, and who had worked to get Dr. Ryan out of the way.  The scheme would have been a costly one as visualised by Fianna Fáil, because they realised that the strength and hope of the nation lay in its children.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I still think that is true.  I could quote endlessly on the matter.  Deputies may have had different grounds, some medical, some political, some social.  In its largest part, this Bill is a perpetuation of poor law medicine.  The reason I was able to support it was because there was retained in the mother and child section that tiny modicum of principle to which I have referred and which, I believe, could in time be expanded when the people grew accustomed to the idea that it was a good scheme and accepted the idea that it was a good principle that all mothers and children should be treated equally. I do not think that conception could be repugnant to any group of public representatives in any country.</P>
    <P>I propose to oppose this amendment. The Minister has, of course, the right to push it through if he wants to do so. I believe the Minister is fair-minded. He will, I believe, try to suggest that the grounds for this amendment are really sound but they are not grounds which we could justify to our constituents. He could possibly have brought forward medical objections. We would have been prepared to listen to him, though I do not believe myself he could bring forward medical objections. I may be wrong in that.  Had he brought forward such objections I would have been compelled at once to point to the magnificent achievements of his own T.B. service.  I would have been compelled to point to his own Act in 1947 which has done such wonderful things for our people. I would have been compelled to point to the fever hospitals and the infectious diseases regulations.  Fevers have practically been eliminated as a result <Col N="1420" /> of these regulations, a magnificent achievement due primarily to the Minister's work and that of his Government. The same principle underlies that scheme, equal opportunity for treatment of people suffering from particular diseases.  Those are facts. The House can examine them for itself. Deputies will find substantial arguments against this particular amendment and against any suggestion that the scheme should be a means test scheme for, if it is a means test scheme, it will be a bad scheme.  In view of that, I think there can be no grounds for the introduction of this amendment. I think that the actuarial grounds are unsound.  I may be wrong on that.  The Minister may be able to correct me because he knows very much more about that than I do.  I rejected the medical maternity insurance scheme on what I believed to be very sound technical grounds from the actuarial point of view.</P>
    <P>There is another argument which the Minister could have put forward, the political argument or the economic argument.  It could have been said that the scheme would put too much of a burden on the rates at present. Deputy Dr. Esmonde here recently used that argument, that the scheme might be too costly.  It is an argument which can be used, but one that I do not agree with.  No doubt it could be a compelling argument with many taxpayers. But, again, I could not allow that to influence me in my decision as to what is right.  I believe that the type of scheme which is the right one is the scheme that gives equal opportunity: where equal opportunity is given to each mother who goes before a doctor and under which there is no inquiry into her means, no segregation into two groups and where each mother is treated exactly the same, and where the only consideration for the doctor is a medical one.  There should not be any financial consideration so far as he is concerned.  I would hope that he would be paid very well by the State or the community for the services he renders to that person.</P>
    <P>I think that is the only, the best <Col N="1421" /> possible service that can be made available.  I think that this amendment completely destroys that particular argument.  The Minister did produce the 1947 Act with the mother and child provisions in it, and the White Paper. The White Paper laid down clearly what was intended, a free mother and child scheme for children up to the age of 16.  Then there followed the inter-Party period when the unfortunate episode occurred in regard to the scheme formulated by us.  There is no point in going into that now beyond saying that what happened on that occasion must have been of considerable assistance to the Fianna Fáil Government in their consideration as to what would be an acceptable or a desirable scheme.  In consequence, I assume that they acted with knowledge and understanding as they were in possession of all the facts that were brought forth at that time by reason of the publication of the documents, the arguments and the debates that took place and so on.  It was in the light of all that, that the White Paper was brought forward, that the Bill was circulated and got a First Reading.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Government intended to go ahead with a scheme which was very close indeed &mdash;not the same but as far as I was concerned acceptable&mdash;to their original intentions in the 1947 Health Act. Consequently I find it difficult to believe that the Minister would put forward the political ground that this was too costly and that the ratepayers or taxpayers would have to pay too much.  Looking back over the record of Fianna Fáil on their social legislation generally I do not think that carried much weight with them in their general consideration of what was the best or the correct thing to do.  On the whole they seem to have done their best for the under-privileged in their years of office.  It would, therefore, appear to me to be a complete reversal of a policy if the Minister were to put forward any suggestion that his objection to this scheme or his introduction of this amendment was on the ground of providing more money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> It seems to me, therefore, that there can be only one other objection&mdash;an ethical or moral objection to the scheme.  I do not know whether there is such an objection.  I should like to know if there is that objection by the Hierarchy to the scheme of £1 contribution as proposed by the Minister. I should like to know if that is unacceptable on moral grounds.  I accept that idea or suggestion without qualification.  I do not know, but it has been suggested, that this is an attempt to bring the Hierarchy in to carry the burden with a shift in ground by Fianna Fáil because of ratepayer or taxpayer opposition.  I think that is a most unworthy suggestion.  I think it should be contradicted.  It can be contradicted and I am sure will be contradicted by the Minister.  It is a most undesirable suggestion and should not be sustained for a moment.</P>
    <P>My difficulty in relation to this is that I do not know whether there are definite moral objections to it or not.  As I say, this scheme was considered by the Taoiseach and his Government, presumably in the light of all the facts which were made available during the inter-Party period in the debate on the mother and child scheme, and in the correspondence which was published. I accept it that the Minister is a very responsible person.  I must assume that there was a certain degree of agreement in the Government that this scheme would be morally and ethically acceptable.  The Bill was published and circulated and got a First Reading.  None of us received any hint or suggestion that its provisions were in any way morally objectionable. We then had the Second Reading.  It was not of very great length.  That is now all a matter of history. The whole House agreed to the Second Reading of the Bill and its provisions. The result was that every single Deputy practically, with the exception of Deputy P.D.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to the Bill is that we all accepted the general underlying principles of it; the Government, in the first instance, in the light of their overt or covert knowledge, and Deputies, after long consideration of the Bill, on its Second Reading.  The principle of the £1 contribution was accepted right up to then. In so far as the £1 contribution was a departure from the 1947 Health Bill&mdash; the provision was free with no means test and no £1 contribution&mdash;must we not assume, those of us who do not know exactly what has happened, that up to the insertion of this final amendment &mdash;No. 20&mdash;that the £1 contribution was an acceptable device for the meeting of any objections that might be made on grounds other than medical or political or actuarial or anything else, that is, on ethical or moral grounds? If that is not so, if this £1 contribution was not acceptable, must we then assume that there was no consultation at all with the Hierarchy in relation to this scheme up to the time that the £1 contribution was agreed upon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say that as far as I am concerned <Col N="1424" /> I, of course, completely accept &mdash;I think most Deputies do&mdash;the principle that in matters of social legislation the Hierarchy and the leading members of all the Churches have not only a right but in my view a responsibility to make their views known to the members of their respective Churches in order that they should guide them and help them in trying to keep within the law as it affects them in their particular religions.  So, I do not wish it to be thought that I objected or would object to the Minister having any consultations he wishes with the Hierarchy of any Church or the leading members of any Church. All I say is, that this £1 contribution was put before us here as the solution of the problems arising out of the rejection of the 1947 Health Bill, the scheme put forward by the inter-Party Government, and that it does seem very strange that, six years after the 1947 Act came out, it is suggested that this amendment is there in order to meet certain moral objections.</P>
    <P>This may not be so.  I hope it is not so.  If this proposition is being put here, it is a most serious one in my view because, as far as I can see, the terms of this amendment must colour the terms of all future social legislation, health legislation and legislation concerning the aged, the blind, widows and orphans, and so on, for all time to come.  A terribly important principle seems to me to be involved in this amendment.</P>
    <P>If this amendment is accepted, if it is accepted because the 1947 scheme or the £1 contribution&mdash;the £1 contribution particularly&mdash;is unacceptable on grounds of moral or ethical considerations, then we who are in political life, public life, must know what is to be our position in relation to all similar schemes at present operated by our public officials, by the medical profession, the nursing profession and by practically every Department of State.  The principle of free no means test runs through practically every Department of State; agricultural grants, housing grants, free no means test school education, free no means test children's allowances. Again, we have the free no means test T.B. schemes, free no means test <Col N="1425" /> infectious diseases scheme&mdash;most curiously of all&mdash;free no means test neo-natal schemes in the City of Dublin, I understand to be extended to Cork and Galway, the scheme under which there is in existence at this very moment in the three major maternity hospitals a mother and infant scheme very similar to the provisions of this particular scheme before the House. The child born from the district in either the Rotunda, the Coombe or the National Maternity Hospital can get a completely free, first-class, right up to the best European standards, no means test neo-natal service.</P>
    <P>All those things are there.  All those things are facts.  All those things are realities.  We must, as public men in public life, probably responsible for the making of social legislation in future, know what is to be the position of those people.  Are any of them, are all of them, contravening any moral laws or ethical objections which have, apparently, or which may have been suggested to have become involved in this particular Bill in respect of the £1 contribution?  Must we now retrace our steps and, in respect of these benefits, these boons, brought over the years by Governments for our people, see a means test restored to every single one of these things in order that we shall comply with moral objections in relation to free no means test mother and infant schemes?</P>
    <P>Again, if this is held, we must know the position of our fellow religionists in Great Britain.  We must know why no objection was made to the Socialist medical scheme, free, no means test and, I might add, non-contributory.  It is a non-contributory scheme.  It is commonly held that it is contributory. I went to the trouble of writing to both the Minister of Health in England and Aneurin Bevan and both confirmed that it is not contributory&mdash; that scheme from which so many of our Catholic co-religionists in Great Britain benefit.  Surely they cannot obtain these benefits if they are morally objectionable.  Again, surely our co-religionists in the Six Counties cannot continue to benefit from the free no means test health scheme operated in the Six Counties by the Government <Col N="1426" /> there if our Hierarchy believe that such a basic principle is morally objectionable.  I am quite certain&mdash;all of us are quite certain, I am sure&mdash; that none of our leading churchmen, Cardinal D'Alton, the other Bishops in the Six Counties, would accept for the members of their Church in the Six Counties anything which was morally reprehensible or morally objectionable. I do not think any of us would suggest that they would be silent while there was any such contravention.</P>
    <P>I would certainly like guidance on all these points.  I know they are terribly thorny points, very difficult points and points on which it will be possible to misrepresent me at a later date.  Fortunately, I am quite careless about that.  I am anxious merely for the facts and I do not mind what it costs myself in the elucidation of these facts.</P>
    <P>If this amendment has been inserted in order to comply with the moral objections raised by our Hierarchy, I would like that to be made clear.  I should like that that would be made clear.  I should like to know, because it is important for us to know what attitude we must take up in relation to this principle concerning all these mothers going for X-rays.  As to the other objections which I mentioned, the political objection, the medical objection or any one of these objections, the Taoiseach and his Government have a perfect right to consider these and to insert this amendment and put it through the House.  But we must know which is the real reason.  It is only then that we will be in a position to make our decision.</P>
    <P>If there is no objection from the point of view of the moral law, then are the objections put forward by the Hierarchy objections of personal prejudice?  I know I will be fallen on for using the words &ldquo;political objections of the Hierarchy&rdquo;.  I am asking that blunt question because I feel I must make it clear that as a public representative I could not take either the personal objections or the political objections of the Hierarchy as a compelling argument with me, at any rate, for changing social legislation.  They have a perfect right both to their personal <Col N="1427" /> and political views and so have I. I do not think I am any the worse Catholic for making that suggestion and I feel that neither would the Hierarchy be anxious that they should go on record as trying to impose on this House as a democratic Parliament either their political or personal objections.</P>
    <P>This is a particularly serious matter.  So far as I am concerned, it affects political development in Ireland for many years to come.  It is because of that I am dealing with this terribly dangerous subject and I think it must be cleared up without delay.  If the objections are moral objections, I want to know about these other aspects of our social life.  If they are not moral objections, but purely personal objections, I want to make my position clear. I say again that every Deputy is perfectly within his right in accepting a dictate of that kind or a position which would be based on the Hierarchy's views in relation to their personal objections. Each Government has a perfect right to do that.  This Government has a perfect right to accept their ruling in that regard.  But I should like to know the exact grounds upon which it has been found necessary to insert this section.  I do not wish to have any misrepresentation of anything. I merely wish that the position shall be completely clarified.  If it is accepted, as it was accepted before, that we should introduce amendments to this social legislation, then the departure from that social legislation must be made only on the soundest possible grounds.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious, as I see it anyway, that the whole principle of health legislation, the whole principle of democratic Government to a certain extent is in the melting-pot here.  We must accept the responsibility for making legislation, getting, wherever we can obtain it, the advice of our spiritual advisers but, having considered that advice, then I think we are at liberty to accept or reject it where it is other than a definite ruling on the moral law.</P>
    <P>I would urge, therefore, on the Minister <Col N="1428" /> that he should clear up for all of us all the points I have raised.  They are points which many people are discussing and I think it is very bad for democratic Government and very bad for our religion and our Hierarchy that matters such as this should be discussed as they are currently being discussed in the country.  There may have been no objections whatsoever from the Hierarchy in relation to the moral law.  The objections which impelled the Minister to introduce the amendment may be one or other of the objections which I have mentioned. There may have been objections based on medical reasons, political reasons, reasons of taxation, economic reasons, or actuarial reasons.  But I think it is up to the Minister to give us a very much more compelling reason than that which he has given up to the present with regard to this payment of £1 because it is not a good reason.</P>
    <P>I ask him to reconsider the amendment and to consider these points.  How can one discover that 50 per cent., or half the cost of a scheme, will be costly or not?  I am sure the Department has given the Minister the best possible estimate it can of the cost, but health schemes have a way of costing a lot. Why is the Minister fixing a figure of 50 per cent., which may be too high? If he is accepting this idea of 50 per cent., it may be too high or too low. Perhaps 5 per cent. might be a more equitable figure.  Perhaps 25 per cent. might be nearer to what the Minister had in mind in the past, or 75 per cent. might even be a more equitable figure.  I cannot understand how the figure of 50 per cent. could be arrived at.  If the reasons were economic, or if the Government fears taxation, then it may be reasonable.  That is the only possible reason that I can see.  I find it very difficult to understand why we should say 50 per cent., not 51 or 49 per cent.  Possibly there may be a perfectly simple explanation or a perfectly reasonable argument which the Minister has, but on the knowledge before me at the moment I could not support it.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong, but it would be out of keeping with the record of the Minister for Health.  It would be completely <Col N="1429" /> out of keeping with the record of Fianna Fáil in their social legislation in past years if they were to allow monetary considerations to stand in their way.  As Deputy MacEntee, Minister for Finance, said in 1950, the scheme would have been a costly one as visualised by Fianna Fáil, because they realised the strength and hope of the nation lay in the children. I do not think Fianna Fáil put a price on the health of their children.  I do not think Fine Gael would put a price on the health of the children. Consequently I would like all these points cleared, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. First of all, I would like to know if the objections are based on any of these other points, if they are based on moral law.  If they are, what is the position with regard to these other considerations which I have raised; if they are based on simple political prejudices?  If they are based on personal prejudices&mdash;which I do not honestly believe&mdash;then of course a terribly serious development will have taken place here with regard to democratic government.  Of course the implications with relation to Partition cannot be over-emphasised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, Sir, just listened to what I think might be described as a very remarkable and illuminating speech.  I think the House &mdash;and I hope the country&mdash;has at long last got a glance at the real mind of Deputy Dr. Browne in relation to this whole matter.  The Deputy tried to hang his whole case, from his point of view, on the amendment.  May I put it to him that from his point of view the provision&mdash;in principle&mdash;in the section is just as objectionable as the provision in the amendment?  So far as the principle is concerned it does not matter from his point of view whether the charge is 1/- or £50. One must have a very considerable sympathy with the position in which Deputy Dr. Browne now finds himself and some of his colleagues, because they have&mdash;to put it very bluntly&mdash;been betrayed and Deputy Dr. Browne and his colleagues are now being asked to accept in this Bill something which from their point of view is much more objectionable than anything he was <Col N="1430" /> ever asked to insert in the Bill which he was proposing at some time to introduce himself.  Again the Bill which Deputy Dr. Browne has described as he described it this afternoon, this Bill which we are now discussing, is just a modicum of a health measure.</P>
      <P>The Deputy and his colleagues are in an extremely difficult position.  There is no doubt about that.  If Deputy Dr. Browne had taken the line that one might expect him to take instead of the line he has taken in the speech he has just delivered, one might feel he had reason to be pained, and reason to feel he had not been fairly treated by the Government and the Minister to whom he has given unswervingly his support.  But the Deputy proceeds to pretend that he is ignorant of matters of which he is fully aware.  He wants to know from the Minister whether the provision in the section or the amendment is due to some political or financial reason or whether it is a question of morals or ethics and he says flatfootedly he does not know.</P>
      <P>Nobody in this House is going to accept that statement from Deputy Dr. Browne.  Deputy Dr. Browne does know, at least as well as any other member of this House, if not better. There is no question whatever about that.  The Deputy knows quite well the reason, and the Deputy, I suggest, is not going to make his own position in relation to this section or amendment any easier by trying to whitewash the Minister and the Government so that he can, with some appearance of consistency, continue to support him and at the same time impute to others very low motives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy knows quite well why this amendment was introduced because the Deputy got a similar direction at his own request on the same principle.  That is true.  That is on record.  No question whatever about that.  What I want to suggest, and I hope I am not being unfair in suggesting, is that we did get Deputy Dr. Browne's real mind in relation to this in what he said.  He reasoned with regard to the right of the Hierarchy to give a direction on morals or on <Col N="1431" /> Catholic social teaching in the same way as I think we could assume Henry VIII reasoned when he wanted to salve his own conscience.  The Deputy does not know when the Hierarchy spoke on this matter, he says, whether they were speaking as the authority on the moral law or whether they were giving full play to their political or personal prejudices.  That is an extraordinary statement from a responsible and intelligent member of this House who says in one sentence: &ldquo;Of course I accept the direction on the moral law,&rdquo; but goes on immediately to question it in a number of ways.  He even went further to suggest that there was one reading of the moral law in this State by the Church; there was a different one in the Six Counties by the same Church, and a different one in Great Britain by the same Church.</P>

The Deputy has made it perfectly clear that not merely must he get a clear statement as to what is or is not the moral position or the ethical position but he must be also assured beyond any shadow of doubt, that there is no trace or taint either of personal or political prejudice behind the giving of that direction or instruction.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would listen more often and speak less frequently, he would learn a bit more. I want to make it quite clear that my object is to show again how stupid this Bill is and how stupid this amendment is.  There is no Deputy in this House who has given any thought to the amendment who will describe it as anything other than a shot in the dark. As Deputy Dr. Browne said&mdash;I think we are in agreement on this&mdash;neither the Minister nor anybody else can say under this amendment whether the charge to be borne by the patient will be £5, £20 or £30.  The Minister does not know now&mdash;he could not know&mdash;by what method or on what basis the appropriate amount is to be estimated. The Minister does not know now what charges are to be included in the amount that is to be assessed and for 50 per cent. of which the patient is to be responsible.  At least under the £1 charge you could get some idea&mdash; even a very accurate idea&mdash;of the financial responsibility that was going to fall on the shoulders of the patient. &ldquo;The appropriate amount&rdquo; can mean anything.  I think it will be agreed on all sides of the House that apart altogether from the grounds on which Deputy Dr. Browne has attacked this amendment, on the ordinary ground of this House being entitled to know what the financial responsibility is going to be, the Minister should make a better case for the amendment than he has made so far.</P>

      <P>There is no uncertainty in the minds of the workers as to where Fine Gael stands in relation to health services.  On their record, they have been against health services all along the line.  We have no doubt on that score.  I do not propose to enter into the political or moral effects of this amendment because I feel that in this amendment we are legislating in the form of prophecy.  We cannot say now what this will cost in three years or five years.  I think the Minister would be well advised to reconsider the amendment.  I come from a working-class constituency in which numbers of people will benefit under this Bill.  I think the Minister should find out first of all what the scheme will cost and he should then come and inform the House of that fact and let us decide at that stage what persons availing of this service should pay.  I am not an expert.  This Bill seems to be providing a field day for lawyers and doctors.  I am neither a lawyer nor a doctor.  I am giving the ordinary layman's point of view, and it would appear that in this amendment we are legislating in the dark.  The Minister would be well advised to find out the cost and inform the House on that matter so that we would then be in a position to know what the worker would be called upon to pay.  That is the most reasonable approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne has clearly stated the position; he says we are in exactly the same position now as we were before.  I quite agree with Deputy Dr. Browne in that.  I believe that health services for expectant mothers should be provided irrespective <Col N="1437" /> of means.  Obviously the present Minister has run into the same difficulties with which Deputy Dr. Browne met in relation to his scheme.  The only difference now is that Deputy Dr. Browne's scheme was a much better scheme.  Apparently, the difficulties that have arisen are insurmountable. Those who are anxious to see a scheme go through without a means test must take whatever we can get, either a limited amount or some small advance. The Labour Party believes in a health scheme without a means test.  We all know now that there is a definite objection to the scheme from the Hierarchy. I cannot understand why the Minister or Deputy Dr. Browne could not deal with this on the basis of the proposals put forward by the T.U.C., that is, introducing a health scheme on an insurance basis.  I gathered from Deputy Dr. Browne that it is not possible to work such a scheme on an insurance basis.  The T.U.C. put forward a scheme to Deputy Dr. Browne when he was Minister for Health.  At the time I understood that he had accepted that scheme.  He did not go ahead with it.  Would the Minister now examine the position on the basis of an insurance contribution from all workers?  The payment of £1 per year was a bluff; that bluff has been called. We all know that.  Apparently, the people will not now have to pay £1 per year, but an unspecified sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll have now had taken from them the excuse they hitherto had for supporting the present Government in inflicting such hardships on the people.  They can no longer shelter behind the excuse that they were supporting the Government in order to have a proper health scheme for our people.  That excuse has been removed and they will have to find a better excuse in the future. The Labour Party supports any move to give a good health service to our people.  We have tried everything. We believe the solution lies in a contributory scheme on an insurance basis.  I believe the solution will have to be found through the co-operation of the Hierarchy and the Medical Association.  We have no objection to an all-Party committee sitting down <Col N="1438" /> with the Minister and endeavouring to hammer out a satisfactory scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I will steer clear of matters that I do not think are of tremendous importance just at the moment.  Deputy Kyne has thrown out the suggestion that there are certain Independent Deputies who should be worried about this.  He says the Labour Party will adopt a certain line but &ldquo;we would like you to do a different thing&rdquo;.  That is a rather peculiar attitude for anyone to take up.  If the Labour Party considers the principles on which it was founded, the person who founded it and the principle for which James Connolly gave his life in 1916, then they should be standing here four-square on principle. If the attitude Deputy Kyne has taken up is four-square in accordance with principle, then what objection has he to Deputy Dr. Browne or Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll or myself standing on the same principle?  I stand on the principle on which Mr. Bevan stood when he put his Health Bill through in Britain.  He was not afraid to run away from his principles.  He fought the Medical Association.  He was not like Deputy Kyne who says one must come in and take dictation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>One must sit down and sup with them and let them eat one up.  That is Deputy Kyne's line. I am not going to take that line but I agree with him when he says that one must make as much progress as one can when one can.  The Minister has introduced an amendment to a section.  I spoke on that section on the Money Resolution and I said it was just a cod.  At that stage, the difference between a free scheme and what was in the Bill was a matter of £1 per year.  I said that was all cod and that we could readily do without that.  Now the Minister has put in a new section.  Why he has put it in I do not know.  Why did he bring in this amendment?  It is a most extraordinary amendment.  While one could swallow the £1 on the basis that it was all cod, and it did not matter whether one took it or not, like some <Col N="1439" /> of the medicine people get from time to time, there are certain problems raised by this amendment.</P>
      <P>I think that Deputy Gallagher has taken a very sensible line in regard to it.  This House, and the people, ought not to be asked to support something in blinkers, something that we could not possibly know of.  The Minister, in his speech, said that no administrative expenses would be charged &mdash;that there will only be charged hospital charges and specialist fees.  That is not in the amendment, but if these three things were put into the amendment they would clarify the position, to some extent.  In other words, if the Minister were to put into his amendment that no administrative charges will be included, then we would know that there could be no question of including any part of the expenses of the Minister's Department in the charge. If the Minister would further put in that there would be no charges except hospital charges and specialist fees then we would know where we stood.</P>
      <P>There is a further thing that I think is necessary.  The Minister's amendment speaks of &ldquo;within three years' experience&rdquo; of the working of this.  In my view, three years is too short.  We would want a longer period than that to see how it works out.  Perhaps it should be five years.  I think that we would want a further protective provision, that whatever it was proposed to charge, after the statistics had been brought before Dáil Éireann, it would be for Dáil Éireann to decide whether these charges would be imposed or not.  If we approach it in that way we will have a longer period in which to make up our minds as to what the costs of the Act may be.  First of all, we would have the statistics that would be available for every member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey says that I will not be in the House at that time.  At any rate, there will be 147 Deputies in that Dáil.  They can consider the statistics and the whole matter fully. They can give it all the consideration that is necessary and can decide, (1) <Col N="1440" /> whether there should be any charge other than the £1; (2) whether this £1 should be retained or not, and (3) what percentage of the total cost of the scheme should an individual have to pay&mdash;whether it is to be 10 per cent., 25 per cent., 50 per cent., 75 per cent. or 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>I think that if the Minister were to approach this amendment on the basis of making changes of that kind it would be very simple.  We would still have control by this House over the scheme that had been put into operation.  These are suggestions which I want to put before the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have said on several occasions that what I want is to see a new Health Bill on the Statute Book.  I want to see that Bill providing benefits for the people.  I have no doubt that, when such a Bill is on the Statute Book and is in operation, there will be a demand for an increase in the facilities available for the people under the scheme. That demand will come from the local councils and boards of health; it will come through Deputies and go right through to the Government.  In that way, nobody will be able to stop the pressure of public opinion for the amendments that will be necessary in order to make the scheme a more equitable one than it will be then.</P>
    <P>I have always said I am absolutely in favour of a no means tests in regard to a mother - and - child maternity scheme.  The Minister, in this Bill, is not going as far as I would like to see him go, but he is travelling some of the way.  He is&mdash;and it is important always to be on the right road&mdash;going in the right direction.  I think that is very important.  I think that a more serious objection to the amendment is in the way it is worded at the moment.  I would ask the Minister to let the House know that the suggestions which I am now making in regard to an improvement in the amendment will be considered, and perhaps on the next stage he will be able to indicate to us that my suggestions have been considered, and, as a result, that an alteration in this particular provision will be made to meet the views which I have expressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are tending to the abstract.  Deputy Gallagher brings us into the realms of X.  I think it might be desirable to go out of them a little bit.  The Minister has made it clear what his idea is with regard to X. He said at column 1226: &ldquo;The cost is not going to be £8, I hope.  I think it will be considerably less.&rdquo;  The X is arrived at by saying that X is equal to a quarter of half of eight.  The Minister finds therefore that his X is equal to £1.  When the Minister starts off with his £8 and finds the X from his £8, we are told by him at column 1228, in order to avoid confusion: &ldquo;I think we should make it clear if it is not already clear that administration should not come into this.  It should be only the medical and hospital cost.&rdquo; Let us see what sub-section (1) of the section provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A health authority shall, in accordance with regulations, make available, without charge, medical, surgical, midwifery, hospital and specialist services for attendance to the health of women (being women specified in sub-section (2) of this section) in respect of motherhood.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is the Minister going to give us information as to what it costs to give medical, surgical, midwifery, hospital and specialist services in public institutions to women in connection with childbirth at the moment?  When the Minister takes the figure of £8, I think it is desirable that he should tell us the type of institution, and the general type of procedure and attention that he has taken into consideration when he says that the cost of dealing with the midwifery case, including medical, surgical, hospital and specialist services for the treatment of that case is £8.  I think that we might leave the arithmetic for a moment to see what services and what provisions we are talking about.  If we could get a picture of those services we might be able to guide our footsteps better along the arithmetical line.</P>

      <P>I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Morrissey has said.  I disagree on one or two points, particularly in regard to the position of Deputy Dr. Browne and <Col N="1442" /> those of us who supported him in so far as this scheme is concerned and his position in relation to the scheme put forward by the inter-Party Government. Deputy Morrissey says that we have been betrayed by Fianna Fáil. That is not correct.  At no time, as far as I am aware, did Fianna Fáil undertake to introduce a scheme without a means test.  If Deputy Morrissey does not agree on that point he can look up the 17 points that have been quoted so often in this House or any other source of information.</P>

      <P>I agree that once you come to make a charge, there is no difference in principle, irrespective of whether the charge is 1/- or £50.  Either a scheme is completely free and there is no charge or there is a charge and once there is a charge in it one cannot say, as a matter of principle, that £1 is not a means test and £50 is a means test.</P>
      <P>In so far as this section is concerned, Deputy Dr. Browne, when Minister for Health and during the crisis over his mother-and-child scheme, was quite prepared to accept the idea that there should be a small basic payment in so far as the mother-and-child side of that scheme was concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne asks us, in view of the fact that Fianna Fáil has not entirely vindicated the original scheme as announced by the inter-Party Government, why should not we support Labour and Labour Deputies in this House.  Is it not much more pertinent to put to Deputy Kyne that, instead of now turning around and supporting Deputy Dr. Browne, Labour should have supported him when they were in the inter-Party Government with him?  It is then that their support would have mattered.</P>

      <P>I apologise, Sir.  It does not arise on this amendment. It is just that questions have been put to us.  Let us come back to the amendments.  These amendments brought forward by the Minister and similar amendments which were suggested to Deputy Dr. Browne before he resigned as Minister for Health must have been brought forward for, as Deputy Dr. Browne says, various reasons.  Let us get down to facts. What are those reasons?  Are the reasons brought forward on moral grounds and if the reasons are brought forward on moral grounds I certainly would like to be informed of the fact by persons who are competent to tell us whether if there is an objection on moral grounds to this section?</P>
      <P>Are these amendments suggested on economic grounds?  It is quite possible that they may be suggested on economic grounds.  There may be economic grounds which would necessitate the introduction of a charge here.  But, although there may be economic grounds which would necessitate the introduction of a charge, I think the Minister in bringing forward these amendments is, as Deputy Morrissey has said, making a very poor shot in the dark.  Why lay down rules which may be quite useless in arriving at the charges which it may be necessary to introduce under this section?  A very reasonable case has been made by Deputy Dr. Browne and indeed by all speakers in the House that the position should be reviewed under this section.  If it is decided that it is not contrary to moral teaching as it stands, or with the payment of £1 or a small sum, then the Minister, whoever he may be at that time, after the scheme has been in operation, will be in a position to review the cost if it is a question of economic grounds, and make whatever changes he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> Everybody's complaint about this Bill is that there have been so many amendments, that there are so many means tests, that there are so many sections and here we are contemplating putting one of the most involved amendments into a more involved section than exists in any other part of the Bill.  I personally think it would be very much better to leave this section as it is and that the position should be reviewed in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to criticise the Minister in his difficulties and to bring forward yet more suggestions which are merely an addition to amendments that are there.  I appreciate the position the Minister is in.  I have the greatest admiration for the very courageous way in which he has handled the whole question of this legislation.  He could not have a more difficult task and I personally have complete confidence in him to do the best he can under the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I, also, am not quite clear why this amendment has been brought in by the Minister.  I had accepted that the £1 contribution to be paid by this section of the community was a device to satisfy the interpretation of the moral law as applied to this Bill.  The amendment itself seems to imply that the £1 does satisfy for at least three years.  Without being told one way or another what was the etymology of the amendment, I accept that it is economic.  It seems to provide an opening for economies to be effected at a later date.  I am not quite sure that I could agree now that economies to be effected in the administration of our health legislation should be effected in just one particular section and in regard to one particular group of the people.  I am not satisfied either that the first three years of administration of this Bill will give us any satisfactory information. If the contributions were to be higher and are to be higher, I think you will reach the stage where the number contributing will equal the number availing of the service.  At £1 a year a bigger number would probably contribute <Col N="1445" /> than would afterwards avail of it.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister should attempt to make any provision now for three years' time or five years' time or ten years' time.  I am sure Dáil Éireann at that time will be perfectly capable of effecting any changes in the health legislation that may be necessary. I believe this is an economic question.  If economies are to be effected in three years' time I believe they will probably have to be effected on a wider scale.  I think the Minister would be well advised to consider withdrawing this amendment.</P>

      <P>First I would like to say that I resent the suggestion by some members of the Opposition that any Deputy who says that he believes in a no means test scheme is growing horns or has a cloven hoof.  I am a believer in a mother-and-child scheme without a means test.  I make no apologies to anybody in this House or outside it for that statement.  Let us get this clear.  Deputy Morrissey suggested that there has been a change of attitude by people in this House, like Deputy Dr. Browne who has stood for a no means test scheme all along and that he has now changed his viewpoint in this.  That is, of course, untrue. The difficulty arose in the period of the inter-Party régime.  We found that Deputy Dr. Browne, when he came to decisions, had very little support from his colleagues when he was up against it.  I think that in this matter Fine Gael are unfair to themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a difficult situation arose during the period of office of the inter-Party Government and matters were coming to a climax in the Party to which Deputy Dr. Browne belonged at the time, it might be of interest to know that Deputy Dr. Browne, as a way out of the difficulty, had accepted what is in this section of the Bill at the moment.  He was prepared to accept a nominal charge; whether it was 5/- or £1 it did not make any difference.  He was willing to accept that in order to get over certain difficulties. That is what was included in this Bill until this amendment came along recently.  What I want to get <Col N="1446" /> clear is that when Deputy Dr. Browne made it clear to his own Party, at a meeting at which I was present, that he was prepared to accept this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the question of the £1 charge arose in the beginning during the inter-Party régime and I am going to make a statement which cannot be contradicted, that this very Section 15, which includes the £1 charge, would have been accepted by the inter-Party Government were it not for the fact that the Leader of Clann na Poblachta, Deputy MacBride, knifed his colleague, Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to get that clear.  I am trying to let the House have a clear picture of how the question of the £1 charge arose in the beginning and to show that there has been no change in the attitude adopted by Deputy Dr. Browne since <Col N="1447" /> he was a member of the inter-Party Government.  I am suggesting that Fine Gael are unfair to themselves at the moment in connection with this particular section.  We know perfectly well that Deputy Costello, who was then the Taoiseach, had nothing to do with asking Deputy Dr. Browne to resign.  He made it quite clear to Deputy MacBride that if Deputy MacBride asked for the resignation of Deputy Dr. Browne he did so on his own initiative, and that he, as Taoiseach, had nothing to do with it. Deputy Dr. Browne made it clear that where the Hierarchy gave their views on moral aspects he was prepared to abide by them.  I think that should be accepted in the House.</P>
      <P>I think I am entitled, as a Deputy who has taken an absolutely independent attitude and made it clear that I support a mother-and-child scheme without a means test, no matter who likes it or dislikes it, to say that there should be no misrepresentation allowed with regard to the viewpoint of the former Minister for Health.  I may not have seen eye to eye with the former Minister for Health when taking a certain line politically, but I do not think anybody can suggest for a moment that he has swerved from his view that that type of mother-and-child scheme could be brought into operation.  This particular section would have been brought in during the inter-Party régime and all this furore would never have taken place if one gentleman in the Cabinet had been restrained from exercising his vindictiveness by excluding politically his Cabinet colleague.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey did not happen to be a member of the political Party to which I refer.  I hope he will agree that I should know a little more about the workings of that Party than he did.  I suggest that Fine Gael are unfair to themselves in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that this amendment should be withdrawn.  Deputy Gallagher gave <Col N="1448" /> his views on the matter and I must say I am in thorough agreement with him.  I cannot understand why the Minister should at this stage tie his hands by legislation with regard to what the charge will be in three years' time, why he should restrict himself to 50 per cent. of the cost under this section in three years' time and from that time onwards.  It would be much better to examine the whole question when the scheme has been in operation for a period of years and as a result of a review of how it works this House could then decide what charge, if any, will be made for the future.  No matter how thoroughly his Department may have gone into the question of cost at best it can only give an estimate.  As others have pointed out, in the initial stage estimates with regard to health services are not always correct.  The cost may amount to far more than the estimate in the first few years.  In view of that, I suggest that this amendment is out of place and that the Minister should withdraw it and allow the section to stand as it is and perhaps in three or four years we can consider what action should be taken.</P>
    <P>The question of an insurance scheme has been mentioned by Deputy Kyne. I should like to ask Deputy Kyne, as a member of the Labour Party, how they would propose to carry out an insurance scheme in rural Ireland?  I represent a constituency in the West of Ireland which is composed mostly of small farmers.  In the province of Connaught there are 55,000 holdings under £4 valuation and another 55,000 under £10 valuation.  Will Deputy Kyne, as representing the Labour Party, show me, as a representative of these people, how he proposes to put an insurance scheme into operation for these farmers?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no comparison between the West of Ireland and Britain.  Britain is an industrial country and the West of Ireland is an agricultural slum to a great extent.  I imagine that Deputy Kyne's suggestion would work out all right in Dublin.  I <Col N="1449" /> do not represent Dublin, however, and I say that an insurance scheme could not possibly be worked in areas like Roscommon, Galway, Kerry, Donegal and elsewhere.  Consequently, I do not believe it will be possible for the Minister to bring in a scheme such as is suggested by Deputy Kyne and the T.U.C.  It would not work out in rural areas.  It might work out in city areas. As far as the amendment is concerned, I repeat that it would be better to see how the section as it stands works out and not insert the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I said about this particular amendment when it was introduced first, putting in the £1 was said by some members to be just a subterfuge to get around the moral principle. I pointed out, in reply to that particular debate, that it was really in my opinion a sum that could be defended. I said that taking statistics of the number of children born per year of 62,000 or 63,000 and the number of women under 44 years of age, it would appear that births occur every four years.  If we are going to base calculations like this on statistics we must take the whole section of the population concerned and it would mean that if a substantial number of women were to join this scheme they would have paid in about £4 for every baby that was born and that would roughly work out at at least half the cost or even more.  That was said to be a subterfuge to get around the moral principle by the Leader of the Opposition and by others, and I had to consider that point among others.  I came to the conclusion that we should try&mdash;at least I was quite prepared to defend my calculation, and being prepared to defend it, I was so sure my calculation was not far out that I was prepared to say let it be decided actuarially after three years to see whether I am right or wrong, and if I am wrong let it be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arose about an insurance scheme.  This is, of course, if you like an insurance scheme.  It is run on insurance principles.  Women join, they must pay an annual contribution and they get certain benefit <Col N="1450" /> from that.  It is an insurance scheme to that extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan has answered Deputy Kyne about the big objection to an insurance scheme for general medical services.  Take, for instance, hospital services.  We know that certain people require hospital services. We know it would be impossible to get a lot of people to insure because they are not working for employers and it is very hard and expensive to collect contributions from people not working for employers.  They remain uninsurable and in the end if would come to the point when we would have to hold out or pay from some other fund.  In the end we would have to have a scheme like that laid down in this Bill as well as an insurance scheme.  For that reason, an insurance scheme was not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputy Kyne to realise, as I am sure he does, that all women whose husbands are insured or who are insured themselves, do get free maternity service.  That is provided for.  The particular clause we are discussing here refers to women in the higher income group, those over £600.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies were inclined to think that this had been put in for economic reasons.  Well, partly, I must admit.  When I went around to meet all the representatives of the local authorities the one thing that they impressed on me was to try to keep the cost down.  The local authorities that I met&mdash;I think without exception&mdash;admitted the scheme was good but they felt there should be no further cost put on local rates.  The urge, therefore, was to keep the cost down as far as possible.  Definitely I should say the provision that the <Col N="1451" /> charges for hospital treatment of recipients was put in as a result of meeting local authorities and, to some extent, this particular arrangement, too.  Not altogether, because it was put in also for the reason that people had the idea that it was merely a subterfuge and was never seriously regarded as an insurance contribution. My intention with regard to this amendment introduced now&mdash;the amendment to the £1&mdash;was only to cover what is mentioned in sub-section (1) of the clause itself.  That is, charges for medical, surgical, midwifery, hospital and specialist services. It would not cover charges for anything else.  The amendment may enable the Minister to charge on administrative expenses, and so on. Perhaps it does.  I did not mean that it should and I would be prepared to correct it so far as that is concerned by amendment, if necessary, at a later stage.  Or, alternatively, I think myself that the £1 per year will probably cover this service as it is laid down, or at any rate a little bit more, and I would be quite prepared to say not more than £2.  But these are amendments of the section that could be considered at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Medical Association which, as I said before, is never well-informed of its facts, in a leading article recently also dealt with this and did use some arguments not far removed from some of the arguments used by the Fine Gael Party.  They said how would the pundits in the Custom House know what this service was going to cost in the years 1960 or 1965. Well, of course, no actuary can make absolute calculations for the future.  He can only give his opinion.  I can only say if it comes down to facts&mdash;and actuaries like to make reports on facts&mdash;that charges being the same, or perhaps allowing for an increase of 15 per cent.  On costs of medical material by 1960 to 1965, then the contribution should be so and so. They talked about a fatuous scheme but there is no use in that sort of fatuous criticism because anybody can take any scheme ever put up and make that sort of fatuous criticism.  How <Col N="1452" /> does anybody know what is going to happen in 50 years' time?  The Irish Medical Association boasts of the insurance scheme but I wonder do they know what is going to happen in 50 years' time?  That is not going to help us one way or another.  We can only make the best calculation we can of what it is going to cost in 50 years' time and base the contribution on that particular calculation.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Dr. Browne whether there was a moral objection to this as it stood.  Deputy Morrissey insists that Deputy Dr. Browne knows the answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <P>Well, what is the difference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Mind you, there is a difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer of the Minister to the question satisfies me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see what the difference is, whether I am asked to put it in for moral reasons or not. As far as I understand moral reasons &mdash;of course I am talking to a band of veteran theologians opposite and I want to be very careful&mdash;the moral reason is this.  A contributory scheme is morally sound and there is no objection whatever to it.  So far as the Hierarchy of this country are concerned, they say they are not in a position to decide what the contribution should be, that that is a matter for the civil Government to decide.  If you take these two propositions together, that they agree that a contributory scheme is morally sound and that the civil Government is the authority to decide the contribution, then this scheme is all right.  I want to say this, however.  The Leader of the Opposition, <Col N="1453" /> Deputy Costello, and some of the Deputies on the other side spoke about this £1 charge as being a subterfuge. I tried to prove it was not.  Certain people were disturbed by that&mdash;not the Hierarchy officially in this country&mdash;but certain people were disturbed about it and I wanted to prove, as I said before, that I was correct, or nearly correct, in my calculation of what the cost was going to be and for that reason I put in the amendment.  As I said, I am so sure of being correct or nearly correct that I am prepared to put in the limitation, either that we should take into account what is mentioned in sub-section (1) or alternatively put in a maximum of £2 instead of £1</P>
      <P>There were some other objections raised also.  Somebody said that three years was not long enough to make a calculation.  That is already provided for.  It is already provided that if three years is not sufficient, the Minister can take longer before he makes a change so that it is not necessary to alter it. I am faced by two extremes in this House, by what I might call the Right Wing who are anxious for a free scheme and are not favourable to anything that might deviate from a free scheme.  I am also faced by opposition from Fine Gael because they want to oppose everything and they will always make some excuse for doing it.  I do not know what the excuse is this time. However, as even some amongst my own Party are not too satisfied I suppose I have to make some concession. I can only suggest that the amendment will be withdrawn and amended by either one or other of the limitations mentioned, that is, that only medical, surgical and hospital treatment will be taken into account or alternatively that there will be a limit of £2 put to the charge that will be imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The £2 ceiling is an interesting suggestion, particularly when one bears in mind the Minister's calculation.  The Minister's calculation is that £1 would meet half the cost. <Col N="1454" /> Then the £2 ceiling, presumably, would meet the whole cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be only half the cost anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If £1 represents half the cost, the Minister is prepared to have a £1 ceiling.  If that is right, it would seem to show how correct his calculations are that a maximum of £2 would cover the whole cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am right, the £1 will stand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And if the £2 is required to carry the whole cost it will be there.  I do not know if that is going to be acceptable to certain people in this House.  The Minister has not yet explained why maintenance is brought in.  The Minister told us that he had met the Hierarchy and one member of an opposite Church on many occasions.  He accepted that he got a letter raising objections against this particular legislation on the grounds that it was opposed to Catholic social teaching and that he proposed to bring in certain amendments in which he would endeavour to meet these objections.  This is clearly one of them.  I suggest that the Minister has tried to consider two points of view, one being the point of view expressed in the editorial columns of the <i>Irish Times</i>, in which it was said that in any new legislation of this kind, certain Christian principles must inevitably suffer.  That is the standpoint of certain people, that we are going to have progress at the expense of certain Christian principles.  As against that the Hierarchy sent a letter to the Government, which it was intended the faithful should eventually get and which certain members of the faithful in this House are complaining that they have not got.  I think they are entitled to that support. I understood that the Hierarchy had approved of what they called &ldquo;graded subvention&rdquo;; they thought that citizens should be helped by graded subvention according to their means. I understood that the Hierarchy added that that graded subvention according to a person's means would help citizens to get treatment from the <Col N="1455" /> doctor or the hospital of their choice. They are not getting that from this amendment or this section.</P>
      <P>Again let us get back to the bedrock of this whole matter.  The people referred to in this Section 15 are people in the higher income group&mdash; that is people whose family income is higher than £600 a year.  That is not a tremendously high income, particularly when one relates it to the 8/- value which the £ of to-day possesses as compared with the £ in 1939.  It means that the family income to-day of £600 would be equal to a family income of only £240 in 1939 but when one moves out of that category, one is supposed to be in the higher income group.  For these people we are still having the public ward treatment.  I understand that the public ward is still in the background of Section 15. As the article in <i>Studies</i> said: &ldquo;Gone forever are the hopes or fears of &lsquo;free-for-all&rsquo;&lsquo;paid-for-by-nobody&rsquo; health services.&rdquo;  We are now clearly faced with the withdrawal of the original proposal in favour of an insurance scheme.  I suggest that that scheme does not dispose of the hierarchal objection based on Catholic principles. These principles are that you are entitled to help citizens by a graduated subvention according to their means but apparently now the only treatment open to these people is the public ward treatment.  This is the particular mess of pottage for which certain people bartered their principles.  We had the promises before in regard to the 17 points.  One of these points was the maintenance of subsidies.  If anything the subsidies were to be increased.  But the subsidies were reduced last year.  The reduction is continuing this year and the reduction will be in operation for 12 months this year where it was in operation for only eight months last year.  People were brought to support the diminution of the subsidies on the plea that the money so saved was to be devoted to paying the cost of certain social welfare schemes.  On the credit side there were those social welfare schemes and it was said that there was to be £1,000,000 over for the State.  That was said to be reserved for the Health Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> Now we have the Health Bill and we realise that the free-for-all has gone and we will now have to provide these midwifery services for the people in the higher income groups still in the public wards; and the Minister laboriously says that he always intended that half the cost would be paid and that he thinks that the £1 would be 50 per cent. of the cost.  He told us that was clearly and openly characterised as a subterfuge.  Another phrase used was tight-rope walking in an effort to evade a moral issue.  He denies that now.  Nevertheless he brings in an amendment to have what is called an appropriate amount charged and there is no doubt as to what the appropriate amount is to mean.  It is to mean the amount hereafter found to subsidise 50 per cent. of the cost, possibly leaving out the administrative costs.  That is the new scheme.  Certainly it is a very different scheme from the one that was talked about on public platforms.  I cannot see why the suggestion of the Labour Party should not be accepted that there should be a proper insurance scheme in which the premiums could be associated with the benefits that would be got.  The premiums would, of course, have to be raised if the cost of giving the benefits increased, as happens in almost every insurance scheme.  Of course, it is taken in this House that an insurance scheme is either fatuous because the statistics, calculations or finances have not been worked out right, or else it is something that offends the moral sense of those who defend the political rights of this community and say that our people should have entirely free health services for all sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to be frank with the House.  For some reason or another he has brought in an amendment containing the phrase &ldquo;the appropriate amount&rdquo; and the appropriate amount is then defined by an amendment which he proposes later &ldquo;provided that the appropriate amount shall be £1 and&mdash;</P>
    <P>shall provide that the appropriate amount referred to in paragraph (a) of this sub-section shall, for each successive <Col N="1457" /> period of five years (the first of such periods being the period of five years beginning on the day after the expiration of three years from the commencement of this section or such later day as the Minister may determine to be the earliest practicable day for the beginning of the first of such periods), be&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then we get a long rigmarole which, at the end, comes to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One half of the estimated total cost as determined by the Minister by or on behalf of whom such contributions are paid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister should be frank about this.  This is insurance and the phrase introduced here is a recognition of the fact that the £1 was subterfuge and that there was a certain amount of tight-rope walking.  The Minister has been coerced, quite properly coerced; perhaps, I should not use the word &ldquo;coerced&rdquo;&mdash;he has been educated and he did not get that education from theologians here.  He got it from outside. He should tell us that that is the case.  All the facts point that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister is introducing this amendment because certain Catholic social principles have been put to him and he has been told what those principles mean.  He has been told how far the original section in his Bill offends against these principles and at this late stage he has decided to mend his hand.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to clarify a point made by Deputy Kyne. The scheme put forward by the T.U.C. was in relation to the mother-and-child scheme in the hope that it would meet the position and do away with the objections put forward at the time. The objections were similar to those that Deputy McGilligan has now told us were raised in respect of this scheme.  The T.U.C. put forward a contributory scheme only in relation to the mother and child.  The arguments for a general health scheme have been dealt with by the Minister and Deputy McQuillan.  I ignore Deputy Kyne's remarks about standing up with the <Col N="1458" /> Labour Party.  The Labour Party will stand when it succeeds in getting off its knees, on which they have been grovelling for the last 20 years.</P>

      <P>Dealing with the Minister's point about the amendment to the first proposition, I think it would be very difficult to consider a section detailing the specific members involved in running a complicated health service from midwife to G.P., specialist, consultant, with a background of pathologist, bacteriologist, chemist, radiologist and all the subsidiary persons who will be brought in. I think it would be very difficult to specify the people one means to include in assessing the cost of implementing any section here.  It would make the thing very clumsy.  As far as I am concerned it will be perfectly acceptable if we are bound by the decision that it must be a contributory scheme as proposed by the Minister. If he feels that the advice he has up to the present that a limited £2 contribution would meet any objections put forward, then naturally I could not disagree with his taking steps to implement that.  I myself have not accepted such objections as being completely out of order.  I cannot criticise the Minister for doing what I did myself. If he feels £2 will meet the objections, I am prepared to give him my full support.</P>

      <P>We are dealing now with the higher income group.  According to the Minister there are 62,000 births per annum.  He hopes to collect £4 per birth, or approximately £248,000. That is to meet half the cost of the scheme for the higher income group. That is an insurance scheme.  If the Minister is introducing an insurance scheme he has apparently cast aside any idea of a free-for-all scheme.  If we are to have an insurance scheme why not have one which will indicate plainly to the recipients what exactly they will get?  We are all agreed that there are considerable difficulties facing the higher income groups in relation <Col N="1459" /> to expenses in this connection.  Surely it would be better to have a whole-hog insurance scheme.  What is the objection to it?  Apparently the principle of insurance is acceptable.  At the present moment the recipients under such a scheme have no idea what benefits they will get in return for their contribution.  They will get a bed in a public ward if they are prepared to take that.</P>

      <P>Sir, by your leave, I want to make a short comment on the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture to-day on the annex to the trade agreement.  I commend the prudence of the Minister for Agriculture in adhering strictly to the terms of the agreement negotiated by our Government in 1948 and I am glad that its provisions have been continued for a further three years.  Article 2 of this annex reproduces Article A of the 1948 trade agreement subject to the qualification of which no doubt the Minister has knowledge that the British Ministry of Food, when they realised they were not going to get supplies of Argentine meat, desired us to send them as much carcase meat as we could so as to spare them the obligation of erecting extra abattoirs in England to slaughter increasing quantities of live stock and it became convenient for them to get as much carcase meat as they could.  It was in the light of that <Col N="1460" /> that the carcase meat industry has made such considerable expansion in the last few years.  But I think it is appropriate to recall the cautionary words which the Minister for Agriculture used some time ago in this House when he warned those who contemplated entering the carcase meat trade that the existing capacity for the slaughter and dressage of meat for export is probably sufficient to cover any likely exports that may develop. I think the Minister would be wise before this Estimate is finally disposed of to give his considered opinions to the House again on the subject.</P>

      <P>I would like to direct the attention of the House to Article 3 of this annex.  It reproduces paragraph (a) (5) of the 1948 trade agreement.  It reproduces that article subject to an important qualification.  The House will remember that the Minister for External Affairs, when he was Deputy Aiken on this side of the House, was profoundly troubled by the acceptance by our Government of a limitation of 10 per cent. on the exports of live stock to destinations other than Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So that in so far as it is now extended to carcase meat it represents a further concession to the British Ministry of Food.  I am bound in honesty to record my opinion in the House and to the country that I am of opinion that that 10 per cent. restriction on our total export of live stock and cacase meat to destinations other than Great Britain is not going materially to affect the prosperity of the live-stock industry of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives freedom for about 120,000 extra cattle.  That is what it gives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no fault to find with the Minister for making that concession although I appreciate it would be possible to raise a stink in the country about it just as he and his colleagues tried to raise a stink in the country about the paragraph referring to a 10 per cent. restriction on exports of live stock contained in the 1948 trade agreement when I made it.  That was a fraudulent ramp then.  To start it now would be fraudulent and I would be sorry to stoop as low as the present Minister for External Affairs in that regard.</P>
      <P>There is one cautionary note I would like to sound.  I hope, and, indeed, I expect, the Minister will be able to reassure us in connection with it.  If the Minister will look at the annex he will find in paragraph 3 that:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government of Ireland undertake that exports of live cattle and carcase beef to countries other than the United Kingdom shall <Col N="1462" /> not in any year exceed 10 per cent. of the total exports of live cattle and carcase beef from Ireland.  The Government of Ireland further undertake that in any year 25 per cent. of total exports of live cattle from Ireland to countries other than the United Kingdom shall consist of second-class cattle.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of calculating these percentages (i) no account shall be taken of exports of cows and bulls and the carcases thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Suppose our total exports of live stock amounted, say, to 600,000 cattle. The 10 per cent. proviso entitled us to send 60,000 to destinations other than Great Britain.  If we take no account of bulls and cows in making that calculation and suppose our annual export of bulls and cows comes to 50,000 and we do not have regard to them, that reduces our exports of cattle for the purpose of the 10 per cent. calculation to 55,000 which means that instead of being entitled to send 60,000 head to destinations other than Great Britain we can only send 55,000 albeit that regard will not be had to any of the cows and bulls that go to destinations other than Great Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not, I think, dwell on that aspect of the calculation.  I am not seriously apprehensive in regard to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>You are on a false premise again.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just drawing attention to an apparent ambiguity.  This causes me no serious concern but I think the Minister would be well advised to clarify the matter so that all would fully understand it in his statement.  If he looks at it I think he will realise he did not deal with that aspect of the paragraph which excludes totally exports of cows and bulls from the entire calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 4 of the new agreement reproduces Article A (6) of the previous agreement, subject to an improvement <Col N="1463" /> of 6d. per cwt.  I do not want to sound in any way derisive if I say to the Minister that securing 6d. per cwt. under that heading in the agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that there is more than 6d. involved.  He knows the principle that is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>You should.  The British had the right of increasing the 5/- under the 1948 agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will consult his files he will find a rather interesting story on that.  This formula was employed in 1948 when there were abundant supplies of Argentine beef coming into England.  There are none coming in now so that it is a good deal easier to talk to the British than it was then.  This formula was employed:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government of the United Kingdom undertake: No excessive differential over the existing 5/- between the prices of home-bred and Irish-bred cattle after two months in Great Britain will be introduced.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, the important words are the United Kingdom undertook not to introduce any excessive increase in the existing difference.  I think the Minister will find, if he refers to the files, that some months after that an enterprising public servant in England communicated to us an inquiry with a view to requiring if that might accurately be described as not to go beyond 15/- per cwt.  I did no more than this.  I asked our ambassador in London to take a letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and ask him: &ldquo;Does that faithfully reproduce the spirit of the agreement that we made?&rdquo;  And the answer he got was: &ldquo;Tell the Minister for Agriculture to tear that letter up&rdquo;.  Now the Minister believes perhaps in the written word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have negotiated with the late Sir Stafford Cripps, and I came to the <Col N="1464" /> conclusion that he was a man who was a great deal too able to try to pin down with the written word because he had the dialectic skill to drive a coach and four through any written word as we found to our cost in respect to Article 1 of the 1938 agreement which, when we invoked it in London, he was able to drive a coach and four through it and we discovered that we had landed in London with an article worth nothing.  We believed that it contained a restriction on the British Government but by the time Sir Stafford Cripps was done with it it appeared to contain a restriction on the Irish Government.  I took the view which I think subsequent events amply vindicated that the same Sir Stafford Cripps was the kind of man whose word was infinitely better than his bond.  The Chancellor led the British delegation, and that is what the spirit of that paragraph was understood to mean between us.  I know there were those who took the view that such a procedure on my part, such advice on my part to the Irish Government was imprudent. I advised the Government, of which I was a member, that in doing that I was adopting the wisest course in dealing with the man that we had to deal with, and I think the events have justified it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Why make agreements at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the agreement that way.  It was sought to change it but it stuck.  Did the British Government ever increase the differential? Now it was my judgment that in dealing with the late Sir Stafford Cripps that was the wise way to deal with him. An event transpired when a dutiful public servant intervened and his Government sought to put a different construction on that paragraph.  I have told you what occurred.  When that happened all that was necessary on our side was, without comment, to send a communication to the Chancellor and ask was that the spirit of this agreement?  The answer, as I have told you, was: &ldquo;Tell the Minister for Agriculture to tear up that letter&rdquo;, and we never heard another word from anybody to suggest that that paragraph <Col N="1465" /> should be interpreted in any other way.  After all, judge a policy by its results.</P>
      <P>Is it not the best test?  I agree that you tried to get the best agreement you could.  We found that paragraph (1) of the 1938 agreement was not as secure as we thought it was.  I am suggesting to the House that that paragraph (5) of section (8) of the annex which we negotiated in 1948 in the event turned out to be as strong as steel.  Five shillings was the figure named in it and there was to be no excessive increase.  Ultimately over the whole period of the agreement that was interpreted to mean that there would be no increase at all.</P>
      <P>There is no use in saying &ldquo;you did a very dangerous thing.&rdquo; Every time one crosses O'Connell Street one is liable to be knocked down by a bus or a bicycle and unless one braces his shoulders one runs the risk of having a lifetime on one side of the street. I had to make up my mind as to what advice I would give the Government and the best formula we could get which would give our people the best and the greatest security.  I think the event has demonstrated most eloquently that we found a formula that did give them security.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Agriculture upon securing the extra 6d.  I hope that paragraph in his agreement will stick as fast as the 5/- proviso stuck in mine.  As regards Article 5 there is one word in it which I should like the Minister would deal with.  Its insertion does cause me a little anxiety. Article 5 says: &ldquo;The seasonal schedule of prices for fat cattle imported from Ireland shall be agreed annually in consultation between the representatives of both Governments.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;annually&rdquo; does not appear in the 1948 agreement because it was foreseen that there might be variations during the year in the schedule prices and in fact there have been.  Wherever a variation in the schedule was made during the currency of a year then without any fuss or bother the officers of my Department met the officers of the British Ministry and the proper adjustment was made in our price schedule to correspond <Col N="1466" /> with whatever interim adjustment was made in the British schedule.  There may be no significance in the insertion of the word &ldquo;annually&rdquo; but lest any ambiguity might arise I should like that the Minister would direct his attention to it.</P>
    <P>Articles 5 and 6 reproduce Article H in the 1948 agreement and Article 7 reproduces Article 8 (4).  Articles 8 and 9 of the new agreement forecast the Minister's intention to negotiate hereafter for a market for eggs and butter in Great Britain; for eggs when the existing agreement terminates at the end of this year and for butter if and when supplies are available.  I think that both of these articles must be read in the light of the cautionary word uttered by the Minister for Agriculture when introducing his Estimate yesterday in which he reminded the dairy farmers of the country that we had reached saturation point in the domestic consumption of butter at 4/2 per lb. and that he knew of no market in the world where he could negotiate the sale of butter produced in this country at that price and that he must advise the farmers that unless they cut their costs he was at a loss to know what he could do.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister for Agriculture does anybody any service in saying that large quantities of vaccine cattle are now released for annual shipment to the Continent. There were never large quantities of vaccine cattle sought there.  The Dutch did buy some from us in August, 1948. When the British Ministry was consulted as to whether they would regard that as a relevant matter under the agreement the reply was: &ldquo;Not at all&rdquo;. So far as cattle are required for vaccine purposes, they can be regarded as not coming under the terms of the trade agreement at all.  I think the Minister will find, if he refers back to our experience over the last four years, that nobody had any regard at all to any vaccine cattle bought by the Dutch.  I think there was an understanding with the British Ministry of Food that they would not be taken account of when any calculation fell to be made thereafter as to the 10 per cent. total exports.  I do not think it makes sense to be pretending that <Col N="1467" /> there is an immense demand for vaccine cattle on the Continent when in fact the exports of vaccine cattle do not amount to a fleabite on a flea.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the potentialities of the trade for manufacturing beef in America are.  We, as the Minister knows, developed and did all we could to promote it.  It consists of the export of the frozen and boned carcases of cows and bulls to America, boxed, for conversion into salami, sausage and soup stock.  It came our way because the Americans were afraid to buy that class of cattle in Mexico consequent on the serious outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease that obtain there.</P>
    <P>A lot of people thought at one time that there was a vast and growing market in America for prime beef. That belief, of course, was quite illusory. Every ten years or so there occurs a shortage of prime beef in America, when the Americans will buy beef anywhere in the world, but it always dwindles down and the domestic supplies in America catch up on demand.  It would be folly on our part to build up the hope that we had any permanent remunerative market in America for prime beef.  If I were pressed for an opinion as to whether there was a permanent and profitable market in America for this manufacturing beef I would say, on the whole, I would think it was worth taking a risk upon, but it does not matter a hoot to the live-stock industry of this country because it is merely a method of getting rid of old cows and bulls.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that where you have to dispose of an old cow it is very nice to be able to get £40 for that for which you used to get £20 but, in fact, none of us will grow rich out of producing old cows and, of course, none of us wants to have many old cows to dispose of.  Let us not blow down or make little of a useful outlet for something that used to be quite an embarrassing commodity to get rid of.  I am not without hope that this market for manufacturing beef, if it is nursed and handled and promoted, may help us materially to eliminate from our herds the uneconomic cow; and the cow that is giving only 350 gallons of milk, I <Col N="1468" /> want to say now, would be much better boned in a box on her way to a soup canner in Chicago than eating good victuals in a dairy farmer's byre in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, perhaps, to have the opportunity of using this outlet to constitute himself into an Aladdin striding through the country roads offering new lamps for old and taking the old uneconomic cows out of the farmers' byres, boning them, boxing them and sending them to the soup canners and, with the proceeds of the sale, purchasing and presenting to those farmers a three-year-old in-calf heifer to replace the old cow which he had frozen and put in the box.  But, that is all that trade is going to be worth.  That is an important consideration and that is why the Department of Agriculture felt it right to promote it in so far as it could.</P>
    <P>Therefore, Sir, in so far as the Minister has recognised the value of this market and has so prudently adhered to the terms of the 1948 trade agreement, I am greatly relieved, and I rejoice that for the next three years the benefits of the trade agreement we negotiated in 1948 are to be preserved.</P>
    <P>I would be doing less than my duty, Sir, if I concluded without recalling to the House that this confirmation of the agreement made by us in 1948 marks a very important milestone in the economic history of this country.  At last we have got agreement on both sides of this House that no one would be well advised to thank God that the British market was gone forever.  At last we have got agreement on both sides of the House that it would be no blessing to Ireland if all the ships that sailed the seven seas were sunk and that we were called upon to live to ourselves alone.  At last we have got agreement on both sides of this House that the Egyptian bee is no adequate substitute for the Shorthorn cow. Some of the younger Deputies may think it is hyperbole to speak of that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy went to East Cork and Wicklow trying to make out that he knew what was in the agreement, that under it the farmers would become paupers, that under it there would be an end to our live-stock exports because we would not be allowed under the agreement to export cattle on the hoof.  Deputy Dillon tried to make out that this agreement is exactly the same as the 1948 agreement. He did not tell us about the secret 1948 agreement which he made <Col N="1471" /> with the British Government.  In the 1948 agreement, there was a clause under which the Government here, apparently, undertook not to export more than 10 per cent. of our live cattle to countries other than Britain. After that agreement was made, a number of people here who had a very profitable market in America wanted to build an abattoir and to get licences to kill cattle in it and in the various abattoirs in existence and export the carcases to America.  Deputy Dillon said: &ldquo;No, you cannot do it.  The export of cattle, either dead or alive, to other countries must be kept within 10 per cent. of our total export of cattle.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>You would not allow it.  The people were looking for licences to export dead cattle to other countries and Deputy Dillon would not allow them.  When the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture came in he said that under the agreement, not under any secret agreement that Deputy Dillon might have made with Britain, our bond was not to sell to countries other than Britain more than 10 per cent. of our live cattle; that dead cattle were out of it; that we were not committed not to sell as many dead beasts as we could.  Deputy Dillon would not allow that.  Under that agreement, while he was there, he would not allow the export of cattle, dead or alive, to countries other than Britain to exceed 10 per cent. of the total.  Coalition Deputies at that time were annoyed by people coming along and saying: &ldquo;We <Col N="1472" /> can sell ten times as much carcase meat to America or some other place&rdquo;, but they would not be allowed by Deputy Dillon to send more than 10 per cent. of the total at any time.</P>

      <P>When the present Minister came in he stated: &ldquo;That applies only to live cattle.  We will export as many dead cattle as we can.&rdquo;  We did that.  That is how the American trade was built up.  Deputy Dillon may sneer at our bulls and cows.  He does not like cows of any kind.  If he had his way, we would have very few cows.  He would have some artificial process of producing bullocks.  If he had secured an agreement for 1/- a gallon for milk for five years, there would be very few cows in the country.  One shilling a gallon for milk would have resulted in having them all killed off.  What does he want us to do with the bulls and cows?  He sneered at the export of bulls and cows.  What are we to do with the bulls and cows?  Are we to become Hindus and worship them and let them go round until they die?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not put it past the Deputy.  Under this agreement we are at liberty not only to send every beast that we can send to England in carcase form but, in addition to that, we are at liberty to send bulls and cows anywhere we like.  The export of bulls and cows last year totalled at least 120,000.  We got millions and millions of dollars even for a very small number of them.  We sent the rest of them to England and the Continent.  This agreement definitely takes us out of the yoke into which Deputy Dillon tried to put the industrial and agricultural development of the dead meat trade.  Deputy Dillon, of course, hates to see any industrial progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we still have the right to export cattle live or dead, that we still have the right, which Deputy Dillon tried to deny to people, of slaughtering them here, keeping the hides and offals and building up, not only a slaughtering industry and a meat-packing industry, but any ancillary industries arising from the byproducts. Deputy Dillon tried to make the point that the reason we got this freedom to kill all our cattle if we could do it and sell the carcase meat to England was that really the poor British were so occupied in killing their own cattle that they could not kill ours any longer and they asked us to kill them for them and send them over as carcase meat.  That was his argument.  Everybody knows that the previous Fianna Fáil Government and Deputy Dillon's Government tried to get liberty from the British Government to kill the beasts here and to export them to Britain in carcase form, but the British would not have it.  When Deputy Dillon asked them they said: &ldquo;No, you can send 200 tons a week but not an ounce more; 4,000 tons a year is all the carcase meat you will <Col N="1474" /> be allowed to send to Britain.&rdquo;  We can now send 400,000 tons if we have it.  We have not only the right to give employment to our people in rearing cattle, attending to them and killing them, but we have the right to give them employment in packing the carcases and in processing the offals.</P>
      <P>No one knows how quickly the dead meat industry will develop.  Deputy Dillon tried to kill it just as he tried to kill the growing of wheat, just as he prayed for the day when wheat would follow beet and peat up the spout.  He did not see it.  We have lived to see the day when he congratulates the Minister for Agriculture on the good work he is doing in keeping up tillage.  The day will come when he will come into the Dáil waving the Tricolour flag that he once called a dirty rag.</P>
      <P>We are glad that Deputy Dillon is coming along and I am glad particularly that the result of the secret agreement which he made with the British&mdash;that he would interpret &ldquo;live&rdquo; in the phrase live cattle as meaning both dead and alive&mdash;is clear.  We have at last got that particular freedom and I am very glad I must say for the sake of our farmers here that they have an alternative market to the British slaughterer.  Heretofore, if a man had a fat beast and could not sell it to England in carcase he was compelled to sell it alive and the British slaughterer had not the competition which we hope he will have in increasing measure from Irish slaughterers, and from Irish dead meat packers being able to give him an offer for it.</P>
      <P>This agreement, therefore, is not a pure extension of the 1948 agreement but a radical amendment of it, particularly as interpreted by Deputy Dillon. If Deputy Dillon had continued in office until this day&mdash;and he could have&mdash;the 1948 agreement would have been continued to be interpreted by him as it was until he left office.  That was, that we could not sell one ounce of meat dead or alive over the 10 per cent. of our live exports.</P>

The 60,000 limit applied to both dead and alive.  If we elected to export 60,000 dead beasts we could not export any live.  If we elected to export 60,000 live beasts we could not send an ounce packed.  Under this agreement there is no limit.

      <P>I want to say in relation to the general agricultural situation that it is very pleasant to go around the country and see that the policy of the present Minister for Agriculture and the Fianna Fáil Government is being put actively into operation by our farmers.  Instead of the big decrease year after year in tillage that was quite apparent under Deputy Dillon's régime, when the area of tillage fell by 500,000 acres or thereabouts, we have quite a large increase this year.  I had not the opportunity of hearing the Minister for Agriculture yesterday, but I am sure he told the House that 42 per cent. additional seed wheat went out this year over last year.  That would give us another 100,000 acres of wheat, and we hope it will save us many millions of dollars and we will not have&mdash;even if we had the dollars that we got from Marshall Loan&mdash;we will not have to worry how many million we can spend on wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You did not buy a pound of dollar wheat last year.  It all came from Australia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>If we had not grown so much ourselves, Australia could not have supplied us with it all.  There must be a little help to world production in various countries, and if our farmers were so foolish and, indeed, if Deputy Dillon had been there and had continued to give them 12/6 per barrel less than we gave them, they would probably have produced no wheat.  We would have had to buy all the wheat that was grown last year from Australia.  And seeing that Australia was largely committed to the British, we would have been pushed over to America and this year we would have to pay an extra 40 cents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>Ymer is not in the same class as Herta or Beorna.  I would not ask Deputy Dillon to agree with me that Beorna could be better than Ymer because Beorna is a product of Irish brains, knowledge and skill.  I am glad to say that our plant breeders have produced in Beorna a barley that is much stronger than Ymer to stand up, even as strong as Herta, and is as good as Spratt Archer for brewing.</P>

      <P>We will get back to feeding barley.  We are glad to say that feeding barley is up 22 per cent.  That is a considerable amount which will again save us many million dollars for maize.  Feeding barley produced here is a much better feeding stuff, as most Deputies know&mdash;Deputy Dillon might admit as much&mdash;for producing good bacon than imported maize.  We are living in the sort of world to-day in which we cannot import these feeding stuffs very cheaply.  Deputy Dillon once in his enthusiasm thought that maize would cost only £20 per ton.  He promised the farmers that never would maize rise above £20 per ton; we are now paying £28 or £30 per ton, and we paid even more.  Many people on the plea that maize was never going to rise above £20 per ton built exaggerated hopes on egg production. Deputy Dillon promised every farmer's wife when she saw the beak of a chicken peeping through the shell could say: &ldquo;If you are a pullet, I know the price of every egg you will lay as long as you are a good layer.&rdquo; It was not very long after the Deputy made his prophecy in regard to chicks <Col N="1478" /> and eggs that the price of eggs fell first by 6d. per dozen and then by 1/- per dozen while the price of maize went up from £20 to £30 per ton.  That is the promise Deputy Dillon made.  I do not blame Deputy Dillon; the people I blame are those who put the Deputy in charge of the Department of Agriculture and who kept him there.</P>
      <P>I am also glad to say that Deputy Dillon, in the final analysis, was the cause of their downfall, because we debated his Estimate for Agriculture for three or four weeks.  Everybody on the then Government side who could say a word was asked to preach for hours until finally, instead of taking a vote, they bolted to the country.  We are still keeping Deputy Dillon running around the country and we hope to keep him occupied in that way for many years to come.</P>

      <P>I am not, but I regard Deputy Dillon as a godsend for Fianna Fáil.  With his help, as well as by reason of our own virtue, we remained in office for 16 years.  After all, the people did not know that a Coalition was going to be formed. Deputy Blowick went round the country before that election saying that he was not going to coalesce with anybody, that there was a bad smell in the Dáil after all the Farmers' Parties that had been gobbled up by Fine Gael and that they were not going to allow the same fate to overtake them.  We know, of course, that the Coalition lasted for three years and we are glad to say that it was Deputy Dillon finally bolted them to the country.  It is unfortunate, however, that the Party with which Deputy Dillon is now associated, for a time, would not apply a little bit of discipline to his tongue.  It is amusing to listen to his exaggerations but, if our people want to do their business in a constructive fashion, they should be allowed to learn the truth without being interrupted by Deputy Dillon's exaggerations and positive falsehoods. The people of the country are entitled to expect that an ex-Minister, whether he appears in a by-election or on any <Col N="1479" /> other occasion, should not create a scare by stating that the farmers of the country were going to be pauperised under the agreement which we have negotiated.  They are also entitled to know that there would be a continuing export market for their live stock and that under the agreement, which everybody knew was on the point of being signed, they would still be allowed to continue the export of store cattle.</P>

Deputy Dillon has no more compunction in making an allegation and trying to create a scare among the people that they will not be allowed to export their store cattle than Deputy Blowick had when he went around the country before 1948 swearing he would never sell into a Coalition and talking about the bad smell that the previous Farmers' Party left when it coalesced with Fine Gael.  I am sorry that the Opposition Parties we have in this Parliament are not an Opposition which will hit as hard as it can any Government for its sins of omission or commission instead of trying to create scares or trying to get nine or ten seats on false pretences by swearing they will not join a coalition. If Deputy Blowick approached the people and said: &ldquo;Although we are completely opposed to Labour we will join with them,&rdquo; then the people would know ahead of time that if they elected Deputy Blowick they would either have to find another £10,000,000 for the civil servants or not to be too sure whether they would not have £9,000,000 or £10,000,000 less.</P>

      <P>I am glad the farmers have had the sense to increase their tillage this year.  I am glad they have increased their use of ground limestone so phenomenally and I am glad also that they have increased the use of other artificial fertilisers.  It is unfortunate that after the war when fertilisers became available freely we did not go in for a good campaign of urging the farmers to build up soil fertility by using all the artificial fertilisers the land requires.  I am sorry that Deputy Dillon stopped the burnt lime scheme when he became Minister for Agriculture. Although we were regarded as a Government of misers we had produced the money, taxed for the money, in order to give our people an opportunity of putting burnt limestone on the land.  When the more modern form of calcium became available in ground limestone we encouraged our people to use that.  Indeed, we were engaged in promoting a scheme for encouraging the farmers in every way to put on the 2,000,000 tons of ground limestone necessary to restore the calcium status of the soil.  When Deputy Dillon came into office he stopped the subsidy on burnt limestone.  At the end of 1948 he told the agricultural committees that he would not give them any subsidy on ground limestone.  That was unfortunate because this year going around the country one can see the improvement in the countryside caused by a mere 1,000,000 tons of limestone put on the soil in the last couple of years.</P>

He had to wait to be kicked into it by a foreigner.  There are many other things Deputy Dillon had to be kicked into&mdash;I am glad to say by the Irish people.  We kicked him into having a good respect for the Republican flag.  We kicked him into having some little respect for wheat and peat and beet.  The beet <Col N="1484" /> acreage has gone up this year.  So has the wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Feeding barley has gone up by 22 per cent.  We kicked him into believing that wheat should be grown and could be grown in this country. We kicked him into growing the beet. We are glad to say that the peat which he hoped would go up the spout is now producing the cheapest electricity from solid fuel in the world.  There are other things we hope to teach Deputy Dillon or at least the people behind him and who support him: that the right thing for the people of this country is to utilise their own resources in the land and anywhere else in order to have a reasonable standard of life here.</P>
      <P>We are glad that the farmers of this country are availing themselves of the lime scheme to a large measure.  I hope that they will avail themselves of it to a much greater extent in the years to come.  It is their duty not only to themselves and their families but also to the country to see that the calcium status of our country is restored within the shortest possible time.  It is ridiculous that we should have a limit to growth in this country for want of calcium since we have it in abundance.  It is richer and purer than the calcium in most other countries in the world.  We have an abundance of it.  Twelve million tons to our total reserve of limestone is as a grain of sand on a beach.</P>
      <P>We are glad, too, that our farmers are increasing their use of artificial fertilisers.  We have a long road to go, unfortunately, until we have applied to our soil all the lime and artificial manures that are required.  That grand little country of Holland could give us many lessons in that respect.  The Dutch apply to each acre at least six times as much potash as we apply and about 40 times as much nitrogen.</P>

The people of this country are entitled to know from time to time what the Government is at.  They are not entitled, just immediately before a by-election, a general election or a local election to be told that the Government are proposing to stop the export of all store cattle, and Deputy Dillon was quite well aware that his statement on that was a complete and absolute falsehood.</P>

The Minister has kept the House for exactly an hour without making a single worthwhile contribution to the debate except to try to paint in his own way the picture that everything Deputy Dillon did was wrong, as well as a whole lot of things which he said Deputy Dillon did, but which he never did.  No matter how the Minister for External Affairs tries, <Col N="1491" /> he will not get away from the fact that Deputy Dillon put the land reclamation scheme and the ground limestone scheme on their feet in this country. Before Deputy Dillon became Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for External affairs knew as much about ground limestone as a cat does about the moon.</P>

What has the Minister for Agriculture been doing for two years if he has not discovered that?  Why is it that he has saved Deputy Dillon's bacon if there was such a secret agreement?  Why has the Minister for Agriculture allowed the Minister for External Affairs, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Taoiseach and everybody else to roam and prowl through his Department and make an office boy of him?

They know his temper and his mettle very well by this time.  When he comes down the country and appears on platforms wearing a sanctimonious face, appealing to the small farmers to give him his beloved over-all majority, he does not tell them about the way he enjoys and laughs every time he can make a cod or a joke of them in the Dáil.</P>

I ask the present Minister for Agriculture what exactly was the position of the canned meat trade or the carcase meat trade before Deputy Dillon became Minister for Agriculture in 1948?

      <P>He told us that the exports of carcase beef in 1938 amounted to 127 tons.  In 1939 there is a blank.  Apparently from 1939 to 1948 <Col N="1494" /> there was none exported because they are all blanks here.  In 1948, the first year that Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, it was not 127 tons, it was 692 tons.  In 1949 it was 873 tons.  In 1950 it had risen to 3,123 tons. In 1951, the year in which Deputy Dillon left office, it had climbed from nothing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>On the next page of this very interesting document the Minister gives one short paragraph to canned meat.  For the information of Deputies I will read it out word for word now as it appears in this document which the Minister so kindly got his Department to prepare for the information of Deputies:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Canned Meat: The quantity of canned beef exported during the calendar year 1952 was almost 18,000 tons as compared with 11,000 tons in 1951 and 9,000 tons in 1950.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He does not go back beyond 1950.  It would not do because the figures for 1949 and 1948 would reveal that it was then the industry initiated by Deputy Dillon was put on its feet.</P>
      <P>I will recall another little incident. The Minister for Agriculture may not know this.  I do not expect him to know it.  We have a bacon factory in Castlebar that we are very proud of.  For three years before Fianna Fáil went out of office in 1948, the management on many occasions asked the outgoing Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, for a licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A shower of licences was issued immediately after Deputy Dillon went into office, including one to Castlebar, with the result that inside two years a most valuable and thriving industry was built up that almost overshadowed the bacon side of the industry in Castlebar.  I am speaking of just one town.  That went on merrily until last <Col N="1495" /> January.  By that time, of course, the paralysing hand of Fianna Fáil descended on it the same as it descended on many other things, with the result that 150 employees, men, women and boys, were dismissed.  I am just wondering what the present Minister for Agriculture is doing about that.</P>

He withheld the text of the agreement which he must have had in his possession last night and then comes in this evening and gives the text.  Then, of course, the Minister for External Affairs gets up here, and here are some of the statements he made: that Deputy Dillon wanted to give 1/- a gallon for milk; that Deputy Dillon killed the ground limestone scheme, the scheme which he established; that Clann na Poblachta was this, that Clann na Talmhan was that and the Labour Party was something else.</P>

      <P>I want to say a word <Col N="1501" /> about the farm building scheme.  I want to bring one change that has been made recently in that scheme to the Minister's notice.  During the inter-Party Government's time and, I think, for a year after the present Minister took office, it was customary that farmers were allowed to use the old roofing material again if it was galvanised iron or asbestos of fairly good quality and provided it was given a protective coat of paint.  But they have been told now to get new iron or the grants will be substantially reduced.  There is neither sense nor reason in that alteration or change. I do not know whether the Minister is aware of that or not.  It would be in keeping with other things about that Department if he was not.  Many farmers might pull down an old building with good roofing material that might have been put up only a few years ago and I do not see what is the reason they could not use it over again because after all, it is the main structure of the building that matters, and if a bad roof is put on, it is the farmer who suffers, not the Department.  If the farmer feels he will suffer, he will not be so foolish as to put on stuff that will rot down within three or four years.</P>
      <P>There is not nearly enough out-office accommodation on the average farm or holding in this country.  I think if a check were made there would not be one farm out of 20 that has sufficient such accommodation.  That really has to do more with another Minister's Department&mdash;that is the Minister for Finance and the Commissioners for Valuation, and with the Valuation Acts &mdash;than with anything else.  We have still a relic of the landlord system hanging on here so that when a farmer improves his out-offices his valuation goes up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in this <Col N="1502" /> difficulty, Sir.  I know that the Minister for Finance, under whom it would probably come, does not understand the first thing about this, and it should not be out of place for me to bring it to the notice of the Minister for Agriculture so that that Minister would bring the situation before the Minister for Finance.  I only want to raise it in so far as I am asking him to bring it to the notice of the Minister for Finance, because it does come more properly under his Estimate.  But it is one thing that is holding back and retarding the development of farms all over the country.  The loss is colossal. In our wet, rainy and damaging climate&mdash;at certain times of the year during October, November, December and January, the weather is very damaging on account of the heavy rainfall and lack of drying&mdash;the amount of crops that are damaged, the amount of farm machinery and tools that are damaged&mdash;I think I would not be underestimating that damage if I say it would run into £10,000,000 a year. We see a lot in this country about the estimated loss caused by various pests, rats, etc., and the damage they do, but this is one of the biggest drains we have.  Now that most of the dwellinghouses are fairly good and in a healthy condition the out-office buildings must be the next thing to be tackled.  If this Government does not do it the next Government will tackle it.  The question of the valuations is the whole cause of the trouble, or one of the principal causes of the trouble there.</P>
      <P>One of the most serious things brought to our notice during the present year was that 78,000 able-bodied persons aged between 15 and 45 left the country since the 1946 census was taken.  I wonder what is the Government going to do about it.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister what is he going to do about it. Suppose that a proportionate number of male workers left the industries in England we would say what is England going to do about it?  In a country where there are only 500,000 approximately engaged in the principal industry, to say that 75,000 of these people have gone from that occupation &mdash;and I want to put this without any political bias&mdash;what does the Minister and the Government propose to do about it?  If they find that during the next five or six years another 70,000 or 80,000 leave the country, the question of food production would be put in the background.  I think it is one of our most serious problems next to the problem of the 90,000 unemployed because it is a steady drain that is not being replaced.  If we travel to any part of the country we must be struck by the fact that many houses are becoming derelict, that holdings of land that once sheltered and reared happy families are gone and that whole families have gone into the towns or to England or America.  Whole families have moved out.  I put down a question to the Taoiseach recently to find out how many families had left.  I was told by the Parliamentary Secretary that the information was not available.  If it was not, it ought to be in such a serious matter as that.  The population is pretty stable at the present time.  I believe there is some slight increase. We have reached the bottom of the well and we are beginning to increase but we must take account of the fact that at the same time the trend is away from the land and into the cities and out of the country.  What is the Minister going to do about it?  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>When I moved to <Col N="1504" /> report progress I was trying to get a comparison between the number of people who are likely to avail themselves of this scheme in the higher income group and the benefits available to them.  In the Minister's speech reported in Volume 139, No. 8, column 1226 he stated:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Statistics Office has given us figures showing that there were 240,000 married women under 44 years of age in the country and the number of births each year for some years back is between 60,000 and 65,000.  Taking all the married women it is fairly simple to discover that a child appears every four years.  Of course in statistics you must always take the whole lot and average it out in that way.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I agree with that, of course, but the point in this instance is that the amendment with which we are dealing refers only to the upper income group alone.  The Minister's statement was not clear as to how many married women are in the upper income group. There are certainly not 240,000 married women in the upper income group. He bases his argument on that fact that if all, or a substantial number, of these people were to join this scheme it would work out at about £4 for each child born and that the scheme would pay for itself.  To begin with these 240,000 married women are not in the upper income group, and this amendment does not apply to them at all, although it may from a statistical point of view.  Has the Minister any guarantee that any substantial number of people in the upper income group are going to pay £1 per year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they are going to pay £1 per year, they, naturally, ask themselves what are they going to get for this £1.  So far as I read the section, they are going to get a bed in a public ward.  Anybody with a family income of over £600 a year is supposed to be in the upper income group.  Take a person with about £700 a year, who wishes to get some benefit from this so-called contributory scheme, as it now is.  What benefit are they going to get by subscribing £1 a year?  They are going to <Col N="1505" /> get the offer of a bed in a public ward and nothing else.</P>
    <P>I think it is clear that this scheme was unworkable from the beginning and the more the Minister tries to amend it, the worse it gets.  The £1 a year proposal is now being changed to the &ldquo;appropriate sum&rdquo; because it dawned on the Minister that £1 a year was not a reasonable contribution.  I think the Minister would be better advised to scrap the whole thing and start from a new angle.  If he accepted the principle of contributory insurance, he could at least offer to the people something specific and they would know what they were going to get.  Anybody contemplating availing of these benefits is supposed to pay £1 a year and for that they get a bed in a public ward.  I think I am right in saying that they get a bed in a public ward for a fortnight.  What is the use of that?  If you have a contributory scheme you pay a certain sum of money and that sum enables the person concerned to receive certain monetary benefits.  First of all, you are in a position to know what you are going to be the recipient of, and, secondly&mdash; and this is a most important point&mdash; you have a free choice.  You are getting these monetary benefits and you have a free choice of where you are to go and where you will spend these monetary benefits, providing you spend them in relation to any sickness or maternity necessity that may arise.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any sense in the £1 a year scheme and I cannot see that it is going to clarify the position in any way by substituting the &ldquo;appropriate sum&rdquo; for that £1.  If the pioneers of the scheme pay £1 a year and accept these so-called benefits&mdash;I cannot see what the benefits are, actually&mdash;the only apparent benefit is a bed in a public word.  If only a few of them accept the scheme and the scheme is going to be extended in a few years' time, the position will be that the pioneers of the scheme will be allowed to continue at £1, but if the scheme has not justified itself, the people who come in afterwards on this scheme of &ldquo;the appropriate sum&rdquo; will have to pay an inflated price for the losses incurred in the earlier years of the scheme.</P>
    <P>I do not know what correspondence <Col N="1506" /> the Minister has had in regard to the scheme, but I can find no enthusiasm whatever for it in the constituency I represent.  Quite a lot of people of that income group have asked what they get for this particular contribution of £1.  I told them that they get a bed in a public ward and that is all they do get.  The benefits that accrue from this scheme as a whole are not really satisfactory.  I do not think it is a workable scheme. I think it is an attempt on the part of the Minister to meet several forces of opinion.  Perhaps it has been forced on him, but I do not think it is going to pay for itself.  We have absolutely no guarantee that it is.  I do not think that the statement which I quoted here and which the Minister made last Thursday, really does clarify the position so far as this amendment is concerned because it deals with the problem as a whole.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGilligan pointed out, people in the higher income group would comprise those who have more than £600 a year and £600 a year has now a purchasing power of only £240 as compared with pre-war days.  I am quite satisfied that not every one of these people will join the scheme; I would say that not more than 20 per cent. of them will join it but, even if they did, I do not think this arrangement is at all practicable.  I am quite satisfied that there are many people who find it a considerable hardship to pay the fees attendant on maternity cases, but if we are going to assist them&mdash;and we are just as willing to assist them as Fianna Fáil or any of the other Parties who want a free-for-all scheme&mdash;let us have something sensible and something practicable and not a scheme that experience will show confers no benefit on anybody whatsoever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question arising out of his speech.  The Minister did say something about fixing a maximum contribution of £2.  Was that for some service in addition to what is set out here in sub-section (1) Section 15 or to cover some service which it was originally intended to cover by the £1 set out in the section itself?  It seems to <Col N="1507" /> me, speaking with all the hesitancy of a layman, that under sub-section (1) we are offering so to speak to provide medical, surgical, midwifery, hospital and specialist services for whatever the period may be and, I take it, it is quite possible the period may vary. That does strike me as a layman as being very strange.  I cannot understand how if all those services are required they can be provided for anything like a cost of £8.  Frankly, I cannot see how all these services, or even a number of them, set out in the sub-section can be provided and the full cost of them covered by a figure like £8.  It is very hard to accept that as being a fact.  The Minister says he is suggesting substituting a maximum of £2 in amendment No. 20.  I do not think that helps the situation at all, and, if I may say so, I do not think it makes the position any easier for those who take a particular stand for reasons different from ours on this side of the House.</P>

At any rate, in order to allay the fears of some Deputies, who said it might be £25 eventually, I said we would put a limit of £2 on it.  I should have said, of course, that there is great stress being laid on hospitals, public wards and so on.  From the beginning I have been trying to stress as far as I can in this Bill that I expect most people will have their babies at home, and it will be a case of domiciliary treatment. Only in some cases will they have to go to hospital.  As far as public wards are concerned, we can discuss that matter when we come to amendment No. 45.  It is provided there that if any person elects to choose her own hospital she will get a subvention of so much per week.</P>

      <P>I am obliged to the Minister for making that point because I had overlooked it.  Again, it does seem to me that if medical, surgical, midwifery and specialist services have to be supplied in the home and not in the hospital, instead of being cheaper they will be much more costly.</P>

      <P>We must talk about the average.  There will be simple cases and there will be difficult cases. There will be cases where no surgical treatment will be required.  Taking the average, with all due respect to the Minister, and to the information and figures he has been given, it seems to me to be an extremely low figure.  I do not see how the services can be provided at that figure.  That brings me to another point.  The Minister says the majority of the women&mdash;I am inclined to agree with him on the point&mdash;will continue to have their babies at home.  I notice that yesterday the Minister said most emphatically that in cases such as that, if medical, or surgical or midwifery treatment was required there would be a free choice of doctors.  The Minister knows that is not possible in our present circumstances.  It is not fair to mislead.  In rural Ireland in present circumstances it is not possible to give a free choice of doctor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were possible, would that not be another factor in increasing the cost?  The Minister's figures, so far as they can be measured at the moment are based on the present cost in hospitals of giving this treatment or treatment akin to it to those who are at present entitled to that treatment free of charge.  If the majority of women elect to stay at home it seems to me it will be utterly impossible to implement the scheme and we will only be fooling ourselves in accepting the suggestion that the services set out here can be made available and given for a sum of £8 per year.  I do not believe there is a medical man in the House, including the Minister, who as a result of his own experience believes that can be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like a little further clarification.  Section 15 deals. <Col N="1509" /><i>in toto</i> with medical care for mothers. There is a sidenote which does not really count.  Sub-section (1) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A health authority shall, in accordance with regulations, make available, without charge, medical, surgical, midwifery, hospital and specialist services for attendance to the health of women ... in respect of motherhood.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this is confined to either medical, surgical, midwifery, hospital or specialist services in relation to child bearing. For that there is to be an insurance scheme for the higher income group, but Section 14 is still in the background with regard to institutional services for care other than that in respect of motherhood, and there is a charge in that connection of 42/- per week or 6/- per day.  The position is that if a woman develops some abdominal trouble and goes into hospital for, let us say, an appendix operation, if she is in the middle income group she goes into the public ward and she, or someone on her behalf, must pay at the rate of 6/- per day or 42/- per week.  If the trouble turns out to be childbirth, if she is in the higher income group, she comes in under this insurance scheme.  But amendment No. 45 changes that situation. This has all to be taken in relation to the public ward in an institution. As I understand amendment No. 45, it means that if a person is going to be treated elsewhere than in the public ward of one of the ordinary public hospitals then a grant equal, so to speak, to the cost associated with the public ward will be made in respect of that person if it is a question of motherhood or institutional services of the kind set out.  Let us know where we are in respect of what used to be called the free-for-all no payment by anybody type of scheme.  That was the slogan up and down the country.  There will now be payments.  There are going to be payments in the institutions. There are going to be contributions towards an insurance scheme.  In addition to that, it is understood that the local authority will have to increase the rates by 2/-.  Over and above all that, we have decided to make the <Col N="1510" /> people's food dearer so that they can get better health, if anyone can imagine that happening, on dearer food which means less food.  If the people on less or dearer food get ill, their treatment will depend on the class they fall into.</P>
    <P>If they are completely destitute they will get free treatment in the public ward.  Those in the middle income group will get institutional service at 6/-.  If it is in respect of motherhood they will get maternity service on the insurance principle.  That is the situation we have at the moment.  We have cut subsidies in order to get something in substitution for the public ward system.</P>

On a previous occasion it was explained that it did not appear to be as evident as it might be that the choice of doctor was provided for.  This amendment is put in to make it abundantly clear that the local authority is expected to provide for a choice of doctor in the case of maternity when drawing up the scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to tell us whether this provision in regard to the choice of doctor can, in fact, be made effective at all, or whether we are just purporting to put something into a Bill which, so far as the greater part of the country is <Col N="1512" /> concerned, is just, to put it bluntly, eyewash.  There may be a two-fold obstacle to giving this choice of doctor. First and foremost, the doctor who is prepared to operate this Bill must register.  From what we read in the newspapers we know that certain doctors will not register to operate this scheme.  In fact, we are told that the majority of them will not register to operate the scheme. If the majority, or even all of them, agree to register and work under the scheme, I want to repeat again that in my opinion in the greater part of this country, particularly throughout rural Ireland and in the more backward areas, it is just not possible to give that choice because the choice is not there.  I think the Minister himself knows that much better than I do.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is not being really fair to the House or even to himself in moving this important amendment which is a very important part of this Bill by merely referring to the technical side from the drafting point of view.  I think the Minister ought to tell us what are his hopes of being able to make this part of the Bill effective or to what extent it can be made effective, or in what areas it can be made effective.  There is no use putting something into a piece of legislation which can only operate in part over the whole country, if it can do that, or can only operate in part or in full in certain areas of the country.  Provided they register you could then get that choice of doctor in the big centres of population where you have a number of doctors.  In the remote and rural areas you cannot get that choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not fully agree with the Deputy.  More than half the population live in cities and towns where the choice of doctor will be availed of. I suppose the other half would be living within easy reach of cities and towns where they can have the choice. When I was young and in a town I had a practice within a radius of 14 miles.  If a radius of 14 miles is taken in by most of the cities and towns, there is not very much of the country left where there is no choice.  There <Col N="1513" /> may be certain parts where it will be difficult to have choice.  But even in that case I think it is possible for a woman who is very anxious to avoid the doctor to stay with her mother or sister when another doctor would look after her even if she does not go to the hospital.  The great majority will have the choice of doctor.  I realise that there are many who are satisfied with the dispensary doctor and will not look for anybody else.</P>

      <P>The point made by the Minister seems to me to add weight to what I have already said. Let us assume that what the Minister has now said is correct, that a doctor in a town can reasonably cover an area within a radius of 14 miles from that town.  Is that going to fit into the £8 cost?</P>

      <P>The Minister said a moment ago that he could not be expected to give the cost as he did not know what he would have to pay the doctors.  There is no use in the Minister taking that line.  Take the case where a doctor has to travel 14 miles from <Col N="1514" /> his own home to attend a patient. Surely, he is entitled to reasonable remuneration for doing that.  He cannot walk there and back.  He must either take his own car or hire a car. I want to put it to the Minister that the person who is living in a remote area in this country is fortunate to be within reasonable reach of one doctor, but very often she is not within reasonable reach of a midwife.  May I also venture to say that the person living in such an area is probably in more need of medical as well as midwifery attention than the person who is living close to a town or a hospital?  Speaking from my knowledge of the country, it seems to me that this section cannot be operated in respect to more than 50 per cent. of the people who may wish to take advantage of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite know what Deputy Morrissey has in mind in pressing the point that there will not be a choice of doctor.  If he is anxious that there should be a choice of doctor, I am in complete accord with him.  I do not think anyone can gainsay the fact that this Bill does greatly improve the position of the mother who is at present benefiting under the dispensary system.  She has now no choice of doctor, even if there is more than one doctor in the area.</P>
      <P>I think this scheme is one that is going to improve health services, and I am sure the Minister means that there will be a free choice of doctor where that is possible.  That may not be possible in areas such as those referred to by Deputy Morrissey, but the important point is that it will be possible in the great majority of the population areas, the cities, the towns and the villages.  As regards the mountainy areas, naturally, the Minister can do nothing there except he was to force doctors to go and live in the mountains which, obviously, would be an unthinkable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt at all that the free choice of doctor is being extended very considerably&mdash;not to 100 per cent. perhaps&mdash;by virtue of the fact that in the cities and towns and in most of the villages there will be a fair choice of doctors.  As far as I am concerned, this is an advance on the system which <Col N="1515" /> I have so often deprecated, and which exists at the moment&mdash;the dispensary system under which the mother in the lower income group has no choice of doctor.  If we are making an advance on that, and, personally I think this is a substantial advance, then I think the Minister is to be congratulated.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Labour amendment, I do not see how it can be read into the Minister's amendment that it is only in a hospital an intending mother can be treated.  I think the Minister's amendment clarifies the point that she will have free choice of doctor.  The doctor, naturally, will not be ordered to treat all intending mothers in hospital.  If that were so, it would mean the end of the general practitioner service.  It would mean that a ridiculous situation had developed if it were suggested that the only service available to intending mothers was that which was provided in the hospitals.  It is implied that the mother, once she is eligible for the service of a doctor, will decide herself where she is to give birth to her child. She is then covered by the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In cases where there is power to have a choice, and in which institutional treatment is required, I should like to know from the Minister in what type of institution in any particular county health area will maternity work be carried out? You have in these areas a county hospital and a district hospital.  I take it that a certain number of beds is set aside in every district hospital for maternity cases.  Let us assume that in a small urban district there is a district hospital which was formerly held by the local dispensary doctor. The Minister knows that the Department has, in many cases, insisted on a separate appointment being made to the district hospital and a separate appointment to the dispensary.  In that case, you have at least two doctors. There are urban areas of that kind. As well as the doctor appointed to the dispensary you also have a doctor appointed to the district hospital with perhaps one or two other doctors also available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that situation, let us take the <Col N="1516" /> case of a person who desires to have choice of doctor and requires institutional treatment.  Will the dispensary doctor, who at present is kept out of the district hospital, have access to that institution if his patient requires institutional treatment?  Suppose there is a general practitioner in the area and a patient of his requires institutional treatment, will he have access to the district hospital for the purpose of attending and treating his patient?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to submit an amendment to cover the amendment that was put in, prior to his doing so, by Deputies Norton and Corish.  I wish I could be as confident as Deputy Dr. Browne that what is implied in any Act of legislation will automatically become law.  We want the thing to be beyond any question of doubt that if a woman chooses to receive attention in her own home she automatically qualifies for choice.  If the Minister gives that assurance I will be satisfied with it, but I might say that at the time we put in our amendment the Minister had not then indicated that he was going to give a choice of doctor at all.  I am very glad to see that he has now come round to our view.  I am at one with what Deputy Dr. Browne says in connection with the choice.  It may be restricted somewhat, as Deputy Morrissey says, although I think Deputy Morrissey has slightly exaggerated that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the point that a working man is often willing to pay to come into the village or nearest town to put his wife in a home where she will even get a certain amount of refund of the price of the medical services given should that home or the doctor in charge of that home accept the conditions. The question of choice will, I hope, be extended some time when more doctors will be persuaded to come in to work under the scheme, if that point ever arrives, but the Labour Party have all the time in view the fact that even in amending this Health Bill we must have in the back of our mind that at some time some sane Government will get together and deal with the Medical Association and try to get the Medical Association to <Col N="1517" /> accept a health scheme and to work a health scheme, because we feel that, no matter what we do, it is madness to be trying to fight against the people who administer the actual essential services of the scheme; you just will not make the scheme work successfully.  We must look to the future and hope that at some time the scheme will be worked with the goodwill of the medical profession. We want to make the scheme as broad as we can make it at the present moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The sentiment behind this amendment is excellent in theory. Whether it is workable in practice or not we do not know.  Neither does the Minister know.  The Minister has made no agreement with any doctor so far. That is the difficulty.  It is all very much in the air.  All the different sections and amendments, that such and such is to take place, are very much in the air.  I will read out the amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To add to the section the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) Regulations shall provide that any woman entitled to receive medical services under this section may receive them from such registered medical practitioner who has entered into an agreement with the health authority for the provision of those services and who is willing to accept her as a patient as she may choose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The only doctors who have entered into any agreement with the health authority, so far as I know, are the dispensary doctors.  As has been brought out very clearly by Deputy Dr. Browne, the position at the moment is that they are at present confined in the choice to the dispensary doctor.  The only people with whom the Minister has any agreement are the dispensary doctors.  Any of the dispensary doctors that I have spoken to, about this Bill as a whole, do not seem to be too happy.  The amendment suggests that there will be a free choice of doctor.  That is an admirable sentiment but is it practicable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be all right if the Minister were able to tell us that he had made some agreement or had some constructive <Col N="1518" /> consultations with members of the profession to work out even the elementary stages.  There is no scheme as far as I know and there have been no consultations whatever.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy has made a very good point indeed.  The position definitely needs clarification.  If any doctor is attending a patient and that patient is transmitted to a hospital, is it the intention of the Minister that the doctor should be able to follow that patient into the hospital and continue the treatment or would that patient, <i>ipso facto,</i> come under the control of the medical officer in the institution?  From the amendment we had last week, it is difficult to know what will happen because, apparently, the county manager will control the hospital; he will decide who will go into the hospital; he will decide how they will be treated in the hospital. If I send a patient to a hospital, if I am working the scheme and have a contract with the Minister's Department, do I lose that patient, do I lose my contract, does that contract pass to the hospital doctor?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the patient lose her choice?  That is the other way of looking at it.  I think it is fair to state that in Leinster, as a whole, you probably would have a choice of doctor in the majority of instances, but not a lot.  Take the average country town with a population of 3,000 or 4,000. You would probably have a dispensary doctor and you might have another doctor living there who is connected with another dispensary outside, and maybe a local hospital doctor.  That is all.  You will not have many private practitioners available such as the amendment seems to me to envisage. In bigger towns&mdash;Wexford, Sligo, Tralee and such places&mdash;you probably would have a choice of doctor.  The Minister gets over that by saying that doctors practise within a radius of 14 miles.  That is perfectly true.  Some good doctors practise within a radius of 20 miles.  Deputy Morrissey made a point, and it is a good one, that if <Col N="1519" /> you are going to have a scheme such as this which is a State contributory scheme, or insurance, how will you pay doctors if they are going to travel that distance?  It is all very well to say that there will be free choice of doctor and that that doctor can practise within a radius of 14 miles to attend a patient.</P>
      <P>The Minister gets over that by saying that the patient can stay with a relation when she is having a baby. I do not think that covers the point. In Leinster there is a certain choice of doctor in the bigger centres.  In some cases in Munster you may have it.  I do not know anything about Ulster but in the West of Ireland you will certainly not have free choice of doctor. In some of the sparsely populated areas of the West and in the greater number of places in Connaught there is only one doctor&mdash;Deputy McQuillan will bear that out&mdash;who covers an area of miles.</P>

      <P>It covers a big area all the same.  Legislation such as this purports to deal with the whole of Ireland and the point I am making is that there are different conditions in different places.  Every part of Ireland is different.  There is rural Ireland, urban Ireland and sparsely populated areas.  I do not think there is free choice of doctor except in some instances.</P>
      <P>Of course, the principle behind the amendment is very sound but it would be very difficult for us to judge whether there would be free choice of doctor until the Minister has made some arrangements, outside the doctors who are already in State employment or are employed by the health authorities, such as the dispensary doctors and rate-aided hospital doctors.  These are the only doctors, so far as I know, in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it the Minister intends by <Col N="1520" /> this amendment, which I approve of if it is practicable, to include other doctors.  Surely it would not be out of place to ask the Minister to make a statement as to what scheme he has in view, how he will employ these doctors and enable a patient to get a free choice of doctors. I do not think that anything we have had so far has clarified the issue at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Kyne, I think that the clause as it is is better because, reading the amendment as put down by the Labour Party, it might be interpreted as providing that services would only be given in her own home.  I think it is better to leave it an open question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make sure about it. It is better to leave it alone.  Deputy Esmonde said that it is ridiculous for me to say that she might go back to her mother's home.  I have known several who went to their mother's house to have babies.  It happens sometimes.  Sometimes they go to a sister's house.  I am not saying they always do it.  I am only suggesting that it might happen.  I think it should be left an open question.  There will be no change so far as the hospitals are concerned.  The local authority hospital has its own staff.  A doctor who sends a case there does not follow up his case; neither will he under this. In the great majority of cases I expect that a doctor will treat a woman in her own home.  He may have to send her to hospital.  If he does, she will be in charge of the hospital staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the negotiations with the doctors on this matter it is intended to pay them so much for seeing a case through and a lesser amount if they send a case to hospital.  If they send a case to hospital, naturally they will not get so much.  I do not think that Deputy Esmonde should repeat that the county managers will direct these hospitals as to who should go in and even control the treatment.  As far as I can find out from county managers, and I asked them on more than one occasion, the procedure is that the doctor sends in <Col N="1521" /> the patient.  I do not know whether they have any power or not, but no county manager will have the courage to refuse to have any patient sent to a hospital if the doctor wants to send the patient.  The county managers do not interfere with the patient going in, neither do they interfere with the treatment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde must have a very poor opinion of the medical profession if he thinks any doctor would be dictated to by a county manager about the treatment of a patient.  I have never heard of a doctor who will accept that from a county manager.  Then why repeat that the county manager controls the treatment?  He does not. He would not be allowed to by the doctors even if he tried, and the Deputy ought to know that.</P>
    <P>Deputies have sought information as to the choice of doctor.  Having got information, what do they want?  Do they want a choice of doctor as far as it goes?  If so, the amendment is all right.  If the free choice of doctor is not there in certain cases, what is the suggestion?  I must say that I cannot see how we can provide a choice of doctor in very sparsely populated areas and I do not think that we would be justified in putting in a second doctor to live beside the dispensary doctor in sparsely populated areas.  I do not think Deputies opposite will advocate that either.  If they accept the position that we are giving the choice of doctor wherever feasible and just face, if you like, that it cannot be done in other cases, that is all right.  If there is any further suggestion to be made, let us hear it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing is, what is the limitation imposed, or is there any limitation imposed in the ministerial amendment by defining a registered medical practitioner as one who has entered into an agreement with the health authority for the provision of those services?  Why could not that be left out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not require an agreement.  There is an offer which can be accepted by the doctors giving the services.  A medical practitioner <Col N="1522" /> enters into an agreement with the health authority and that makes the doctor what the Hierarchy call a State doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is to be lost by leaving these words out and simply saying that the regulations shall provide that any woman entitled to receive medical services under this section may receive them from such medical practitioner, willing to accept her as a patient, that she may choose?  That is a completely free choice of doctor. Anything that prevents, even by a scruple, that completely free choice, is limiting the freedom of choice.  I suggest to the Minister that he should leave out the words &ldquo;who has entered into an agreement with the health authority for the provision of those services and who is willing to accept her as a patient as she may choose&rdquo; and let it run as I have said.  That simply means that under the regulations a capitation grant or fee will be established for the provision of maternity services for a person at home, a further payment to be made if the medical practitioner sends the patient to an institution.  The institution will presumably then get the payment. That is what I call free choice of doctor.  That free choice is not here.</P>
      <P>One of the main objections that the medical association and the Hierarchy have to this scheme is that the limitation to certain people means a limitation of choice.  They will not have full freedom of choice.  The limitation contained in the words I have quoted means that people are being directed to what is called the State doctor and cannot go anywhere else.  It may be that you will get more State doctors under this than under the more severely limited provision that was previously in the legislation, but there is still the limitation.  I do not see what is to be lost by cutting out these words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point which the Labour Party were attentive to, and which others would be attentive to, is where a person must enter an institution to get treatment.  With regard to Section 14, sub-section (9) provides &ldquo;specialist services shall not include <Col N="1523" /> ophthalmic services and services provided otherwise than in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability shall not be institutional services&rdquo;. As far as Section 14 is concerned, the doctor is not at liberty to treat a patient at home.  The patient will have to go to a dispensary or to an institution.  That particular provision is met in England where they have provided what is called a mileage grant to enable the registered State doctor to give his services outside the institution by going to the patient's home. Another provision is that, in order to prevent institutions being crowded with people who might like to avail of them and who used to get service at home, they make a charge for maintenance. The tendency here appears to be the other way, to cut out maintenance and make charges for medical attention.  I suggest that the English system is better, that by making patients in certain groups pay maintenance charges you keep people out of institutions.  They have a choice, but when they go to an institution they pay for maintenance.  If they do not go, they get what is called free services. By going to an institution they have some payment added.</P>
    <P>The other point included in the Labour amendment is that the patient may get State service in her home, subject only to the advice of her doctor. That is not in Section 15.</P>
    <P>It is true that it is not prohibited in Section 15 as it is prohibited under Section 14 because there, the services have to be institutional.  But it is open to this: the health authorities are to make these services available but they have to do it in accordance with regulations. What is to prevent a regulation being made following the lines of sub-section (9) of Section 14 and saying these services shall not be made available except in institutions?  It is all very easy for the Minister to say here that he intends to have professional services at home, although he veered away from that a moment ago by making an objection that will not stand, that if he is to use the terms <Col N="1524" /> that are in the Labour amendment that might mean the services can only be obtained at home.  By no possible means of forced interpretation could that construction be put on it.  It quite clearly states these people may obtain these services in their own homes.  I suggest this section should be very definitely clarified and, of course, very much improved, and would accord more with Catholic principles if the full freedom of choice were given.  I do not see anything at all against having it announced in the terms of the Act itself that the regulations shall not provide, and shall not impose any prohibition against the services being obtained at the patient's home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the remarks of the Minister just now about health authorities and control of the hospitals, the amendment to Section 9 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, by Order made in respect of a specified health institution, direct:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) that institutional services of a specified class shall be given in the institution,</P>
      <P>(b) that institutional services of a specified class shall not be given in the institution,</P>
      <P>(c) that institutional services shall be given in the institution to a specified class of persons, or</P>
      <P>(d) that institutional services shall not be given in the institution to persons of a specified class,</P>
      <P>and the health authority maintaining the institution shall comply with the direction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The health authority would appear to be the county manager.  Those four sections there would appear to give the county manager unlimited power to decide who is treated at the hospitals.  I think he could counter any order of the doctor&mdash;I do not say he would do so&mdash;but I think he is empowered to do so.  That was the point I was making when the Minister was replying just now.</P>

      <P>It struck me reading the Bill that the domiciliary <Col N="1525" /> service was not mentioned as much as I would like.  If the Minister says there is every intention to develop domiciliary service I would like to hear from the Minister if it is his intention to follow the development of the domiciliary service on the lines that have been done with the medical scheme in England, because it has been a tremendous success.  I think it is the outstanding feature of the present service in England.  I am sure it is the Minister's view that the delivery of as many babies as possible should be conducted at home.  Apart from the fact that it is desirable, it is going to help the hospitals enormously.  I would like to know from the Minister if he is thinking of providing the new domiciliary units which they have in England which go out fully equipped to deal with maternity cases.  They have gas and air machines, and they are able to get medical services and even specialist services, and this is associated with the provision of nurses, domestic assistance and home help is provided along with the grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HonorMaryCrowley" hpid="Mrs. Crowley Mrs. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is the most valuable part of the whole Bill.  It is a matter that I have been pressing for a long time.  I know how many women there are who prefer one doctor to another and quite often, though they can ill afford it, they will pay for a doctor who is not a dispensary doctor when having their babies.  I would ask the Minister whether this arrangement should be run on county lines or whether, for instance, somebody living on the border between one county and another could avail of the services of a doctor in the other county; or must they only keep to the doctor in the county in which they are living?  I think if they could avail of another doctor it would give greater freedom of choice.  I think in most counties there is good freedom of choice and any town of any size would have certainly two or three doctors.  Now that cars are so plentiful it is quite easy for a doctor to travel 14 or 15 miles. After all, that is only 28 miles of a journey&mdash;just one gallon of petrol.  It would not be very expensive and cars are fast nowadays.  I do not see it would add very much to the cost.  I <Col N="1526" /> would like the Minister to answer that question because it is rather important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the domiciliary services, it is naturally intended to develop it as far as possible for two very good reasons.  First, it will be cheaper and, secondly, there would not be enough hospital accommodation if all these women were to use it.  It must be encouraged, and there is no doubt about that.  What type of service we can provide is another matter. Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll, I am sure, knows that at the moment all we can offer is that if the woman chooses her doctor he will look after her as he looks after his patients at the moment. I do not think we could have that type of service mentioned by Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll because we have not got the State service of sending along all this equipment.  These doctors will be private practitioners so far as the scheme is concerned and will have to provide their own equipment and make their own arrangements, and look after patients in their own way.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan said there was no necessity to make an agreement. There is.  First we have to make sure that where a woman enters into an arrangement with a doctor for the time of confinement that he does actually look after her and that he cannot draw money without seeing her at all.  In other words, he must visit the woman before and after the birth. It is also necessary to know what doctors are entering on this panel as we call it because it may happen&mdash;and probably will happen in many cases&mdash; that a woman may make inquiries through the local authority what doctors are available so that she can make her own choice.  Therefore, for two reasons we must have doctors on this panel and they must make the agreement.  I cannot see how that limits the choice of the patients.  If the doctor is willing to take on the patient then she has a choice under the scheme amongst the doctors who are willing to take her on.  I cannot see how it makes any limitation in the choice.</P>

The Minister in reply to Deputy Dr. Esmonde said that the <Col N="1528" /> Deputy must have a very poor opinion of the medical man who would submit to dictation from the county manager. I understand that at a recent meeting of the Health Council a statement was made that the county manager might have a very delicate and difficult task in deciding what particular institution a patient would be sent to or in saying that one particular hospital should render a specialised type of treatment rather than another and the county manager said he was making that decision every day.</P>

      <P>I want to refer again to the question of domiciliary service.  I think it is of tremendous importance.  I seemed to have conveyed, although I did not mean to, that I was making inquiries about a domiciliary service staffed by State doctors.  That is not what I had in mind at all.  Basically the essential domiciliary service is a nursing service. I do not see why a domiciliary service should not be available to a patient, while the patient could still choose her own doctor.  If the case is an abnormal one, she can choose her specialist, in addition to her own private practitioner.  I want to submit that unless a first-class domiciliary service is provided there will be a much greater demand for accommodation for normal cases in a maternity hospital.  I think if we are going to operate this scheme successfully from the beginning, it is essential that, as <Col N="1529" /> far as possible, only abnormal cases should be dealt with in the maternity hospitals, and unless the intention is to have a first-class domiciliary service, you will have a frightful number of cases going into the maternity hospitals when it should not be necessary for them to go there.</P>

The Minister said in reply to Deputy Mrs. Crowley that a patient would not be confined to a selection of doctors within the area of her own county health authority.  The Minister said there would be a free choice from outside.  At the same time we are saying here that a doctor must enter into a contract or agreement with the health authority.  If a patient goes over the border to get a doctor whom she may prefer, obviously he will not necessarily have entered into an agreement with the health authority functioning within the area within which the patient resides.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That doctor can enter into a contract <Col N="1531" /> or agreement to provide services not only for one county but for several counties.  If he practises in these counties there is no trouble whatever about that unless Deputy Morrissey wants to make out that cannot be done.  Of course, it can be done and the Minister says clearly the system of choice is not confined to the county.  That is a very clear statement.  Deputy Morrissey does not want to accept it; he wants to create the usual obstruction.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan was very anxious about these agreements&mdash;the doctors should not enter into agreements.  Of course, they should enter into agreements. They should enter into a definite contract with the health authority.  Then this House would know how many doctors would be available to provide the services proposed under this Bill.  When such an agreement is entered into by a doctor I am perfectly certain that under the terms of that agreement he will be required to give a certain amount of notice before he terminates the agreement and he will be morally and legally bound to carry on in accordance with the agreement until such time as he tenders notice of his intention not to continue.  That in itself will be a guarantee to mothers that they will have available to them the services for which the doctors will be paid under the provisions of this Bill.  That ought to be clear to Deputy McGilligan.  It is clear.</P>

There ought to be travelling hospitals in the city areas&mdash;indeed, I would like to see the service extended to the rural areas too&mdash;properly equipped for dealing with difficult cases where the doctor and the nurse <Col N="1532" /> find themselves confronted with unanticipated difficulties.  There should be no trouble in providing such a service in the cities.  I am sure they could be extended to the rural areas without much difficulty.  Such a service exists in London and has proved very satisfactory.  It has resulted in the saving of many lives.  I hope that when this Bill comes into operation it will be possible to provide this type of ambulance service with first-class equipment and specialists that can be called out on receipt of an emergency telephone call to the appropriate hospital.</P>

Unless, for example, a doctor living in Wicklow has also entered into an agreement with the public health authority of Dublin County, he cannot attend a patient or be paid for attending a patient resident in County Dublin.

      <P>The health authority is the opening phrase in Section 15.  I turn to the 1947 Act to see what a health authority is.  It is the council of a county or a corporation of a county borough.  Let me interpose here the first phrase&mdash;a council of a county.  Transpose that into this section and it reads: &ldquo;A council of a county shall make available medical, surgical etc., treatment in accordance with regulations.&rdquo;  The regulations may so provide that any woman entitled to receive medical services under this section will receive such from the council of the county.  Surely it is the same council of a county.  In other words, it is a county council.  A county council shall make available certain services and the regulations under which these services are made available are to provide that the patient may receive them from such registered medical practitioner as entered into an agreement with the council of the county.  It is quite clear that it is tied down to one council.  At any rate, whether it is clear or not, would not the whole difficulty be obliterated&mdash;if there is a difficulty&mdash;by saying &ldquo;enter into an agreement with a health authority or with any health authority&rdquo;?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this being limited at all.  I do not see why there should have to be any agreement entered into with the health authority or any authority.  Why should not the patient be entitled to receive service from such registered medical practitioner who is willing to accept her as a patient, whomsoever she may choose? <Col N="1536" /> What is the difficulty about that?  I am told that the health authorities ought to know what doctors are available. You might as well suggest a scheme for grocers and that the people who wanted groceries would want to know what shops are open to them. If I want to buy groceries I can go anywhere.  That is the type of freedom we want or if I want to buy law, for instance, I could go to Deputy Cowan if I wish to do so.  Why have a man enter into an arrangement?  I cannot understand that point at all. The other method does give complete freedom of choice.</P>
      <P>On the question of domiciliary care, in England the general practitioner service can be given in the patient's home.  Here the services under Section 14 are limited to institutional and specialist services.  The institutional services are more or less described by the episode that is put to them and the specialist services are not to include ophthalmic services and services provided otherwise than in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear where we have departed from the freedom which people have in England so far as the general practitioner is concerned.  They have a mileage grant which allows a doctor to go to the patient's home and charge for it.  The English system aims at producing good results.  In this country where institutional services are not adequate to cope with a very heavy demand, by allowing the practitioner service to be given at home and by making charges for maintenance in the institution an incentive is given to the patient to be treated at home.</P>
      <P>With regard to the child service.  I put it to the Minister that this suggestion of domiciliary visits does not enter into the legislation.  There is no phrase that points towards services being rendered in a home.  The Minister said he was aiming at treatment in the institutions and treatment in the public ward of the institutions.  That is the slogan the whole time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 15.  We have Section 15 as it stands in the Bill except that one amendment has been put in which implies a choice of doctor, but I do not think we are quite clear yet what really is involved in that.  At any rate, it applies only to domiciliary work.  In so far as a woman goes into a local institution, whether a county institution or a district institution, the question of choice does not arise.  She is dealt with by the official doctor who is appointed to that institution.  The section does propose certain services, and I take it that the section from the Minister's point of view is intended to work.</P>
      <P>If it is intended to work, then it will cost a certain amount of money to deal with certain classes of persons, and it will require a certain amount of institutional arrangement to carry out that work.  It purports to provide for women of all classes in the country who want to come in under it.  It covers the persons who are referred to in Section 14, sub-section (2) (a), that is, persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, (b) adult persons whose yearly means are less than £600 and all adult persons mainly deriving their living from farming and whose rateable valuation is not more than £50.  I take it that sub-section (2) (d) of Section 14, which says: &ldquo;Persons not specified in the foregoing paragraphs who, in the opinion of the health authority, would be unable, without undue hardship, to provide institutional and specialist services for themselves or their dependents&rdquo;, covers the public assistance classes.  In terms of population, sub-section (d), the public assistance classes, covers 1,000,000 people.  In regard to sub-section (2) (c) which covers persons who derive their income from farming and whose rateable valuation is £50 and under, I would like the Minister to give us some idea as to how many persons are involved under that.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 deals with the providing of medical, surgical, midwifery, hospital and specialist services for certain women.  Sub-section (2) of Section 15 defines the type of women in respect of whom services are provided under sub-section (1), which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The women referred to in sub-section (1) of this section are:</P>
      <P>(a) women who are in, or who are dependents of persons in, any of the classes mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 14 of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take it that we are dealing with maternity services for women who belong to any of the classes described in sub-section (2) of Section 14.  The Minister has given us certain figures in regard to the number of women of marriageable age and the number of births on which the calculation of cost is based.  If the Minister is in a position to give us figures of the number of women of marriageable age who come under these four sections, that is, persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, adult persons of less than £600 income, adult persons who come under the farming heading and persons who come under the home assistance heading, we would be glad to have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only basis to go on for estimating the range of the population in respect of which these services can be required is by taking, in such a scrappy way as we can get them, the figures for the population as a whole.  Under sub-section (2), paragraph (d), we have the figure of 1,000,000 as the population. Under Section 2, paragraph (c), that is farming, the only information I can lay my hands on handily relates to the number of people who occupy farms with valuations not exceeding £50.  That information is contained in a table on page 2 of the Commission of Inquiry Report on Derating.  That was published quite a number of years ago, early in the 1930's.  The structure of our farming population, in relation to the size of the farms they occupy, with their valuations, does not change very much, so that we have at any rate an approximate figure as to the size of our farming population, or of the <Col N="1539" /> womenfolk who will come under this service.  On page 2 of that report on derating it is stated that, out of 378,568 occupiers of farm holdings, 346,689 or 91.5 per cent. occupy holdings with valuations of £50 or under.  That means that under Section 15 facilities for domicilary and, where necessary, institutional treatment, will be required under Section 14, paragraph (c) for 91.5 per cent. of the farming population.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (2), paragraph (b), we deal with persons, whose income is £600 or under.  I do not know if the Minister can give us figures as to the part of the population that will be covered by that.  When we come to sub-section (2), paragraph (a), that is, persons insured under the Social Welfare Act, we find that there are 630,000 persons who are insured under that Act.  These are the population figures at the back of the various classes that are referred to in Section 14.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give us any estimate of the cost of applying these services, and, in relation to the cost, can he give us any information as to the percentage of the cases that will be dealt with in institutions?  The Minister has already provided figures with regard to the beds available at the present time for maternity cases in the various counties.  He gave these figures in reply to a question by Deputy Norton at column 224, Volume 134, No. 2, of the 23rd October last. From that reply we find that in the County Carlow there are only eight maternity beds available in the local authority hospitals; County Cavan only 15; Longford only five; Monaghan only eight; Offaly only eight; Roscommon only ten, and in Waterford County only three.  These figures relate to general maternity beds.  Can the Minister give us any idea as to whether an estimate is being made as to the number of beds that will be required?</P>

      <P>I want to get some kind of an impression in respect to a section about which there has been a considerable amount of discussion.  I infer that the Minister considers it should work and hopes to endeavour to make it work.  Those who will be looking for services under this section will require very positive and definite attention and treatment.  They may get it in a domiciliary way or in an institutional way.  I think everything that is being done at the present moment with regard to propagandising health services and institutional services is creating a very definite increased demand for institutional services, particularly for maternity cases.  We want to get from the Minister information as to what estimate has been made of the number of people likely to require these services, particularly in the four classes that are mentioned specifically. Can he tell us what the increased cost is likely to be?</P>
      <P>We have seen from the Minister's reply to the question asked by Deputy Norton last October that there is a very great dearth of accommodation for maternity cases in most of the local authority hospitals.  Therefore, I am asking him whether any estimate has been made as to the increased number of beds that will be required in these areas, whether anything is being done at the moment, whether any progress is being made in the way of additions to these hospitals and what the capital cost of work of that kind is likely to be?  I am asking for an estimate of the cost of carrying on these services on the one hand, and for an estimate of the additional capital cost of providing buildings in which to carry on these services on the other, so that we may have some idea of the financial aspects of these proposals.</P>

      <P>Might I take advantage of this section to ask the Minister if he intends, or to what extent he intends, to improve the conditions and the emoluments of midwives?  I think everyone will agree with me that the present position in this country is scandalous, that the most essential service that can be given to a mother by a midwife is carried out for a pittance, carried out usually under terrible conditions and even the provision of a motor-car has to be paid for out of the very small allowance that is given at present.  The Minister has made promises to a number of local authorities who view this matter with alarm and who also view with alarm the fact that there are hardly any applicants for vacancies for midwives at present due to the small salary.  A number of local authorities, including County Waterford, have already sought sanction to increase the allowances but the Minister has put them off on the plea that this Bill was coming out.  I would like the Minister to indicate to what extent he proposes to improve the conditions or, if he foresees a delay in this measure coming into force, would he indicate now if he would give an interim measure of justice to these people?</P>

      <P>This section, 15, is one of the pivotal sections of the proposed legislation and, of course, it is to be welcomed in so far as it gets rid for ever of the harmful Part III of the 1947 legislation which, I take it, this is to be regarded as substituting. However, properly to get the background of this clear again, we have it now determined that this section operates in respect of all three groups. We have it determined that the population of this country may, roughly, be divided into three groups, more or less, of 1,000,000 each.  The first is a group of 1,000,000 who are destitute, who are unable by their industry or other lawful means to provide their own essential medical requirements.  Now we are told that, under the blessing of a free Government in this country, they amount to one-third of the entire population. The second are the people in the middle-income group.  I take the high level of that to be people who are described as having a family income of not more than £600 per year, that is, where you have a man working and, say, a couple of children working, where the entire income coming into the house exceeds £600 a year, then that family is classified as being in that high income group, the highest level that the legislation discussed.  The people who are under the £600 or, at least, not above it, are in the middle-income group.  The test we take here is the £600, the equivalent of the old £240 in 1939, say, less than £5 per week.  These, roughly, are the three groups.</P>

      <P>Speeches that were made in connection with health legislation before drew very vehement statements.  One was by a Deputy in this House who said that he would not vote under any circumstances for any amendment to a Health Act which would authorise any Minister to bring into life that which should be dead 50 or 100 years ago, namely, this means test, the pauper law of the red ticket, and all the rest of it.  We have got all these things.  We have got means tests all over this legislation, and properly so, but we have got, certainly, the pauper law, although we do not call it that any longer; we speak of something about the test under the Public Assistance Act or we speak of destitution, and the red ticket is no longer to be a red ticket; it is to be a white ticket.</P>

      <P>Section 15 gives what are regarded as the most up-to-date proposals in respect of medical care for mothers. We know that an amendment was proposed and discussed here or, at least, a suggestion, or amendment, was proposed and discussed here for a long time.  Apparently, there was some more patchwork done upon it but the amendment is to the effect that, instead of this £1, this subterfuge £1, there is to be charged an &ldquo;appropriate sum&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>It has been withdrawn, I understand, to be reinstated, but with a ceiling to it that there may be a £2, charge made instead of a £1. The £1, we are told, being the equivalent of half the cost of the service being provided, on that calculation, £2 would pay the full cost.  However, we will see that when it comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, the mood has changed <Col N="1544" /> and the mood is now that maternity services are to be, for a certain group of the community, based on an insurance scheme.  Of course, there again, there is no reason why it should not be completely and entirely an insurance scheme for people who are in the upper-income bracket.  I think it should most decidedly be completely and entirely an insurance scheme and, I believe, when the cost of the insurance under a proper scheme would be related to the benefit to be derived under a proper insurance scheme, it would be better than what the Minister is here proposing, which destroys the sort of old free-for-all idea, so far as that is accepted by anybody nowadays, by putting in something that will not be effective and will not be desired by many people, and I do not think will be availed of by many people.</P>
    <P>It is to be said with regard to what this substitutes, that that was, of course, defined as being entirely unacceptable to the Hierarchy.  On 7th October, 1947, the Hierarchy mentioned their grave disapproval of certain parts of the then recently enacted Health Act of 1947, but particularly Part III, dealing with mother and child services.  The point was made that to claim such powers for the public authority, without qualifications, is entirely and directly contrary to Catholic teaching on the rights of the family, the rights of the Church in education, the rights of the medical profession and of voluntary institutions. That was the section&mdash;Section 21&mdash;under which the health authority was given power, in accordance with regulations made under Section 28, to make arrangements for safeguarding the health of women in expectant motherhood and their education in that respect.  That, of course, it was pointed out, could cover such things as whether a woman was to have a baby at all, what treatment she might take either for the event of childbirth or to prevent it, and the question of operations and certain types of operations clearly arose under that and if certain types of operations were to be permitted to be under the control of a health authority.</P>
    <P>However, that has gone and instead <Col N="1545" /> of it we get this, Section 15.  I am taking Section 15, not as it now stands but with the background, the essential idea which is now being worked in under it, that is, something in the nature of a contributory scheme, an insurance type of scheme.  We have it from the Minister as being in touch with Church authorities in the matter that, apparently, the stand they take in this matter is that a contributory scheme is in accordance with principle, a non-contributory scheme for the entire population is not.  On that, the Minister says that what the amount of the contribution might have to be in any case was not a matter, of course, for the Church to interfere in, that it was a matter on which they might have views, but that it was a matter for the civil authority to determine, and the determination was the £1 which was derided as a subterfuge, although the Minister may still argue against the application of that term that we will get a more realistic standard from experience over a number of years and that it will be 50 per cent. of the cost of the treatment. That is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before that as far as I understand Church principles on this matter of a graded subvention according to the means of people what seemed to be desirable was that if that graded subvention is given, then citizens should be allowed to obtain treatment in the hospital of their choice and from a doctor of their choice. Again, we have got a limited advance to that in amendment No. 22, which I think has been passed.  Still I think there are certain restrictions in it which are not necessary and that only just a certain amount of vanity prevents the Minister from giving what would be complete freedom to the patient to choose a doctor.</P>
    <P>The question of the hospital is a different matter.  I do not understand that the choice of hospital has yet been granted.  There is still in this legislation authority bestowed on the health authority, which is a lay body, to determine the institutions in which certain treatment is to be given.  I do <Col N="1546" /> not know whether Section 15 is excepted from that general power of the health authority to regulate the particular institutions in which maternity services are to be provided.  So that, far from having a free choice by the patient both of the doctor and the hospital, the contrasting service, which was the one to which the Hierarchy objected, was where citizens were to be compelled, if they took treatment at all, to undergo that treatment in the institutions that a public authority or a public official might decide.  Again, I understand the Hierachy's objection was that the public official was a person who was entirely subordinate to the Minister and, therefore, the general objection was that in this part there was at least a section of the general bureaucratised system of the State type.  That was definitely objected to.</P>
    <P>To clear away these objections one would require: (1) that there would be an insurance scheme, which has been partly accepted; (2) that there would be freedom on the patient's part to choose the doctor, which has been, with some limitation, accepted; (3) that there would be freedom on the part of the patient to choose the institution if it were an institution in which services were given that the patient required.  I do not think that these have been granted.  The point has been raised that the patient may desire to be treated at home and that the doctor might approve of the treatment being given at home.  There is no specific statement that the patient may avail of this treatment at home.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there is the background of the public official being a person entirely subordinate to the Minister and the Government.  I know that that is in accord with a view held by a member of the Government, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who boldly came out in favour of paternalistic Government when he said that &ldquo;paternalistic care of a community by a Civil Service acting on instructions from a Government elected by the people could alone preserve the fundamental freedoms and sanctity of human existence&rdquo;.  That is an utterly wrong point of view.  It could be, I think, expressed to be a <Col N="1547" /> paganised point of view and in accord with the statement already made by people who support such legislation, those who are in charge of the <i>Irish Times.</i>  Of course, they told us that in legislation of a health type such as this is, certain Christian principles must inevitably be defeated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of what has been said outside by people who approve of this type of legislation. I do not think anybody in this House should accept that it is necessary to break Christian principles in order to get what is called progress in health legislation.  It is completely unnecessary and it is, of course, fundamentally wrong to have any such standard accepted.  But the blessing of the people who speak that way has been given to this legislation and, more particularly, to the wilder scheme of a &ldquo;free-for-all&rdquo; and the nonsense of &ldquo;no payment for anybody&rdquo;.  That point of view would be put forward by people who have that concept.</P>
      <P>Finally, in this particular section, there comes the question of the type of services to be given, more particularly when one considers that part of Section 15 is particularly reserved or supposed to be appropriated to the higher income group.  The writer of an article in <i>Studies</i> of March, 1953, drew attention to that.  He asks the question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Will the type of hospital or nursing-home service for mothers be uniform all through where the service is free?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I ask whether the service is to be paid for at the 6/- a day rate or to be under this type of insurance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Is a woman to pay a £1 contribution per year to enjoy the same services as she has already paid for in taxes for less-well-off women to enjoy free?  Private rooms, a special nurse, a different type of cooking, <Col N="1548" /> general amenities&mdash;presumably these will not be supplied free to mothers in the middle income group and to those paying the £1.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This was written when the subterfuge of the £1 had been put into the proposal.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When our legislators discuss this Bill, will they know in their hearts that they are merely putting up a pretence and a facade of giving all mothers free maternity service?  In order to avoid a means test and in order to be able to boast of at least a juridical and formal equality of service, are we going to provide a service of a type which we know many women will be deterred from using for various good reasons?&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already stated that.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And do we know therefore, that we are compelling these people&mdash;and they will be many&mdash;to pay twice or possibly three times: once for a service for their poorer fellow citizens; once for the availability of the same service for themselves, which in practice they cannot use; and once for the service they will use.  On such doubtful paths of conduct must honourable men walk when they seek the Welfare State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has not yet spoken on that point.  As I was absent on Thursday, I cannot say whether any change took place.  I have not discovered any in the time I have had to investigate the report of that day's proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly the Minister did boast first of all that he was travelling all the time towards institutional services.  He wanted these services provided.  There was no talk when he was speaking about care at the home.  It was institutional care and all the time he said that the institutions into which people would have to go under this health legislation would be public institutions and the services they would get would be services of a public ward type.  If that is still the situation we should be told of it.  It is clearly possible <Col N="1549" /> that the Minister's views may have changed, and are going to be changed by other amendments, but he must have some fairly good idea of where he is going, or is being purshed.  Are we to have services, in so far as they are institutional, confined to the public health institutions and is the service to be only one of public ward type?</P>
    <P>In England&mdash;we refer again to their legislation&mdash;they have written into the legislation from the start a type of thing which there is a late effort being made to put forward in amendment No. 45 here.  Under it the people were entitled to get on contributions and charges put upon them services of any type they liked to choose, but only certain of them were provided more or less free in return for contributions which they made.  But they could go anywhere for those services&mdash;to a private home, public hospital or semiprivate hospital&mdash;and give a contribution to get that treatment that the person desired.  The service would not be entirely paid for but only some appropriate part which would be measured by the charge imposed on the person. If these improvements could be made, then, of course, we have a piece of health legislation which goes away from the so-called welfare State business and gets more nearly to the proper ideal.</P>
    <P>I do suggest that the proper ideal would be if we could reconstruct society so as to have people obtaining so much for the services they render to the public in the different walks of life that they would be able to provide for the services they need out of their emoluments.  That I think is the proper idea, especially for a small community like ours&mdash;that people be better paid and allowed to spend their own money as they like.  It is not possible to reconstruct society all at once and therefore, some type of service has to be made as an emergency one.  That could be met in a sort of scheme of sliding arrangements for people as they grow better off, or are helped to be better off, until they can maintain those services themselves.</P>
    <P>Again there are certain people who &mdash;by being handicapped in certain ways &mdash;will not be able, through the services <Col N="1550" /> they render to the community, to earn enough to provide what is considered necessary for them in the way of education, sometimes of food, and lastly, in the way of health.  It is even suggested that people who might have enough money are not always provident people and cannot be relied upon to make the provision which their means allows them to make and you must have regard to those.  Those are people who can be met, not by this over-all business of levelling down to get a kind of egalitarian scheme, but on the lowest possible level.  That, I suggest is not the proper approach.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to the cost, we now have a system of charges, and certain people will have what is called free services.  They will pay for them in the end of course.  They are already paying for them.  Deputies voted to give them dearer food so that moneys could be put in cold-storage to give services of this type.  Certain other people are being asked to pay certain sums of money with a ceiling of 6/- a day, and whether they will get some treatment for lesser rates will depend on local authorities.  In one county a person may be charged 6/- a day and another person may get off in another county for 2/6.</P>
    <P>I suppose it will mean that in poorer counties it will be 6/- a day, because such counties will not be able to afford it at a lesser rate, but in good counties where the land is good and where people's properties are valued better and more money comes in from the rates, then the rates will be able to afford better services at a lesser charge.  You will have the reverse happening to what would be the ideal.  The people who are living in the more impoverished counties will pay the full rate and people living in good surroundings will pay less, and that will be at the disposal&mdash;not of the Government, nor the Minister&mdash;but of the local authority, the county manager, who in these counties is a layman, and will not have any real outlook in medical matters.  He may take advice about treatment to be given from the medical officer, but the decision in the end is with the county manager.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there is to be a charge by way of the appropriate <Col N="1551" /> sum for taking out an insurance policy for people in certain groups, and we have been promised that this is going to cost an average 2/- extra on rates. So you have cut subsidies on food; you have 2/- on rates, 6/- a day charged for certain people, and that is all to get treatment in the public wards.</P>

      <P>My feeling listening to Deputy McGilligan was that it was a perfect example of my description of our progress of dragging these people &mdash;the McGilligans&mdash;kicking and squealing into the 20th century.  We heard the squealing to-night, but fortunately it is not going materially to affect the passage of the Bill.  I was only interested in one aspect&mdash;a poisonous reference made by Deputy McGilligan in relation to the inter-Party scheme considered and accepted by him as proved by the Minister here recently, in which he left the impression&mdash;on my mind at any rate&mdash;that under that scheme it was intended that legal abortion operations, contraception and other objectionable practices were intended to be introduced and carried out.  The Deputy knows them to be untrue.  Every hint or suggestion of that kind is completely untrue.  He is being, in his suggestion or in leaving that impression on anybody's mind&mdash; he certainly left it on my mind&mdash;unfair to his colleagues who, I think, to a man, would repudiate the suggestion <Col N="1552" /> that they would be prepared to stand over any such thing.  From Deputy Costello, the former Taoiseach, down to Deputy MacBride, I think they would all have repudiated it.  Certainly any such suggestion would be, and still is, completely contrary to any of the moral teachings which I, myself, accepted in regard to these matters. Again he is being unfair to the vast majority of members of the Irish medical profession who operate our health services in suggesting that a mother and child scheme would have compelled them to carry out any such objectionable practices, practices which must be objectionable to their religious principles.</P>
      <P>Finally, Deputy McGilligan impugns the integrity, the honesty and the high moral standing and beliefs of the vast majority of the mothers of Ireland in suggesting that under any Government scheme, or under any conditions, they would acquiesce in the introduction or carrying on of such practices.</P>
      <P>I am not going again to enter into the details of Deputy McGilligan's part in considering, accepting and providing money for that scheme, for all its implications and all the different points it contained.  I merely want again to reiterate clearly and unequivocally that there was no such suggestion.  The purpose which I had in mind, which the Department of Health and all the officials concerned had in mind, was that we might help to educate mothers at the time of motherhood in relation to such simple matters of hygiene as were recommended by the commission of which Dr. McQuaid, the Archbishop of Dublin, was a member&mdash;to educate young mothers before and during maternity in relation to exercises which they should take and other purely medical matters that arise at that time.  I want to conclude on that point and to make it quite clear because this suggestion was part of the whispering campaign carried on mainly by my opponents over the years.  That suggestion is a foul suggestion, a malicious suggestion and a thoroughly dishonest suggestion, completely worthy of Deputy McGilligan's record during the major part of his political life as I have either known of it or read it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne has put up a skittle for the purpose of knocking it down.  I understood Deputy McGilligan to quote from a letter of the Hierarchy of October, 1947, referring to the 1947 Health Act.  Deputy McGilligan did not say anything in that connection with regard to any proposals, or what Deputy Dr. Browne calls a scheme, of the inter-Party Government.  His reference was entirely to the observations made by the Hierarchy in respect to the sections of the 1947 Act that are now by this Bill being deleted and repealed. Deputy Dr. Browne with all respect to him, completely misunderstood Deputy McGilligan.  There was no necessity whatever for him to get up so completely filled up by what was stated and, in my opinion, stated correctly.  Deputy McGilligan referred entirely to the objectionable sections of the 1947 Act, those very objectionable sections, now at long last&mdash;and it is not a day too soon&mdash;being repealed by the measure which we are now discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have expected that Deputy Dr. Browne and some of his colleagues would have addressed themselves to this section which is, I think, the fundamental section of this piece of legislation, particularly so far as they are concerned because it was on the issue enshrined in the section that Deputy Dr. Browne and his colleagues completely burst a better piece of health legislation, or what promised to be a better piece of health legislation, than what we have now before us.  The whole issue, not merely <i>vis-á-vis</i> his colleagues in the then Government, not merely so far as those who are competent to give direction or instruction on morals were concerned, but so far as the general public were concerned, the whole issue was on the means test. That was the cardinal issue and it was on that issue that Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Cowan and others gloried in the fact that they were going to bring down the then Government and put the present Government in its place. Now they are sitting down on this fundamental section quite prepared to swallow it without even a protest or a reference to it.  That is the acid test for these Deputies.  How can what <Col N="1554" /> was according to them, fundamentally wrong and entirely unacceptable to them in 1951 be acceptable to them to-day?  The principle, if principle there was, must be the same to-day as it was then.  The Deputies are in as powerful a position or even in a more powerful position to insist on their point of view to-day than they were in 1951.</P>
