      <P>It is not possible to estimate the number of emigrants (i.e. the gross emigration) from this country, either in individual years or for a number of years, for reasons which I explained fully in my reply to a question by Deputy Hession on May 1, 1952.  Furthermore, net emigration (i.e. gross emigration less gross immigration) can be stated accurately only for intercensal periods, the allocation to individual years being subject to wide margins of error.  It has, however, been <Col N="1164" /> roughly estimated that the net emigration amounted to 3,000 in 1946, to 10,000 in 1947, to 28,000 in 1948, to 34,000 in 1949, and to 41,000 in 1950. It is not possible to give a corresponding estimate for 1951 for the reasons given in my reply to Deputy Declan Costello on 22 October, 1952.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) the amount of asbestos slates and roofing tiles imported during each of the years 1951 and 1952 and to the latest date in 1953; (b) the amount of Dutch land drainage pipes imported during these years, and (c) the amount of duty, if any, paid on these imported articles.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the required information for the imports of (a) asbestos slates from all countries and (b) land drainage pipes of Netherland origin.  The figures for asbestos roofing tiles are not available as the Official Import List does not distinguish this item separately and an investigation has shown that sufficient information is not available on the basic import documents to enable a separate figure to be extracted.  No duty was paid on these articles during the period in question.</P>

      <P>Certainly not but, in the public interest, I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture, having regard to the important function fulfilled by the Royal Dublin Society in the life of this country, particularly agricultural, live-stock and general industrial development, that he ought to endeavour in the public interest to persuade this company that bought the property by public auction to give the benefit of that contract to the Royal Dublin Society.  There is no question of compulsion.  It is a question of putting it up to them that, in the public interest and having regard to the fact that there is very great public disturbance by reason of the fact that the Royal Dublin Society were not able to get this property, they ought to give the benefit of that contract to the society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the price paid by creameries, the property of the Dairy Disposals Board, for milk delivered by the producer was less than one penny per gallon for the month of March over that for the previous month of February, while at the same time, the supplier was charged 4d. extra on each lb. of butter purchased on and after the 1st March, 1953; and, if so, whether he will state where such profits go when not handed back to the producer by way of an increase in the price of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be invidious to compare the price paid for milk by any creamery in any two individual months and particularly so in the case of February, 1953, where for approximately half of the month little if any milk was supplied by producers to creameries.  Milk prices at any creamery may vary from month to month depending on a variety of factors including the average fat content of the milk supply generally, overhead and other expenses for the month, adjustment for either profits or losses incurred in previous months, etc.  If, therefore, the Deputy wishes to examine critically the milk prices paid by any particular creamery, it would be unfair to that creamery to apply the examination to a period of less than a complete season.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence that the Dairy Disposals Board creameries paid a lesser price than other <Col N="1174" /> creameries.  The price paid in the month of March for milk supplied in February is dependent on many factors&mdash;overhead expenses and the quantity of milk supplied to the creamery.  All these factors must be taken into consideration before the price is fixed for the milk delivered in the creameries in the month of February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it then that the operation of the Dairy Disposals Board creameries during the month of February was much heavier than in other creameries, resulting in the fact that they had to lower the price in order to meet the overheads the Minister referred to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The evidence is that many creameries in the country paid a lesser price for March milk than for February milk, due to the fact that their overhead expenses were higher proportionately than they were in February.  It is because of the higher costs for the manufacture of butter, for instance, that the lower price is paid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards (b) the answer is &ldquo;nil&rdquo; because under the provisions of the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Acts, 1935 to 1941, creameries must <Col N="1175" /> surrender into the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund the increased value of butter stocks held on the occasion of any increase in the price of butter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the Budget for last year I emphasised the urgent need to <Col N="1177" /> restore order in the public finances and in our general economy.  I explained that, while these objectives would take longer than one year to attain, the Budget would facilitate their achievement. Looking back on the year which has passed, it is plain that we have progressed a long way towards the attainment of our objectives.  We have succeeded in bringing the current revenue and expenditure of the State closer to equilibrium, while at the same time we have reduced the balance of payments problem to manageable dimensions.</P>
      <P Just="Center">VIEWS ON BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.</P>
      <P>When, last year, I stated that the deficit in our balance of payments, which began to grow ominous during the latter part of 1950 and the earlier half of 1951, was our greatest anxiety, I said nothing that the Dáil and the country had not already heard many times over from both sides of the House.  For instance, even as far back as July, 1939, according to column 1817, Volume 76 of the Official Report, Deputy Dillon declared</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is plain to the observant that, unless we correct the adverse trade balance, and correct it soon, we are going to have a crash.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In May, 1948, the Coalition Minister for Finance said that it was</P>
      <P>&ldquo;impossible to view with equanimity a continued reduction in external assets on last year's scale.  These assets can be consumed now only at the expense of a reduced standard of living for the future ...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(Volume 110, column 1053.)</P>
      <P>Three months later, in August, 1948, Deputy J.A. Costello, who was then Taoiseach, told us that the adverse trade balance had grown</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to an extent which must cause anybody who thinks about it for one moment or who looks at the figures the utmost alarm for our economic and financial stability.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(Volume 112, column 2146.)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his Budget speech of 1951, my <Col N="1178" /> predecessor, Deputy McGilligan, reminded the country that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;deficits in the balance of payments cannot be sustained for more than a short period&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(Volume 125, column 1880), and then sounded the warning that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the present position&rdquo;&mdash;that is at 2nd May, 1951&mdash;&ldquo;on external account is by no means satisfactory and if it continues to develop unfavourably the application of corrective measures will be called for.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>(Volume 125, column 1883.)</P>
    <P Just="Center">BALANCE OF PAYMENTS, 1951.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments position unfortunately did continue to develop unfavourably. The deficit of £30,000,000 which had emerged on external account for 1950 continued to mount and the year 1951 eventually closed with a balance of payments deficit of £61.6 million.  If our predecessors regarded a deficit of £30,000,000 as &ldquo;disquieting&rdquo; or as a cause for &ldquo;the utmost alarm&rdquo;, if they had warned the country that &ldquo;deficits in the balance of payments cannot be sustained for more than a short period&rdquo; and that, unless we could &ldquo;within a few years equalise our external receipts and payments, we must inevitably suffer a decline in our living standards&rdquo;, were we to ignore the alarming significance of this adverse figure of £61.6 million?  From statements which have been made from time to time, it would appear that we were.  The Government were admonished, in fact, to watch and wait for some spontaneous and mysterious process to put matters right.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EFFECT OF GOVERNMENT ACTION, 1952.</P>
    <P>Fortunately the Government did not adopt this attitude of helpless fatalism. On the contrary, they did what my predecessor in his Budget speech of 1951 had foreshadowed would be inevitable, they applied the requisite &ldquo;corrective measures&rdquo;.  Recognising that the immediate necessity was for budgetary equilibrium, they took steps to balance the current Budget.  At the same time, efforts were made to encourage home <Col N="1179" /> production and saving, and imports were reduced.  In consequence, we emerged from last year with a deficit in the balance of payments which the Central Statistics Office inform me was £9,000,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">FINANCING OF 1952 BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEFICIT.</P>
    <P>This deficit of £9,000,000 was financed mainly by the sale of sterling assets by the Government and by private owners and by external subscriptions to the 5 per cent.  National Loan.  The sale of assets and the incurring of debt to foreigners outweighed the increase shown in the external assets of the Irish banking system.</P>
    <P>The figure for the balance of payments deficit is the lowest in the postwar period.  Yet it would be wrong to conclude from this fact that the position no longer requires close attention. During 1952 certain factors of an unusual character contributed to narrow the gap between our external expenditure and our externally derived income, and these are not likely to recur this year in the same degree. Nevertheless, making all due allowance for these special factors, when we contrast the out-turn of 1952 with that of 1950 and of 1951, I think we have reason to congratulate ourselves.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DEFICITS WITH CURRENCY AREAS, 1952.</P>
    <P>The balance of payments problem exists, of course, independently of any question of foreign exchange difficulties, but in existing circumstances it is important for us to keep under review not only our general external balance but also in a special way the position in relation to non-sterling countries. The fact that, in association with the great improvement in the over-all balance of payments last year, there was a substantial decline in our deficits with the dollar area and with the rest of the non-sterling world is, therefore, very satisfactory also.  The figures which I now propose to give in that connection are those of actual payments and receipts as recorded by the Exchange Control.  They are not <Col N="1180" /> identical with those which appear in our published balance of payments statistics because the latter record trade transactions at the time of physical import and export of the goods, whereas the time of payment may be either earlier or later.</P>
    <P>Because international payments problems are centred on the dollar, the balance with the dollar area, from which we have to buy so many commodities vital to our economy, may be referred to first.  To get a true comparison we must exclude Marshall Aid receipts, for if these are included, comparative statements as to our real deficit with the dollar area could not be clearly presented.  In 1951 our payments for imports and for all other purposes to the dollar area were $117.9 million while our receipts, including exports at $10.4 million, totalled $48.3 million; the deficit was, accordingly, $69.6 million.  In 1952, the corresponding figures were payments $80.5 million, receipts $52.1 million (including exports $11.1 million) and the deficit $28.4 million.</P>
    <P>In 1951 we had a deficit of £27.4 million with the non-sterling members of the European Payments Union on trade and other items.  Last year we succeeded in reducing it to £20.5 million. In the final summation, our global deficits, expressed in pounds, with all countries outside the sterling area in respect of 1951 and 1952 were, respectively, £58.7 million and £34.1 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">1952 BUDGET.</P>
    <P>It would be idle to claim that equally gratifying results were secured in relation to the problem of the Budget; but even here substantial progress was made.  As the Dáil will recall, when the Budget for 1952-53 was framed, the problem which the Government had to solve was three-fold.  We had, first of all, to try to ensure that the deficit thrown up on the Budget of the preceding year would not recur.  Then we had to meet the inevitable increase in the current cost of the public services, and, finally, we had to procure funds to finance the social welfare legislation of 1952.  All told, there had to be found, either by reductions in State <Col N="1181" /> expenditure or from fresh taxation, a sum of over £15,000,000.  We struck the balance as narrowly as we possibly could, seeking no surplus, making no unnecessary economies and imposing no avoidable taxation.  In the event, as I shall detail later, we fell somewhat short of our goal of a balanced Budget.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PUBLIC CO-OPERATION.</P>
    <P>As well as the significant changes in the budgetary position and in the balance of payments which I have outlined, another matter merits special mention, namely, the diminution in the inflationary effect of State capital outlay. A closer approach to monetary stability has been secured.  This has been due in large measure to the greater tendency of the community to save and to the increased readiness of its thrifty and industrious members to entrust their savings to the Government for investment in works of national importance.  The record response which the saving and investing public gave to the National Loan in September last was a striking manifestation of confidence and the Government are particularly appreciative of it.</P>
    <P>The nation, indeed, has much for which to thank its provident and responsible citizens.  Without their practical support the country would not have made such substantial progress towards economic recovery.  If the public had not responded to the needs of the situation by saving more and spending less on imports of consumer goods, last year's Budget of itself could not have been so successful in checking and redressing the unhealthy development of recent years.  In this connection it is salutary to remind ourselves that, while the activities of the State have a considerable influence, they are not of predominant importance in our economy.  Private decisions as to work, investment, consumption and saving play a major part in shaping the course of our economic and financial affairs.  If the public continue to cooperate, especially by producing more it will be all the easier to overcome our economic and financial difficulties. Recovery in production and trade is <Col N="1182" /> already under way and this Budget will stimulate it.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REDUCTIONS IN IMPORTS, 1952.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory that the improvement in the balance of payments to which I have referred was achieved so quickly and without any marked or general disturbance of the country's economy.  As was to be expected, dispensable imports of consumer goods accounted for much of it.  For example, of the drop of £32.4 million in total imports, one category alone, namely, textiles and clothing, accounted for £15,000,000.  It can be fairly said that, in general, the import reductions were such as to cause the minimum of embarrassment to domestic interests. Indeed, the speedy action which the Government took to control imports of textiles and clothing helped considerably, not only to redress the adverse balance, but to restore and sustain employment in this important industrial sector.  Apart from textiles, imports of materials for industry and agriculture were well maintained.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONDITIONS OF 1953.</P>
    <P>It is difficult at any time to assess future economic prospects but particularly difficult at present when world trends are so much in doubt.  The proper course is to avoid predictions and to confine ourselves to a brief review of recent and current trends.</P>
    <P>World prices of many basic materials have fallen in recent months.  Our internal prices have by now borne most of the effect of the recent round of wage and salary increases.  Stability seems at last within reach provided we avoid a further inflation of internal costs.  The dangers of such an inflation at a time when costs are falling elsewhere and competition is becoming keener should never be absent from our minds.  As it is, the prospective stability in prices is encouraging new purchases and there are already signs of increased activity in many industries.</P>
    <P Just="Center">IMPORTS.</P>
    <P>A rise in such imports as are essential to support increased home production and enable exports to be <Col N="1183" /> expanded is, of course, not to be deprecated.  Other factors, however, may operate to enlarge our import total without necessarily increasing our export capacity or earnings.  Purchases, for instance, to replenish stocks used up in 1952 may tend to raise the 1953 import figures.  If, in addition, the recent increases in wages and salaries should fail to be accompanied by an adequate expansion of output, the balance of payments situation might again deteriorate.  Accordingly, although there are certainly good grounds for confidence, we cannot afford to be complacent about the future.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EXPORTS.</P>
    <P>Last year, for the first time, exports exceeded £100,000,000.  The actual total was £101.5 million or £20,000,000 more than in 1951.  Of the rise in value, only £2,500,000 can be attributed to higher prices; most of the increase was due to greater volume.  Cattle, dressed meat, tinned beef and the products of new industries, such as sweetened fat, showed the largest increases.  In the last quarter of 1952, however, the rate of expansion slackened.  Nevertheless, there has since been no falling back and, indeed, exports in March of this year were the highest ever recorded for a single month.  The future course of exports depends essentially on the volume of agricultural output and on competitive conditions in external markets, and it has to be said that in some respects the latter have recently become adverse as, for instance, in the case of the trade in frozen meat to the dollar area.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PRODUCTION.</P>
    <P>Estimates of national income, savings, etc., are not yet available but the provisional indices of the volume of production in industry and agriculture show the trend of national output. There was some improvement in agriculture in 1952.  Gross output rose by 1.7% as compared with 1951.  On the other hand, there was a slight decline in output in manufacturing industries. In general, the position was that national production was about the same in real terms as in 1951 and 1950.  In <Col N="1184" /> the final quarter of 1952, however, there was a pronounced upturn in industrial output which was greater than could be ascribed to merely seasonal causes.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REAL INCOMES.</P>
    <P>Although industrial production was lower, wage earners and other secured substantial increases in pay during the year, as a result of which the purchasing power of the earnings of the average worker in the transportable goods industries was by December, 1952, as high as in December, 1951.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EMPLOYMENT.</P>
    <P>As regards the employment situation, there have recently been welcome signs of increasing activity in consumer goods industries.  In the textile and clothing industries in particular, there has been a considerable increase in employment in recent months.  The number of houses completed in 1952, with State aid, was 13,018, as compared with 12,125 in 1951 and 11,879 in 1950. Recently, however, the number of houses in course of erection has declined.  It is too early to say whether the falling off in private building is likely to be permanent.  It is certainly due in large part to the satisfaction of arrears of demand which had accumulated during the war and the years immediately following, when building materials were scarcely procurable. To some extent, the effect on current demand of higher prices due to increased costs of materials, wage increases and higher interest rates, may be responsible.  In this industry, as in others, high costs have generated a consumer resistance which can only be overcome by a reduction in prices. Local authority building has also slackened somewhat; not, however, because of any shortage of capital, but because in some urban and rural areas much of the programme has been completed. In the particular case of Dublin, such delays as have occurred are occasioned by the need for development of sites before further housing schemes can be proceeded with.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EFFECTS OF EXTERNAL POLICIES</P>
    <P>To arrest the inflation in prices and <Col N="1185" /> wages and to secure some measure of stability in external payments, other countries, during the past year or so, have been forced to make internal adjustments of a drastic character designed to reduce domestic consumption and to increase the surplus available for export.  These measures have increased the intensity of the struggle for export markets, as the fall in import prices clearly indicates.  Their effect has been greatly accentuated by the re-emergence of Germany and Japan as highly competitive producers.  A slackening in rearmament demands and the movement towards greater freedom in international trade are other factors of significance.  We have already felt some of the consequences of these developments and we may expect that they will become more acute.  It is vital, therefore, that our domestic costs per unit of output be brought down; for, otherwise, we shall be priced out of our external markets.</P>
    <P Just="Center">POTENTIALITIES OF AGRICULTURE.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, there is no escape, so far as our export industries are concerned, from the effects of these world developments and we must adjust the circumstances of our production accordingly.  This applies particularly to agriculture which is the sphere in which we have at once our greatest production and our greatest export potential.  Unfortunately, that potential is still far from being fully realised. Taxation presses lightly on the land, so that there is little scope for any stimulus under that head.  The Government have provided incentives in a more direct and useful way&mdash;by guaranteeing high prices for agricultural produce, by arranging markets, by draining, reclaiming and fertilising the land, by making credit available for the purchase of stock and machinery and by providing educational and advisory services.  Accordingly, if the margin between the return to the producer and his costs should be reduced by the action of the forces to which I have referred, the only practicable remedy is to increase production and to spread farm costs over a larger volume of output.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1186" /> FINANCIAL POLICY, 1953.</P>
    <P>In the financial sphere, balancing the current Budget must remain our immediate objective and we must likewise strive to create conditions in which, so far as is practicable, capital expenditure will be financed from current savings.  As an adjunct to this, the Government will continue to stimulate saving by making it attractive and popular.</P>
    <P Just="Center">II. &mdash;CURRENT BUDGET, 1952-53.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CURRENT EXPENDITURE, 1952-53.</P>
    <P>The immediate aim of last year's Budget was the simple and modest one of restoring order to the public finances by bringing current expenditure and current revenue into line at £97,761,000. The figure was fixed for us by the commitments which we had inherited and by the obligation of fulfilling the pledges to expand and improve the social services which had been given by all Parties during the general election.  The accounts for the year show that current expenditure was £97,966,000 or a mere one-fifth of 1 per cent. beyond what was budgeted for. It is true that there were Supplementary Estimates for non-capital purposes of £8,890,000 but of these £5,750,000 was provided for in the Budget&mdash; £4,750,000 for additional social welfare services and £1,000,000 for unspecified contingencies.  In the controversy which developed over the Budget, it was suggested that credit should have been taken for over-estimation, in other words, for the probability that actual expenditure would in the end fall short of expectations.  The answer which was given at the time was that experience of recent Budgets had shown that any such casual saving was eaten up by unforeseen supplementaries. And so it turned out in regard to the Budget of last year.  There was almost an exact balance between the unprovided-for supplementaries and the savings realised in other directions.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CRITICISMS OF 1952 BUDGET.</P>
    <P>So many criticisms were directed against the 1952 Budget that I may be <Col N="1187" /> allowed a minute or two to emphasise the absurdities and inconsistencies inherent in them.  Take, for instance, the allegation, repeated monotonously and bolstered up with tedious arithmetic, that £10,000,000 of unnecessary taxation was imposed so that we should be in a position to show a surplus on the 31st March last.  Incidentally, this phantom surplus occasioned much mental confusion among its inventors.  They were never clear in their own minds as to whether it was to be used to finance capital expenditure or was to be held for the distribution of tax reliefs in later years.  In any case, as the accounts have shown and as everyone knew from the start, their suppositious calculations had no basis of fact.  There was no surplus.  There was never intended to be a surplus.  Over and over again that was made clear by the Taoiseach, by myself and by other members of the Government.  Our aim was to secure a Budget which no more than balanced.  In the outcome, even that limited objective was not realised.</P>
    <P>Since no one is foolish enough to believe that democratic Governments impose unnecessary taxation, even to take it off again later, what did those who devised the fiction of a surplus hope to achieve?  I think the answer must be that their aim was to obscure the truth that the severity of the measures taken in the last Budget was due to the laxity of the previous Administration. Rather than permit this to be known, however, those accountable for the situation tried to browbeat the Government and compel them to adopt a passive attitude and allow things to drift.  That course would have been inconsistent with responsible administration of public affairs.</P>
    <P>The pity indeed is that this Government came too late on the scene to enable it to avoid drastic remedies. There is no doubt that if the situation which developed in 1950 and reached its culmination in 1951 had been dealt with sooner, the adjustments required to restore order would have been much less severe.  If the 1951 Budget, instead of being&mdash;as it quite obviously was&mdash;a Budget designed for a snap election, had been a sound Budget, had <Col N="1188" /> been balanced or nearly balanced, it would have been a relatively easy task to balance the current Budget for last year.  Again, the reduction of the deficit in the balance of payments in 1952 to tolerable size would have been achieved with much less strain if external receipts and payments in 1950 and 1951 had not been allowed to get so far out of balance.  These are the simple facts.  The corrective measures, to use my predecessor's phrase, which were forced on the Government last year, were necessitated by the failure of the previous Administration to act before the situation assumed serious dimensions.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES. 1952-53.</P>
    <P>I have already drawn attention to the fact that, in the actual working-out of the Budget of last year, total current expenditure, including that due to uncovered or unforeseen supplementaries, exceeded the original budgetary provision for the Supply Services by £205,000, that is, by about one-fifth of 1 per cent.  I should like, however, to go into this matter a little further. Last year's Budget included £5,750,000 for foreseen supplementary charges and for contingencies, so that the Supplementary Estimates which were subsequently introduced were covered to this amount.  Of the £5,750,000, as I have already said, it was estimated that £4,750,000 would be required to meet the additional costs arising under the social welfare legislation of 1952. The actual provision for additional social welfare charges exceeded the £4,750,000 mark by £4,810 or, approximately, one-tenth of 1 per cent. The £1,000,000 which had been allowed for current contingencies was a net rather than a gross provision since it took account of the possibility of general savings.  If it were gross, it would have been deficient to the extent of £3,135,000 because, for the reasons which I shall now detail, the gross provision which actually became necessary for unforeseen supplementaries was £4,135,000.</P>
    <P>First of all, in the course of the year it became possible to procure defensive equipment for the Army in greater <Col N="1189" /> measure than was foreseen but in much smaller measure than the Army's needs.  This alone involved an additional provision of £860,000.  We had then to provide agriculture with £555,000 as a further advance against the importation of superphosphate and an extra £150,000 for the ground limestone subsidy.  An additional £580,000 went in grants to health authorities; a further £200,000 was given in supplementary agricultural grants; and, as a new charge, £130,000 was provided as the first instalment of an <i>ex-gratia</i> payment to teachers who were retired before the 1st January, 1950, the day fixed by our predecessors for the coming into operation of new superannuation terms.  We had, furthermore, to find another £1.1 million to cover losses on C.I.E.  All told, the items I have mentioned came to £3,575,000, while the balance of £560,000 was spread over a large number of items of lesser magnitude.  I doubt if anyone will have the hardihood to question now that these additional provisions were properly made.  Certainly, when the relevant Estimates were before the Dáil there was no demand for curtailment of the expenditure.  On the contrary, as in the case of the additional subsidy for C.I.E., the urge was very much the other way.</P>
    <P>It has always been a <i>sine qua non</i> of sound budgeting that the estimate of expenditure on which the Budget is based should be comprehensive so as to minimise the contingency of supplementary demands.  This is a principle which, as I shall show later, has been little honoured in recent years.  This year the Budget will be based on that sound principle, however, and, accordingly, every care has been taken to ensure that uncovered demands will not arise during the current year on the scale which characterised all Budgets for some years past.  For example, the amount included in this year's Estimate for the subsidy on ground limestone is £600,000, as against an original provision of £300,000 last year and £200,000 in 1951-52.  Similarly, the <i>ex-gratia</i> payments to retired teachers are fully covered in the published Estimates, while the amount included in the Defence Estimate for <Col N="1190" /> defensive equipment is £1,800,000, as against an initial provision of £850,000 in 1952-53 and £370,000 on 1951-52.  For C.I.E. there is £1,500,000, as against £1.3 million, and for grants to health authorities £6,013,000, as against £5,180,000.  So far as the social insurance and social assistance services are concerned, the total amount which was included in the original Estimates for 1952-53 was £13.6 million. In this year's Estimate we are allowing £19.9 million&mdash;that is to say, £6.3 million more.</P>
    <P>It will be readily appreciated that the increased provision which has been made, not only for the services which I have mentioned but for others also, has significantly enlarged the scope of this year's Budget and will reduce correspondingly the risk of Supplementary Estimates being called for during the year.  To exemplify what I have in mind, I may recall that, while in 1949-50 the amount included in the Budget for Supplementary Estimates by my predecessor was £676,000, the total amount of the supplementaries actually introduced and voted was no less than £9,212,000, or almost 14 times the Budget provision.  In 1950-51 the Budget statement included £600,000 for supplementaries but the additional provision actually voted for current services was £3,412,000, which was almost six times what the then Minister for Finance had budgeted for.  The Government have taken decisions in relation to the Budget which I am now presenting which will ensure that nothing of that kind will occur this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVENUE, 1952-53.</P>
    <P>I have now some remarks to make concerning the revenue of 1952-53.  As I have stated, the forecast and the event were in close accord on the expenditure side of last year's Budget; a similar position did not obtain, however, on the revenue side.  As in other countries, the Budget Estimate was not realised and it was this shortfall which was mainly responsible for the deficit of £2,048,000 with which the year closed.</P>
    <P>Instead of the projected £97,761,000, the revenue actually received was <Col N="1191" /> £95,919,000, showing a deficiency on the Estimate of £1,842,000.  As non-tax revenue, at £11,799,000, was only £17,000 short of the Budget Estimate, the deficiency was virtually confined to the tax revenue.  Of the shortfall, customs accounted for £1,724,000, excise £1,295,000, estate duties £144,000 and stamp duties £157,000.  To offset these in part, motor vehicle duties yielded an extra £374,000 and income-tax, surtax and corporation profits tax between them exceeded the Estimate by £1,121,000.</P>
    <P>An examination of the main items of customs and excise shows that beer and petrol produced more than was expected, but that the revenue from spirits was deficient, the gap between expectations and receipts in this instance being as much as £1,500,000. Tobacco, too, was short of the target by £600,000.  After the first impact of be increase in duty, however, the consumption of tobacco recovered considerably and is now at a level which promises a higher revenue this year. It is believed that a declining trend in the consumption of spirits had set in before the last Budget and would have continued even if there had been no increase in duty.  Indeed, a tendency for the consumption of spirits to decline has been a marked phenomenon in several countries over the past two or three years.  Doubtless, the increase in duty accentuated the tendency in our own case; on the other hand, there is good reason to believe that consumption was not affected to the extent that the reduction in clearances from bond would suggest, so I am expecting that the revenue from this source will show an improvement in the present financial year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION.</P>
    <P>Although the outcome of the 1952-53 Budget was disappointing in that revenue failed by some £2,000,000 to cover current outgoings, it was nevertheless a marked improvement on the experience of the previous year when, because of the shortcomings of the 1951 Budget, the current deficit was £6.7 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1192" /> III. &mdash;CAPITAL BUDGET, 1952-53.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OUTCOME ON CAPITAL ACCOUNT, 1952-53.</P>
    <P>We may now turn to the capital account for 1952-53.  I am glad to be able to say, and I am sure the country will be no less glad to learn, that without curtailing capital investment in any form we managed to finance it in a much less inflationary way than in recent years.  For this we have in the main to thank once more the Irish public who, despite the higher cost of living, decided to spend less on consumer goods, so as to save more and have more to invest.  When introducing the Budget for last year, I ventured to forecast that there would be a &ldquo;return to more normal habits of spending and saving&rdquo; among the thrifty and industrious elements in the community. That prediction has been fulfilled and indeed the improvement has been even better than could have been foreseen. In consequence a National Loan for £20,000,000, the largest ever floated here, was not only fully subscribed without recourse to the banks, but attracted a record number of investors, including many people of small and modest means.  That the improvement has persisted, with the consequence that more money is available for investment, is evidenced by the unprecedented support which was given to the last public issue made by the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>As against a Budget Estimate of £35.92 million the actual expenditure during last year on State capital account came to £32.27 million.  The detailed figures are as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>So far, however, as the issues fell short of the Estimate, I wish to emphasise that the difference was entirely casual.  It was not due to any curtailment of capital investment.  The most important causes of the difference were, first, the fact that the £2,250,000 provided in the Budget Estimate for the acquisition of the G.N.R. did not mature for payment&mdash;the enabling legislation is at the moment before the Dáil; secondly, neither the E.S.B. nor Bord na Móna needed as much as had been expected; thirdly, the Estimates for certain voted items, such as arterial drainage machinery, proved to be on the high side; and, fourthly, the banks provided the capital resources needed by the Agricultural Credit Corporation. The absence of an issue of capital to Irish Steel Holdings, Ltd., will be dealt with later.</P>

    <P>Allowing for the deficit on the current Budget, as well as for capital outlay of £32.27 million, the sum which had to be raised last year in addition to current revenue was £34.32 million. Towards this requirement, loan repayments by the E.S.B., local authorities and other debtors contributed £2.35 million, leaving £31.97 million to be raised independently.  How that sum was raised, or rather, the ultimate sources of the borrowings, may be set out as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> I shall refer later to a special circumstance which may affect this figure of £36.3 million.</P>
    <P>The increase in prospective State capital requirements as compared with the actual needs of 1952-53 is due mainly to the assumption by the Exchequer of the burden of financing the hospitals' building programme consequent on the exhaustion of the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  Other operative factors are additional expenditure on agricultural development, particularly on land reclamation, and the carrying forward to this year of the liability to pay half of the cost of acquiring the G.N.R. Company.  Deputies are familiar with the objects of capital expenditure and I do not feel that any of the items, apart from housing and the provisions for university buildings and for Irish Steel Holdings, calls for special explanatory comment at this stage.  The voted &ldquo;capital services&rdquo; figure will be explained later.</P>
    <P Just="Center">HOUSING.</P>
    <P>The Dáil will note that housing occupies top place in the capital programme and is still by far the largest item in it.  In fact the figure of £10,500,000 by no means expresses fully the extent of public outlay on housing. So far as local authorities are concerned, it covers only housing financed by advances from the Local Loans Fund and from voted grants.  It is out of this fund that, with the important exceptions of the cities of Dublin and Cork, the loan requirements of housing authorities in general are met.  Therefore, as deficiencies in housing accommodation in the smaller urban and rural areas are overtaken, the demand for advances from the Local Loans Fund must tend to taper off. This explains why the estimate of the demand on the fund for housing purposes in the current financial year is £1,000,000 less than the actual figure for last year.  So far as Dublin and Cork are concerned they will continue as heretofore to finance their housing activities by public borrowings.  In the past both cities have been able, with the assistance of the Irish banks and the State, to meet their capital needs <Col N="1196" /> by the issue of stock and I am sure that they will not experience any insuperable difficulty in this connection in future.</P>
    <P>There is a fact which I ought to mention before I pass on.  It is that in recent years new dwellings in this country have accounted for a much higher proportion of domestic capital outlay than in most European countries, even those which have suffered the devastation of war.</P>
    <P Just="Center">UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS.</P>
    <P>The £200,000 for university buildings has been included in anticipation of the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate to provide a grant to University College, Dublin, towards the cost of certain properties at Stillorgan which are the nucleus of new university buildings.</P>
    <P Just="Center">IRISH STEEL HOLDINGS.</P>
    <P>The £250,000 for Irish Steel Holdings is a repetition of a provision made in 1952-53 towards putting the company's capital structure on a more appropriate basis.  We had hoped that this would have been done last year but the matter has been delayed, mainly because the question of the future capital needs of the undertaking has not yet been resolved.  In the meantime the company's bankers have continued the temporary overdraft facilities afforded under State guarantee.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SOURCES OF FINANCE.</P>
    <P>So far as the State capital programme for this year is concerned, we are faced, as I have indicated, with a net borrowing programme of the order of £36,000,000.  The problems involved in raising from this small country such a huge capital sum will be formidable indeed, perhaps even more so than last year.  It is never possible to make any firm prediction as to private savings and in view of the erratic experience of some previous years the prospects must not be overrated.  But in the year just ended the greater part of the State capital programme was financed from the current savings of the community; production is on the upturn, import prices are tending to fall, <Col N="1197" /> money incomes all round are higher and there has been a reversion to former habits of thrift and providence. In short, people now feel that if they have more money it is money which it is worthwhile to save.  In these circumstances, while our task will remain difficult, we may face it with some optimism.</P>
    <P>Last year the figure for net principal receipts by way of small savings finally emerged at £4.3 million.  In the early part of the year it was tending towards my original estimate of £6,000,000.  But when the 5 per cent.  National Loan was offered there were substantial withdrawals from the Post Office Savings Bank for investment in the Loan, which left the ultimate net receipt at the figure I have mentioned. On the other hand, the total receipt from the Irish public in the form of subscriptions to the 5 per cent. National Loan and &ldquo;small savings&rdquo; amounted to £21.3 million, which was 80 per cent. more than the corresponding total for 1950-51.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to float another public issue during the present financial year; and, as in other years, this will react to reduce the savings garnered through the Savings Banks and the sale of Savings Certificates. Nevertheless, in view of the measures which have been taken to stimulate and promote saving by making it more attractive, it is not too rash in the improved financial circumstances to expect an increase in small savings.</P>
    <P>We have indeed good reason for this expectation, since the new issue of Savings Certificates which was put on sale in May last has been remarkably successful, gross sales in 1952 amounting to £3.4 million.  Allowing for encashment, with interest, of old and new certificates, net sales in 1952 were well over £1,000,000 as compared with an insignificant net receipt of £50,000 in 1951.  A Director of Savings was appointed some months ago and his special task will be to organise and intensify the campaign for thrift.  To this end full use will be made of the modern publicity media of the radio, the Press, and the cinema, with, we hope, enduring results in the expansion <Col N="1198" /> of our resources for capital development. A second minor source of Exchequer finance is the net investment income of the Post Office Savings Bank and the Social Insurance Fund. From this source and from small savings, receipts in the current year are expected to reach £7,000,000.</P>
    <P>Last year when outlining the capital programme which we wished to finance. I said that the response of the public to the loan which I then foreshadowed would determine in large measure the Government's capacity to carry the programme through.  The ultimate response indicated beyond any doubt that the public were fully behind the Government and were prepared to support in a practical way the programme of national development to which we were committed.  I feel that we shall receive the same whole-hearted support for the next issue as for the last.</P>
    <P>Should private contributions fall short of meeting our needs, we shall have at our disposal some of the remaining sterling investments of Government Funds.  I have no doubt that the banks also will meet any reasonable request for assistance in financing State capital projects.  The substantial help they have given hitherto is greatly appreciated.  As well as joining earlier this year in underwriting the Dublin Corporation issue, the banks have agreed to underwrite fully a £2,500,000 issue of Government-guaranteed Transport Stock and to assist also with a proposed public issue by the Cork Corporation.</P>
    <P>Taking everything into consideration it would appear that the capital programme which I have outlined is within the capacity of the community and can be carried through without damage to our economy.  Yet in that connection a certain reservation must be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>It is only in recent years, and largely on the basis of the American Loan Counterpart moneys, that State-financed capital expenditure has reached its present proportions.  While we may see our way safely ahead for another year, it is not yet possible to say definitely whether a programme of the present size can be continuously sustained, without imposing too great <Col N="1199" /> a strain on the balance of payments and without depriving private enterprise of its capital needs.  As a general proposition it is clearly unwise to aggravate the obvious difficulties of financing the State capital programme by adding unduly to its magnitude, for the assignment of an item to the capital Budget does not relieve us of the embarrassment of paying for it.  On the contrary, to the extent that the State capital expenditure proves to be unproductive, it increases the ultimate burden on the taxpayer and reduces the ability of the community to cope successfully with economic vicissitudes. Moreover, it has to be remembered that, however desirable new capital projects may seem, the resources available to finance them are not inexhaustible and that in this realm, as in most human affairs, means are much more limited than desires.  It must, therefore, be the duty of the Minister for Finance to prevent the unwarranted expansion of State capital outlay and, within the programme itself, to ensure a greater concentration on directly productive projects.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONTROL OF INVESTMENT.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of capital investment I think it is necessary to deal with a certain proposal of which we have been hearing a lot of late.  It relates to the establishment of a board to decide investment priorities and watch the effect of total investment on the balance of payments.  We have been given no indication as to the type of board which would carry out these functions.  Against our economic background, in which the basic limitation on national development is the low level of current savings, it is surely a misplacing of emphasis to give pride of place to a proposal for controlling and disposing of the nation's savings when the true national need is to induce our people to save as much as possible.  From that point of view, indeed, the introduction of a formalised control of investment would be harmful; for interference with the investor's freedom of choice would discourage private saving.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this primary defect, <Col N="1200" /> certain politicians in search of a programme have swallowed the proposal with avidity.  These gentlemen appear, however, to have overlooked the simple fact that control over investment would be useless without control over savings. Control over savings would, of course, raise important ethical considerations as to the right of the individual to dispose of his income or his capital.  But I need not dilate on this aspect of the matter.  Let us instead ask ourselves how the control could be operated.  It would be quite impossible, for example, to control total investment, if companies were free to use their reserves and other resources as they pleased, or individuals their capital or savings. Apart from interference with the freedom of individuals and firms to use their own moneys according to their own desires, we may take it that directives would be issued to banks, insurance companies, building societies, etc., as to the manner in which they should hold their assets.  I cannot think of anything more calculated to discourage savings and to undermine confidence in the institutions through which savings are accumulated.</P>
    <P>The only practical way, indeed, of ensuring that resources would be diverted to the particular types of investment favoured by the controlling body would be for the State to provide for a Budget surplus by increased taxation so as to bridge the gap between voluntary savings and investment. Rational people would not expect this course to commend itself to those who opposed so bitterly our endeavour to achieve a balance on the current Budget of last year on the excuse that our real purpose was to raise in taxation the moneys required for certain capital expenditure.  Nevertheless, the individuals who took that line then now advocate the establishment of a board which would facilitate a deeper encroachment by the State on the resources available for private enterprise and investment.  Consistency has sometimes been described as a doubtful virtue, which, no doubt, is why some people are not addicted to it.</P>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves, however, whether it is practicable over the <Col N="1201" /> whole field of private and public enterprise even to attempt to frame an absolute scale of priorities in investment policy.  To begin with, there is the difficulty that the investment which will best serve the national interest or give the greatest return cannot be decided <i>a priori.</i>  Broadly speaking, investment is much more likely to be directed into productive channels when the decision has to be taken by people who are risking their own capital. They are likely to weigh the pros and cons more carefully, balancing initiative and imagination with that prudence and foresight for lack of which the most energetic and enterprising may encounter disaster.  They will take the utmost care to be right in their judgment because they have something to lose.  Under the proposed investment board, however, the demands of the various sectors of the economy would be determined by the subjective judgment of planners who would themselves have nothing to lose and would be indemnified against the effects of their decisions.  The planners would have their own predilections and some matters, perhaps indeed very important matters, might be decided accordingly.</P>
    <P>We may now turn to the consideration of the current Budget for the year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">V.&mdash;CURRENT BUDGET, 1953-54.</P>
    <P Just="Center">BUDGETARY POLICY, 1953-54.</P>
    <P>Our guiding principle this year is to keep a tight rein on expenditure until output expands and revenue automatically expands with it.  We must shun any policy which would wreck the improvement in the national finances secured with such difficulty over the past year and we must not do anything which might retard the economic recovery that has begun.  The simple rule of health&mdash;that current expenses should be met out of current revenue&mdash; retains all its old validity.  It is, in fact, all the more binding because of the size of our capital programme and the strain it will put upon current and past savings.  Were we to incur a deficit in the current Budget, we should have to borrow to meet it.  By so doing we would be encroaching on the funds <Col N="1202" /> available for capital purposes.  We would be wasting on ordinary running expenses the resources which are sorely needed to finance housing, agriculture, electricity and other forms of national development.</P>
    <P>Such a misapplication of capital funds we, as a nation, cannot afford. State capital outlay is already so large in relation to any reasonable assessment of what we can borrow from the public that it would be the height of imprudence to budget for a deficit on current account.  So far as the Budget is expected to exert a positive influence on the level of economic activity and on employment, it is desirable that it should do so in a direct and useful way, through a large and balanced programme of State capital works, rather than by diverting capital resources to serve consumption needs, whether public or private.</P>
    <P>This is my answer to the charge that in fiscal matters the Government have been pursuing an out-moded and ultraconservative policy.  We have been attacked for what is alleged to be our rigid adherence to orthodoxy and our failure to adopt what are termed progressive and flexible methods in dealing with the country's problems. Stripped of their sophistry, the contentions of our critics are nothing better than demands for laxity in administration such as characterised their own régime.  On the plea that it would stimulate economic activity, they are pressing us to adopt the malpractice of burking year-to-year commitments by deliberately incurring deficits even in the current Budget.</P>
    <P>Advocates of this policy do not realise that the contribution by the State towards the stimulation of economic activity is determined, not by deficits on the current Budget but by the over-all effect of State expenditure, capital as well as current.  They overlook the extent to which in recent years total State outlay has exceeded the resources drawn from the public in the form of current revenue and savings and has been financed by putting new money in circulation one way or another.  In this matter we have been much less conservative than <Col N="1203" /> many other countries which are not generally categorised as such&mdash;Norway, Sweden and Denmark, for instance&mdash; which for years past have been running surpluses on their current Budgets.  I dare not, of course, mention Britain, for the Leader of the Labour Party would snort &ldquo;Tory&rdquo;, although the practice was initiated by a Labour Chancellor; and the Republican gorge of Deputy Dillon would rise in abhorrence at the sound of the name.  But there it is.  This country, on the other hand, has consistently had deficits in its current Budget, while at the same time it has been realising external assets or incurring foreign indebtedness.</P>
    <P>In the light of these prefatory remarks we may now outline the current Budget for the year.  The White Paper on Receipts and Expenditure, which Deputies have had for the past few days, will, no doubt, have enabled them to comprehend the problem in the main.  There are, however, certain additions and subtractions to be made, and these will have a material effect on the final balance.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CAPITAL SERVICES.</P>
    <P>First among them, and the most substantial, is the deduction to be made from the current Budget for voted &ldquo;capital services,&rdquo; upon which vexed question I must say a few words.  Last year in the vain hope of allaying controversy, I excluded from the charge against revenue every single item in the Supply Services which had been classified as &ldquo;capital&rdquo; in my predecessor's 1951 Budget.  About the capital character of several of these items, I had misgivings which have not since abated.  This year again, however, but for a different reason, I must postpone any reform of the procedure.  If there is anything in the view that we are poised between inflation and deflation, then it follows that this is not a year for categorically assigning to taxation charges which for some years past have been met by borrowing.</P>
    <P>Recently, in reply to a parliamentary question, I listed the items, amounting <Col N="1204" /> to £9,366,000, in this year's Estimates which fall within the classification of &ldquo;Capital Services&rdquo; adopted for the purposes of the 1951 Budget.  To these I propose to add three new items of an obviously capital character, namely, the grant-in-aid of the hospitals' building programme (£4,500,000), the cost of new broadcasting transmitters (£115,000) and the provision for grain storage loans (£200,000).  The total deduction, therefore, to be made in respect of such voted &ldquo;Capital Services&rdquo; is £14,181,000.</P>
    <P>Deputies are, of course, well aware that heavy expenditure on hospital construction has been incurred annually for years past, so I need not remind them that the hospitals' building grant does not represent a net addition of £4,500,000 to national capital outlay.  It is, however, a new item in the State capital programme. The Hospitals' Trust Fund can no longer defray capital costs in addition to meeting current deficits, and so that the building programme may proceed, the Exchequer has been called in aid.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DEFENSIVE EQUIPMENT.</P>
    <P>I have now to refer to a further matter which requires special consideration. As the House is aware, the failure in some recent years to maintain our Defence Forces at proper strength with an adequate standard of equipment was a source of concern to all who valued the liberties which have been won so dearly.  In the three years preceding the outbreak of World War II expenditure on defensive equipment, on the basis of present-day prices, ran at the rate of £400,000 a year, and would have been larger if supplies had been procurable.  During the years of conflict the average expenditure, again at present-day prices, exceeded £500,000 a year, and once more would have been greater if more equipment could have been obtained.  During 1949-50 and 1950-51, however, expenditure was a mere £54,000 and £56,000, respectively, again at present-day prices.</P>
    <P>In the light of these figures, the Dáil and the country will appreciate the anxiety of the present Government <Col N="1205" /> when in June, 1951, in conditions of great international tension, they took over responsibility for the defence of the nation and found that the country had to rely on an ill-equipped and under-manned Defence Force.</P>
    <P>Immediate efforts were made to retrieve the position by procuring from whatever source it could be obtained the equipment which would afford the Defence Forces some hope, if attacked, of defending our territory.  Within our first 20 months or so of office, we expended on such equipment just a shade under £2,000,000; and we have placed further orders which will require us to find £1,800,000 for the same purpose this year.</P>
    <P>But this is not, and in our circumstances cannot be, the sum total of the country's expenditure under this head. The position in relation to international affairs which the State through its successive Governments has taken involves the maintenance of a highly efficient Defence Force, a Defence Force which, whatever its numerical strength, must be up-to-date in armaments.  For a State of our size, resources and strategic situation, this creates a financial problem of some magnitude.  The first heavy impact of it was felt last year, when over £1,700,000 was expended on defensive equipment.</P>
    <P>This Government is concerned above all to preserve the independence of our people.  Under no circumstances will it seek to economise or improve budgetary appearances by shirking its duty to provide for the nation's defence.  In the present condition of our economy, however, it would be inappropriate to ask the taxpayer to shoulder the whole cost of repairing in the immediate present the deficiencies of the past.  A substantial part must be accepted as an immediate obligation, since the defensive equipment is required primarily to place us, who live and breathe at this moment, in a position to defend ourselves and our liberties. It is true that, defending those liberties and preserving them, we shall pass them on to succeeding generations but it is we, and not the unborn who are directly concerned that in this our day <Col N="1206" /> these precious things should not be taken from us.  It is, therefore, incumbent on us to meet at least that share of the cost which, if adequate provision had been made in the past, would be normal in the circumstances of to-day.</P>
    <P>It is not easy in our position to assess what that share would be.  Perhaps we may take the years 1937 to 1940 as a norm.  This was a period of acute international tension, a period, too, when in face of surprising opposition we were endeavouring to provide for the country's defence.  We then taxed ourselves to the equivalent at present money values of £400,000 a year for the purchase of defensive equipment.  I think it reasonable to ask the taxpayer this year to provide not less than that amount out of current revenue for the same purpose.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining £1.4 million, I propose to find £500,000 by drawing on the revenue balances carried forward at the 31st March last.  These balances are the Exchequer counterpart of the liquid capital of a going concern.  They are paid into the Exchequer in the first few weeks of the financial year when current revenue receipts are meagre and in this way they obviate <i>pro tanto</i> the necessity for temporary borrowings. In recent times, however, the balances have tended to exceed the £2,000,000 or so which is regarded as a reasonable carry over.  On 1st April, 1948, the cash balances in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners amounted to almost £1.9 million and over the three years to 1st April, 1951, they were maintained around this level. As a result of fortuitous accretions over the past two years, however, the figure at 1st April last had risen to £2.5 million.  They will now be drawn upon to the extent and for the special purpose which I have mentioned, thereby reducing them to a round £2,000,000. In fulfilment of this decision, the estimates of Exchequer receipts from taxation at existing rates which appear in the White Paper include, in addition to current receipts, the sum of £500,000.  The balance of £900,000 required this year for the purchase of defensive equipment will be provided by short-term borrowings.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1207" /> EFFECT OF ADJUSTMENTS.</P>
    <P>The effect of these adjustments is to increase by a further £900,000 the sum deductible from the expenditure side of the account, thus giving a net amount of £101.5 million, as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>In connection with these figures, we may note that the provision for issues to the Road Fund shows an increase of £476,000 over the actual figure for last year as set out in the White Paper, but this is balanced by a corresponding increase in estimated revenue from motor vehicle duties.  The prospective increase of £1.78 million in other Central Fund services does not reveal the whole story, since last year's figure included a special payment of £500,000 for shares of the Industrial Credit Company.  Excluding this item, the increase is £2.28 million, which is almost entirely attributable to increased charges for the service of debt, internal and external.  The debt service provision is, in fact, up by £2.24 million, of which increase almost £600,000 arises because a full year's interest on the Marshall Aid borrowings falls due this year.  As the Dáil is aware, the rise in borrowing charges is an inevitable consequence of the progressive increase in the State debt caused by heavy annual borrowings to meet capital expenditure and Budget deficits.</P>
    <P>Excluding only the voted &ldquo;capital&rdquo; items the net Supply Services figure for the present year is £86.37 million, which compares with actual outlay on non-capital Supply Services in 1952-53 of £84.7 million.  The increase arises mainly under the headings of Social Welfare, Defence, Local Government (Gaeltacht roads), Health, Army and other Pensions, Education, Lands, Forestry and Tourism.  These and other increases are offset in part by a reduced provision for transport subsidies and by a credit, instead of a debit charge, for superphosphates.  Taking <Col N="1208" /> non-capital expenditure as a whole, both on Central Fund and Supply Services, the increase over last year's actual outlay on similar services is £4.43 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES.</P>
    <P>So far my remarks have related to the figures given in the White Paper. Traditionally the White Paper reproduces the figure for Supply Services from the Volume of Estimates published some months before.  There are, however, a few items for which the published Estimates do not provide and which I must now take into account in order to present a comprehensive picture.</P>
    <P>A case in point is the proposed Bill to increase the pensions of those who were wounded or disabled when fighting in the national cause in the period from 1916 to 1923.  The text of the measure will be before the House shortly and its enactment will involve an increase in expenditure which during the current year will be about £165,000 with a prospective ultimate maximum of £215,000 annually.  Some additional expenditure on minerals exploration at Avoca is also foreseen.</P>
    <P>To cover the cost of these pension increases, the additional expenditure at Avoca and such minor contingencies as cannot be averted, I propose to bring in on the expenditure side a comprehensive and limiting figure of £750,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ECONOMIES.</P>
    <P>While economies affecting the living standards of the weaker sections of the community are out of the question and will not be sought, this does not apply to other sectors of the administration. There is little reason to doubt that within the framework of an expenditure of over £100,000,000 significant economies can be made without impairing efficiency or curtailing essential or useful services.  Accordingly, the Government have decided that a general economy of at least £3,500,000 in the cost of the public administration must be secured.  I can assure the Dáil and the taxpayer that this matter will be most vigorously pursued in every Department.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1209" /> REVENUE.</P>
    <P>Before coming to a final review of the budgetary position, there are some revenue and other matters to which I must advert.</P>
    <P>First of all, it is gratifying to note that the White Paper figures for non-tax revenue show an increase of £3,153,000 over last year's receipts. Larger interest receipts from the E.S.B. and other borrowers compensate in part for the heavier debt charges on the Central Fund.  The transfer from the Central Bank on foot of surplus income is doubled, the figure this year being £800,000 as against £400,000.  After the many harsh things which have been said here about the board of the bank, it would ill-become the Minister for Finance if he did not say that he at least appreciates this substantial contribution to alleviate the taxpayer's burden.  It will defray approximately two-thirds of the interest on the Marshall Aid Loan.  The Post Office services, which are the main category of non-tax revenue, show an increase of £890,000, partly as a result of normal expansion and partly in contemplation of the measures to reduce commercial losses recently announced by the responsible Minister.</P>
    <P>In estimating receipts from taxation in the current year I have considered it reasonable, having regard to the general character of the Budget and prevailing trends, to allow for a natural increase in the revenue, particularly from those duties which are showing their innate resilience after the temporary set-back of last year.  There is good reason to anticipate a substantial improvement in customs and excise revenue, partly offset, however, by reductions in the estimated yield of income-tax and corporation profits tax. Motor vehicle duties are expected to yield £4,350,000 or almost £500,000 more than for last year.  In all, tax revenue this year at current rates is expected to show an improvement of roughly £2,000,000 on last year's actual figure, thus in effect reaching last year's target.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SPIRITS.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed the view that the produce of the spirits duty <Col N="1210" /> last year was adversely affected by the fact that consumption had been met in part by using up stocks on hand rather than by withdrawing stocks from bond. I have budgeted, accordingly, for an increase in the spirits revenue in the present financial year, but I do not propose to make any change in the rate of duty.  I am fully satisfied that any reduction would result in a loss of revenue.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INCOME-TAX.</P>
    <P>It is exactly 100 years since income-tax was applied to Ireland but no one would have wished me to celebrate the centenary by raising the tax still further.  I am sorry, indeed, that circumstances make it impossible for me to propose a reduction in the rate or any increase in reliefs or allowances. The appropriate Financial Resolution will be moved.</P>
    <P>Over the century, and particularly in recent years as the standard rate of tax has increased, the income-tax code has been under constant criticism.  One of the more recent but most persistent contentions is that the present incidence of the tax constitutes a positive deterrent to the modernisation and extension of productive capacity. This is so serious a possibility from the point of view of national development that, despite the many difficulties involved, the Government have decided that the matter should be fully investigated. The decision will impose demands on the time of individuals, companies and organisations in industry and commerce wishing to make representations.  It will also put considerable strain on the already hard-pressed Revenue Commissioners whose principal preoccupation must always be the efficient collection of the revenue in accordance with existing law. Arrangements are, however, being made to set up a committee to consider the question of the incidence of direct taxation on production.  Its personnel and terms of reference will be announced in due course.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STAMP DUTY .</P>
    <P>Under the Stamp Acts as they stand, a purchaser of lands or houses can avoid the increase in duty, imposed some years ago, by adopting a somewhat <Col N="1211" /> devious method of acquiring the property.  In the case of a non-national liable to pay at the 25 per cent. rate the duty evaded might be considerable. I propose to move a Financial Resolution to-day with a view to closing the loophole.</P>
    <P>Another stamp duty matter arises this year.  The rates for purchases of lands or houses by Irish citizens operate only if the deed contains a statement that the person acquiring the property is an Irish citizen.  It has been brought to my notice that some purchasers, in the belief that they were not Irish citizens, have omitted the statement and paid duty at 25 per cent., but have found afterwards that they were in fact entitled to describe themselves as Irish citizens at the time of the purchase.  Existing law affords no relief and so I propose to insert a provision in the Finance Bill which will authorise the Revenue Commissioners to make refunds in appropriate cases.  The cost to the Exchequer will be trifling.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ENTERTAINMENTS DUTY.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years I have had repeated representations from the representatives of the cinema proprietors concerning the present scale of entertainments duty.  This scale is highly anomalous at several stages in its gradation and I have agreed that it should be replaced.  The proposed new scale, while avoiding an increase in the incidence of duty on any current admission charge, will afford some relief at the lower levels of admission charges.  I am not seeking to gain revenue by the change&mdash;in fact I may lose a little&mdash;but, if so, the loss will not be of any significance.</P>
    <P>These changes in the law will have an insignificant effect on the revenue. The position now is that we have a prospective revenue of £101.17 million to cover a current expenditure which at most should not exceed £98.75 million.  I shall be forgiven if I pause here to look back on my previous term as Minister for Finance in the days before the war and reflect how happy I should have been to gladden the heart of the taxpayer by the announcement <Col N="1212" /> of a surplus of almost £2,500,000. Alas this year's possible surplus emerges only to tantalise the taxpayer and then begins to fade away when we turn to consider the Civil Service Arbitration Award.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CIVIL SERVICE ARBITRATION AWARD.</P>
    <P>This Government will not borrow to defray increases in public remuneration. They stand firmly on the principle that such increases must be met out of taxation and that those who advocate them or grant them must accept the necessity for raising the requisite tax revenue to meet them.  In the light of the revenue trends of last year the Government, who in the Budget for that year had already substantially increased taxation to meet, <i>inter alia</i>, the cost of a previous arbitration award, exercised their rights under the Civil Service Arbitration Agreement and decided that they could not pay any increase in remuneration in respect of 1952-53.  That decision has been fully vindicated by the out-turn of last year's Budget.</P>
    <P>The substantial economies which will be vigorously sought and secured in administrative and other expenditure will enable the award to be met in respect of 1953-54, but not for any prior period, without an increase in taxation. The Government have decided accordingly and the decision will be effective as from April 1st.  Approval will also be given on the same basis to corresponding adjustments in the pay of other State personnel, including the Army and the Garda Síochána, and in teachers' salaries.  It is estimated that the cost in the current financial year of all these increases will be £2.4 million, which will in effect absorb the amount which otherwise might have been available for reducing taxation.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure, therefore, for 1953-54 comes into line with current revenue at approximately £101,000,000. This sum marks the limit of expenditure beyond which the Government is determined not to go until the present pressure on resources is eased by an expansion of national output and taxation has been reduced to a more tolerable level.  Only the gravest and most <Col N="1213" /> urgent grounds of national interest will be accepted as justifying any modification of that attitude.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION.</P>
    <P>This Budget marks the second phase in the struggle of this Government to re-establish order in the public finances and in the nation's economy; and we may now review what we have accomplished in that regard.  We have virtually resolved the balance of payments problem.  We have stimulated thrift and industry.  We have regained for the State the confidence of the saving and investing public, so that we can look forward with assurance to the continuance of a well-ordered and sound programme of productive capital investment.  To the measure of the nation's capacity, we have expanded the social services and provided for the health and welfare of our people.  We have been concerned to make good past deficiencies in the vital matter of national defence.  We have met the demands of the public servants for increases in remuneration with due regard to the position of the taxpayer. And we have taken decisions which assure the balance of this year's current Budget.  This is a Budget which is designed to achieve stability of prices and money values, to foster increased productive effort and to afford a firm basis for continued economic and social progress.  That progress, however, can only be achieved if we have not only a sound financial basis for it, but the will, enterprise and energetic effort which are essential if we are to develop our economy and expand our markets even in face of intensified competition.  It must be clear to all of us, worker and employer, farmer and industrialist, public servant and politician alike, that we cannot maintain our present standard of living, much less improve it, unless we earn that standard by a substantial increase in production which will reflect itself in increased exports.  Thanks to the measures which the Government have taken during their term of office, the nation is no longer moving towards economic disaster; it has regained its balance; and it only remains for it, unitedly <Col N="1214" /> and co-operatively, to bend its will and its energies to ensure that the bright prospects which now open before it will be realised to the full.</P>

      <P>In classical literature the disappearance of a certain person was always lamented by the habitual phrase that a voice was left and nothing else.  We have had 66 pages of bad and doubtful economics and what does not appear to be very appetising rhetoric, and nothing for the people.  Sixty-six pages and nothing besides.  I am wrong to say nothing; there are two reliefs which I want to go back on in a moment.  First of all I want to refer to the argument which we made last year about the £10,000,000 over-taxation and which was used inconclusively. Now the contention that there was that amount of over-taxation has been proved by the event.  Revenue fell owing to the incompetent handling of the public finances by about £2,000,000 or £3,000,000.  So we are faced with a depreciated and declining revenue, with nearly £8,000,000 of Supplementary Estimates, £4,500,000 of which were not forecast but were financed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said that there are two reliefs that should be mentioned.  Businessmen are now promised a committee to consider and report upon&mdash;the phrase that follows I suppose is intended to be reassuring&mdash;depreciation and obsolescence of machinery.  Party funds must be low, but Party expectations must be higher than usual if they believe that business is going to come forward with cash on promises that may or may not be implemented at some future date. Last year we had the remission of taxes to the ballroom proprietors; this year we are dealing with their sumptuary brethren, the cinema proprietors. One can only conclude that they have not subscribed as much as the ballroom proprietors to Party funds because they <Col N="1215" /> are promised only a slight revision in the lower charges.  When one considers what sort of depreciation will rank for relief, one is rather puzzled by the announcement of a relief to cinema proprietors in this year's Budget.</P>
    <P>The Budget no doubt will be phrased in the newspapers afterwards as a &ldquo;Standstill Budget&rdquo; but there is another phrase that could more properly be applied to it, the highwayman's phrase of &ldquo;stand and deliver&rdquo;.  We stand as last year, to deliver £101,000,000.  That is the sum to be exacted from a community which has been entreating the Minister for the last few weeks to have some common sense in his economics and to make some effort to grant some alleviation in the harsh levies imposed last year.  How are we to achieve stability if no relief is afforded?  If I said what the Minister said when I was over there, that in any year I was counting on £3,500,000 economies which would be pursued during the year, it would be phrased as a very dubious type of economy.  However that is the insecure basis on which this Budget is presented to the people.  In addition we have the promise which was made last year and which is repeated this year, that there would be no Supplementary Estimate during the year.</P>

      <P>We heard it last year but notwithstanding that statement, we had Supplementary Votes introduced in the course of the year to the tune of £8,000,000 odd and we are told that £4,000,000 of these were not forecast.  In addition the Minister is going to cash-in on part of the carry over from these Supplementary Estimates to the extent of £300,000.  That brings the figure to the carry over from £2,500,000 to £2,800,000 although at the time we were told that the Budget was unbalanced.  If these three items are <Col N="1216" /> taken together it will be seen that there was £11,500,000 accounted for, a sum very like the £10,000,000 which we said was imposed in unnecessary taxation last year.</P>
      <P>What has happened this year is that expenditure has been forced up to meet the over-taxation imposed in last year's Budget.  Finally the Minister adds the items under the heading of voted capital services while at the same time he pretends to be critical of our method of budgeting and indulges in a correction of what he describes as &ldquo;bad financing until a better time arrives.&rdquo;  In the end, he expects that the yield from the present taxes will show an advance of about £2,000,000 over this year.  He has provided us in the White Paper with a glimpse of the better times he foresees.  The yield from income-tax and surtax is down, or is estimated to be down, by about £700,000.  That is a very significant drop but it does not even tell the whole tale as since 1947-48, the yield from income-tax, notwithstanding the reliefs given and notwithstanding remissions of taxation, rose by about 50 per cent., or from something about £12,000,000 to £18,000,000.  This year there is going to be a drop.  In the year we have just finished there was still a huge yield from taxation because business had not completely felt the inefficiency of the Minister's handling of the affairs of the nation and the impact of last year's Budget.  Notwithstanding the recorded estimate of a reduction, the Minister believes that he will get £2,000,000 extra by way of yield from the present rates.  If he does it can only be by some way of some new levy on the public.  It may be a hidden tax as the increased Post Office charges are a hidden tax which take them out of the precise tax category but the result is the same.  That is the result of the Budget.  It is founded on a variety of misconceptions phrased throughout the Minister's speech.  We were told that the National Loan was a striking demonstration of confidence in the Government&mdash;a striking demonstration of confidence obtained at a charge of 5 per cent.  You can get even a better expression of confidence by issuing a loan at 6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> We are told that last year there was no marked or general disturbance of the country's economy&mdash;that at a time when there is depression and distress all round, when rates have gone up, when the number of unemployed has increased to the figure we all know, when emigration is excessive to an extent to call forth the lamentations of each Bishop as he visits his various parishes at Confirmation.  If the people believe that there has been no marked or general disturbance in the country's economy, how is the Minister going to explain the presence of Alderman Thomas Byrne from North-West Dublin?</P>
    <P>We are told that the Budget was carried through with a minimum of embarrassment to domestic interests. The Minister does not include his own Party in that statement or if he does will he say that there is no embarrassment in the words, to parody an old song: &ldquo;Follow me down to Wicklow&rdquo;? The Minister believes that some things have led to increased costs without saying where the high costs proceed from.  He has told farmer Deputies that he is not going to stimulate agriculture any further, as he believes taxation presses so lightly on the land.  We are told also that if the citizens decided to spend less on consumer goods or to save more, they would have more money to invest.  The people will know whether they are spending less was due to a desire to save or was simply due to the fact that the Minister had robbed them last year.  Did he not say in his Budget statement that he was making the attack which he made upon them last year, because salaries were too high and had gone higher than the increase in the cost of living?</P>
    <P>I have a word of welcome for one thing only in this Budget.  It is that which has now been done grudgingly and belatedly for the State personnel. The Minister is giving at least an instalment of the award to this personnel by the arbitration body the Minister himself set up.  He is giving it from the 1st April.  He is withholding from the State personnel, civil servants, teachers, Army and Guards what was due to them under the arbitration award as from an earlier date. <Col N="1218" /> If the Minister finds it possible to take some part of the carry over to pay for arms and equipment of this country, would it be anything more disgraceful, in the way of economics, to take some part of that carry over to pay what is due to State personnel from the 18th November last?</P>
    <P>The Minister appears in this Budget to accept the system he so much criticised and precisely condemned of these State capital services.  The Minister's Budget has not accepted it but at least this year is an improvement in so far as it has not refuted the principle of maintaining a level of investment socially and economically desirable in this country, even though it be beyond the present saving capacity of the community.</P>
    <P>The Minister announces one extra relief.  The Government are going to provide more for Mianraí Teoranta. The Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce shows this year a reduction of £55,000 in payments to Mianraí Teoranta.  The Minister knows the names of approximately 50 people who were sent forward to head office as likely to be unemployed as a result of this refusal of funds.  With the Wicklow by-election in the offing, Mianraí Teoranta will get this belated relief and will be able to put these men back into employment.  The net result of the Minister's speech, all these gyrations and all this economic talk, is that for another year the community has to suffer the savagery of the Budget attack of last year.  There is no alleviation given to the people notwithstanding the fact that the newspapers have been full of entreaties to the Minister to recognise the harm he did and to do whatever he could to repair that harm.</P>
    <P>Efficiency experts are in the air.  One such expert has been described as a person brought in to see that anything that goes wrong goes wrong the right way.  The Minister shows his versatility by having that as his objective. The other type of expert has been described as one to see that if anything goes right it is done the wrong way. This community has got to pay £101,000,000 for a second year.  I suppose people will be happy to hear <Col N="1219" /> to-night that, while there is no alleviation, there is no increase in taxation. But the Deputies recognise that they are unpopular.  They have lost any hold they had on the country and they have lost that mainly as a result of mishandling our finances.  They recognise that, given a chance, the people will definitely show their appreciation of the harm that has been done and they will turn to those from whom they believe it is possible to expect something better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The lengthy speech to which we have listened from the Minister for Finance is about as brazen an attempt as I have ever listened to to conceal the very serious deterioration in the whole economic and trade position which has taken place over the past 18 months and particularly over the past 12 months.  We have had presented to us a document of 66 pages, a document in which the Minister explains his Budget.  After listening to the Minister's speech and perusing the document carefully, everybody must come to the conclusion that this is a dreary and uninspiring Budget.  This document maintains every one of last year's vicious impositions on the people of this country.</P>
      <P>Food prices are going to remain at their present high level, if, in fact, they are not going to be increased. There is no hope for the unemployed people.  There is no serious effort to attempt to bring about any economic renaissance which is so urgently needed if we are to correct the present appalling economic deterioration which is taking place all round.  We had from the Minister in the second last page of this document what looked like an heroic recitation by the Minister.  The words are worthy of repetition.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have stimulated thrift and industry.  We have regained for the State the confidence of the saving and investing public, so that we can look forward with assurance to the continuance of a well ordered and sound programme of productive capital investment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later on we are told:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;... the nation is no longer moving <Col N="1220" /> towards economic disaster; it has regained its balance; and it only remains for it, unitedly and co-operatively, to bend its will and its energies to ensure that the bright prospects which now open before it will be realised to the full.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a tenth-rate recitation from the Minister&mdash;something you would hear in a down-town concert hall.  That is the kind of effort by which it is hoped to put a brass face on the economic situation which confronts the country to-day.  Let us contrast this mass of verbiage on page 66 of the document against the three main problems confronting the country to-day and when we are making the contrast let us remember the Minister's recitation on page 65.  &ldquo;We have stimulated thrift and industry.&rdquo;  Let us see how we have done it.</P>
    <P>I have here a document issued by the Department of the Taoiseach and dated April, 1953.  It shows that on the 25th April there were 84,000 people signing for unemployment benefit at the labour exchange.  We find that that was 17,000 more than were signing on the 25th April last year.  Yet the Minister for Finance with brazen audacity tells us that this Government has &ldquo;stimulated thrift and industry.&rdquo;  They certainly have &ldquo;stimulated&rdquo; thrift amongst the 84,000 people who are signing at the unemployment exchanges.  They do not spend their money recklessly now.  The thrift the Minister put in them was the thrift of poverty because they cannot buy the barest necessaries of life.  It was not their money that went into the 5 per cent.  £20,000,000 loan.  These people cannot provide themselves with the ordinary necessaries of life.  Yet the Minister talks about the nation having regained its balance with 84,000 people signing at the unemployment exchange.  That figure would be substantially higher were it not for the fact that the Minister had cut thousands off by the application of the Employment Period Order this year. The right figure to-day is one of 100,000 people and not the 84,000 people recorded in this document.  Yet we are told in this statement that all the nation has got to do is &ldquo;to bend its will and its energies to ensure that the <Col N="1221" /> bright prospects which now open before it will be realised to the full.&rdquo;  Does the Minister live in the clouds?  Is the Minister a citizen of cuckoo land, or is the Minister's passion for the main road such that he does not know what is happening in the small towns, villages, and rural areas throughout the country?</P>
    <P>Take the question of unemployment. If one starts at Gardiner Street, moves over to Werburg Street and then up to Victoria Street, or if one goes to any other employment exchange to be found up and down the country, one will find that larger numbers of people are seeking unemployment benefit to-day than ever sought it over the last 15 years, and all that in a year in which we are told &ldquo;we are stimulating thrift and industry.&rdquo; A statement like that, coming from the Minister, is a mockery and a satire on the sufferings of the tens of thousands of people who regard this frothy and windy document as just a mockery on what they are enduring from day to day under a Government which, in the last two years, has increased unemployment by no less than 26,000, according to its own official figures.  In spite of that, the Minister talks about &ldquo;stimulating thrift and industry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Contrast this document against the three main problems which are confronting the country to-day.  Contrast it against the problem of unemployment, and you find this Government's record is a record of dismal failure, not only from the point of view of not solving the unemployment problem but of keeping it from attaining its present gigantic proportions.  The Taoiseach told us, with a candour which does him credit, but with an appalling sense of frustration so far as the unemployed are concerned, that the Government, in fact, had no plan for dealing with unemployment.  They had no remedy at all.  The old fairy tale remedies of 20 years ago which were uttered by the Fianna Fáil Party are now discovered to have been so many punctured balloons.  The Taoiseach does not believe in them now, althongh he got almost annoyed if one referred to the fact at one time that he uttered a statement which indicated that it <Col N="1222" /> was only a matter of organising the State in the way in which he had in mind to ensure that everyone would be employed, and that the only danger was that there was the possibility that they might be drowned in a deluge of milk and honey.  He must realise now that these old days are gone.</P>
    <P>We have a more serious unemployment situation in the country to-day than we have had at any time during the last 15 years.  Take price levels. They are higher to-day than they have ever been in the memory of the oldest man or woman alive to-day.  People are paying more for articles of food and clothing to-day than they have ever paid in this country since man first populated it.  That, again, is the achievement of the Fianna Fáil Government because, thanks to the Fianna Fáil Government and the last Budget, and to the action and inaction of that Government during the past 20 months, the cost of living has soared to a new, to an all-time record.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Budget for any relief for the tens of thousands of people up and down the country who were crippled by last year's Budget. They are now facing another year with the prospect of having to carry the same burdens.  The people will have the same heavy, onerous burdens to carry.  There will be the same unflinching burdens, so far as they are concerned, to try and make ends meet, burdens such as they have had to endure during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>Take the problem of emigration. Every Bishop who speaks in this country, and who has been speaking for some time past, has been deploring the way in which the rural areas and the small towns have been denuded of their population.  The census figures which were issued during the last few days showed that the Celt is now going faster than even the <i>London Times</i> at one time thought possible.  It is taking an appalling tax on the flower of our manhood and womanhood.  That situation, in the main, is attributable to the fact that those who are emigrating are going, largely from the rural areas and the small towns, because they are unable to find the employment which would keep them at home to create <Col N="1223" /> wealth if that employment were available for them.  So far as they are concerned, they do not see any evidence of &ldquo;stimulating the thrift and industry&rdquo; which is referred to in such a prosy manner by the Minister for Finance. Tested against these three main problems&mdash;emigration, unemployment and high prices&mdash;this Budget statement is a complete distortion of the facts so far as our economic position is concerned. Tested against the sufferings of the people, due to unemployment, high prices and emigration, this document gives no hope of relief whatever.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that there has been a substantial fall in house building. There are four times more unemployed tradesmen to-day than there were two years ago, and the figure is mounting. That fact is going to give us further unemployment during the ensuing year in the matter of house building.  There have been savage cuts imposed this year in the grants made under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The sum of £66,000 was given in the year 1949-50 in the County Kildare under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, and that has been reduced to £11,000 this year.</P>

      <P>The grants given under that Act gave a substantial amount of employment in the rural areas in the draining of land when there was no other work available.  That, as I say, is gone.  The figure has now been brought down to such a low level that it can make no perceptible contribution towards the absorption of unemployed people in the rural areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that later.  In this 66-page document, to which the Minister treated the House to-day, there are 19 lines devoted to agriculture.  I am sure all the farmers on those benches, and Deputy Cogan, will draw joy and inspiration from that.  These 19 lines ought to be cut <Col N="1224" /> out and used as a Fianna Fáil poster in the pending by-election in Wicklow &mdash;19 lines out of a 66-page document devoted to agriculture.  That is the best that the Government are able to do for agriculture.  If agriculture cannot get on with that, then they had better forget about it.</P>
      <P>The position, at any rate, to-day is that we have an appalling flight from the land.  Agriculture is stagnant and has been stagnant for the last 50 years. Our industrial production has fallen. These are the characteristics of this Budget&mdash;high prices, 26,000 more unemployed and a substantial increase in emigration with a stagnant and deteriorating agriculture.  There has been a fall in industrial production, a fall in house building and a substantial reduction in the grants hitherto made available under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In the face of these unchallengeable facts, the Minister offers to us and to the country the solace of these 66 pages of wasted paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister took great pride in the fact that the National Loan filled during the past year.  The Minister was concerned during the year to see that the National Loan would fill&mdash;to use his own words he was going to make sure that the saving of a &ldquo;ha'porth of tar&rdquo; would not prevent the loan from filling.  Twenty million pounds were borrowed during the year at 5 per cent.  But the Birmingham Corporation recently borrowed £6,000,000 on the London money market at 4¼ per cent.  If the Minister, during the year, had not spent so much of his time in maligning the prudent finances of this State he could have gone to the country and got a loan at substantially less than 5 per cent.  He was anxious, however, to make political capital against his opponents, and proceeded to tell the country that its finances were in a bad way.  He created such an atmosphere that he dare not ask the public for money at 3½, 3¾ or 4 per cent.  Now, we are going to have another loan this year, presumably at 5 per cent.  All that we have to pay for the loan this year, with all the additional interest, is made necessary by the recklessly intemperate speeches made over the last 18 months <Col N="1225" /> by the Minister for Finance&mdash;by him more than by any other Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in this Budget to the Government's proposal to pay an increase to State servants, as from the 1st April.  State servants&mdash;or a substantial proportion of State servants&mdash; got an award from the Arbitration Board on the 18th November last.  That board was constituted by the Minister; the Minister agreed to refer to the board the question as to whether or not an increase should be granted and, if so, what increase; the Minister appointed his representatives on the board; he appointed the chairman of the board; he sent his heaviest artillery to the board to make the strongest case he could against the State servants; and notwithstanding that, an award was given by the chairman of the Arbitration Board on the 18th November last recommending payment from the 1st November last.  The Minister will not pay the November arrears; he will not pay the December arrears, the January arrears, the February arrears or the March arrears. In other words, he is going to adopt the disreputable and despicable practice of cheating these lowly-paid State servants out of the honest award which they got from the ministerially-appointed chairman of the Arbitration Board on the 18th November last.  That is welshing of the worst description.  The Minister is now adopting an attitude which has been adopted by no other decent employer in the country.  The Minister has held up the award from the 18th November to the 6th May and now says he will not pay the arrears, the arrears having been caused by his own failure to accept the award at the time when it was given, in the same way as every decent employer in the country acts in regard to awards of the Labour Court.  I characterise that attitude of the Government as deliberately cheating these people out of the award which they got from the board.</P>
    <P>Ordinary employers and workers are expected to honour and abide by the award of the Labour Court.  The ordinary citizen is expected to respect the awards of the Government's own courts.  But, for the Government, there <Col N="1226" /> is an acceptance of no law, not even the common law or the moral law, in relation to this Civil Service arbitration. I do not know whether it is any use at this stage appealing to a Government which can apparently treat its moral obligations with such contumely as the Government has shown in repudiating the moral obligation which rests upon it to honour this award.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will, I hope, and I will have something more to say about it then.  The Government is in honour bound to pay the arrears created by its own delaying action and I hope the Government has still sufficient adherence to the moral law and sufficient respect for the Ten Commandments to induce them to do so.</P>
      <P>It is a weary, dreary, uninspiring Budget.  It is a Budget which takes no cognisance of the existing needs of the nation, of the need for a bold, forward, courageous policy of economic development, and of wise spending in all fields of national endeavour.  The best thing that could be done with this Budget would be for the Taoiseach to take it to the President and ask for a dissolution of the Dáil.  After another midnight ride to-night, the Taoiseach should tell the President that he is bursting to test out the views of the country on this uninspiring Budget. If the Taoiseach would only take that course, I venture to say that in about three weeks time he would be a wiser and a more realistic man, as he would then know the feelings of the country, he would know clearly and unmistakably by the vote given in the election, that this is not the Budget that this nation wants, that they want a Budget which will hold out, as this does not, some relief for the 100,000 unemployed, some relief from the present level of high prices and some stopping of the haemorrhage on our manhood and womanhood by the exodus of our people to Britain.</P>

      <P>I, for one, expected that the Budget speech would contain some relief or some solution for three domestic problems that I hold most urgent in this country at the present time.  The first is the cost of living, the second is the 90,000 unemployed and the third is what the Government proposes to do for our principal industry, agriculture, in view of the fact that 78,000 young men between the ages of 15 and 45 have fled from the land since 1946.  I have often wished that the public gallery was big enough to gather in the public to see for themselves the flippant, irresponsible, clown-in-the-circus attitude that the Minister for Finance displayed during the greater part of his Budget speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, that is my impression of what it was.  The Minister passed over the whole industry of agriculture very lightly.  One <Col N="1228" /> would gather that it was with the greatest distaste he referred to it at all in his speech.  He said that last year, for the first time, exports of agricultural produce exceeded £100,000,000. The actual total was £101.5 million or £20,000,000 higher than in 1951.  The Minister is clapping himself on the back for that.  Twice during last year I told the present Government that they were achieving an increase in agricultural exports by the device they adopted in the Budget this time last year of depriving our own people of the purchasing power to buy our own farm produce.  The Minister has nothing at all to congratulate himself on, as that £20,000,000 increase means that the Irish people have been denied the power to purchase £20,000,000 worth of our own produce.  The Minister is very quick, whenever he gets the chance, to proclaim his patriotism and part of that seems to be a deadly hatred of England.  I cannot see how a man who hates England as much as the Minister says he does, can show his hatred by stuffing them with £20,000,000 more of our agricultural produce, when our own people are not able to buy it as they could in the days of the inter-Party Government.  Sending it across the Channel to England is a novel way to show one's antagonism, making £20,000,000 worth of food available to his avowed enemy, as the Minister has so often described them, by depriving our own people of the power to buy that food.  It passes my comprehension and my intellectual capacity to see how the Minister can treat his enemies like that.  I would like to be an enemy of his if he started with such kindness, but I would not like to be one of his constituents.</P>
      <P>In another paragraph in the Budget speech, under the heading &ldquo;Potentialities of Agriculture&rdquo;, the Minister says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Whether we like it or not, there is no escape, so far as our export industries are concerned, from the effects of these world developments, and we must adjust the circumstances of our production accordingly.  This applies particularly to agriculture, which is the sphere in which we have at once our greatest production and our greatest export potential.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1229" /> that potential is still far from being fully realised.  Taxation presses lightly on the land so that there is little scope for any stimulus under that head.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a nice warning, one of the gentle warnings to the farmers, like that which the workers got prior to the Budget last year.  Coming events cast their shadows before.  He goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government have provided incentives in a more direct and useful way&mdash;by guaranteeing high prices for agricultural produce, by arranging markets.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Would the Minister kindly tell us what high prices for agriculture did he or the Government guarantee?  What markets did he arrange?  It would be very interesting to know.  He says: &ldquo;by guaranteeing high prices and by arranging markets.&rdquo;  But the plum of all is this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...by draining, reclaiming and fertilising the land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That comes after he deliberately cut down the Local Authorities (Works) Act grant last year by £250,000.  That shows how much reliance we can place on any statement in the Budget speech. He tells us that he is draining the land, that that is one of the advantages that agriculture is getting at the present time, and that he is fertilising the land. The lime subsidy this year is £150,000 greater than last year for 26 counties, which works out at an increase of £6,000 or £7,000 per county.  No wonder the Minister looks up&mdash;when he strays into the field of agriculture he must be a very lost little lamb indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister finishes up that paragraph by saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Accordingly, if the margin between the return to the producer and his costs should be reduced by the action of the forces to which I have referred, the only practical remedy is to increase production and to spread farm costs over a larger volume of output.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister did not tell us what methods he proposes to adopt to increase production.  Is one of these methods the method of inducing and assisting 78,000 males between the ages <Col N="1230" /> of 15 and 45 to leave the land as they have left it in a period of six or seven years?  Is that one of the methods by which it is to be increased?  Is another of these methods the cutting down of the drainage grant under the Local Authorities (Works) Act by £250,000?</P>

      <P>I was referring to statements in the Minister's speech and had no intention of going into details. I want to refer now to the 90,000 unemployed. There is not one single word in the Budget statement about these 90,000 unemployed and no hope whatever of the re-employment of any of them, nor is there a word in the statement about cutting down the cost of living which is already blistering the poorer sections of our people particularly. I am sure the Minister will feel very happy and will give his usual chuckle when he hears from me that the vast number of people throughout the country are now using less than half the quantity of bread they were using prior to the Budget of last year.</P>
      <P>The only relief given in this Budget, strangely enough, follows exactly along the lines of the relief given last year. It is relief this year to the cinema proprietors. Dance hall proprietors last year got a certain relief and this year the cinema proprietors hope to get a certain amount.  The Minister dismissed it by saying that he would not gain any money but may lose a little by reason of the adjustment he intends to make I wonder if the Fianna Fáil Party funds will lose anything by it.  I do not think they will.  I think they will gain a little.  The Taoiseach shakes his head.</P>

      <P>Unless he is a bad shot.  This Budget statement consists of nothing more than 66 pages of sheer empty gas.  The position is that the country is to stay where it is, that the hard-pressed people down the country who were hoping for some relief in the cost of living will hear from the radio to-night that the Minister enjoyed himself for the best part of one and three-quarter hours telling them that they are not going to get any relief.  The 90,000 unemployed at least now know that the sooner they pack up and clear out the better, that there is no hope of their re-employment this year and that those people on the land who are waiting to see whether agricultural prosperity will be restored before they follow the 78,000 who have left should be getting ready to leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will be highly pleased when he looks back on his carefully-laid plan, the plan the Government laid when they took office almost two years ago on the basis that the people were eating too much, living too well and spending too much &ldquo;and we are the crowd who will cut that down&rdquo;.  The inter-Party Government brought prosperity to every section of <Col N="1232" /> the community, but the present Government has brought poverty and privation to practically every home in the Twenty-Six Counties in the short space of two years.</P>

      <P>It is no exaggeration to say that this nation is facing probably the most serious crisis it has faced since the State was set up.  Every economic index shows a disimprovement in the economic position of the country.  True, possibly, the position was worse during the war, but at least then there were some exceptional circumstances that caused that situation. We are now in the position where we have higher unemployment figures than at any time since the height of the war; where industrial production figures show a decline; where the number of people in agricultural employment shows a decline; and where the number of people in industrial employment shows a decline.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGrath challenges me and says that it is not true.  It is unfortunate for the Deputy that he should make a quite casual statement of that kind.  I happen to have here the trade journal which, unfortunately for the Minister for Finance, was published this morning and which publishes the statistical returns produced by the Government of the present position of employment. If Deputy McGrath would take the trouble to acquaint himself with the position it might be well because he might then alter his policy.  At page 8 of this morning's issue of the trade journal there is an analysis of the number of people in industrial employment. It shows that in September, <Col N="1234" /> 1951, there were 133.2 thousand people in industrial employment.  It shows that, in September, 1952, which is the last figure given, there were 125 9 thousand&mdash;a decline of approximately 8,000 people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of opinion; it is a matter of fact as to what is the number of unemployed and what is the employment position in the country now.  I stated and restate that there are fewer people in employment <Col N="1235" /> now and more people in unemployment, that the country is facing probably the worst economic crisis that it has faced at any time since the inception of this State and that in those circumstances it does seem tragic that the Minister for Finance in introducing a Budget on behalf of his Government makes no reference, good, bad or indifferent, to the economic position of the country from the point of view of employment or from the point of view of unemployment.</P>
      <P>In so far as he does make some references to it these references certainly appear to be misleading having regard to the facts of the position.  He states that recovery in production is already on the way.  The figures published this morning show that there is a fall in industrial production.  The Minister for Finance also told us that what he described as an improvement in the situation with reference to the balance of payments had been achieved without any marked or general disturbance in the country's economy.  Is he really serious in saying that?  I think everybody knows that there has been chaos in the economy of the country in the course of the last year, chaos in the business life of the country, chaos as regards employment.  There has been more unemployment than at any time since the height of the war.  To come along and say then that his policy has not resulted in marked or general disturbance of the country's economy is surely underrating the intelligence of his House and of the public generally.</P>
      <P>What is disturbing with regard to the unemployment position, and it is a fact that I would like to point out to the Minister for Finance, in case he has not adverted to it, is that it is progressively becoming worse at a time when it should be rapidy improving. At the beginning of this year, in January, we had the position in which 13,000 more were unemployed than in January, 1951.  In February there were 23,000 more unemployed.</P>

      <P>The point which I think it is essential to underline is that, not merely are there approximately 90,000 people unemployed, but the situation has been growing worse and disimproving by comparison with other years and by comparison with the period of the year.  At the beginning of April there were 27,000 more unemployed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, surely the most germane question to the economic policy of the Government is the question of unemployment and emigration. Surely I am entitled to point out to the Minister and to the House that the position has been growing worse in the five months since the beginning of the year; that in this Budget Statement unemployment is not referred to once; that there are no steps being taken to remedy the unemployment position; that on the contrary, the economic policy the Government is pursuing is likely to make the situation even worse.  The responsibility of the present unemployment position lies directly with the Government because it is the Government that created that unemployment situation by its budgetary policy of last year which it is re-enacting this year.  In my submission to the House this is probably one of the worst situations this country has faced.  We cannot afford further deterioration, we cannot afford further emigration, we cannot afford a further fall in production.  The policy which the Minister is pursuing is one which must inevitably lead to a continuance of the <Col N="1238" /> disimprovement in the economic position of the country which took place in the course of the last year.</P>
      <P>The Minister congratulated the Board of the Central Bank on the amount of money they received.  It might be more to the point if the Minister told the House what rate of interest the Central Bank is receiving on its £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 of British securities.  I notice that at the same time the Minister talked of the help that the Government were giving to the farmer by way of credits.  It might be of more interest to the farmers if he told them that he would be prepared to make credits available for them at the same rate of interest at which he is prepared to make credits available to the British Government.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to give some further explanation of the rather cryptic references he made to the provisions which he intended to make in regard to the increase in pay for the Army, for the Guards, and for the teachers.  He was rather vague in his reference.  So far as the teachers are concerned, there has been a most shameful breach of faith in what has taken place in regard to the arbitration machinery.  There has been a complete breach of faith with them and they are entitled to know exactly what the Minister proposes to do at this stage. Does he propose to increase the emoluments, with or without arbitration? Does he stand over the arbitration machinery created by the action of the previous Government, or is it his intention to put up conditions so as to make that impossible?  These are matters upon which the House is entitled to get some information.</P>
      <P>Again, I want to repeat that this Budget is introduced in circumstances in which the country is facing one of the most serious situations it has had to face.  The country has never been faced with a worse crisis as far as emigration and unemployment are concerned, a situation brought about by no particular emergency but that created by the Government's economic policy.  If that situation is not remedied the life of this nation will be actually in danger.</P>

      <P>The House and the country expected the Minister to give some alleviation in respect of the lower level of income-tax payers, the people who are being asked to pay income-tax for whom such a tax was never designed.  The Minister knows very well that the people on the lower level having to pay income-tax is one of the causes of absenteeism and loss of production.  If the Minister knew what he should do in the Budget, he would have made provision to meet that difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  That in this Resolution &ldquo;the <Col N="1243" /> principal Act&rdquo; means the Stamp Act, 1891.</P>
    <P>(2) (a) That where upon the exchange of any property for any other property the properties exchanged are not of equal value, the principal or only instrument (in this paragraph referred to as the said instrument) whereby the exchange is effected shall be charged with the same stamp duty, and be subject to the provisions of the principal Act (as amended by subsequent enactments), as if, instead of being such instrument, it were a conveyance on sale of the property which is of the greater value&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  which was made in consideration of a sum equal to the difference between the values of the properties exchanged,</P>
    <P>(ii) which was made to the person or persons in whom there vests the property which is of the greater value,</P>
    <P>(iii) under which the entire beneficial interest passed to the person becoming entitled to the entire beneficial interest in the property which is of the greater value, or, where more than one person becomes entitled to a beneficial interest therein, under which a beneficial interest passed to each of them, and</P>
    <P>(iv) which contained any statements and certificates such as are referred to in section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947 (No. 33 of 1947), as amended by subsequent enactments, and section 21 of the Finance Act, 1952 (No. 14 of 1952), that might properly be contained therein if it were in fact such a conveyance on sale.</P>
    <P>(b) That where there are several instruments for completing the title of either party to the exchange, the principal instrument is to be ascertained and the other instruments are to be charged with duty in the manner provided in the principal Act in the case of several instruments of conveyance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1244" /> (c) That the said instrument shall be deemed not to be duly stamped unless the Revenue Commissioners have expressed their opinion thereon in accordance with section 12 of the principal Act.</P>
    <P>(d) That in this paragraph &ldquo;property&rdquo; means lands, tenements or hereditaments and &ldquo;value&rdquo;, where used in relation to property, means the value of the property free from all charges and incumbrances.</P>
    <P>(3) That section 73 of the principal Act shall not apply in relation to an exchange in relation to which the provisions contained in paragraph (2) of this Resolution apply and the references to the said section 73 contained under the heading &ldquo;Exchange or Excambion&rdquo; in the First Schedule to the principal Act shall, in the case of any such exchange, be construed as references to those provisions.</P>
    <P>This Resolution is designed to stop the practice arising out of the fact that an exchange of one parcel of land for another is not in law a conveyance of sale.  That fact has been taken advantage of by certain people to evade stamp duty on the conveyance of land and this Resolution is designed to stop that practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it quite clear that the reference in the last sub-paragraph to &ldquo;any statements and certificates such as are referred to in Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947 (No. 33 of 1947)&rdquo; has the effect of limiting this Resolution purely to those people who are outside the 3 per cent. duty?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1245" />&ldquo;Under the Stamp Acts as they stand, a purchaser of lands or houses can avoid the increase in duty, imposed some years ago, by adopting a somewhat devious method of acquiring the property.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is no qualification there by reference to nationals or non-nationals.  I went on to point out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of a non-national liable to pay at the 25 per cent. rate the duty evaded might be considerable.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It could be eight times more than in the case of a national.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me, at the outset, compliment the Minister on the very subtle manner in which he has introduced the additional taxation which he proposes under the Estimate &mdash;and particularly on an evening such as this, Budget evening.  We have had loud applause from the Government Benches because no additional taxation has been imposed upon the taxpayer as a result of the Budget introduced by the Minister for Finance to-day.  But here, in the quiet of the evening, at the bottom of the page, we have a subtle attempt to do the very thing the Budget proposes not to do, namely, to impose additional taxation.  It is usual, I understand, on Budget day for the Minister to introduce these various additional taxes which the country may be required to bear during the coming financial year.  I think we have departed from the usual procedure and used back door methods for acquiring this additional income which, in former years, was collected in the manner which I have described.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The pain of having a tooth extracted is bad enough, but when the dentist increases the charge for the extraction&mdash;and imposes additional pain by way of strain on the patient's pocket&mdash;I do not blame Deputy Dillon for what he said.</P>
      <P>If we had the efficient telephone service that is provided in other countries such as Britain and America then there would be some justification for increased telephone charges.  But we have not got that service.  In fairness to the present Minister I must say that he is making a serious effort to improve the position with apparatus which was purchased by his predecessor in office, Deputy Everett.  I refer, in particular, to the radio-telephone service to the islands which the Minister told me some time last year would be installed in the spring of this year. We are waiting for that service.  I was assured by Deputy Everett, on whose instructions this apparatus was procured, that it was the most efficient and up-to-date to be acquired.  I should like to see this particular apparatus installed forthwith and particularly before the coming autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for accepting two suggestions which I put forward last year on the discussion of the Estimate for his Department. I suggested to him that it would be most beneficial to the fish trade generally if the prices of fish could be broadcast each day.  I am very glad that the Minister accepted my advice on the matter.  However I did not like his method of informing my colleague for West Donegal when <Col N="1249" /> he was about to do it and inspiring a question by him as to when it was proposed to carry out the suggestion made by me.</P>
    <P>I am also glad that the Minister has accepted my suggestion that more time should be given to a broadcast review of Dáil Debates.  I think that that additional information each evening at 11 o'clock on events in this House is most beneficial to the public generally.</P>

      <P>Some months ago this very Minister for Posts and Telegraphs announced an increase in the price of wireless licences.  Now he tells us that it is proposed to increase the charges in respect of the telephone service, telegrams and postage.  I agree with the Taoiseach in his statement the other day that we have reached the limit of taxation.  Evidently, the Minister for Finance accepted the Taoiseach's statement in that respect, but the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs finds a quiet way of slipping around the broad principle which was outlined by the Taoiseach and adopted by the Minister for Finance.  In his own quiet and unobtrusive way, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs proceeds to collect additional revenue&mdash;at the same time telling the public and the country generally that the Budget is a standstill Budget.</P>

      <P>He was protesting against this indirect method of taxation. Surely the charges for the use of postal services cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be called taxes? Posts, telegraphs and telephones are services rendered for the community. The Post Office is supposed to be run on commercial lines and if the charges made for the services given bring a very heavy deficit and that deficit has to be made up by obtaining it from the taxpayers, then we are taxing the people for a loss in that service which is not met because the charges to the users happen to be insufficient.  I wonder how many people who have not got telephones in their homes, who rarely receive or send a letter, like having to subsidise, even by indirect taxation, the facilities accorded to people who have telephones in their houses for convenience, who use telegrams for all purposes, business, sport, and so forth, and who see areas in the country with services brought up almost to the same standard of efficiency as a city service.</P>

      <P>We are talking about posts, telegraphs and telephones.  The <Col N="1251" /> service has to be taken together; one end of it pays; another end loses, but the over-all picture of it is that the total amount received by way of charges happens to be insufficient to meet the over-all cost.  Consequently it has to be decided what is the best way to meet it, whether to tax the people to meet the deficit or to make the users pay, as far as possible, for the services they get.</P>
      <P>The Deputy who has just sat down has expressed alarming apprehension at the amount, £750,000, which the Minister proposes to get by way of these additional charges.  How long is it since Deputy Everett, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, brought into this House additional charges which would have meant £1,000,000 extra for the users?</P>

Deputy Rooney is trying to suggest that because the Government next morning on a vote of confidence were reinstated instead of having to resign, my statement is not correct.  They came back here; they withdrew the charges and <Col N="1252" /> then the Estimate was passed.

      <P>The Opposition are complaining that the Minister is seeking to obtain a certain sum of money, £750,000, which they say is by a subterfuge. I am informed that the actual amount which will come into the Post Office coffers in the balance of the financial year as a result of these increased charges will be something around £590,000.  But whether it is £590,000 or £750,000 it is all the same from the point of view of principle.</P>
      <P>I read in the newspapers the other day, as, I suppose, many other Deputies did, that a telephone subscriber stated that she had the telephone for convenience.  It suited her to use the telephone rather than to walk the mile to town to do her shopping or to get certain messages.  But now because there was going to be a slight increase in the cost of the telephone she was going to deny herself that service; the telephone authorities could take back her phone and she was going to walk the mile to town and back every day in order to save the additional amount.  That is the very point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> Are her neighbours expected to pay by way of taxation, direct or indirect, to make up the deficit in order to meet her need for convenience, just to protect her from having to walk the mile? That is the answer to the whole situation.</P>

      <P>Everybody is entitled to whatever convenience she may be able to avail of provided she does not expect her neighbours to pay for that convenience while they have no such convenience.</P>
      <P>I have heard in this House almost every week questions addressed to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs asking him to improve the postal services in this district or that district so as to have daily services, instead of services on alternate days, and to have full-time rather than part-time postmen.  The people making these requests know full well that the amount of mail which a rural postman has to deliver is absolutely insignificant as compared with the amount which an urban postman has to deliver.  If the people are entitled to these services, those who benefit by them must pay for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to another aspect of the matter, it has always been accepted that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is run on commercial lines and keeps commercial accounts.  Are we to take it from the attitude of the Opposition that they want the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to develop gradually into the position of, say, C.I.E., that irrespective of costs of administration or irrespective of the size of the deficit on the year's working, the Post Office should come in here every year and get a vote of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 to cover the deficit, that the charges must remain static but the services must be improved and everybody must be satisfied, that the taxpayer must pay but not the user?  Unless the public are made to realise that is the position you are not going to have efficient administration. If the administration in the Post Office find an easy way out, just sit back and say: &ldquo;Let the Dáil vote <Col N="1254" /> the amount of the deficit every year,&rdquo; you are not going to have efficient administration, whereas if users are forced to pay, so far as possible, the actual cost and if there are still deficits at the end of the year and the Minister has to come to the House and ask for a subsidy or for increased charges, there will be a feeling in the minds of the officials that at some time or other there is going to be criticism and an inquiry into the administration.  As a result of that mentality, which I believe they possess at the present time, they will be always worrying to make sure that there will be no unnecessary loss on the running of the Department.</P>
    <P>We hear complaints about the telephone services.  Many of us have had occasion to complain but, first of all, let us remember that whatever delays arose, mainly in trunk calls, were due up to recently to shortage of materials. There was consequently an inability on the part of the engineering staff to bring the services up to date.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, we had a shortage of materials and, on the other hand, a very substantial increase in the number of users.  We know that even at the moment there is still a considerable number of potential subscribers on the list waiting to be given telephone connections. Although I have mentioned a number of complaints to the Minister, on another occasion I had reason to compliment him and through him the Post Office staff on the wonderful improvement noticeable in trunk calls from Ireland to England and the Continent.  I remember one had to wait almost four hours to get a connection to Paris and three hours was not an unusual wait to get a telephone connection to London.  To-day whether the call be to Paris, London or any other part of England, there is a vast improvement in these services and there is practically no delay.  So far as the internal service is concerned, I heard a Deputy saying this morning that it is easy now to ring up Cork whereas some time ago there was considerable delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever be the reason there has been a great improvement, I have been informed.  I have also heard that the service between Dublin and Belfast shows equal improvement.  I want to say to the Minister, however, that while it is true to say that there is practically no delay in getting connections to trunk exchanges, there is still a certain amount of delay in getting the exchange when one dials 0 whether for a local trunk call or a foreign call.  Sometimes the person dialling may feel, as Deputy Dillon has described it, as if he were going to have a tooth extracted by having to wait so long.  I understand that our telephone exchanges were in fact overworked up to recently&mdash;I am speaking of the mechanical side not of the human side.  New exchanges are now being added and possibly with a little more modernisation, that problem will also cease to exist.</P>
      <P>I mentioned on the last occasion on which I spoke on this Vote that the service is faulty in certain areas which have been provided with cable in recent years.  It may have been that the material used was not up to standard and I would suggest to the Minister that, even if it means the scrapping of the material formerly used, where there is evidence that such faults exist he should take the bull by the horns, scrap faulty material and put down new wires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, the telephone end should show a profit or a surplus.  Telegrams, we know, have always shown a loss.  I remember when we first started to increase the charges for telegrams, it was always said that if you made the telegram too costly you might lose all the customers who use that service.  The charges for telegrams will go up again but I think that, if we take the sensible view, we must admit the Post Office is just as much entitled to put up its charges to meet running costs as is, for instance, the E.S.B.  I have my own views about the E.S.B. and I do not want to discuss the matter now.  Those who say that the E.S.B. is not a white elephant are those who will never complain that the charges there have been far more rapidly and vastly increased for <Col N="1256" /> the consumer than have been the charges of the Post Office.  If the Post Office is fair game here because it is attempting to do what is just, then I say there should be a fair comparison. The E.S.B. does not come looking for a subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to see the Post Office relegated to the position where they will have to come in here year after year and ask for a Vote to make up a deficit in the running of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I say that because if it is supposed to be run on commercial lines it should be run on commercial lines and it should not be allowed to fall into the position in which C.I.E. finds itself.  It should be put in the position of another State organisation which does not come into this House for anything except capital moneys. That organisation is enabled, without any criticism, to raise from time to time their charges in order to avoid a deficit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to discuss the matter.  I am giving an illustration. I did not wish to discuss the matter as we will have another opportunity of doing that.  I am merely giving an illustration.  We have Stateowned organisations which are run on commercial lines; they fix their charges according to their requirements. The Post Office is a commercial undertaking, and on this Estimate the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be allowed, without the criticism which has been levelled at it now, to adjust its charges to meet the needs of running it as a commercial organisation.  It is not run for profit. If by any chance there should be an over-all surplus as opposed to a deficit, obviously nobody would be more pleased to come to this House than the Minister and say that he would be <Col N="1257" /> able to reduce a certain charge.  We cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>As a user of telephones, private and commercial, I consider it most unjust that my workman, by paying his tax on cigarettes and entertainment, should pay a subsidy towards the use by me of the commercial operations of the Post Office, whether by way of telegram, letter or telephone.  I think that is the line everyone should take.  There are a great number of people who do not use telephones.  I agree with the Minister&mdash;I see some criticism of this&mdash; that it is a very wise thing to leave the cost of public telephones as they are. These phones are used in the main by the type of person who cannot afford to have the convenience of a telephone and only uses it in an emergency&mdash; sometimes a very urgent emergency.</P>
      <P>I say to the Minister that there are very many ways in which the trading possibilities of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs could be improved. For instance, we charge a rental and so much per call after so many calls. It might be possible&mdash;we may reach that stage soon&mdash;not to charge a rental at all but to charge a certain rate per call as is done in the United States, where there is no rental charge.  In the United States they charge so much per call.  There the Post Office is not a national institution but a commercial concern run for a profit.  In the United States they have found it more profitable to entice a person to take a telephone into his house by not having him pay a rental.  In that way, the person becomes a user by habit.  We are still short of telephones for those who wish to become subscribers.  They are not so many and the Minister may, during the year, consider the possibility of altering the charges for the actual call and make it possible for us to have a phone without a rental charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that there are certain people who have telephones for their own modest use.  They may use the telephone only for a small number of calls. There is another institution which charges a meter rent.  The consumer of electricity in a small way has a higher rate to pay per unit because of the meter rent charge.  In the same <Col N="1258" /> way, the user of the telephone on a small scale finds his telephone costs so much higher because he has to pay this rental charge.  I do not want to labour that matter any further.  I consider, however, that the matter may be worthy of consideration when we have reached a certain stage.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made to me by telephone subscribers who move from one place to another and who experience very grave delay in the transfer of a telephone from the house they left to that in which they took up the new abode.  It does not matter whether the place involved is an ordinary residence or a business.  There should be some examination of that matter in order to speed it up.  Everybody will agree that telephone subscribers who are left without a telephone for a month or six weeks feel lost.  They become so accustomed to the telephone that, when they are left without it for four, five or six weeks, they are like fish out of water.  I would ask the Minister to examine that question to see whether he can do something to speed up the transfer of the telephones.  A special section might be set up in the Department to deal with the transfer of phones only. Some officer could be specifically put in charge who could be got in touch with directly rather than have to get through to the contracts department.</P>
    <P>This service can on occasions be most efficient.  Political Parties who establish a headquarters in a street during an election can get a telephone installed very quickly.  That applies to all political Parties.  That is all right but it proves that the Post Office can work with the greatest promptitude and efficiency.  I would like to see some speeding up in regard to transfers of telephones.</P>
    <P>There has been a great improvement in the matter of dealing with complaints in regard to faulty telephones which was a bone of contention amongst subscribers.  Sometimes they had to wait three, four and five days for something to be done about it.  That is in the happy beyond now.  I think we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that we are getting better service from day to day.  I do not know <Col N="1259" /> whether the Minister is using material that was ordered by his predecessor or material that was ordered by his pre-decessor's predecessor.  The policy of the Department is the concern of the Minister.  The administration of the Department is mainly the concern of the permanent Post Office staff from top to bottom.  I am told that we have very good engineering staffs.  The people we have in the telephone service are as good public servants as one could wish for, but at times, when we meet with certain difficulties or get complaints from those who have met with difficulties, we are all inclined to be irritable.</P>
    <P>We come now to the point of letting the Post Office be run as it should be run&mdash;as a commercial undertaking&mdash; realising that its success in maintaining itself will depend on its efficiency. We must realise, too, that it should not be put in the position of having to scrimp and scrape here and there.  If put in that position it will be all the harder for it to overcome the defects that must inevitably arise.  Our aim should be to help the Post Office to increase its efficiency.</P>
    <P>I have no complaint to make about the telegraph side of the Post Office.  I get quite a number of telegrams.  All Deputies do.  When we are re-elected to the Dáil we get telegrams of congratulation, I will not say from thousands but from hundreds of our admirers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">

      <P>I am certain that the more often members on this side of the House come back after an election, and come back in even greater numbers, the more telegrams of congratulation they will receive.  I do not think anyone is going to grumble about the cost of them.  I imagine that, if Deputy Dockrell had heard of a little anniversary of mine recently, he probably would have been delighted to send me a telegram of congratulation and would not mind paying 1/9, 2/- or 2/6 for it.  We also send messages of <Col N="1260" /> sympathy by telegram, and messages of congratulation to our friends.</P>
      <P>When we come to consider the postal side of the Department, it is well to remind the Deputies opposite that it was not this Government which abolished the cheap postcard.  I think Deputy Everett could tell us something about that.  At any rate, it was not the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, or the Fianna Fáil Government, who made the sending of a postcard dearer.  I suppose it was necessary to do that, and it was done.</P>
      <P>We have a good postal service.  I know that I get my mails regularly, morning and evening.  The deliveries are always on time, like an alarm clock.  All of us want efficiency of that kind so far as the mails are concerned &mdash;domestic, cross-Channel and foreign. When we post letters, we like them to reach their destination in the shortest period of time.  If we are given a good efficient service then, surely, we ought to be ready to pay for it.  The wages of Post Office workers in all grades have been increased.  The money to enable the Department to do that has to come out of the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;kitty&rdquo; is kept full by those who use the Post Office services.  Therefore, I think that the public will understand full well that this is not taxation.  The object here is to bring about relief in taxation.  I am sure that when Deputy Everett goes down to his constituency to prepare for the by-election he will not use these increases by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as a reason why he is going to argue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What I was about to say was that, so far as this particular item is concerned, Deputy Everett will never attempt to tell the workers of Wicklow that it was a grave injustice on the part of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to make the users of the telephone and the senders of telegrams <Col N="1261" /> pay for the cost of these services rather than make those workers pay for them by an additional charge on their cigarettes.  That is one argument that Deputy Everett will not use. It may be a nice argument to use here in the hope that city dwellers and business concerns may feel that they have a grievance.  No business concern that I know of will grumble at having to pay the full charge necessary to enable the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to give it the efficient service it wants.</P>

      <P>That was your whole case-that people should pay more for the telephone service in order that there should be a cheap telegraph service.  If the telegraph service is only used for the purpose of sending messages of sympathy or messages of congratulation, why have it there at all, and why not use the telephone? Deputy Briscoe referred to the speech he made when I, as Minister, had to ask for an increase in charges to enable me to pay increased wages to the workers.  I remember the speeches made at that time by Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Corry with the tears almost coming down their cheeks.  They asked what was going to happen to the people as a result of the increased postal charges.  Now, Deputy Briscoe gets up and says it is a pleasure for the people to pay.  The Deputy referred to the by-election in Wicklow. He is welcome to come there.  I had the pleasure of being on a joint platform with him before.</P>

      <P>On the question of having sufficient materials available, does the Minister expect a reduction <Col N="1262" /> in the number of telephones to be installed during the next year or two? I ask that because last year there was a reduction in respect of stores of £53,100; on uniforms, of £126,300 and on engineering materials of £246,750. This year the Minister is reducing the amount in respect of engineering materials by £251,000.  These reductions show that there had been stocks of materials in the Department.  The Minister referred to the plan in connection with the telephone development that was made in 1946.  I do not want to refer to my predecessor, but, as regards that, I would ask the Minister to look at the record of a conference that was held in Leitrim House on the 22nd May, 1948.  I called a conference of engineers, inspectors and labourers to ascertain the reason why the Department was unable to install telephones throughout the country.  I took care to have a shorthand writer there to take a verbatim note of what was said by the inspectors and the workers.  I am not putting any blame on my predecessor, but it was found that the whole thing was due to a shortage of tools.  The men were unable to secure tools from the stores. As some person very rightly pointed out in the report, he often had to go into Woolworths or purchase the tools from men selling these materials at a fair.  That was the position in 1948, that was the reason why the development of the telephone did not go on. Then we have the Minister saying it was the plan organised in 1946 he was going to continue.  If the plan was there, it was not submitted to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met those engineers and the unfortunate position was that the then Government would not allow the Department to pay the same salary to engineers as Bord na Móna or the E.S.B.  As a result, young men would not naturally go into the Post Office but into the E.S.B. or Bord na Móna, where the salary for engineers was higher, with greater prospects.  It was some time before we could get the Department of Finance to agree to pay the same salary.  When that was done, we got the co-operation of those people who, even at great inconvenience, acted loyally and took a pleasure in <Col N="1263" /> the work of trying to install telephones through the country.  I wonder if the Minister has visualised the position, when he is reducing by £251,000 this year the outlay on materials, that there is not going to be such a demand for telephones.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask if the Minister has changed the position where an applicant submits a medical certificate as proof of need of a telephone.  I have sent on two cases to the Department. One, in the Bray area, was certified by a Dublin specialist, urging the necessity for a telephone as there was only a housekeeper in the house.  That man was refused.  The other case was in Wicklow, where a gentleman went into a house where there was a telephone formerly.  The doctor certified him as being often in urgent need of medical assistance at night time.  The answer I received was that his wife was in the house and that if he became ill at night she could go out and walk a mile to get the doctor.  That was the position last October, and he has no telephone yet.  In my time, where a medical certificate was given the case was treated as one of urgent priority. I am sure, now that it has been brought to the Minister's attention, that he will see about it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, that man who represents or misrepresents Wicklow, questioned my absence during the week. Did he not know that I was finishing the making of arrangements for his political interment in County Wicklow? One of his chief mourners asked me not to complete his burial until we get a car out with Deputy Dr. Humphreys in it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason with which I justify myself.  I am glad the Minister is continuing the reorganisation of the Post Office service.  It is one branch the Department of Finance was always trying to economise on. They were always anxious to reduce the deliveries in the rural areas.  I am glad that if the Minister has not been able to stand up to the Department of Finance in other matters, he has stood up to them in carrying on with the same facilities for the rural areas, trying to give them at least a six day delivery as in the towns.  Regarding the increased charges, I have my fear that the increased charge for telephones will mean less of a demand than previously.  I agree with Deputy Briscoe that if you could have a charge for telephones and remove the perpetual rent there is attached to the meter, there would be a better chance of making the people telephone-minded in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Tribute has been paid here to the staff.  I can say that in my experience there was no more loyal staff in the whole Civil Service.  The Minister can compliment himself on that.  Irrespective of what Government is in power, their whole concern, from the highest and most important official to the lowest, was to take a pride in the work.  They are the men and women most in touch with the people.  The postmen and the staff behind the counters meet the people daily.  With the exception of cases where one or two people are always complaining about lack of some extra courtesy, there is a staff we can be proud of in the telephone service.  We should not mind the complaints about delay in telephone calls.  As the Minister could explain, some people are imaginative, they ring up and if the operator is not able to get the number in a few seconds, she has to put up with a large amount of abuse from citizens she does not know.  With the cable being laid to Cork and the arrangements now to improve the whole telephone service, if there was delay in the past it will be eliminated in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> I sympathise with the Minister in having to bring in a demand for increased charges.  I would have fought the Department of Finance and let the Minister for Finance bring in these matters himself.  I am glad that the airmail charges are not being increased, but I believe the Department of Finance would have pressed the Minister to increase air mail charges, only for the international agreement. The new increases will press heavily on the business community.  All Departments are adding to the high cost of taxation everywhere, even in local bodies, and I fear we will not have the results the Minister anticipates.  We do not want to see losses and I am surprised when I hear some Deputies justifying the Minister in making these increased charges&mdash;when I think of the different attitude they adopted a couple of years ago, when charges were increased merely to pay wages long overdue to the men.</P>
    <P>We know that the Post Office is to be a commercially run institution and I agree that it should not be a question debated here on political lines.  It is giving service to the whole community, it comes into the life of the people and is in touch with the people more than any other Department.  The people now expect that not the slightest wrong should happen in the Post Office.  I keep in mind when the Post Office was reorganised in my time, when there were no mails by the trains and only two or three-day delivery, when there was disruption of the whole system and we found men who gave unstinted service day and night, to try to cope with the situation during the bus strike and during the Christmas period.  These are things which should not be forgotten regarding a staff that has given loyal service.</P>
    <P>Some individuals think it is popular to criticise and attack the civil servants. In my time I got some abusive letters for an interview I gave the Press some years ago.  I pointed out that I had over 30 years' experience in this House.  I have had great admiration, from the inception of the State here, for our Irishmen coming in and taking over the responsibility of the <Col N="1266" /> State and building up a first-class Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Minister will also remember the Department of Supplies which was organised during the emergency.  No Deputy or member of the public could have the slightest complaint against any of the officials in that Department on grounds of want of courtesy, although I often wondered how they kept their patience, in face of the one hundred and one questions put to them each day by Deputies and members of the public.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat the statement I made 12 months ago that I am proud of the Civil Service and I am glad the Minister has disagreed with those people who have said that there is a 20 per cent. redundancy in some Departments. That does not apply to the Post Office, and in many cases pressure is being brought to bear to secure an increase of staff in some of the sections. It is the cheapest publicity to attack the Civil Service on these lines. I have never found it a disadvantage to give honour where honour is due after 30 years' experience here, and I am proud that we had Irishmen capable of taking over the administration of the State and working it so successfully.  There may have been a mistake or two, but occasional mistakes are inevitable.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister has deemed it necessary to impose these increased charges.  From my experience, I believe that they will not achieve what he hopes.  I do not believe they will bring in the necessary revenue from telephones and apparently the Minister himself is satisfied of that, in view of the reduction in the amount set aside for engineering services in the past couple of years.  I feel that there will not be the demand for the installation of telephones that we have experienced in the past couple of years.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to continue with the reorganisation of the remainder of the rural areas.  It will not involve any extra expenditure by the State, but it will give the people in rural areas facilities which are long overdue.  I am very pleased that the Minister has stood up to the Finance Department. <Col N="1267" /> I know well the pressure that must have come from that Department for a cutting down of rural services.  I am disappointed by the proposal to increase charges, especially in view of the present high level of taxation.  We have never had, in my memory, such high taxes.  I urge the Minister to carry on the work of the development of postal services in the rural areas. Deputy Briscoe spoke of shortage of materials, but he will see from the Estimate that we had so great a quantity of materials in stock that the Minister has reduced the appropriation each year for the past two years, which disposes of the argument that was put forward that we purchased only mouse traps in the course of our stockpiling programme.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to say whether he has changed the priorities in connection with the installation of telephones for people in urgent need of them.  Surely when there is such a demand for these telephones, a demand which is backed up by medical evidence, and when the men are working in the area, there can be no great expense involved in providing the required service.  I support Deputy Dockrell's motion that this Vote be referred back on the ground that there is no justification for increasing the cost of telephones.</P>

      <P>If there are any people in the State who give and have given service over many years, they are the people behind the counters in the post offices throughout the country. Their job is one which calls for extreme patience and one which is most worrying.  Anyone who thinks back 20 or 25 years must realise the tremendous volume of work that has been thrown on the shoulders of these people, and I was glad to hear from the Budget statement of the Minister that these people will not be forgotten. They do not deserve to be, because their job, as I say, is hard and onerous. I was very gratified to learn that that section of the public officials, as well as others, will get, from the monetary viewpoint, what is their just due.  There is no section of our people <Col N="1268" /> who show greater courtesy to the public and exercise greater patience, often in face of very irritating circumstances, and I should like to pay that tribute to them.</P>
      <P>I have been rather disappointed on the few occasions on which I have approached the Minister in connection with the installation of telephones in my constituency.  I put up a very strong case within the past three or four months in regard to one application and felt certain that I had convinced the Minister of the absolute necessity for the installation of a telephone and had I known the Estimate was to come on this evening, I should have come here fortified by some of the letters I have received. There is one person in my constituency &mdash;I do not propose to mention the town&mdash;who is the biggest business person in the town, a person who pays in rates up to £3,000 and £4,000 a year, with a wages bill of £10,000 or £12,000 a year.  That person changed residence lately to the outskirts of the town and there are three or four cross-Channel calls every day from that business premises. The owner goes to lunch from 1 o'clock until 2 o'clock or 2.30 and when telephone calls are made from cross-Channel to that place of business, there is no way of getting in touch with the owner.  I asked the Minister to accede to my request in relation to that person, who, as I say, is the biggest business person in the town, and I was very disturbed to learn, a fortnight or three weeks after receiving the usual departmental letter, that my request could not be acceded to.</P>
      <P>No matter what vocation we follow, it gives every one of us enough to do nowadays to make ends meet and when a good case is put up for the installation of a telephone, the request should not be turned down.  The telephone in this business premises was one of the first telephones installed in the town. I am careful not to mention the town because I feel that the person I refer to would not wish me to mention names, but the telephone number is 3, which shows that it must have been installed in these premises 30 or 35 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another person in a very <Col N="1269" /> big way of business in the same town. Every day the people on both sides of the premises get at least ten or 12 calls for that particular business.  Within the past week I was asked if I had done anything about having a phone installed.  Application was made last June.  In this case a phone is absolutely essential.  The premises are situated in Youghal which is a tourist resort.</P>
    <P>I made representations within the last month or two and got the usual departmental form saying that applications would be dealt with according to order of priority.  I never put up a case to any Government Department that is not genuine.  The people concerned must think that I have not made representations for them.  The Post Office wants money.  Here are people in a big way of business who need a telephone and cannot get it.  The case I mention is that of a victualler.  We are approaching the summer and my phone and the phone in a shop on the other side will be used for receiving calls for this business.  The Minister might ask the Department to expedite the matter.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest admiration for persons working in the Post Office.  If anybody gives service to the State it is they.  Where reputable business people ask for a service and are prepared to pay for it they should not have to wait nine or ten months.  It is absolutely essential for anyone in business to have a telephone.</P>
    <P>I pay this tribute to the Minister that in connection with other matters he certainly treated me very courteously and granted my requests, but I was grievously disappointed when I made representations on behalf of two excellent citizens who require telephone facilities.  In one case it is a question of an extension.  It is a very serious matter.  Calls come from England, and if the person cannot get in touch a cargo of coal or something else may be lost.  I may call to the Minister's office within the next day or two in connection with the matter.  I want to impress upon him that the request is genuine.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Briscoe about <Col N="1270" /> the delay in providing extensions.  In the case of the person I have in mind there is a telephone pole within 25 yards of the premises.  I certainly would be very annoyed if I could not get telephone facilities in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay a tribute to those working in the postal service throughout the country.  There is nobody who gives greater service.  It is a trying job at times and one that demands great patience.</P>
    <P>I hope the few points that I have made will be borne in mind by the Minister and that there will not be a delay of ten to 12 months in providing telephone facilities for people for whom they are absolutely essential.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, his officials, engineers and linesmen deserve the very best thanks of this House for the useful work they have been doing for some years past.  Some complaints about delay are purely imaginary.  In some cases persons who do not get a number immediately on request fly off the handle.  They fail to realise that the official may be paying an old age pension or children's allowances or something else.  They should be reasonable.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay a special tribute to the linesmen.  I watched them for a couple of hours recently in my town and people could take a lesson from them.  They certainly worked hard and did their job in a businesslike way. Unquestionably the Post Office is giving one of the best services in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With other Deputies on this side of the House I feel that people who have telephones and people who send letters, telegrams and parcels cannot expect to get the same services for the same amount of money as they were paying many years ago.  The Post Office is costing more.  Salaries and other expenses have increased and naturally the Post Office could not be run as an economic unit unless charges were increased.  On the whole, the proposed increases in charges are not exorbitant. I fail to see why a man who smokes his pipe of tobacco and who lives 20 miles from a telephone and does not give a <Col N="1271" /> hoot if he never gets a letter should be asked to pay for the increased cost of the telephone service or the delivery of letters or parcels. A parcel can be sent from Donegal to Carndonagh at possibly one of the lowest rates in Europe.  An 11 lb. parcel is brought for about 1/6 all that distance by road and the poor old postman has to hawk it along as best he can.  I am speaking from memory.  I think that is what it costs.  The taxpayer should not be expected to meet increased charges in postal rates.  If a person is getting a good service&mdash;and I think on the whole we are getting a very good service&mdash;he should pay for it and not ask anybody else to pay for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell and others on the other side, including the former Minister, were very perturbed about the proposed increased charges.  One would imagine that this was the first time they ever heard of increased charges for telephones, parcels, etc.  They forget that during the last Government's period of office, in July 1948, there were increases affecting letters of two ounces and over, postcards, printed paper, newspapers, samples, parcels and registration fees amounting to £300,000 per annum.  Then there was a second increase introduced in March 1951, affecting air mail and foreign mail which was expected to bring in additional revenue at the rate of £145,000 per annum.  The third increase was decided on by the Coalition Government in April, 1951, and that affected inland printed papers, postal orders, money orders, inland and foreign parcel post and also provided for the raising of the then existing surcharge on telephones from 5 to 25 per cent.  These increases were estimated to yield £488,000 in the year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, during the period of the Coalition Government additional charges similar to those now proposed by the Minister were estimated to yield £933,000, almost £1,000,000 per year, whereas the increased charges proposed now are estimated to yield this year £594,000.  In these circumstances we should not have any of the Opposition shedding crocodile tears <Col N="1272" /> about a matter of this kind because this is nothing new to them.  Of necessity, they had to increase the charges made by the Post Office to make it an economic unit as far as possible.  I agreed with what the Coalition did at the time, just as I agree with the present increased charges which are in the same category. I think it is the right and proper thing to do.  The Opposition, however, should not be shedding crocodile tears and raising their eyes to heaven and pretending that this is the first time anything of this kind happened in the history of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I want to bring one special matter to the notice of the Minister concerning a man in a certain town in my constituency who unfortunately met with an accident.  He has a large family and was in receipt of 50/- per week workmen's compensation.  Then the learned judge in his wisdom decided that he was fit for light work and the poor man attempted to do that light work.  He continued for some months doing the light work, but unfortunately the work he was engaged in was beyond his capacity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>You increased the Post Office charges by £933,000.  I think the Minister should take steps to deal with a case of that kind.  The man was <Col N="1273" /> unable to do the light work provided for him.  Climbing up a pole can scarcely be described as light work.  He had a decent salary as an official of the Post Office and it is very difficult for him to exist on 50/- per week.  Great hardship has been caused to him and I ask the Minister to look into the case.</P>
      <P>While I agree with the present system of priority in regard to the installation of telephones, I think that when the engineers of the Department go into a town they should finish the work in that town.  It causes great uneasiness in the minds of some people if neighbours who applied for a telephone a week or a month or two months before them have telephones installed.  There is another class of people to whom priority should be given.  If a man has a telephone in his private house and he gets a business house, I think he has a prior claim for the telephone service to be connected with his business house.  It would mean increased revenue to the Post Office and Deputies would not have to write so many letters about these things.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will restore on the radio the Question Time which we had some years ago on Sunday nights.</P>

      <P>I intend to vote against these proposed increases in telephone and postal charges.  At a time when the telephone was becoming very popular it was a mistake for the Minister to take this decision to increase the charges.  When the cost of living is so high and this country is going through many other difficulties these increased charges are very ill-timed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Judging by the rapidity with which people are having telephones installed throughout the country there is bound to be a substantial increase in the number of subscribers in the near future.  That increase should help to a great extent to reduce the cost and to bring about greater efficiency in the service.  I think it would be better to <Col N="1274" /> deal with the situation through the medium of increased subscribers rather than through the medium of increased charges.</P>
    <P>We have been sadly neglected in the West of Ireland from the point of view of telephone communication.  We suffer amazing delays in trunk calls, particularly between the hours of ten in the morning and six in the evening.  I have had personal experience of that.  I had a telephone installed in 1939 and I have not seen much improvement in the years between.</P>
    <P>We, in Mayo, have not benefited to such an extent as would induce me to vote for these increases.  I heard Deputies say this evening that it is now possible to get through to the cities and towns in a matter of a few seconds.  That is not our experience in Mayo.  I press on the Minister the desirability of giving the remote areas some concession in regard to the laying down of cables.</P>
    <P>Our telephone kiosks are very poor in type.  There is absolutely no ventilation in them.  I can see no reason for making them on such a small scale in view of the fact that there is always plenty of space surrounding them. There should be no difficulty in constructing a bigger and a better kiosk, particularly from the point of view of ventilation.  There is one kiosk down at the North Wall that I have had occasion to use.  I have often had to leave that kiosk and ask for permission to use a telephone elsewhere because it was quite impossible to hear a word spoken owing to the horse-drawn traffic, the heavy lorries, and the cranes constantly at work there. That is not a desirable type of service and steps should be taken to remedy matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>Some areas in the West of Ireland have been given a 24-hours' service and there is an understandable reluctance on the part of some of the staffs to take calls or put calls through late at night or early in the morning.  I can sympathise with them because I understand that these people have received no increased remuneration for the extra hours of duty imposed on them.  I do not think that sort of situation should arise in any State Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> I understand that the system is that the local sub-postmaster or sub-postmistress gets a certain sum of money every year for the running of a particular post office.  Naturally whoever is responsible, be it a postmaster or a postmistress, is anxious to make what he can out of it for himself.  They look for workers who will be prepared to work for them for 10/-, 15/- or £1 per week.  The amazing thing is that many young girls are anxious to go into the Post Office service even though the pay is so poor.  Evidently the work is attractive.  I think the position should be examined.  Many of these young girls are expected to contribute something towards the home and it is quite impossible to fulfil that expectation on a meagre wage of 15/- or £1 per week.</P>
    <P>Sub-post offices have been connected with the telephone in recent times and I have been told that the increased income they derive as a result of installing a telephone is £3 per year.  Three pounds per year represents a little over 1/- per week.  I think that is a very mean way of dealing with the matter. It shows a poor appreciation of the work done and the service rendered.</P>
    <P>I impress on the Minister the necessity for giving the people who are required to do extra telephone duty adequate remuneration for that work. I appeal to the Minister to install a telephone as soon as possible in Boherdubh, Ballina, County Mayo.  It is in a very remote area.  The people are far removed from hospitals and towns. I think it is an area which should receive first consideration.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I again appeal to the Minister to investigate the remuneration of our Post Office workers throughout the length and breadth of our country.  Unfortunately, many of them are working for a very meagre sum.  A Government which treats its staffs in such a manner sets a very bad headline for other employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House and for that reason I shall be very brief in my remarks.  I represent a rural constituency.  Undoubtedly, much progress has been made in the Post Office service and continuing advantages accrue to our people but there <Col N="1276" /> are some points which I should like to put before the Minister for his urgent and sympathetic consideration.  The whole of the Post Office service seems to me to be characterised by a reasonably high standard of efficiency coupled with co-operation.  Time and time again we have heard speeches from the Government appealing to our farmers to increase production.  The farming community are the most essential section of our people.  On them hinges the economic stability of the country.  It would seem, however, that in the apportionment of some services by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the farming community are discriminated against.  For instance, I wrote to the Minister six or eight months ago and appealed to him on behalf of some progressive farmers, a garage proprietor and an undertaker who required certain services from the Department but, beyond receiving the usual stereotyped letter acknowledging receipt of my letter, nothing has been done by the Department in regard to the matter. I am sure that the Minister will agree that that is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to talk about the postal services in the rural areas in my constituency. There has not been much evidence of progress in that respect.  In some places, the farmers get their letters twice a week and in other places they receive letters three times a week.  Long before I became a member of this House I appealed to the various Ministers to endeavour to provide a daily postal service in these rural areas.  I know one gentleman who deals extensively in hunters and gives much employment in that regard. He lives in a rural area.  He told me that because of the infrequent postal delivery service he has to detail a man to go to the nearest post office on those days on which there is no postal delivery in his area for the purpose of collecting the mail.  He informed me that there is no postal delivery service to his area on Wednesdays or Fridays. He pointed out that the ironical fact is that the postman on Wednesdays and Fridays, passes along the same road and nearby the some house in order to deliver post three or four miles further on.  Surely it should be <Col N="1277" /> possible to come to some arrangement in that regard?  I appeal to the Minister to consider this matter and to see if it is not possible to co-ordinate postal deliveries so that there will be a more satisfactory postal delivery service at the same cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hara mentioned Post Office workers and the low salaries which they receive.  It is a tragedy that that should be so.  The salaries of girls employed in some post offices are so low that I should not like the people in the Gallery to hear me mention them.  These girls provide a very efficient service and co-operate in every way they can to help the public. In justice, the Government should examine their case with a view to increasing their salaries.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I would be brief in my remarks, but I hope that the Minister will read my speech in the Official Report.  I shall be only too glad to give him whatever particulars he may require, and I hope that he will deal sympathetically and without delay with the points which I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first place, I suggest that when a Minister is giving priority or preferences as regards the installation of telephones in post offices he will consider the distances which people are from the nearest telephone.</P>
      <P>Some time ago I made representations to the Minister in regard to a telephone service for Gortroe, Youghal. Actually, Gortroe is exactly five miles from Youghal and when the people there want to send for a doctor or a clergyman, or to make an urgent telephone call they have got to travel all the way to the town of Youghal&mdash;and sometimes they have to travel that distance by a very difficult method.  A telephone service is absolutely essential for the people of that area&mdash; particularly when they have been paying for such a long time for the other fellow's phone.  Similarly as regards Knockraha, which is three and a half miles from the nearest town.  As I said, when the Minister is considering giving preferences or priority, he should take those matters into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not understand the approach of <Col N="1278" /> Deputy O'Hara or other Deputies in connection with the increased charges. My only complaint about the increased charges is that the Minister does not provide in his proposals for increased charges to cover the deficit.  The Minister has told us that the deficit the year before last was £875,000 and the reason it is not £875,000 this year is because certain stocks that were in were taken and used.  Only for that there would be another £875,000 this year.</P>
    <P>The people in this country who have no phones, the unfortunate agricultural labourers who never use the phone and the unfortunate agricultural community as a whole who use the phone only very seldom, are sick of paying for facilities for professional gentlemen in this country.  It is just as well that we make that understood straight off the reel.  It is those people who want special services who should pay for them.  If the people I mentioned in the agricultural community want to use a phone for a sick call at night to a doctor or a clergyman, they have to travel three, four and five miles.  In addition, they have to pay, through their pint and their cigarettes, the £875,00 deficit for the professional gentlemen.</P>

      <P>It is about time they did pay something.  In addition to the £700,000 deficit this year, according to the Budget statement the Minister will also have to meet an increase in salaries in the Post Office of £440,000. I admit that a large number of the workers there are very badly paid.  I think it is the worst paid service we have.  If there was a little more cropping on top and a little more given to the under-dog we would come out better.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>On his present showing. the Minister will have to meet, not the £700,000 deficit this year but £1,100,000, that is, the amount for the increased salaries plus the £700,000 deficit.  In regard to the ordinary people of this <Col N="1279" /> country who have no phones and who have no need to be sending telegrams every day about racing news and other things, they have enough to pay for without paying for facilities for certain professions here.  The principle under which we should work in future is that those services and facilities should be made to pay for themselves.  If we have people wanting special facilities it is about time they were made pay for them.</P>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy O'Hara means when he complains of the rise in the cost of living for the general public.  If this money is not found in the manner in which the Minister proposes to find it, where will it come from?  You can only do for one year what those gentlemen over there did&mdash; increase salaries to the extent of £3,500,000 and make no provision in your Budget for it.  They will not do that the second year.  Those gentlemen did it and left the debt to us to pay. It will make the Minister and the officials that are responsible in his Department keep a tighter rein on things and it will render the public who get those facilities a little more critical of the services they get, if they have to pay the full amount for them.</P>

      <P>My attitude in this regard has been put forward on a previous Estimate by the Minister for Local Government in regard to road taxation, that the user should pay.  In this particular instance it is high time the user paid, especially when the users are people who in many cases are better able to afford to pay the little extra that is required than some other people, the ordinary working classes in this country, who have been susidising them to the extent of £875,000 last year.  I do not know what some Deputies over there want.  We had them howling because we were not implementing the award of the Arbitration Board in regard to civil servants.  The implementation of that award for the next 12 months is going to mean practically £500,000 on this Estimate alone.</P>

That is the kind of business in which the gentlemen over there engaged.  However, I do not wish to hold up the House on these matters.  I should like to make it clear, so far as I and the people for whom I speak are concerned anyway, that these people consider that they have been long enough paying in ordinary taxation for facilities for others.  They stand behind the Minister in seeing that the users of these services will be made pay in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has gone on for a long time, so I shall be very brief.  We are faced with increased charges for postage on letters.  Increases in the cost of telephones and telegrams have also been foreshadowed by the Minister and will be imposed by future legislation.  We on this side of the House object to these increased charges.  I do not think it is right to say that we are unreasonable in objecting to them because the burden of our objection is the fact that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is supposed to be run on commercial lines.  Deputy Briscoe said that the Department was <Col N="1281" /> supposed to be run on commercial lines and he then proceeded to make the case that, of course, the Department had to pay its way.  While it is true to say that the Department should be run on commercial lines&mdash;and at this point I should like to say that we consider that it is a well-run Department and that the officials carry out their duties very efficiently&mdash;we have to consider the circumstances in which this great Department works.  This is a small country with a very thinly scattered population, which cannot be described as a commercial population. Our people are, in the main, members of an agricultural community.  A profitable Department of Posts and Telegraphs cannot be run very easily with a thinly scattered agricultural community.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry tried to establish that the rural community were paying for services for the professional people. As a matter of fact, it is the commercial community that are subsidising services run by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for the rural community.  So far from the agricultural community paying for everything, it is the city commercial communities, at least in this particular respect, that are paying for the uneconomic services and expensive handling in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy will have to go to school again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>What we on this side of the House would like to put before the Minister and the country generally is that with a view to building up a large number of subscribers and users of the facilities provided by the Department, it is in the commercial interests&mdash;when I say that I mean the interests of running the Department on commercial lines&mdash;to keep costs as low as possible.  The number of users of postal, telephonic and telegraphic facilities has increased enormously in the last few years.  The more people added to the list of telephone subscribers the greater will be the efficiency of the Department and of the services provided by it.  I would, therefore, urge upon the Minister that the overriding consideration of his Department should be to keep costs as low as <Col N="1282" /> possible in order to induce as many people as possible to use the facilities provided.</P>
      <P>An increase in postal charges is one that directly hits the commercial community. It is very difficult to work out what it will mean to an individual business but it will put up overhead costs in business to a considerable extent and consequently will add to the cost of living.  I think it is a great pity that this increase should have been introduced.  To my mind it would have been better to have raised the necessary money by way of over-all taxation.</P>
      <P>Various people have made complaints in connection with trunk calls.  I think the situation has improved, but I had a complaint some time ago that a trunk call from Dublin to Ardee took three hours.  The call was put through at 11.45 a.m. and the connection was made at 2.45 p.m.  I do not want the Minister to go into that particular case. Every Deputy from time to time receives complaints of this sort.  Certainly they do not tend to make the telephone service more popular with people.  I would agree with Deputy O'Gorman who spoke about the difficulties with which postal officials have to contend.  Anyone who deals with them knows that they can be difficult at times but, nevertheless, it is notorious that the public sometimes meet with discourtesy in post offices. I think that is due to the trying nature of the work which postal officials carry out and which is, in the main, carried out very well, but a big responsibility rests upon the officials to keep before their working people generally the necessity for being polite to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was requested to raise a certain question with the Minister.  Certain councillors have found it difficult to get their telephones put in.  I was asked to know whether the Minister would consider a priority list for councillors. There is another point I should like to bring to the Minister's notice.  Parcels which go through the post and come in from outside are opened for customs and excise purposes.  In this connection great emphasis should be laid on the necessity of having those parcels carefully and properly tied up again. Most people have had the experience <Col N="1283" /> of receiving parcels which originally were very carefully packed.  They were opened coming through the post for customs reasons and when the people received the parcels the articles inside were damaged because the packing was not put back in the same way.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the commercial loss on the sale of stamps.  Perhaps, he might explain the phrase &ldquo;commercial loss.&rdquo;  I am not very clear as to what exactly he meant.  There is a further point I should like to mention to the Minister.  The Post Office carries a great deal of work in connection with old age pensions and the Department of Social Welfare generally.  How far is the Department of Posts and Telegraphs reimbursed for the work it does in that way?  Is there any payment made by the Department of Social Welfare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>£800,000 for the carrying out of the services?  If the Minister is satisfied that this is an adequate payment for the service, that is all right but it would be rather unfortunate if the Department had to carry some of the costs of the Department of Social Welfare.  In conclusion, I should like to urge upon the Minister the very great importance of regarding the Department and the services which it gives generally as a hand-maiden of the commercial community and, indeed, of the whole community.  I am not satisfied that under certain conditions the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should, in the national interest, be required to be entirely self-sufficient. I think that under the circumstances in which we find ourselves, with a large rural and scattered population, it would be wiser, in the better interests of extending the services, to subsidise them by means of general taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, of course, could be a dangerous <Col N="1284" /> weapon under certain circumstances but we are in a different position from many other countries in Europe and I think that we need a different method of paying for our post office services. That really is the reason why the opposition object so strenuously to these increases.  We feel that the general services which this Department gives to the people will be placed outside the reach of many of the people who will be discouraged from being able to make the fullest use of the services.  I would like to see telephones in every farmhouse.  I would like to see the very greatest use being made of our postal services but if we keep the charges high, then our people will not, in the main, be able to avail of the services.  That is why I am afraid we will have to vote against this particular Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to intervene in order to pay tribute to the officials of the Department and to compliment the Minister on the rapid improvement in the telephone and postal sections of his Department.  In Cork we have an up-to-date post office and a very up-to-date automatic exchange. I do not agree with some of the people on the opposite side who say that increases should be met by general taxation. I think that every herring should hang by its own tail and that the people who use the Post Office telephones should pay the cost thereof themselves.  I agree with Deputy Corry that the ordinary worker, who does not use the phone and seldom uses a stamp, should not be expected to contribute towards the cost of telephones for others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the courtesy of all the officials connected with the post office in Cork that I know of, both engineering and telephone officials.  I am very glad that the Minister for Finance saw fit to implement the Civil Service arbitration award in full.  In my opinion nobody needed it more than the Post Office men.  Even with this increase, I say that the majority of the people in that Department are poorly paid.  There are a lot of men in the Post Office Department who are kept on a temporary basis for the most of their lives. <Col N="1285" /> They should be made permanent at least after nine or ten years' service. They should not be kept on a temporary basis all the time.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look into the matter of providing more collection boxes in Cork if possible in the builtup areas and at other places by which postmen and people pass.  I am sure that the provision of additional collection boxes would not involve much expense.  If there were more collection boxes in the different areas it would save people a lot of trouble and walking. There is nothing more I have to say on the Estimate except that I am very pleased with the service that we are getting in Cork at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how any Deputy could congratulate the Minister on this Estimate.  Following the general policy of the Fianna Fáil Government, the Estimate proposes to increase taxes all the time.  After the last Budget, which was a terrible burden on all the people, we had the Minister for Local Government coming along later and piling on more taxation on lorries.  Within a few months, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs increased the wireless licence by 5/-, thereby bringing in more revenue to the State.  Now he proposes to increase letter postage and telegraph and telephone charges.  A number of Deputies have pointed out that the telephone had been coming into general use throughout the country, especially in recent years.  The extra charge now proposed by the Minister is not going to encourage people to install it.  I am sure there are many people who, in the normal way, would have installed a telephone, but now due to this increase will not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember, some few years ago, when the Minister's predecessor on his Estimate suggested that all letters addressed to Radio Eireann and to the different Departments of State by people throughout the country should carry a stamp.  I forget whether the stamp at that time cost 2d. or 2½d.  It was suggested that all Deputies sending letters to State Departments should stamp them, and in that way help the revenue.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies at that time opposed the <Col N="1286" /> Minister's suggestion.  In fact, they brought about the defeat of the Minister's Estimate on that very question. I am quite certain, however, that the Fianna Fáil Deputies who acted in that way at that time will go into the Lobby to-night and vote for all the increased charges which are being proposed by the present Minister.  It was a different matter with them when they were being asked to pay part of the charge themselves.  They were in opposition then and voted to a man against the proposed charges.  As I have said, they brought about the defeat of the Minister's Estimate at that time, with the result that the Dáil had to meet on the following morning to consider the position.  The proposals at that time did not involve a charge on all the people, but only on those writing letters to different Departments of State.</P>
    <P>The charges which we are considering to-night will apply to all the people, yet I am certain that all the Fianna Fáil yes men will march into the Lobby and vote for them.</P>
    <P>I understand that Kilkenny Post Office is one of the offices on the list for reconstruction.  I would like to tell the Minister that he would want to buck up with its reconstruction.  It is in a deplorable state.  It is not half big enough for a city the size of Kilkenny, and for the amount of work that has to be done in it.  As we all know, Post Office work has been greatly increased. The officials now have to deal with children's allowances, old-age pensions, widows' pensions and a number of other services.  The position is that the office is so crowded on some days that it is impossible for people to get into it to do their business.  It is a disgrace that its reconstruction was not undertaken long ago.</P>
    <P>We talk about civil servants.  I suggest that it is hard for people who have to work behind a post office counter in the conditions I have described to be civil.  They have not even breathing space there.  Deputy Corry mentioned some time ago about the drones in the Civil Service.  I can assure him that there are not many drones behind the post office counters <Col N="1287" /> in Kilkenny.  They are simply overburdened with work and have not enough accommodation in which to do it.  I suggest, too, that due to the failure to have the work of reconstruction carried out earlier, the revenue of the post office has suffered in consequence. I would ask the Minister to have the work carried out at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of my reply, I think I should mention the fact that the expected revenue from the increased charges in the course of the current financial year will be approximately £594,000.  A number of the charges are not being levied until later in the year.  I think that sum, in the computation of a Budget of some £100,000,000, disposes of the idea, one way or another, that the charges proposed are crushing or burdensome, or that they could possibly affect any argument in regard to the Budget if they were to be described as taxes.</P>
      <P>The first point I wish to make is that I object in the strongest possible way to the suggestion that the charges paid for the postal services should be described as taxes.  The Department is supposed to be run, as far as possible, on a commercial basis.  The charges are not compulsory except to those who wish to avail of them.  They are not compulsory in the way that a tax on cigarettes or alcohol is, on something that is used almost universally by everyone.  The postal services, as I have said, should be run on a commercial basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, before going on to make a general comment on the speeches which have been made, I should mention that increased charges were levied during the 1948-51 period on no less than four occasions.  The total extra revenue derived from these three increases amounted to nearly £1,000,000 per year&mdash;in actual fact to £935,000. In July, 1948, the letter rate for letters above two ounces, the printed paper rate for printed papers, newspapers, samples and parcel rates were increased. There were also increased charges for other miscellaneous items. The total amount of income brought in <Col N="1288" /> was estimated to be £300,000.  In August, 1949, minor charges in the foreign postal rates were imposed.  I need hardly mention these because the amount of revenue derived was almost negligible.  In March, 1941, the rate for foreign air mails was increased, the estimated revenue being £145,000.</P>
    <P>In April, 1951, the former Government wrote a letter to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs sanctioning increased charges in respect of parcel post, printed paper, money orders and postal order poundages, which were estimated to bring in £213,000, and increases in telephone charges which were estimated to bring in £275,000. Those charges were implemented some time, I think, in July, 1951, by myself. They were confirmed by the present Government, but sanction for them lay on the table of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in April, 1951.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the total increased charges by the last Government amounted to £1,000,000 a year.  I think myself that all of it was necessary and was done with the object of trying to prevent a deficit arising at a time when the costs of materials, wages and salaries were rising.  It was done with the same object as in the present case.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had at that time&mdash;I wish to be quite frank and to accord him the compliment&mdash; the same general viewpoint, that the postal services should pay for themselves. When the costs rose, there naturally had to be increases in the charges levied on the users of those services, in the same way as in the services of other public utilities and for other goods generally.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say that, taken as a whole, the comment on the character of the services has been highly favourable. Deputies of all Parties have pointed to an improvement in the services, particularly in the telephone service, and there have been very few complaints.  The comment on the increased charges has been largely unrealistic. It is quite fantastic that many Deputies in the Opposition came in here and condemned increases in charges and then proceeded to advocate higher salaries for the staffs and more elaborate services.  A great many <Col N="1289" /> of their recommendations would have involved still further expense and still further increases in charges.</P>
    <P>The Post Office is manned by officers of the Civil Service who, from long experience, have the general attitude of businessmen in the conduct of Post Office operations.  They have a general understanding of what charges can be borne by the community.  In the past, their predictions in regard to anticipated increased revenues have been reasonably good.  I am prepared to take the advice of these very able men, and I have made up my mind to subscribe to the general tradition that the Post Office should, as far as possible, come at least near to paying for itself. In some years, it has actually earned a surplus.  I am prepared to take the officers' advice as to the method to be adopted in securing at least a balance.</P>
    <P>Since 1922 there have been 14 years of surplus in regard to the three services.  There have been 18 years in which there were deficits, but in the case of eight of the 18 years the deficits were under £200,000.  If you subtract the first seven years of our native administration and assume that deficits in those years were due to taking over from the British Government, to the impact of the civil war and its after effect, one can say that, in general, the tradition has been that the Post Office should come near to paying for itself, and that it might earn a modest surplus in some years in order to make some compensation for losses in previous years.</P>
    <P>Until these new charges were imposed, the Post Office had no rival I know of in this coutnry for the very moderate character of the charges for its services.  Compared with 1939, the general postal rate had in the year 1952 increased by only a very small per cent. ; telephone charges were only 25 per cent. up; and a great many of the miscellaneous charges for other postal services were from 25 to 50 per cent. up.  I do not know of any other public utility which has had the same record.  I do not believe that the new charges will be crippling and, when they have been imposed, the increase in comparison with 1939 will be of the <Col N="1290" /> general order of only 50 per cent. There are some exceptions to that. Certain charges, such as those for trunk calls, are not going up even the 50 per cent. over 1939.  Some other charges may be slightly in excess of 50 per cent. over 1939.  I know very few public utilities in this or any country, I know very few services of any kind, I know practically no goods, whose cost to-day is only 50 per cent. above 1939. It is a tribute to the Department and to the officers who conduct the services that even after these increases have been made there will still be great moderation in the charges levied.</P>
    <P>I am very interested to know that, in all the comment there has been in the course of this debate, not one single Deputy has suggested that he has ever observed any notable over-staffing in my Department.  I have heard many Deputies in the Opposition and on our own side speak on that point and I am particularly glad to have the testimony of Deputies of the Opposition, who were complaining of increased charges, to testify to the difficulties under which the staff worked and to hear them described as extraordinarily zealous and courteous officials.  There has been no criticism that people were idle, pushing pens and doing nothing, or that there were people in the Department doing crossword puzzles.</P>

      <P>There have been some comments on our finances which I consider to be more than dishonest on the part of certain Deputies who are expected to speak with some degree of probity on our financial position. Deputy Declan Costello, whom I have <Col N="1291" /> heard make some extremely intelligent speeches, apparently without examining the facts made it quite clear that he wished to give the impression to the country that we had made some change in the method of running services, the method of calculating the finances, which had some relation to changes in budgetary policy.  He tried to drag the argument about raising capital, the different methods adopted by the two Governments in computing capital commitments, into the running of the postal services.  There has been absolutely no change whatever in regard to the character of the items that are treated as capital charges and those which are treated as current charges in my Department, nor has there been any change made, I might add, for a considerable number of years.  Deputy Everett himself when he was Minister made no change.  I equally have made no change at all. At any rate, the deficit increased to over £800,000 before any of these budgetary discussions commenced and before the long dispute on the balance of payments policy began in the Dáil. The deficit was £840,000 in the financial year 1951-52; it was £317,000 in 1950-51; and in both those years there had been no major changes in budgetary policy nor had any of the arguments started in regard to capital payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, we have been able to report greater output per man in the installation of telephones, kiosks and exchanges since 1950.  There has been a tremendous growth in the telephone service, and I have noted that Deputies themselves have commented upon that in no unfavourable fashion.  I do not know whether I need indicate again how the deficit arose, but as there has been some doubt cast upon the cause I should mention that, long before there were any budgetary changes, mail conveyance costs had increased and depreciation, interest and maintenance charges for the telephone and telegraph services had increased, consequent upon the increased number of trunk circuits and general development. Wages had increased under the Civil Service award 1951 by £592,000. <Col N="1292" /> All these things together brought about the deficit, which has been continuous since the financial year 1951-52.  I have examined every section of the Department for possible waste and there is no need for me to reiterate what I have said already, that the very great majority of the staff of the Department do the kind of work whose volume can be tested and, therefore, every effort is made to keep costs as low as possible.  At present, on account of the growth in the &ldquo;no delay&rdquo; service in the Dublin telephone exchange, we have adapted our previous method of recruiting.  In the Dublin telephone exchange, when there is a very heavy peak load of traffic, people are brought in to do switch work who otherwise would be doing clerical work, in order to ensure economy.  I mention that as one example of the many efforts made to keep down costs.</P>
    <P>So far as telephone services are concerned, there is no service on earth that I know of that can be kept at a general rate of charge of only 25 per cent. above the 1939 figure, when the materials used for the construction of the service are three times the 1939 figure and when the wages and salaries of the officers and men who carry out the installations and maintenance are 90 to 110 per cent. above 1939.  It simply cannot be done, and in that connection I should like to refer to the report of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, a company which is a by-word of efficiency, which is always being held up to Government telephone administrations as a model to copy and where exactly the same situation has arisen as here.</P>
    <P>The president, reporting in connection with the 1952 accounts, made it perfectly clear that technical and operating improvements in the American telephone service alone could not offset the effects of inflation and he said that he would have to apply continuously for increases in telephone charges to the commissions of the various States who have some say in the charges to be levied by his company over the United States of <Col N="1293" /> America.  There were increases of about 25 per cent. in telephone charges in America since 1946. and, in spite of that, in 1952, although there has been an enormous increase in the number of telephones installed, in the speed of telephone calls and the general efficiency of the system, the president of the company made it perfectly clear that new facilities would inevitably cost more, no matter what the volume of calls anticipated.  In fact, a great deal of this report, which I do not propose to read, could almost be written, with a few changes, as a general report, without figures stated, of our own telephone service.</P>
    <P>I might add that the American Telephone and Telegraph Company earned on its total capital a profit of some 5.41 per cent. in 1952, a profit so low that, being a private commercial company, the president was complaining that he would like to see an increase. One can make a comparison with that of our own telephone service, in which the profit in 1950-51, the last year in which we made a surplus on the telephone service of any note, was 4.36 per cent. on the gross capital of the whole of the telephone service. There is a certain amount of comparison, even apart from that, in the fact that the number of telephones has increased in roughly the same proportion here and in America and that the number of conversations has increased in the same proportion.</P>
    <P>I shall have to ask the House to take my word for it as a person of some business experience and to bear with me in regard to this question of telephone charges.  I am very well aware that if it had been possible to maintain the charges at their present figure, I would have done that from the purely commercial standpoint, if I had thought that revenues would increase sufficiently to enable the telephone service to earn sufficient surplus to pay for the inevitable and universal losses on the telegraph service; but the increase in traffic would have to be so remarkable that I know it would be quite beyond reason that it could take place.</P>
    <P>I must have regard to the experience of my officers who have watched the <Col N="1294" /> traffic increase through the years, who experienced the increase in 1936 when charges were reduced but when the surplus equally went down, in spite of the prediction made at that time by some people that the surplus would increase in the ensuing year.  I must take their advice in regard to traffic predictions.  Their advice is, as I have said, that it is no use hoping that some fanciful suggestion could be adopted, such as that of leaving charges as they are, or even decreasing them, with a view to having a sufficient increase of traffic to earn the kind of surplus we need to pay for the losses in the telegraph service.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon may have been in rather a skittish mood when he referred to the poor character of trunk service in this country.</P>

      <P>If he has a complaint to make, I shall be glad if he will write to me in regard to any specific complaint he has concerning the trunk service, because I had 511 major exchanges contacted on April 30th and instructed to report what the character of the traffic had been for the whole of the day.  In connection with 511 major exchanges on April 30th, for the whole of that day, including the peak period, there were only 42 exchanges where delays of over half an hour were experienced.  I regard that as very remarkable progress.  It was that kind of progress that I wanted to see achieved before I made any recommendation for increases in charges.  It was progress of that kind that I wanted to see before asking the telephone subscribers to pay more for their service. There will be some subscribers who, even after the increased charges are levied from July next and who, in connection with rentals, will pay more in the October period, will still not obtain a first-class service.</P>

      <P>Perhaps some Deputies would like to hear some of the increases which have taken place in the costs of providing a telephone service. The ordinary telephone instrument has gone up by 370 per cent. since 1939; copper wire is up by 650 per cent.; bronze wire by 508 per cent.; lead-covered cable by 1,163 per cent.; switch-boards of various types by 204 to 210 per cent; 20-ft. light telephone poles by 280 per cent.; coin-collecting boxes by 254 per cent.; and automatic exchange equipment in general by about 258 per cent.  These figures will indicate the impossibility of maintaining the service at 25 per cent. above 1939 level.  No one can do it.  No genius, no Rockefeller, no financial wizard could maintain charges, bearing in mind that there are multifold new amenities and facilities being provided with materials whose cost has so vastly increased.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer now to one criticism I saw in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> to the effect that the subscriber pays a perpetual rent for a telephone which he has paid for many times over. That is a completely false argument. No telephone administration in the world provides a subscribers' telephone service on a sale outright basis. The subscriber is renting not an instrument only, but an exchange line running to an exchange which may be several miles away, equipment at the exchange which may alone cost up to £50 a line and the service required to keep that line in good working order for 24 hours a day.  I have already mentioned that the average capital cost of a subscriber's exchange line in Dublin has been estimated as about £130.  The interest on that sum alone, apart altogether from depreciation and maintenance costs, does not fall far short of the current rental of a residence line, so that there is absolutely no question whatever of the public being asked to pay many times over for their telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the criticism comes somewhat ill from a concern which increased its own service, its own paper, by 100 per <Col N="1296" /> cent. since 1939.  So far as telephone charges in future are concerned, we have tried to establish them at rates which will admit of some stability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister mind answering a question with regard to the matter he has mentioned?  If the rental is related to the cost I wonder would the Minister be good enough to tell me what do we pay the trunk fee for?  If I have already paid for the maintenance of my line, for what am I paying 2/9 thereafter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The custom in a number of countries, including our own, where this system of financing is adopted is that the rental pays for the capital charges, depreciation and the maintenance of the line and the operating charges pay for the mechanical operating costs and for the operators who transmit the messages.  At the present time there is a terrific deficit on the rental portion in that, very approximately, the annual charges on one Dublin instrument for rental, covering capital charges, depreciation and maintenance, should be £14 and it is or was, rather, until these new charges come into operation in October, £6 per year.  That is one of the difficulties we have had, one of the difficulties we have to overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not regard it as a good thing to alter frequently telephone charges.  We do not like to treat the subscribers in that way.  We regret having to increase charges.  Telephone charges, as the House well knows, have not been frequently altered.  I think I am right in saying that they were increased by 5 per cent. some time during the war and again by 25 per cent. in July, 1951, an increase that had been sanctioned by the last Government in April, 1951, and now they are being further increased.  We tried to fix the charges in such a way that we can look forward to a reasonable period of stability.  If the general value of the £ does not materially alter, if materials either go down in price or remain at their present levels, if the traffic shows the same kind of <Col N="1297" /> change as it has shown in the past years, if wages and salaries paid to the officers of the telephone section of the Department relate to, shall I say, general considerations affecting the profit on the service rather than to inflationary changes, we hope that they will not have to be increased in the foreseeable future.  I have had to mention a good many &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; because the £, willy nilly, has changed in value so often and if there should be another rearmanent rush and if lead-cover cable, which is already about 1,150 per cent. in price above the 1939 level goes up 2,000 per cent. on the 1939 level it would be very hard for me to say that there would not have to be another increase.  If a period of general stability, foreseen by the Minister for Finance and others as being at least a hope, takes place, I hope we shall not have to increase telephone charges again.</P>

      <P>Speaking in general about the increased charges, to my mind it would be absolutely fatal if we were to adopt Deputy Dockrell's suggestion that overall taxation should cover the deficit in the Post Office.  It would simply be an inducement to the uneconomic working of the service. Everyone knows the history, for example, of C.I.E., where, because of difficulties during the war and the fact that no matter what improvements were suggested the deficit continued to increase.  The deficit has reached now a point where no one knows how to meet it in its entirety.  Every inducement to economy in the service would be bound to disappear if this deficit was allowed to remain or if the habit grew of permitting deficits in the Department.  I think the officers of the Department are excellent men.  I and they are human like everyone else and if a large deficit became a permanent feature of the service, who could blame them or anyone else if the general atmosphere became, &ldquo;what does it matter?  It will be all swallowed up in the Budget.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was particularly for that reason that I wished to see the service paying for itself or coming to within a reasonable <Col N="1298" /> margin of paying for itself.  The charges were not increased, as I have already said, in 1952, because I wanted to see a marked increase in the &ldquo;no delay&rdquo; service in the telephone; I wanted to carry out a few more improvements in regard to establishing daily postal deliveries and, having achieved those objectives, having achieved the objective, for example, of ensuring that only 10 per cent. of all the delivery posts are now not daily, I then felt it was a right and proper thing to make the service pay for itself.</P>
    <P>As long as the service pays for itself and as long as everyone knows that the charges are supposed to meet expenses, there will be every inducement to the Minister of the day and to his officers to insist on innovations, to insist on high output, to insist on efficiency, to prevent the gradual seepage of unnecessary staff into the service. But, if there is going to be permitted a continuous deficit, rising and rising as time goes on, there will never be that inducement, and I could not expect men, however brilliant they may be, to keep on checking up on inefficiency, insisting on high efficiency, if they knew that the surplus would be swallowed up in the general vastness of the Budget because a surplus at no time would be a very large item compared with the whole of the Budget, but the deficit could be quite large enough to affect severely the mentality of all those in the service.  Nor could I ask the postmen who, I agree, work for very modest wages indeed and who are acclaimed by the whole community as people of courteous disposition, to undertake the services which they do, to be efficient, to do their cycling duty efficiently, to accept the tests imposed on them which ensure that each man does a sufficient number of deliveries in a day, if they knew all the time that there was always this slack that could be taken up in the Budget, that there was always a deficit that could be increased and that somehow or other the taxpayer would always see to it that they were left running along without any check upon their activities.</P>
    <P>My own belief is that very few businessmen <Col N="1299" /> would disagree with me in regard to this matter.  All I can do is to assure the House that every effort will be made to promote efficiency in the future as in the past.  To give some example of that&mdash;we have, as I have already indicated, what we call office organisation and methods officers who have been trained in business technique and who check upon the activities of the whole of the staff.  The officers of most of the sections have had the opportunity of giving a kind of overall examination at continuous intervals to the working of their particular departments.</P>
    <P>In the case of the telephone engineering section we have never been able to secure the services of sufficient electrical engineers.  There are not sufficient engineers coming from the universities to provide this country with all the engineers it requires allowing for those who by tradition or for their own personal reasons emigrate and, as a result, the officers who conduct the engineering branch of the service have never had an opportunity of making a very fundamental examination of the methods adopted in installing phones and in conducting the general operation of the telephone service.  I am insisting that they have that opportunity, that they have the most expert advice, in order to make sure that the very best work is being done because the actual fact is that the officers of that branch have been working so hard at overcoming the difficulties of the war period when supplies were not available, that they have not had the time and there have not been enough of them to take a long term view of the department.  They are now going to do so.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need give in great detail a comparison of the charges made for services in my Department with those made by other public utilities. But I notice here that in the case of two well known utilities, one of which makes a loss, and the other of which makes a very small profit, the increased charges are over 100 per cent. since 1939, compared with about 50 per cent. by which the charges are going up in the case of my Department. <Col N="1300" /> Another public utility has increased the charges by 55 per cent. in regard to one portion of its services and by 120 per cent. in regard to another charge made upon those who make use of it.  I mention these figures because they may be of interest to Deputies who think that the new charges are in any way excessive compared with those levied by other utilities or other companies in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need say very much about Deputies who advocated increased pay and increased services of a highly extravagant character and at the same time recommended that the charges should not be increased.  I think there is no need for me to deal with that matter in great detail.  One Deputy asked whether we have made any alteration in regard to the length of time for the amortisation of capital charges.  There has been no noticeable alteration in the last year.  Buildings are regarded as having a life of from 30 to 52 years.  Telephone apparatus is regarded as having a useful life of 20 years.  There is nothing exceptional in that.  As I said, there has been no particular change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy wants me to give again full details of the deficits which took place before any of these changes were noticed.  There was a deficit of £840,000 before the rate of interest went up.  Deputy Costello suggests that the deficit was actually increasing and asked why need we increase the charges.  There was a slight decrease between 1951-52 and the estimated deficit in 1953-54, largely because of the postal emergency stocks bought during the years 1950-51, which in actual fact, in so far as the postal section of the Department is concerned, are not put to capital account.  The telephone material is put to capital account, but stocks of equipment for the postal service have always been regarded as being on current account. It is because of the fact that postal emergency stocks have ceased to be bought that the deficit has very slightly <Col N="1301" /> decreased since the year 1951-52.  There has also been some increase in revenue.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made that there is some sort of plot between the Department of Finance and ourselves, whereby the charges that we make for Government services in setting out the commercial account, result in a sort of hidden profit to the Department of Finance.  All accounting for that is done in the Post Office.  The work is treated in rather a complicated way by having a set of units of value and we will receive this year something in the nature of £860,000 for doing Government work.  We believe that the estimation is fair.  If there should be any error in our method of accountancy, we believe it could not make any noticeable difference to the deficit.  In actual fact, we are making a special check this year to ensure that in setting out the accounts of the Department in commercial form we will have charged every Department in the fullest possible way for the services which we render to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether at this stage it is necessary for me to reply in detail to the many questions raised by Deputies of an unimportant character, questions in relation to the telephone services in various areas.  I will take at random a glance through the notes I have made and refer to some observations. Deputies complained of the waiting list for telephones.  I mentioned that the number of telephones installed last year was a record&mdash;7,234. Deputies may be interested to know that there is a waiting list in other countries, including the very efficient United States.  People have to wait for telephones in a great many countries of the world.  I am not going to clear off the list of waiting applicants until the trunk circuits have been still further improved, until all call offices in post offices have been installed.  It would be very tempting to decide to cut down the trunk circuits provided every year and to say: &ldquo;Why not take three years to complete all the call office installations&rdquo; knowing that the figure for waiting telephone subscribers would be wiped out.  I am not going to do it.  Equally, I found that for a considerable number of years the pressure <Col N="1302" /> upon the Department for installing subscriber lines in Dublin City has been so great that a lot of long-term maintenance and renewals are required in respect of cables in the city.  It is a tribute to the work of the engineers and the men in the Dublin section of the Department that, although the chief engineer said that he thought we would have to instal 500 fewer telephones in Dublin in a year in order to get that renewal and maintenance work done, for the first quarter of this year, in spite of the fact that gangs have been diverted, the men have worked so hard that we have managed to complete as many subscribers' installations as we were doing previously.</P>
    <P>One Deputy asked what the telephone density of this country was.  I have not the latest figures for the various countries of the world, but two or three years ago there were about three telephones per 100 people in this country compared with some 27 in Sweden and the United States.  We have a long way to go in installing the telephone system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan raised the question of deposits by subscribers and the fact that when telephone charges were increased new subscribers were asked to pay a higher deposit.  Discretion is exercised in regard to that matter.  We are having that side of the accounting section's activities examined and I can assure Deputies that everything will be done to avoid unnecessarily increasing deposits by subscribers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick raised the question of telephone services in the Mayo area. There is now a 12-channel carrier system between Dublin and Claremorris which is giving a no-delay service. My officers report to me that there is now a no-delay service between Castlebar, Westport and Claremorris because a three-channel carrier system has been installed or is about to be installed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure. The improvement is either actual or imminent.  I think it is actual in regard to the Castlebar-Westport ser-sur <Col N="1303" /> vice.  Deputy Palmer referred to the problem of ensuring what might be described as an emergency service, and suggested the installation of more kiosks.  I am afraid the installation of kiosks everywhere would be fatal to the finances of the telephone service. The actual charges for maintaining a kiosk are very considerable.  We have to instal them where we believe they will be economic.  If local authorities consider that a kiosk is urgently required and if neither the Garda emergency telephone services at night nor the telephone service of sub-postmasters or sub-postmistresses, which is available in the ordinary way, are conveniently at hand, then a kiosk can be erected and the local authority can agree to pay the difference between what is received in the coin-box and the actual annual maintenance and capital charges should there be a deficit.  In general, there are very few complaints in regard to what can be called the emergency service requirements of the telephone section of my Department, and I think that is highly satisfactory. I shall always be glad to have any complaints in that regard.  Wherever the Guards have ceased to occupy Garda stations at night we have made alternative arrangements.  The post offices in that case are ready to make their 'phones available after closing hours for emergency purposes.  Where such arrangements cannot be made local authorities are at liberty to have subsidised kiosks where such are considered desirable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde asked that some of the smaller exchanges should have the telephone service open until a late hour at night.  As the House may have noticed we have made that concession in order to encourage people who wish to phone after their day's work and have hitherto been deprived of the opportunity of doing so because of the fact that there was an insufficient number of telephones connected with the local exchange.  In future, if there are five and up to nine telephones connected to an exchange the service will continue until ten o'clock at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton made several references to the general condition of Post <Col N="1304" /> Office buildings.  As I intimated in reply to him, the estimated expenditure in the present year under the Department's building programme amounts to £157,000 and that does not take account of minor works of maintenance or minor schemes of alterations which will be carried out.  It is my resolve that we should press forward with the programme of reconstruction and new building until the accommodation in all post offices is sufficient for the reasonable requirements of both the public and the staff.</P>
    <P>In regard to the new sorting office, the site for which has been purchased in Sally Gardens, the officers of the Department are at the moment engaged in a close study of the requirements of the new building and we will press forward with it as quickly as we can.  We shall have to study the methods used in various countries before we officially decide what kind of sorting machinery to employ.  There have been enormous advances in the methods used to sort parcels by mechanical means and we want to do the very best we can.  I cannot promise that the building will be open very shortly but we will press forward with the formulation of plans as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton referred to the cleaning of mail bags. We are at the moment cleaning mail bags in the most economic way.  The question of installing machinery for this purpose will be considered when the new sorting office is available.  The return of surplus bags after the expiration of the Christmas pressure period enables us to have bags that are particularly dirty cleaned.  I think that should go far to answer Deputy Norton's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He referred also to the early attendances of postmen in the rural areas, and he suggested that they were unnecessary. I think Deputy Norton exaggerated the hour at which the average countryman gets up.  In any event the postman must start early on his route if he is to finish early.  If <Col N="1305" /> he starts late the last person to receive mail will surely complain.  On the whole, I think, that a 7.30 a.m. commencement of rural delivery is not unreasonable, and I think Deputy Norton spoke too much of the somnolent habits of the rural community. I think he exaggerated the position.</P>
    <P>He referred also to the small number of part-time posts in the postal service&mdash;Deputy Brennan and Deputy Cunningham also made that point&mdash; up-graded during the past year.  We have been carrying out rural revision schemes to ensure an earlier delivery and a later collection where possible. At the same time we have endeavoured to provide full-time employment where possible.  We find it very difficult to increase the number of full-time posts without adversely affecting existing part-time officers.  In motorising the mail service to sub-offices the tendency is that full-time service in these offices ceases to be necessary, and it is only with difficulty in some cases that we have been able to maintain the full content of existing full-time posts in certain areas.  I will press on the officials of my Department the desirability of increasing the number of full-time posts and increasing proportionately, wherever it is possible, the number of fully-established postmen.  I believe it is absolutely essential we should do that. Nevertheless, we have to have regard to the difficulties in making changes in the mail services and at the same time up-grading part-time posts.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the low rate of remuneration of sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses.  I do not think I need say very much on that matter.  Some of them are able to get extra sales through their small retail businesses.  Others are not so successful. In regard to 2,005 small post offices the average income until recent increases were granted was £222 per annum.  I agree that some have a very low contract arrangement, as low as £50 in some cases, but the average is £222.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton also referred to difficulties in regard to the staff in the registered letter office section in <Col N="1306" /> Dublin.  I am advised the difficulties are exaggerated.  Staffing is now fully adequate for requirements and there should be no complaint with regard to that matter in the future.</P>
    <P>He also asked that the Saturday staff should be given more facilities for leave on Saturday evening.  We do all we can in regard to that matter but we have to bear in mind the fact that the night mails come through on Saturday evening and there are also late evening collections to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>One Deputy asked if postmen were permitted to use motor-cycles or auto-cycles. They are permitted to use them subject to certain conditions, which are regarded as reasonable, that have to be fulfilled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>If the route is not dangerous for motor-cycle work; the duty must be performed by ordinary cycle if for any reason permission to use a motor-cycle may be withdrawn; the scheduled time of starting and departing from sub-offices, wall boxes and other collection points must be strictly adhered to and deliveries on the route must be made, as far as possible at the same time each day; insurance premiums must be paid regularly and the motor-cycles must be maintained in sound mechanical condition. In actual fact there has not been very much demand so far as I know for that facility.</P>

I would like to conclude by thanking those Deputies who paid a sincere tribute to the working of the services.  I would like equally to conclude by saying once again that it will be a very bad day for this country when the deficit of my Department can be swallowed up in the vastness of the Budget.  It is absolutely essential for the efficiency of the service and for maintaining a keen and watchful attitude on the part of all the staff from the highest to the lowest, that the service should be made to pay for itself.  The increases which have been notified are the lowest that can be imposed. They have been imposed with a view to ensuring that at least a major part of the deficit can be wiped out in the coming financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,256,620 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1954, for the Defence Forces (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for certain Expenses under the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939 and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946 (No. 21 of 1939 and No. 28 of 1946); for Expenses in connection with the issue of Medals, etc.; for Expenses of the Bureau of Military History; and for a Grant-in-Aid of the Irish Red Cross Society (No. 32 of 1938).</P>
      <P>The gross Estimate for 1953-54 in respect of defence is £8,044,920 and, after anticipated Appropriations-in-Aid have been deducted, the net total is £7,884,920, which is an increase of £1,381,350 on the original net Estimate for 1952-53.  Taking into account, however, the sum of £715,000 voted by way of two Supplementary Estimates, the net increase over the total amount voted for 1952-53 is £666,350.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has always been the case, a considerable proportion of the gross total provided for relates to the pay, allowances and maintenance of the members of the permanent force.  The provision in those regards over the various sub-heads amounts to £4,015,231 or almost 50 per cent. of the total gross Estimate. The Estimate has been prepared on the basis of the Peace Establishment of 12,743 all ranks, made up of 1,271 officers and 11,472 other ranks.  The force is at present 130 officers below strength, but 29 cadets will be commissioned this year, a further 35 are <Col N="1311" /> in training and it is proposed to recruit 36 this year.  Up to the present, the Establishment has also not been filled as regards other ranks, but recruitment continues and the Estimate was framed on the assumption that it would be possible to reach full strength by about the beginning of July.  Whether our hopes in that respect will be realised is not certain, because the response to the current recruiting drive has not, so far, been at all as great as was the response to last year's campaign. Nevertheless, the drive will continue since, as has so often been stated in this House, it is the Government's defence policy that the full Establishment figure should be reached and maintained, not only because that figure is the smallest around which an emergency Army could be successfully built but also because a full and regular flow of trained men from the permanent force on to the First Line Reserve is absolutely necessary if that component of the Reserve is itself to be maintained at a strength which would make it of value in the event of mobilisation at any time becoming necessary.</P>
    <P>The increase in the strength of the permanent force during the last year, and the influx of recruits, has done much to restore a feeling of realism to Army organisation and training.  Training has progressed considerably, and the health and morale of the troops have been excellent.</P>
    <P>In the case of the First Line Reserve, provision is made for a sum of £70,406 in respect of pay, allowances and maintenance. This is a reduction of £13,459 on last year's figure, occasioned by the fact that the number to be provided for is only 3,304 all ranks, as against 4,790 last year.  This position arises, of course, from the fact that those who were placed on the First Line Reserve at the end of the emergency are gradually becoming timeexpired, while the flow from the permanent force to the Reserve which will in due course eventuate from the recent recruiting campaigns has not yet begun to make itself appreciably felt. The present strength of the First Line Reserve will naturally be a matter for <Col N="1312" /> regret on the part of all who remember the value of its counterpart&mdash;the old Class A Reserve&mdash;when mobilisation took place in the early stages of the last emergency, and must bring home to everybody the wisdom of the Government's and the Army authorities' desire to build up this Reserve by way of the transfer of trained personnel who have completed their time in the permanent force.</P>
    <P>This year's provision in respect of the Second Line Reserve, which includes An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muiri, amounts to £198,380, as compared with last year's £227,156. Here, again, it would be idle to pretend that I am satisfied with the effective strength of this component of the Reserve or with the attendance at annual camps and training.  Undoubtedly, it is much more satisfactory to have a low effective strength of good quality than to have an illusory strength figure of which a large proportion merely represents non-effectives. Efforts to build up the Second Line and to improve attendances at training will, however, continue and, in the latter connection, provision is made for the first time for the payment of married rates of pay and marriage allowance to officers and men, respectively, in respect of attendance at annual training.  This will put them in the same position as officers and men of the First Line.</P>
    <P>Having thus dealt with the various components of the Defence Forces, I may turn to some other important features of the Estimate.  First, I should like to deal with the provision at sub-head P in respect of defensive equipment.  On the occasion of the debate on the recent Supplementary Estimate, I was able to inform the House that the position with regard to the supply of defensive equipment had improved and that it had been found possible to negotiate and place very substantial contracts for material of the most up-to-date and valuable nature.  In all, it is anticipated that a sum of £1,800,000 will be spent during the financial year 1953-1954 on defensive equipment.  The gross sum of £4,519,430 takes into account orders which have already been placed or <Col N="1313" /> which may be placed during the financial year, but the rate of delivery will result in a carry-forward of the sum of £2,719,430 to the next or subsequent financial years.  As I mentioned in connection with the Supplementary Estimate.  the amount proposed to be spent on defensive equipment may appear large, but a heavy leeway has to be made up, and it is absolutely essential that we should do everything possible to provide for the Army equipment of the nature it would require in the event of our country being attacked, and suitable to the conditions under which it would have to fight.</P>
    <P>I may next refer to civil defence. The gross estimated requirement for civil defence as shown in sub-head P (1) is £86,139 but, as it is not anticipated that all the equipment ordered will become available within the year, a deduction of £30,000 has been made, leaving the net provision at £56,139.  I am glad to say that civil defence is making definite progress and that, even though development is necessarily slow, we have made considerable strides towards attaining our preliminary objective, the establishment of the nucleus of a civil defence organisation in the cities and principal towns of the country.  The civil defence officers appointed are at present engaged in surveying their areas in accordance with instructions issued by the Department with a view to preparing plans to meet the particular problems which may arise in their own areas.</P>
    <P>Since the Civil Defence School opened in 1951, five administrative courses and six courses of instruction have been held and up to date 110 of those who attended the courses of instruction have received certificates as qualified civil defence instructors. We purchased during the year a number of rescue vehicles which are used for training at the school, and it is hoped to purchase more of these vehicles this year.  We also intend buying general equipment for local training. The rescue training range at the school which was completed during the year has been favourably commented upon by experts, and has been of great assistance in training generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1314" /> I think it might now be for the convenience of the House if, before concluding, I went through the sub-heads which show an appreciable upward or downward trend as compared with last year's figures.  I will not comment on the sub-heads which show no great differences, but if any points are raised on those sub-heads, I will deal with them as far as possible in the course of my closing remarks.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A shows an increase of £204,109 over last year's figure.  I have already explained this when I pointed out that the actual strength is now closer to peace establishments than it has been and that the Estimate has been framed on the basis that the peace establishment figure may be reached during the year.  Thus, the deduction in respect of numbers below strength is lower than heretofore, and this mainly accounts for the increase.</P>
    <P>The increase of £10,014 under sub-head B in respect of marriage allowance is due mainly to an amendment of regulations which reduced the age and period of qualifying service for the admission of soldiers to the married establishment and which, therefore, has resulted, and will continue to result, in greater numbers being admitted.  The increase of £9,374 in sub-head C arises almost entirely from increased rates of remuneration for the civilian employees attached to the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>As regards sub-head J it has been decided to renew all the Army vehicles over a period of five years.  Some of the present vehicles have long passed their economic life and would be of little use in an emergency.  Provision is made, therefore, under sub-head J for renewal this year of approximately one-fifth of the vehicles.  The sub-head shows an increase of £49,125 which is due to the proposed purchase of the new vehicles and to the fact that, for the first time, because of recent legislation, provision has had to be made for a sum of £25,000 in respect of road tax for Army vehicles.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £130,989 under sub-head K for provisions and allowances in lieu which is caused by <Col N="1315" /> the increased strengths to which I have already referred and to the increase in the cost of foodstuffs.  There is also an increase of £122,034 in sub-head M &mdash;Clothing and Equipment.  This arises from the proposed purchase of reserve stocks in continuation of the policy of building up, over a number of years, an adequate reserve to meet the situation which would arise in the event of a sudden emergency, necessitating mobilisation and extensive recruitment.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with sub-head P &mdash;Defensive Equipment&mdash;and sub-head P (1)&mdash;Civil Defence.  Sub-head P (2)&mdash; Naval Service&mdash;shows an increase of £102,582, partly attributable to increased strengths and partly to anticipated increased expenditure on naval vessels and to a proposed purchase, at a cost of £30,000, of a reserve stock of 2,500 tons of fuel oil for Haulbowline. A reserve was not maintained up to the present owing to lack of accommodation for tankers at the jetty.  The 21-foot jetty has now been completed, thus enabling tankers to deliver fuel oil into the main storage tanks at Haulbowline.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to improve the accommodation at Baldonnel Aerodrome and provision is made under sub-head T for £28,000 to meet the cost of extra land required for the purpose.  This accounts for the bulk of the increase of £30,544 shown under this sub-head.</P>
    <P>The increase of £25,995 under sub-head W is due to the increased rate of contributions under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  Provision is also made for paying insurance contributions for officers and nurses who were not previously insurable.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that a sum of £5,000 is provided by way of Grant-in-Aid to the Irish Red Cross Society as compared with £40,000 last year.  Of the latter amount, £20,000 was, it will be remembered, voted specially by way of a Supplementary Estimate last February for the relief of distress. The Grant-in-Aid for other purposes last year was, therefore, £20,000.  As I stated when introducing the Defence <Col N="1316" /> Estimate last year, the Irish Red Cross Society, at the request of the then Minister for Defence, early in 1950 introduced a recruiting drive and a general reorganisation which included the building-up of emergency hospital supplies, uniforms and accessories. These activities are closely related to national defence.  The society was not able to meet the exceptional expenditure involved from its own resources, but the stage has now been reached when it is anticipated that a State subvention of £5,000 only will be required this year.</P>
    <P>The only other sub-head to which I think I need particularly refer is sub-head R-Fuel, etc.&mdash;which shows a very substantial reduction of £58,288. This is being achieved by the proposed use of certain reserve stocks of coal. That brings my survey of the Estimate to a conclusion.  There is, I think, no more for me to say than that the increases, which are necessary, are directed to improving the capacity of the Defence Forces in regard to strength, training and equipment. Nothing has happened during the past year, nor is there any real indication that anything is likely to happen, which would make it anything but imprudent for the Government to relax its efforts to ensure that the efficiency and preparedness of the Army continue to be maintained at the highest pitch.</P>

      <P>It has been customary to move most of the Votes together. The Minister has only moved the Defence Forces Estimate itself. There is still the Estimate for Army Pensions.  It is customary to move both together.  Is the Minister taking them separately now?</P>

      <P>As regards the Estimate for Army Pensions, I should like to invite the attention of the House to the fact that, for the first time, the Estimate exceeds £1,000,000.  I should also like to mention that while it includes provision, as far as the year 1953-54 is concerned, for the anticipated increased expenditure on military service pensions arising from the recently enacted Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Act, 1953, it does not provide for the arrears on these pensions in respect of the period 1st January, 1953, to the 31st March, 1953.  Neither does it include any provision for the benefits provided by the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act, 1953, or for those which will result from the Army Pensions Bill, 1953, and from a forthcoming Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme.  I will have to come to the House later this year with a Supplementary Estimate in these regards.  On present indications, the Supplementary Estimate will be of the order of £200,000 to £250,000.  That point, therefore, is one to be borne in mind in considering and discussing the present Estimate.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, the Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Act, 1953, and the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Act, 1953, became law during March, and I am glad to say that the increased pensions under those Acts are now being paid and that the arrears up to the 31st March last have been included in the March payments made to the pensioners.  The Army Pensions Bill, 1953, unfortunately proved more difficult in preparation than was expected, but I now hope to be able to circulate it in the near future, and also to lay before the House the Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Scheme which I have already mentioned and which is now, too, almost ready.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Estimate itself, there is not, I think, in these circumstances a great deal for me to say.  The smaller sub-heads are self-explanatory and, on the <Col N="1318" /> whole, show little or no variation from the amounts provided last year.  I will, therefore, confine my remarks to the five main sub-heads&mdash;E and F, which relate to wound and disability pensions, gratuities and allowances under the Army Pensions Acts: I, which relates to military service pensions; J, which relates to retired pay, pensions and gratuities under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, and O, which relates to special allowances.</P>
    <P>Sub-heads E and F each show a slight decrease on last year's figures but, as I have said, these sub-heads take no account of the increases in pensions and allowances which will arise under the Army Pensions Bill, 1953.  The amounts which will actually be expended under the sub-heads will, therefore, show a very substantial increase, which will have to be met by way of Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The provision under sub-head I represents an increase of £233,990 in respect of military service pensions. This is because of the increases under the recent Act but, as I have pointed out, provision has not been made for the arrears in respect of the quarter which ended on the 31st March last and which will have to be covered by Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Sub-head J shows an increase of £21,430 in respect of retired pay and pensions under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, which relate to retired and discharged members of the permanent force, and to the retired members of the Chaplaincy Service and the Army Nursing Service.  That increase, however, merely covers the additional numbers expected to become eligible for retired pay, pensions or gratuities during the present financial year.  The forthcoming amending scheme will necessitate still further provision which will, as I have said, have to be made by way of Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The position as regards sub-head O&mdash; Special Allowances&mdash;is similar.  Here again, the increase&mdash;£40,807&mdash;provided for over last year's figure covers only the additional number of special allowances which would normally be likely to be granted in the course of the financial <Col N="1319" /> year.  Certain increases in the rates of special allowances to which I referred when speaking on the Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Bill and certain improvements in the means test which I will announce in connection with the Army Pensions Bill, will result in still further increased costs which again will have to be provided for in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there is anything further which I have to explain in connection with the Estimate nor need I embark on any general discussion of the pensions position.  We have already had an opportunity of discussing military service pensions fully when considering the recent Act and will have a similar opportunity, if required, as regards disablement pensions and allowances and Defence Forces pensions in connection with the forthcoming <Col N="1320" /> measures.  I would merely again refer to the fact that, as compared with last year's Estimate of a little short of £1,000,000, this year's, with the necessary Supplementary Estimate, will be in the region of £1,500,000.  That, I think, is the best indication of the Government's desire to be as fair as possible to the pensioners concerned, regard being had to all the other present demands on the public purse.</P>

      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.25 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 7th May, 1953.</P>
