      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is prepared to make a statement on the consideration that has been given since 1922 to the questions of (a) the erection of new buildings for the centralised accommodation of the Houses of the Oireachtas and of Government Departments, and (b) in particular, the provision of improved accommodation on the Dublin Castle site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (for the Taoiseach) Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>A joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas set up in July, 1923, recommended that a commission should be appointed at an early opportunity to inquire and report as to suitable and available sites for the permanent housing of the Oireachtas.  A second joint committee set up in January, 1924, recommended that Leinster House should be taken over for the temporary accommodation of the Oireachtas upon the distinct understanding that Leinster House would be vacated at the earliest possible date consistent with the acquisition of a permanent home for the Oireachtas.  Resolutions agreeing with the latter recommendation were, at the instance of the then Executive Council, adopted by both Houses in July, 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January, 1934, the then Executive Council approved the recommendations of a Cabinet Committee to the effect that plans should be prepared for the construction, according as the demands for office accommodation required or as labour was set free from more vital constructional work, of new buildings <Col N="1246" /> for the Oireachtas and certain Government Departments on a site in the Merrion Square area.  While the preparatory work for the purpose of taking the necessary legislative and other steps to give effect to the recommendations of the committee was still in progress the need for concentrating the efforts of the Office of Public Works on arterial drainage arose, and the Executive Council decided, in March, 1937, that the work on drainage should take priority and proceed immediately and that the scheme of new Government buildings should be postponed.</P>
    <P>In 1943 the matter was considered afresh by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Planning in connection with the need for making provision for the possibility of the return from Britain after the war of large numbers of Irish workers, and the Government, in December, 1944, decided in principle that a joint committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas should be set up to investigate the question of a suitable site for new Oireachtas and administrative buildings.  Shortly before this, it had become clear that the selection of a site in the Merrion Square area would present grave difficulties in view of the existing interests that would be disturbed if such a site were chosen. In March, 1945, the Government approved provisionally, in broad principle, draft terms of reference for the proposed joint committee and arranged that the Minister for Finance would initiate preliminary discussions with representatives of the various Parties in the Dáil with a view to obtaining their reactions to the proposal as a whole and, if the reactions were favourable, to reaching agreement as to procedure, etc.</P>
    <P>The leader of the principal Opposition Party, when consulted by the Minister for Finance on the matter on the 26th March, 1945, expressed personal opposition to the proposal but intimated that he would consult his colleagues and communicate again with the Minister; no such communication was, however, received.  The proposal to bring the matter of a joint committee before both Houses was <Col N="1247" /> thereupon withdrawn by the Government, and, instead, the Government decided, in August, 1946, that the Minister for Finance should set up an inter-departmental committee to advise him in regard to the provision of accommodation for Government Departments.  The committee had not concluded its inquiry when the change of administration took place in February, 1948, and I understand that its work was then brought to an end.</P>
    <P>So far as the first part of the Deputy's question is concerned, the position, then, is that, while a decision was taken by the Executive Council in January, 1934, in regard to the planning of the scheme for new Oireachtas and Government buildings, that scheme was postponed in March, 1937, in favour of drainage work, and, while the matter was further considered during the years 1943 to 1946, at no time was any particular scheme or plan finally approved by the Government, nor were any commitments of any kind entered into for the acquisition of property or the erection of buildings in connection with any such scheme.</P>
    <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, relating to Dublin Castle, the position is that, in July, 1946, the Government approved, in principle, certain recommendations made by the Commissioners of Public Works on the subject of the reconstruction and development of the Castle site.  The outline scheme prepared at the time by the commissioners contemplated the retention and improvement of the central block of the existing buildings round the Upper and Lower Castle Yards and the utilisation of the remainder of the Castle site for the erection, over a period of some 20 years, of modern office buildings capable, when the work was eventually completed, of housing a staff of 4,000 persons, as compared with 1,170 who were then housed in the Castle.  A certain amount of the planning and other preliminary work in connection with one section of the reconstruction work had been done when, in November, 1948, the then Government decided that the proposals for the reconstruction <Col N="1248" /> of the Castle should not be proceeded with pending the giving of further instructions by the Government.  No such further instructions were given, but, as the Minister for Finance indicated to the Deputy recently in this House, the Minister hopes to be in a position to take steps to put the work in hand again as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>As regards the model of the Castle scheme referred to by Deputy MacEoin in this House on the 11th instant, I find that the actual cost was £148 5s., and not £600, as stated by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The general position regarding accommodation for Government offices in Dublin is, and has been for many years, highly unsatisfactory, many of the premises occupied being old, badly planned, wasteful in space and unhealthy for the occupants; this applies in particular to the Castle buildings, very few of which were ever intended to be used as offices.  The need for the centralisation of Government offices, in the interests both of the convenience of the public and of efficient administration, is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that there are at present no less than 61 private houses scattered throughout the city in the occupation of some 2,000 members of the staffs of various Government Departments.</P>
    <P>None of these schemes was ever contemplated otherwise than as one for execution over a long period of time; the intention was that the schemes should be subordinated, in regard to finance, supplies and available labour, to urgent needs of housing, hospitals, schools, etc.; the underlying idea was to have available a comprehensive plan which could be carried out, section by section, according as needs might dictate or other considerations suggest, over such a period of time as circumstances might determine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to say that the Government's plans had reached so concrete a form that they constituted an obstacle to the completion of the Dublin City planning scheme and that Sir, Patrick Abercrombie swore in court yesterday that that <Col N="1249" /> was one of the reasons it had been impossible to complete the scheme for the Dublin Corporation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell us how all this work of the committee which has been enumerated by his Parliamentary Secretary was done gratuitously, because the Taoiseach will remember that last week when we told him that this matter had cost money he told us we were telling an untruth?  If the work was not done gratuitously, will the Taoiseach now withdraw the unjust, unfair and unreliable imputations which he made last week?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know exactly the terms of what I said before I withdraw anything.  If, however, I have said anything wrong or anything that is not in accordance with the facts, I unhesitatingly withdraw it.  The suggestion all the time was that there had been considerable sums of money spent on this scheme.  There has been no such expenditure, as is indicated in the reply.  There have been, of course, officers of the Departments concerned engaged in the consideration of the proposals and the preparation of plans.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Everything done in the Departments, including the preparation of data, costs money.  All those things that are necessary in order that public works should be undertaken cost the time of individuals and, therefore, in the final result, cost money.  There is no doubt about it.</P>

Needless to say, any definite proposals which may be submitted for the setting up of an industry in Listowel will be carefully examined.  The Undeveloped Areas Act applies to County Kerry and, consequently, any group interested in a new industrial undertaking in the Listowel area could approach Foras Tionscal for assistance under the provisions of that Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Acceptance of the Deputy's suggestion would involve the recruitment of additional staffs and I am not satisfied that any benefits that might result from the payment of pensions at shorter intervals would justify the appreciable extra expenditure involved at a time when reduction in administrative costs is essential.  I might add that, following representations by the Deputy, arrangements were made in 1945 to allow Civil Service pensions which did not exceed £4 per week to be paid twice monthly where the pensioner so desired but only about one in four of the pensioners then affected chose to take advantage of the concession.</P>

      <P>Unemployment benefit is not normally payable here in respect of contributions for unemployment insurance <Col N="1256" /> paid in Great Britain.  Reciprocal arrangements for unemployment benefit have, however, been made with Great Britain.

Is <Col N="1262" /> it true that that information was furnished to the live-stock exporters and to the packers?  Is it true that they put men out buying lambs on the fairs and in the fields from farmers who had no knowledge of that bonus and, consequently, sold their lambs £1 cheaper?

      <P>Perhaps this would be the most appropriate time for me to ask the Minister for some information which I think he might be in a position to give us and which we should have before we pass this Money Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the debate on the <Col N="1265" /> Second Reading of this Bill, the Minister mentioned a proposal to erect four generating stations in, I think, four of the western counties for the purpose of using surplus hand-won turf.  Of course, the Minister stressed that the proposal to erect those four smaller stations was more of a social than an economic one.  Before we pass this Money Resolution I think the Minister should give us some indication as to what it is estimated each of these four additional stations will cost.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to go as far as anybody to provide a market for hand-won turf, particularly in the areas which the Minister has outlined, but the question of the capital cost of the stations themselves and what I would imagine to be&mdash;speaking without any technical knowledge of it&mdash;the fairly heavy cost of the overhead transmission from them might be much greater than would be justified or&mdash;let me put it another way&mdash;there might be a cheaper way of conveying or using the surplus hand-won turf in those areas.  However, that will depend to a very large extent if not entirely on the estimated cost of those stations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Money Resolution for the provision of money for the development of turf, I should like to direct the attention of the House to certain facts that appear to me never to have been discussed adequately in this House.</P>
      <P>In December, 1921, a report was published on peat by a Commission of Inquiry into the Resources of Ireland. The report was signed by the late Professor Hugh Ryan, who was chairman of the commission, by Joseph Connolly, Thomas Dillon, Maurice Moore, J.P. O'Shea, Roger Sweetman, Robert N. Tweedy and Henry Walsh.  The late Mr. Darrell Figgis was the secretary. At, paragraph 107, on page 31 of that report, the attention of the Oireachtas is directed to the following facts:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Apart from the use of peat for generating and power, its use has occasionally been proposed for a great variety of purposes.  It has been employed for the manufacture of paper, clothes, carpets, antiseptic bandages.  It has been converted into <Col N="1266" /> a roofing and building material for houses, into a thermal insulator for ice stores, into a sound damper for telephone boxes, into a packing material for vegetables, fruit, eggs, fish and manures.  It has been used for the filtration of oils, and for the manufacture of foodstuff (peat molassine meal).  A brown pigment has been got from it, and, finally, attempts have been made to prepare from it a tanning solution similar to that got from brown coal.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, over and above that, at an earlier stage, this same report states that peat has been used, and was being used, for the generation of power in the form of pulverised peat in the 19th century.  What puzzles me a little about all this is that, listening to much of what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said to us, you would imagine that the procedures for using pulverised turf were of relatively recent development and that the available information about the processes employed was hard to come by. According to this report, these operations have been going on for close on 55 years.</P>
    <P>Is it not queer that, when you go down to the Library of Oireachtas Éireann to inform yourself of the research work that has ensued on these operations 55 years ago, and search the index of the Oireachtas Library, there is not a single reference in the Oireachtas Library to turf?  There is one reference to peat&mdash;which is the report from which I have just now been reading an extract.  Surely there must be a very large volume of subsequent information available arising out of the user of turf for these various purposes since they were first initiated, and surely that information ought to be gathered for the information of the Oireachtas and made available to those who are interested in the matter for perusal in some readily accessible form?</P>
    <P>There is one user of turf which strikes me as being one that would be and, I assume, has been investigated, but which I have never heard discussed here, and that is the gasification of turf. I know that in America they think nothing of piping methane gas, derived <Col N="1267" /> directly from the soil, thousands of miles and, quite commonly, hundreds of miles.  I observe that the gasification of turf for the immediate vicinity of a bog not only makes gas for stationary engines available but also provides a fairly wide range of by-products that could be further processed into very useful commodities for sale here or abroad.  The reason I am consternated that these things have not more fully been ventilated here is that it suggests itself to me that possibly further work on these kinds of operations has revealed that it is impracticable&mdash;but it does not seem from this report that, in our circumstances, the gasification of turf could be deemed to be impracticable.  I should be interested to hear from the Minister whether any active project on these lines is being pursued. If there is, might I appeal to him, instead of erecting a gas plant as big as the White City, to establish a pilot unit where whatever procedure we think most likely to succeed could be tried out and amended and adjusted before an immense capital investment of a permanent character is undertaken?</P>
    <P>In paragraph 22 of this report&mdash;and it is to be borne in mind that this report is now 30 years old&mdash;it is stated that, in the judgment of this commission&mdash;and it was a very good commission&mdash;the most efficient method of developing power from peat is that of the producer and gas engine.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister could conveniently tell us whether he has studied the 19th recommendation of this report, which is dealt with in further detail in paragraph 315.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>For the draining of bogs. I am sure that nobody wants unduly to restrict me, but surely one of these purposes is the purpose of using turf to generate electricity.  In that connection, I want to refer, with specific reference to the user of turf for the generation of electricity, to paragraph 177.  I suppose this has special reference to the Bangor-Erris project, but it may be adapted to any of the stations where it is proposed to use turf.  The paragraph says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The use of peat dust or pulverised peat for firing furnaces was introduced by J. Ekelund in 1910 and a factory for the manufacture of peat powder was erected by the Aktiebolaget Torf at Back, in Sweden, in that year.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> The report then goes on to describe how pulverised peat was prepared and used in great detail and goes on further to say that there were 10,000 Swedish tons of this material annually used in firing these stations.  In paragraph 179, the report says that the Swedish Government, in 1914, used pulverised peat for locomotives on the railways and that the process was subsequently extended to Rühemäki, in Finland.  Paragraph 182 contains this remarkable finding:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the Swedish trials, it was found that the steam pressure would be maintained as easily with peat powder as with coal while the superheating was greater&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two ways in which turf can be used to fire a station.  We can carry the turf, as we are doing at present, in sods from Ballaghaderreen to Portarlington or fire the station with pulverised peat, if it is adapted for that purpose.  Is it in the slightest degree outside the strictest bounds of relevancy and order to discuss various methods of using the turf to be developed with this money?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, the Bill sets out to empower Bord na Móna to do certain things and we are providing the money to enable them to do these certain things. Whether we should do that or not is the matter before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>To develop bogs for the production of turf for the production of power&mdash;is that not the purpose of the Resolution?  We can produce turf in sods: we can produce turf mechanically and by hand-won methods: and we can produce pulverised turf.  What puzzles me is the fact that there is a great deal of relevant and carefully sifted scientific fact contained in this report.  Not one syllable of this has ever been brought to the attention of Oireachtas Éireann, so far as I know. What is in this report is 30 years old and there must be a mountain of stuff which has developed out of what was <Col N="1270" /> known in 1910.  Yet I think it is true to say that perfectly well-intentioned and well-informed persons call in question at present the fact that you can use pulverised peat to fire electricity generating stations.  That puzzles me, and I think the Minister does us less than justice if, in bespeaking a substantial investment of this kind, he will not furnish Oireachtas Éireann with what seems to me to be the vitally relevant information which I cannot get by reference to the Library but which I cannot doubt he has somewhere.</P>
      <P>Did any Deputy know that they were firing electricity generating stations with pulverised peat in Sweden 40 years ago?  Did any Deputy know that 50 years ago they were making gas out of turf and a wide range of by-products?  Can any Deputy now compare the relative merits for me of coal coke as opposed to dried and anhydrous turf or turf dust?  Surely it is reasonable to expect that before Oireachtas Éireann makes up its mind on questions of this character the Minister would at least give us the benefit of his views on the relative merits of these several procedures?  I will be quite frank; I did not know this until I rooted it out for myself and I do not think that ordinary Deputies should be left in that position.  How many Deputies have had this report out and have read it?  I do not think anybody knew it was in the Oireachtas Library but myself.  There is a lot of information in it and to me what is peculiarly interesting, most of it is 40 to 50 years old.  But there is more information in that 30-year-old report than in anything I have read in any of the annual reports of Bord na Móna or than anything I have read or heard of what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said in connection with this Bill or any previous development Bill.  I turn then to the Minister's original White Paper which he circulated when the first Turf Development Bill was brought in and from the first paragraph of it to the last there is no reference to the fact that that report is in existence at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider the desirability of doing this for us, <Col N="1271" /> taking the various methods for the user of turf advocated in the 27 recommendations of that report, and to let us have at his convenience a note informing us in a White Paper or some other suitable publication what 30 years' further inquiry has revealed in respect of these several proposals, and in respect of those where further development towards practicality has materialised, a more copious note as to what the development has been.</P>
    <P>In that regard I would speak with special reference to the user of pulverised peat as recorded in Sweden in 1910 and of the coking of peat and the user and processing of the by-products of that process.  I would ask the Minister to reassure the House that the relative values of these peat procedures will be fully considered not only by Bord na Móna but by himself with whatever consultants he cares to employ before irrevocable decisions are taken to invest very large capital sums in one particular method of the user of turf for generating power.</P>
    <P>I take it that on the Minister's estimate, we will, perhaps, have an opportunity of discussing the general question of turf user in a wider relevance than appears to be proper on this Money Resolution but, even in the restricted relevance of this Resolution, I would be grateful if the Minister would conveniently say a word on the matters to which I have referred, arising out of that report in 1921.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dillon is somewhat mistaken in regard to the amount of reference to peat development that may be found in the Dáil Library.  If he were to look up the Official Reports in the Library of Dáil Debates he would find very extensive references to peat and he would be able, I think, to quote very long-winded statements by a certain Deputy Dillon on the subject of peat development over the last 20 years.  I think he would find peat, along with wheat and beet, denounced in every direction.  Indeed, all efforts by Fianna Fáil at peat development were ridiculed.  It is a <Col N="1272" /> good thing that Deputy Dillon's researches down in County Wicklow have brought to his notice that there are considerable areas in this country covered with this once-despised product.  If he travelled through West Wicklow, as I believe he did, he would find big areas of bog which are capable of development.  However, in regard to those bogs they are, in the main, shallow bogs and are not of the type that have been extensively developed by Bord na Móna at the instigation of the Minister over the last 20 years.</P>
      <P>I often wondered is there not some use that could be made of peat in shallow bogs which is, perhaps, not of a very superior quality.  The area of our country that lies under such bogs is considerable and if we could find some means not only of utilising whatever amount of peat is in those bogs but also if we could reclaim the lands upon which they are found and convert them into agricultural land or into land suitable for afforestation, it would be a tremendous step towards the development of our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the need for that particular type of development. I am not going to go into it in any detail.  I think the Minister probably realises himself that over the last 20 years a vast amount of work has been done on what I might call high-quality bogs or bogs of very considerable depth.  That is praiseworthy work.  In addition, we have had various schemes for the reclamation and the utilisation of these bogs for agricultural purposes but areas such as we have in County Wicklow have been neglected and it is no harm to draw the Minister's attention to that matter now.  If the residue of peat on those lands could be utilised, it would help to lower the very high cost of draining, reclaiming <Col N="1273" /> and improving that land for agricultural or afforestation purposes.</P>
      <P>It is a good thing that Deputy Dillon has been induced after such a long period, to make some research into this matter and although some people were not as pleased with him in the County Wicklow, particularly in Tinahely, as he would have liked, I think his visit to that constituency has to a certain extent opened his eyes and sent him delving into the records of the Library.</P>

      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Morrissey, none of the money provided by this Bill nor any of the powers conferred by it are intended to be used in connection with the establishment of the four small generating stations to be located in western counties and fired by hand-won turf.  The idea of establishing such stations has been approved and the E.S.B. have been asked to prepare plans.  The plans are being made at the present time, and until I have received them I cannot give an estimate of what they will cost.  Bord na Móna will not come into the operation of these stations at all except perhaps in an advisory capacity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I inform the Deputy that a Bill is coming along shortly to provide additional funds and powers for the E.S.B.?  The fact is I am not in a position to give any estimate of the cost of these stations.  I am glad Deputy Dillon discovered and read the report of the economic commission of the first Dáil.  If he had discovered it 30 years ago and read it then it would, perhaps, have saved him a lot of mistakes.  Let me be clear.  A lot of experiments have been carried out and are being carried out now in the utilisation of turf and methods of winning it, and possible chemical industries that might be based on it.  I have not thought it necessary or desirable to report on these experiments to the Dáil except when they led to some decision to take action.  I think the Deputy is mixing up several things in his mind.  Milled peat&mdash;peat in the form which we are proposing to use it for firing of boilers in power stations&mdash;is different to pulverised peat.  Pulverised peat was used experimentally on many occasions.  Some ten years ago a series of experiments was carried out by an engineer in the services of Hospitals' Trust&mdash;he happens also to be a member of Bord na Mnna&mdash;and a report was prepared. I have a personal recollection of being present at the meeting of the scientific body at which his paper was read. There is not any question that pulverised peat will burn and has certain advantages over other fuels for steam-raising purposes.  The economy of pulverised peat as a fuel is a different matter nor do I understand that it is necessary to carry out further experiments in that direction in view of subsequent developments.  The much more economical milled peat which Bord na Móna proposes to use for power station purposes satisfies the immediate requirements of the E.S.B. in regard to fuel for these stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of this new jet burner&mdash;the Mona jet burner&mdash;by Bord na Móna offers the possibility of the utilisation of peat for industrial purposes without even reducing it to milled form.  The aim of the board <Col N="1275" /> has been to get peat fuel available in the most economical form so that the cost of generating steam would be kept at the lowest.  While they are satisfied that they have made considerable progress in that regard the experiments are still going on and they are every day adding to their knowledge of the methods by which peat can be won, can be transported and utilised.</P>

      <P>All doubts on that subject have been removed already by experiments carried out here and in other countries.  Both the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna are satisfied that no further experiment is required.  When I brought in here in 1951 a Bill dealing with E.S.B. affairs I intimated that we had then consented to the provision of money for the erection of a pilot plant at Portarlington to be operated on milled peat.  The E.S.B. has now decided that a pilot plant is not required and they can proceed forthwith to install the apparatus which has already been designed.</P>

      <P>We carried out investigations during the war but dropped that because there was not enough peat available to justify going ahead with it.  In any event the information gathered established that it would not be an economical process in normal times.  It was only the scarcity of coal during the war years that justified its examination at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the possibilities of utilising mountain bog for any purpose.  Again, I can only say that Bord na Móna experts are examining every possibility based on peat. Up to the present they have not discovered mechanical means of exploiting mountain bog or the blanket bog which one finds over western Ireland, for fuel purposes.  Originally they based their plans for the mechanised development of sod turf on the characteristics of the deep midland bogs. Then they perfected a method of producing milled peat, which opened up a prospect of exploiting certain western bogs on which the midland method <Col N="1277" /> could not have been operated.  They are deeply interested in all the possibilities of mountain bog because by far the greater part of the bog areas in the country are of that kind.  In the course of time, they may devise some method by which they can be developed.  They have experimented with the hydraulic method of winning peat, that is by ejecting peat from the bog by means of water jets, and drying it in drying beds.  That does not appear to be as economical as their present method of winning peat but they still have it in mind as a possible development in view of its applicability to the problems of winning peat from the shallower bogs in mountain areas.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna are maintaining a well equipped experimental station and they have available there men who are, I think, now recognised as foremost experts in the world upon all problems associated with peat.  They are really enthusiastic about their work and the House may be assured that any possible outlet for the utilisation of peat will command their attention and, if they can develop it to the point at which it has economic possibilities, that will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  I mentioned before that the Dutch Minister for Agriculture told me that they were making paper out of turf.  I asked Bowaters if they would look into that and they told me decently enough that they would and arranged that the results of any research they had done, or any research that they might carry out subsequently would be made known to us.  Did the Minister or the Government ever get any communication from Bowaters in that connection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question straightway.  There is nothing you cannot make out of peat that you can make out of any vegetable matter, but it is the economy of the operation that matters.  As I mentioned on Second Reading, the idea of manufacturing insulated wall board has been recently taken up by a Swedish company and Bord na Móna is taking an active interest in that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points in the Minister's statement in connection with this Estimate with which we certainly agree.  One of these points, I am pleased to observe, has reference to the continual expansion and building of new schools and the reconstruction of others.  Unfortunately many of our schools had fallen into a very bad condition.  It is true to say that if this problem had been attacked some years ago, both the State who have to furnish a large part of the expenditure by way of grants, and the local people who have to raise the remainder, would have saved money.  It is well, however, even at this stage to see that people generally are facing up to the responsibility of keeping schools in proper condition and that the programme is proceeding in the way that we all would wish, particularly in rural areas where as many of us are aware, the accommodation for pupils was very primitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with the Minister in his comments in regard to the desirability of local people accepting a certain share of the responsibility.  It is a <Col N="1279" /> pity to find every section in the community clamouring, as it were, to the State for assistance of all sorts.  I think it would be deplorable if, even in rural areas, we reached the stage where the people failed to recognise their responsibility for providing some contribution towards the upkeep of the schools.  It is of primary importance that parents should see that school buildings once they are put into a proper condition by the State are kept in that condition.  I will say for the people in rural areas that, if this is put plainly to them, they will not shirk their responsibility for keeping the school in a proper state of repair.</P>
    <P>There are a few points, however, in regard to which I differ from the Minister.  I mentioned them before but perhaps, as the Minister said in his statement, we may be misinformed.  If so, that is one problem that still exists. I consider that no matter what trade or profession young people enter they must of necessity, first of all, serve a certain number of years apprenticeship to it.  When we speak of these problems that face us it is because of the fact that each one of us did serve an apprenticeship in the primary schools or, as they are more commonly known in the country, national schools.  Perhaps we did not avail to the full extent of the opportunities afforded to us in the course of that apprenticeship but I still maintain that such views as we do express in regard to these problems are based on the knowledge that we and our neighbours in these rural areas acquired in these schools.  I was sorry that the Minister last year pointed out that he differed completely with the views I expressed on one particular item&mdash;that is the problem of schoolbooks.  This system was not introduced when the present Minister took over responsibility for the Department. Indeed, the Minister's predecessors must accept the same responsibility.  I fail to understand why parents should have such heavy imposts placed upon them year after year in connection with the purchase of new school textbooks. If two children in the same family are attending the same school and one is in third class and the other is in fourth <Col N="1280" /> class, there is no reason why the child moving up from third to fourth should not use the textbooks that her sister or brother used the year before.  I fail to understand why parents should be told that the textbooks current in the year 1952 must be scrapped in the year 1953 and that the child moving from third to fourth cannot use the books used by a brother or a sister in that class.  I think there is some kind of a ramp in connection with these books. I do not say the Minister or any of his predecessors are or were involved in that ramp.  Undoubtedly a minority is gaining at the expense of a majority and, in this instance, the majority is representative of the parents of school-going children throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This problem needs a closer study than it has been given in the past.  Such heavy burdens should not be imposed on parents.  We have reached a stage now when school textbooks represent a very costly item in the family budget and for that reason alone some steps will have to be taken to remedy the present position.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement referred to the setting of specific courses in the various schools.  He adverted to the teaching of woodwork, agriculture, rural science and domestic economy.  The present curriculum may be suitable from the point of view of Dublin City and Cork City but it is not suitable from the point of view of the rural areas.  The purpose of primary education, as the Minister pointed out, is the development and formation of character and the training of the child to do certain things correctly.  Considering the present curriculum in the primary schools, is it any wonder that the young people are emigrating or fleeing from the rural areas into the cities and towns?  The present programme has a definitely commercial bias.  No attempt is made to awaken the child's interest to the importance of agriculture and rural life.  Added to that is the fact that there are not sufficient openings in commercial life to absorb all the young people.  The Minister says we cannot overload the programme.  I believe rural science is a subject which would be of tremendous value to children in the rural <Col N="1281" /> areas because it will open children's eyes to the significance of nature and will pave the way ultimately to a proper appreciation of agriculture. Girls in the primary schools should be taught the fundamentals of domestic economy.  It is a mistake to encourage children in the rural areas into commercial life.  The programme should be one that will encourage children to adopt careers that will hold them in the rural areas.  In that way we will do something to stop the tide of emigration and, more important still, build up rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>In connection with county council scholarships to secondary schools there is a certain weakness.  Undoubtedly these scholarships are a great help but the amount awarded is not always sufficient and parents are often called upon to make up the deficiency.  I think a flat rate should be introduced. I know the Minister has no real jurisdiction in the matter and he has no compulsion over local authorities, but if a flat rate was introduced parents would know exactly where they stood. It is hardly fair that a child should be asked to forego the advantage of a secondary education merely because his parents are not in a position to supplement the scholarship awarded to him.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the increase in the number of secondary schools. That is very satisfactory indeed.  We hear many complaints of the standard of education going down and from that point of view it is a good thing to know that secondary schools are actually increasing in number throughout the country.  In connection with examinations in the secondary schools, is it correct that music does not get its rightful place?  Is it correct that a pupil doing music in a secondary school must pay a fee of 10/6 if he or she wishes to enter for an examination in that subject?</P>
    <P>That, surely, is not an incentive or an encouragement to pupils to take music as one of the subjects in the examination.  I think that the Department should encourage such a subject. I believe there is nothing that would help us more than the fact that our <Col N="1282" /> young boys and girls were concentrating on the study of music.  It would be much better that they should do so than have them enjoying some of the tin-can jazz music that we hear over the radio.  Most of us here are well aware that in the rural Ireland of the past the pride of any household was the man who was able to play the fiddle, or as we term it now, the violin, or the man who at the cross roads provided music with his accordion.  The Minister will admit that music has always held a place of honour in rural Ireland but now our children are to be forced to pay an extra fee of 10/6 if they take music as a subject at examinations.  I do not think that is right.  I believe that encouragement should be given to this special branch of education&mdash;that it should be given the place of honour that it deserves.</P>
    <P>I also believe that from the secondary. schools encouragement should come for choral singing.  Even under the British régime in this country, so far as I am aware, there was more encouragement given to this subject than there is at the present time.  These are two problems which come from the secondary school side.  To some people they may not seem to be of much importance, but I believe they are of very great importance to children who may be anxious to take them as subjects at examinations.  The Minister, I think, should give consideration to the question as to why an extra charge of 10/6 is made in the case of pupils who take those subjects.</P>
    <P>We all realise that the foundation of our educational system is the primary or national school.  If boys and girls are lucky enough, through means of county council scholarships, to pass from the national to the secondary school, they can then enjoy the advantages of the advanced training provided there.  In that connection, I do not believe that we realise to the full the great credit that is due to some of the teaching orders who conduct our secondary schools, or the wonderful help given to this country through the Irish Christian Brothers. There are many young Corkmen in good positions in the City of Dublin <Col N="1283" /> to-day.  It may be that they came up with single tickets, but, at any rate, they came up because of the fine education they received in the North Monastery or Sullivan's Quay schools in Cork.  Their success in life has been largely due to the great training they got in those schools.  I believe, however, that we have some secondary schools wherein a danger lies in this sense that part of the training is concentrated on etiquette and all that is connected with it, such as snobocracy and autocracy.  That does not apply to such schools as those conducted by the Irish Christian Brothers.  We have good reason to be proud of them.  In some of those other secondary schools that I have indicated the system of the old school tie is inclined to become more pronounced every day.  I believe that the farther we get away from that the better.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that, in his opinion, the most important subjects in the primary schools should be Irish, English and mathematics.  If boys and girls get a good foundation in those subjects in the primary schools, and are then lucky enough to be able to get to a secondary school, they will have been well prepared for the advanced studies which they will have to face there.  They will, for example, have been well prepared for the examinations held in connection with appointments to ordinary clerkships under the local authorities.  Naturally, it is a great advantage to the boy or the girl who secures one of these appointments.  As far as I understand, the papers which are set for these examinations by the local authority examiners comply with the rules and regulations laid down by the Department of Education.  If I mention any point in connection with this, it is not to be taken that I am objecting or finding fault either with the local authorities or with the people who set the papers because I realise that they are simply carrying out their duties within the framework of the regulations laid down for them.  It does, however, seem senseless to me that a boy or a girl who sits for an examination for appointment as clerk in a county council <Col N="1284" /> office should be asked questions in history of a standard or type that I believe is not in line with our own national interest.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the history questions which are set for these examinations.  I am not going to mention any names.  If boys and girls at these examinations were asked to write an essay on the history of 1916 or 1920, I certainly would be proud of them if it showed that they were familiar with these periods of our history.  But surely, it is fantastic to ask boys and girls sitting for an examination for a local authority appointment a question such as this: &ldquo;Write an account of the incursions of the Northmen into the Continent of Europe, dealing with the effects they produced.  Did they make any permanent settlement?&rdquo; Is it not, as I say, fantastic to ask a person seeking a clerkship in a county council office a question such as that, or a question such as this: &ldquo;Trace the growth of Spanish power under Ferdinand and Isabella and account for the subsequent decline.&rdquo; Is it not a joke to ask boys and girls to cram their minds and their brains with a knowledge of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain when we know very well that their work in a county council office will be to deal with the case of some poor farmer&mdash;at least he will tell them that he is poor&mdash;who comes in to say that he cannot pay his rates?  Another question that may be asked is: &ldquo;Describe the principal stages in the unification of Germany or Italy in the 19th century.&rdquo; Would it not be more compatible with present-day conditions, and more correct, to ask them for their views as to how we can bring about the unification of the 32 Counties in our own small country?</P>
    <P>I believe that our line of approach in connection with these examinations is rather antiquated.  I agree, of course, that questions in history should be asked.  Why not ask them questions about Pearse and Connolly and of others of our 1916 men, some of whom are still alive&mdash;or indeed of our present Minister&mdash;and tell what they knew of them?  But let us forget about some of the nonsensical questions which applicants for county council clerkships are <Col N="1285" /> expected to be able to answer.  I believe, too, that we could do very well without asking questions in Latin at these local authority examinations.  By all means, as the Minister mentioned at the start, it is important for boys and girls to have a good knowledge of Irish, English and arithmetic, and after that of the historical past of our country.</P>
    <P>The last point I would mention is one on which most of us perhaps have different views, not in this House but in the country as a whole.  If you speak completely in favour of the Irish language you are an ultra-nationalist out on your own.  If you try to explain that you believe that we should try to adopt a middle of the road policy then you are very doubtful, and probably anti-nationalist.  It is not so many years since we were in school, and if one looks back one remembers that we took a pride, and always will take pride, please God, in a knowledge of the Irish language and all it stands for.  But I consider that our advantage was that we learned Irish as a subject.  I know that one of the problems confronting parents at present is this: their boys and girls going to national schools come back in the evening with problems in arithmetic.  The parent is anxious to help the child with the problem, but when the question is in Irish and the child is doing it through the medium of Irish and is stumped half-way, his parents are not conversant enough with Irish to help. Surely the child is suffering by such a system.</P>
    <P>I believe that boys and girls could be encouraged to love the language of their country and all that it holds for the people of the country more securely and more sincerely than by being compelled, as they have been, to try to learn other subjects through the medium of Irish.  I am speaking from our own experience and knowing the advantages of it, and I am also speaking from the knowledge I have gained from parents whose children are at a disadvantage when the parents cannot help them.  In many instances it is not the fault of the parents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" /> There is another side to that problem.  There is unfortunately the parent who is ready to condemn the language; and the child hearing his parents complaning about the language&mdash;parents may not know the language and may not be able to converse in it&mdash;is encouraged not to learn Irish as a subject. The parents then are not aware of how backward the child can be.  I believe that we should kill this section who are, as it were, intellectually trying to scoff at the language.  We should help the children in a better way if we concentrated on the language for reading and writing and, above all, speaking in the language.  This way would be better perhaps than trying to inculcate other subjects and giving less time to the language itself, beautiful as it is, to the detriment of the children.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to draw attention to one feature of our Irish life that is becoming more prominent. Every new board that is set up or every new commission that is appointed bears an Irish name.  I am asking, when these new names in Irish are given to these boards and commissions, is the Minister or the officials in his Department consulted as to the wisdom of the name so given or as to whether those names are correct or not?  I believe that no Department, whether it is Industry and Commerce or any other Department, should put an Irish name on any new venture without consulting the Minister for Education and his staff.  There was a name brought before the people of this country and before the people of other countries quite recently&mdash;a name in Irish.  I would like to know did the Minister or his Department have anything to do with the checking up of the real meaning of the word or not.  I am speaking of the word &ldquo;Tóstal&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister for Education is not responsible for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It being an Irish word I maintain that, in fairness to the Minister, I should ask the Minister my point and inquire as to whether the attention of his Department was drawn to that word.  Many people have been inquiring as to what <Col N="1287" /> is the English meaning of the word and I have known school teachers who are not able to give a definition of it except that they got an understanding that it means &ldquo;at home&rdquo;.  Now strange to say I have been checking on an old Irish-English dictionary, by O'Reilly, published here in Dublin in 1821 and the word &ldquo;Tóstal&rdquo; comes into it, and the only English definition for the word &ldquo;Tóstal&rdquo; in that dictionary is &ldquo;arrogance, pride, envy&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;Tostallach&rdquo; also appears and is the only word in connection with it, and the English definition is &ldquo;presumptuous, presuming, and arrogant&rdquo;.  I think it is totally unfair that any other Department of State should be prepared to use titles for any of our boards without consulting the Department of Education and their responsible officials.  That is all I have to say on it but I should be glad if the Minister would tell us about Irish meanings and whether such words were used without his authority or the authority of his Department.</P>

      <P>Molaim go mor an rud atá ráidhte ag an Teachta Deasmhumhan agus ná tóg orm é má deirim gur dóigh liom go bhfuil an ceart aige.  Nuair bhí an tAire ag caint an lá fé dheireadh dúirt sé:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ach ní'I ann ach an t-aon teanga amháin gur linn féin í, go bhfuil ár ndúchas agus ár n-oidhreacht fite intí, a múnlaiodh ar intinn mhuintir na hÉireann agus gurb í fealsúnacht ár sinsir is anál anama di; sí sin an Ghaeilge.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An chéad rud atá, le rá agam ar an Meastachán so baineann sé le pointe a bhí á luadh ag an Teachta, Deasmhumhan.  Is mó fadhb a bhí ag baint, le teanga na Gaeilge agus aithbheochaint na Gaeilge nuair cuireadh an Stát ar bun ar dtús agus cheapamar nuair a bheadh ár réim féin ans na scoileanna, dá gcuirtí an obair chun cinn i gceart go mbeadh an Ghaeilge sabháilte ach chímíd anois, tar éis 30 bliain, nach mar sin an scéal.  Gídh go bhfuil sár-obair á déanamh ins na scoileanna agus gach <Col N="1288" /> scoil díobh, go mór-mhór na bunscoileanna agus na meán-scoileanna, tá an Ghaeilge gan sábháil fós.  Ar dtús, nuair tháinig Rialtas Gaelach anseo agus nuair cuireadh an Dáil ar bun bhí orainn na hAchtanna a chur i bhfeidhm agus iad d'fhoilsiú i nGaeilge.  Bhí rudaí le déanamh againn chun réiteach a dhéanamh leis an teangain d'oiriúnú chuige sin agus cuireadh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin ar bun.  Ní mar a céanna an aigne a bhí againn i dtaobh litriú na Gaeilge nó na gcanúint.  Socraíodh sa Dáil ar an cló romhánach a chur i bhfeidhm, ar shimpliu beag a dhéanamh ar an litriú.</P>
    <P>Níor mhór canúint éigin a cheapadh i dtreo is gur mar a chéile an chaint sna hAchtanna, agus socraíodh ar chanúint an Athar Peadar a ghlacadh chuige sín. Dheineadar comh-réir nua, &ldquo;syntax&rdquo; simplí, a dhéanamh agus, cé go raibh canúint an Athar Peadar mar chanúint againn, i dtreo is go mbeidh saibhreas Gaeilge Chúige Chonnacht agus saibhreas Gaeilge Dhún na nGall anseo againn sa Dáil, fuaireadh cainteoirí ó Dhún na nGall agus ó Chonnacht agus bhíodar anseo i Rannóig an Aistriúcháin agus chuamar ar aghaidh leis an gcóras san.  Ní raibh Fianna Fáil sásta leis an obair seo agus nuair a tháinig Rialtas Fianna Fáil isteach anseo, dheineadar athrú air sin.  Dheineadar athrú beag ar an litriú; dheineadar an litriú níos faide ná an litriú a bhí ceaptha ag Rannóig an Aistriúcháin.  Ach, tar éis tamaill, fuaradar amach go raibh an ceart ag na daoine a bhí ag riaradh na cainte sna hAchtanna agus ansan dheineadar an litriú a chaighdeánú.  Tá sé caighdeánaithe anois agus tá glactha leis ag formhór na ndaoine atá ag scríobh.  Tá glactha leis ag an Roinn Oideachais, cé go bhfuil roint údar nach bhfuil sásta go gcuirfí amach a gcuid leabhar sa litriú nua.  Cé gur deineadh caighdeán nua ar an litriú sin, ní dheachaigh éinne i gcomhairle leis an Roinn oideachais, leis na cainteoirí, le lucht na n-ollscol, leis na húdair féin, nuair a bhíodar ag ceapadh litrithe nua don Ghaeilge.  Deineadh an litriú nua gan an obair sin a chur fé bhráid an Aire Oideachais, na hAireachta Oideachais, na n-údar, na gcainteoir, ná éinne go raibh aon bhaint aigele <Col N="1289" /> hobair na Gaeilge sna scoileanna nó le hobair na scríbhneoirí.  Is ait an scéal ar fad é sin.</P>
    <P>Pé ar domhan é, tá glactha leis an gcaighdeán nua, gí go bhfuil constaicí anseo is ansiúd le réiteach fós mar gheall air.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil na leabhra go léir atá á n-úsáid sna scoileanna á gclóbhualadh anois sa chló nua.</P>
    <P>Airímid anois go bhfuil rud eile á dhéanamh agus gan aon bhaint ag aon duine atá dhá dhéanamh leis an Roinn Oideachais, ná gan aon chomhairle fachta ón Roinn Oideachais ná ó chainteoirí ná ó údair&mdash;sé sin, go bhfuil daoine sa tír seo agus tá na focail á n-athrú acu.  Ní fheadar cé uaidh a bhfuaireadar an t-údarás ach airímid go bhfuil an graiméar nua ceaptha.</P>
    <P>I gcás litrithe nua, is féidir focal d'athrú agus gan cur isteach ar chaint na ndaoine, ach is rud eile é an graiméar. Ba mhaith liom rud éigin a chloisint ón Aire mar gheall ar an ngraiméar seo, do réir mar airímid, má tá graiméir nua déanta, agus &ldquo;syntax&rdquo; nó comhréir nua ceaptha.  Deineadh é sin agus níor cuireadh ceist, níor glacadh comhairle le cainteoiri, le lucht na nollscol, le lucht Scoil an Ard-Léinn ná le haon údar a raibh aithne air in aon chor.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaíth liom a íarraidh ar an Aire conas atá an scéal i dtaobh an ghraiméir seo?  An mbeidh cead ag éinne leabhair a scríobh í gcóír na scoileanna ná beidh bunaithe ar an ngraiméar seo?  An mbeidh sé éigeantach, cuir i gcás, sa Ghaeltacht, leabhair d'úsáid a bheas scríofa agus bunaithe ar an ngraíméar seo?</P>
    <P>Cad is dóigh leís a thíocfaidh ar obair na scoileanná sa Ghaeltacht má déantar athrú anois agus graíméar nua do cheapadh agus an graiméar sin do chur i bhfeidhm sna scoíleanna agus iachall do chur ar na clódoirí agus ar na foilsitheoirí cloí leis an ngraiméar sin nuair a bheid ag cur amach leabhar scoile nó b'fhéidir leabhar eíle faoin nGúm nó faoin gClub Leabhar?</P>
    <P>Is amaideach ar fad é, im thuairimse, an tslí atá tógtha chun an obair seo a chur chun cinn.  An raibh aon tír riamh ann go raibh aon Rialtas nó aon Roinn Stáit nó Stát-Sheirbhíseach, nó lucht Parlaiminte nó Rí, a d'athraigh ar fad an teanga?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> Tá saibhreas agus gontacht i gcaint na Gaeilge i gConnacht agus i gC ige Mumhan agus teastaíonn an saibhreas uainn.  Tá an sampla ag an Aire agus tá sampla ag an Rialtas i dtaobh conas a tosuaíodh ar an obair cheana, nuair a Cuireadh Rannóg an Aistriúcháin ar bun ar dtús.  Do ceapadh canúint, agus canúint a bhí go maith agus go ciallmhar, ach do glacadh comhairle cainteoirí Chúige Uladh agus Chúige Chonnacht agus ní raibh aon tsaibhreas ann ná raibh le fáil ag Rannóig an Aistriúcháin.  Bhíodar i mbun obair na nAchtanna agus nuair a chuir siad isteach ar obair na scoileanna le himeacht aimsire, chuir siad feabhas ar chaint agus ar litriú na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Nuair a ceapadh ar chanúint an Athar Peadar mar bhun chuige sin, bhí mórán déanta ar an Athaír Peadar roimhe sin.  Is cuimhin liom nuair a thainig an tAthair Peadar go Baile Átha Clíath chun Saoirse na Cathrach d'fháil i 1926.  Thug sé óráid uaidh i dTigh an Árd-Mhaoir ag cur síos ar conas mar thosnaigh sé ar scríbhneóiracht na Gaeilge agus an saghas litriú a bhí ann an uair sin.  Chuir sé síos ar an údar agus mar a bhí an t-údar bruite síos ag an litriú, &ldquo;Thosnaíos ar an ceann agus an t-earball a bhaint díobh agus an mullach a bhaint astu,&rdquo; dúirt sé.  Agus sin mar d'éirigh leis an Athair Peadar ar chaighdeán nua na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Is amaideach an obair atá ar siúl ag pé duine atá dá déanamh anois, bheith ag ceapadh graiméir nua agus á chlóbhualadh, gan cheist do chur in aon chor ar an Roinn Oídeachais. Is amaideach an rud é go dtabharfar ainm mar &ldquo;Tóstal&rdquo; nó ainm eile ar aon chuallacht Stáit gan an cheíst do chur faoi bhráid gléas éigin nó dream éigin a raibh dlúthbhaint aige leis an Roinn Oideachas agus obair na Gaeilge sna scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go dtuigeann an tAire conas atá an scéal fé láthair agus go gcuirfidh sé a chos síos agus go ndéanfaidh sé cosaint ar lucht na Gaeilge í dtaobh an ghraiméir nua seo.  Agus ná déanadh sé cosaint ar lucht na Gaeilge agus ar an nGaeilge i dtaobh an Ghraiméir nuaidh seo.  Tá a fhios <Col N="1291" /> aige gur gá riaradh éigin a bheith ann agus go gcaithfear comh-réir ar chaint na leabhar a bheith ann, ach ní dóigh liom gur féidir, ná gur ceart é a dhéanamh gan an obair sin do chur faoí bhráid lucht na Roinne Oideachais, mar, cé gur maith an rud an obair seo go léir do bheith ar siúl, mura gcoimeádtar go buan agus go seasmhach agus go daingean an líofacht chainte agus an ghéire aigne agus an chinnteacht teangan atá ag muintir na Gaeltachta ní bheidh teanga náisiúnta agaínn agus, mar adeir an tAire arís:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Níl ann ach an t-aon-teanga amháin gur linn féin í, go bhfuil ár ndúchas agus ár n-oidhreacht fite inti, a múnlaíodh ar intinn mhuintir na hÉireann agus gurb í fealsúnacht ár sinsir is anáil anama di; sí sin an Gaeilge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Aon duine go bhfuil aon eolas aige agus go bhfuil aon staidéar déanta aige ar scríbhinní an Athar Peadar nó scríbhinní na n-údar is mó atá againn, tuigfidh sé sin nach ceart ligint do dhream nach bhfuil aithne ag aon duine againn orthu comhréir nua a cheapadh i gcóir na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá fhios ag an Aire na constaicí agus na deacrachta atá ann faoi láthair i dtaobh leabhar do chlóbhualadh, go mór mór leabhair do cheapadh agus do chur sna scoileanna toisc an t-atharú ar an litriú.  Is dóigh liom gurb é, do réir stíl scribhneoireachta. gurb é an tAthair Peadar an duine is fearr sompla, dá a lán againn, Muinhnígh, nó Connachtaigh nó muintir Chúige Uladh.  Scríobh sé roinnt leabhar díreach agus roinnt leabhair eile agus na leabhair is mó a bhí ar eolas againne ag fás suas agus ag foghlaim na Gaeilge, níl siad le fail anois.  Ní bhfuighfeá aon chóip de <i>Sheanmóir Is Trí Fichid,</i> scéalta as an mBíobla Naofa, tá timpeall 300 ann i gcóir uimhir a 1.  Ní fheadar an bhfuil 30 cóipeanna ann de uimhir a 2; ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon cheann de uimhir a 3 le fáil.  Ní féidir iad do cheannach.  Is dóigh nach bhfuil ach 30 coipeanna de <i>Aithris ar Chriost</i> le fáil gidh gur ard-leabhar é sin agus níl aon fhonn in aon chor <Col N="1292" /> ar na clódóirí na leabhair sin do chlóbhualadh arís.  Is mór an chailliúint é sin do na daoine óga faoi láthair. Nach ait an scéal é sin, na leabhair is mó do thaithnígh linne ag fás suas, ag foghlaim na Gaeilge agus na leabhair do dhein taithint orainn leanúint leis an nGaeilge d'fhoghluim níl siad san le fáil ag ár ndaoine óga.  Tá siad á fagháil ag daoine a bhí glic agus a chonac go rabh na leabhair sin ag dul as cló.  Is é mo thuairimse gur cúram mór ar an Aire féachaint chuige sin agus má thagann graiméar nua isteach ar an obair sin éireoidh na clódóirí as clódóireacht Gaeilge ar fad.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil sé ar chumas an Aire a rá, linn nach bhfuil an scéal chomh dorcha agus a mheasaimid é do bheith.  Tá sé dorcha go leor nuair a chuimhnimíd ar an tslí inar deineadh an caighdeán nua eile.</P>
    <P>So much with regard to the language. With regard to the general position, the Minister rightly says how much our nationality and our philosophy are enshrined in the language.  We all know that.  It is quite clear.  I feel that a lot more should be known about the work that is being done in the schools, magnificent as it is.  A little of it is being brought out into the open by our feiseanna and I would like to see a greater appreciation of what our feiseanna mean as a matter of adult education in both the language and in national culture and literature.  I would like to see a little more general appreciation of that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond asks how is it possible that Irish should be used officially for descriptive purposes without the Department of Education having anything to say on it.  In the same way, how is it possible for us to talk so much about what the language means to the country and to have no machinery of any kind for reviewing or for estimating the condition in which the language is in the Irish-speaking districts, for estimating and for positively putting down what are the things that are militating against its strength there, what are the things that, on the other hand, are helping it and what are the things that would help it more?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1293" /> I would look to the annual statement of the Minister for Education for a review of the position of the language in the life of our people in the Irish-speaking districts.  A separate inspectorate for the Gaeltacht was set up and from the reports that were originally made and that, no doubt, are continuing to be made from these Gaeltacht areas on the general conditions in the Gaeltacht as affecting the use of the language in ordinary life there must be a very fair amount of information and a very fair amount of suggestion now and it ought to be regarded as a responsibility of the Department of Education to give an annual summary of what the position in these Gaeltacht districts is.  I would like to hear if the Minister is in a position readily to give the information.  I would like to know to what extent, in the Donegal, in the Connacht and in the rather scattered Munster Gaeltacht, additional schools have been added to the inspectorate or if schools have been taken away.  It would be interesting to know, from the point of view of size, how the inspectorate has been changed.  I would hope that it might be possible for the Minister, in a systematic way, if not now, at any rate, in some kind of arranged way, to give us a statement, from the point of view of the people best able to have a point of view in the matter, as to what is the position of the language as the linguistic medium of life in the Irish-speaking districts.  I feel that unless we settle on some machinery for keeping the situation there under review, the Gaeltacht will pass as some people say it is already passing.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention Irish music. Deputy Desmond has been speaking of music generally but I would speak of that particular section of music that Father Séamus Ó Floinn has been lecturing on in our summer courses for the last three years or so.  Has anything been done to have a systematic gramophone recording, particularly for purchase by the public, of the systematised review of Irish traditional music that Father Ó Floinn has been putting before the public through his splendid classes in Passage West and <Col N="1294" /> through the Summer School of Music? For a very long time Father Ó Floinn has interested himself in traditional music.  For a very long time he has been tinkering with every kind of machine he could lay his hands on to record faithfully and systematically our Irish traditional airs.</P>
    <P>When Colonel Brase came over here first, I had occasion to introduce him to many Irish traditional singers.  The colonel rather went off the handle from time to time, because when he got to the piano and tried to reproduce what the singer had sung his attitude was, &ldquo;But that is different.&rdquo;  We cannot afford to have the remnants of Irish traditional music become simply a matter for argument and for criticism. At any rate, we have one splendid authority on the matter now and we have had a splendid amount of systematic work done.  With all the wire recorders and all the machinery available for record purposes now, surely the whole of Father Ó Floinn's review of our Irish traditional music should be systematically recorded and made available for teachers to reproduce, say, on a gramophone for the teaching of their classes.  When they attend a class of Father Ó Floinn's in the summer school, there seems to be no explanation as to why the teachers cannot buy here in town whatever records they want as samples.  At this particular stage, there is no reason why a lecturer on these matters would not be able to produce records of the systematic story and setting out of the various Irish modes and the songs that emphasise them.  I understand that it was proposed to develop that matter and I want to urge on the Minister that there is no time to be lost.  Father Ó Floinn is too long on the road now to risk not having faithfully recorded under his direction the full range of his review.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the Council of Education is at present engaged in preparing its report, which will deal with the function of the primary school and the curriculum up to 12 years of age.  It will be a very important thing to get.  In the meantime there are some fundamental matters in regard to which waiting for <Col N="1295" /> the report may be used by the Treasury to delay expenditure.  One thing I should like to press on the Minister is the inadequacy of training college facilities, particularly for the training of women teachers but to some extent for male teachers.  I know that two years ago there was grave urgency in regard to the matter of providing more facilities for the training of women teachers.  In the meantime there has developed further criticism of the Department in connection with the number of untrained teachers who are being appointed throughout the country.  I know that there is a demand from the primary teachers' organisation and others with regard to the training of teachers&mdash; that primary teachers should be the product of the university.  I think it is realised that up to 11 years is the basic age for the imparting of primary education.  What will come after that we will be better able to decide when we have an opportunity of considering the report of the Council of Education.</P>
    <P>It is no doubt a good thing that our teachers should have a high ideal as to what the professional qualifications should be for teachers, including primary teachers.  To my mind, however, one thing stands out in our whole educational machinery: that the only systematic training in teaching as a practice and as a profession is given in the training colleges in which primary teachers are trained.  When you review the various classes of schools that teach children up to 12 years of age, then the work of these training colleges stands out as a work of fundamental importance that the educational authorities can hardly tinker with, and any development in the further education and the further training of teachers must be based on that work.  At any rate, at the present moment to depart in any way from or surrender in any way, in the training of our teachers, the basic institutions which you have is absolutely unthinkable.  That being so, there is an urgent need as far as I understand the situation that facilities should be available for the training of perhaps another 100 women teachers every year.  That need <Col N="1296" /> was there for some years past and every year that passes is adding to the problem that we have of putting untrained teachers into our primary schools.  It is quite easy to see here and there throughout the country what the result is of having untrained teachers teaching young children.  I am sure the Minister fully appreciates it, and I want again to press that it is a most urgent matter.  I should like to ask the Minister how far he has progressed in the matter of dealing with that.  It particularly applies to the women teachers, but the question also arises in regard to the men.</P>
    <P>While we are on that, there is another aspect of the matter which, I think, would require attention.  If the Minister looks at the Report of the Department of Education for the year 1948-49, page 5, he will see the results of the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations in regard to the preparatory colleges.  I feel there must be something wrong or, at any rate, something that requires examination or requires to be looked into when you consider the great discrepancy that exists in respect of the results between the number of boys who got honours and the number of girls.  I think the Minister will find that whereas only 55 per cent. of the boys from the preparatory colleges got honours in the leaving certificate examination 86 per cent. of the girls got them.  In regard to individual subjects 25 per cent. of the boys got honours in English but 50 per cent. of the girls got honours. When you come down to geography, 50 per cent. of the boys got honours but 86 per cent. of the girls got honours.  In regard to mathematics the boys are the only ones who got honours but even in this respect only five out of 26 boys got honours in the leaving certificate examination for the preparatory colleges.  When you consider that these are sound subjects for teachers and that these are people who have gone into the preparatory colleges through competitive examination there seems to be some kind of weakness there but the discrepancy between the type of result got from the boys and that from the girls is really very striking.  It looks as if there was <Col N="1297" /> something there that should be rather carefully investigated.</P>
    <P>Another thing which I regard as fundamental from many aspects is harmony between the teachers and the Department.  I am sorry to see that the Minister, whatever the cause, finds himself in the position he is in with regard to arbitration for the primary teachers.  I understand that the arbitration scheme originally set up for the primary teachers gave great satisfaction to the teachers and to everybody connected with the Department. There was a serious clash between the Government and the teachers with a strike of teachers in 1946.  With the passage of time and with the discussions that led to the setting up of arbitration machinery and its working, agreement was secured at conciliation level between the teachers, the Department and the Department of Finance. Yet, under the plea that the scheme of arbitration was to be reviewed at the end of 12 months, the scheme was stopped and a complete review of the situation from a different point of view entirely undertaken.  Let us consider some of the things that the teachers are put up against now.  In the first place:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the original scheme it was permissible for the I.N.T.O., should they consider that course desirable, to make direct approach to the Minister on the question of salary.  In the scheme now proposed the I.N.T.O. are precluded from so doing and matters within the scope of the scheme will in future be dealt with exclusively through the machinery of the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the necessity of denying representatives of the teachers the power of coming and sitting down with the Minister and having a face to face chat on things they think they want and things they feel they want to propose, if necessary, as matters that should be sent to conciliation and arbitration?  Surely, in the kind of world we have to-day where it is most desirable that men, whatever their functions, should dovetail and work with one another, it is desirable that there would be no denying them an <Col N="1298" /> opportunity of discussing with the Minister a matter which was regarded as so important as to warrant setting up systematic machinery for dealing with it.  It could easily be that direct access to the Minister would help to get a point of view put over that would take the edge off irritations, widen the field of view and help to prepare the minds of people to go in a constructive way into conciliation and arbitration machinery.  I regard it as an unhappy thing to require that, where certain things have to be arranged for through conciliation and arbitration, the very fact of doing so should erect a barrier between the Minister and the people for whom the machinery was provided.</P>
    <P>The second point suggested is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If, at any time, during the period up to 30th June, 1954, legal proceedings on a matter coming within the scope of the scheme are instituted by any teachers or group of teachers and are pending, then, unless the I.N.T.O. has assured the Ministers that the organisation is not in any way supporting such proceedings nor associated with them, no meeting of the conciliation council or of the arbitration board shall be held,&rdquo; etc.</P>
    <P>I understand that what is preventing the continuing of conciliation&mdash;the scheme ought to have been a continuing scheme and was meant to be a continuing scheme&mdash;arises over a case in connection with the change of rates in 1946.  The I.N.T.O. are supporting the taking of legal proceedings by some members of the organisation and the Government is so outraged by that type of indiscipline, that the people should be invoking the law, that they decline to consider or discuss the settling of conciliation and arbitration machinery.</P>
    <P>Surely even on a matter arising out of present-day conditions, and even arising on a matter which is liable to arbitration and conciliation, when something is done by which individuals feel that they are being affected unjustly to the extent of an illegality, it is unreasonable and undesirable that a Government should attempt to deny them the right of appeal to the courts. I submit to the Minister that that is only introducing unnecessary frictions and putting unnecessary obstacles in <Col N="1299" /> the way of having harmonious relations of a sufficient satisfactory and working type between the Government and the teachers.</P>
    <P>Again, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If at any time during the period up to 30th June, 1954, the I.N.T.O. sponsor or resort to any form of public agitation as a means of furthering claims or seeking redress for grievances relating to matters within the scope of the conciliation and arbitration machinery, this agreement shall be terminated by the Ministers.  Public agitation regarding matters within the scope of the conciliation and arbitration machinery is defined as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Strike action or any measures to encourage or incite to strike action or directed towards the taking of strike action.</P>
    <P>(b)  Public meetings.</P>
    <P>(c)  Meetings of national teachers to which the Press was admitted or of which reports were supplied to the Press.</P>
    <P>(d)  Endeavours to enlist the support of trade unions or other outside organisations or of political Parties or individual members or groups of members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Ministers do not regard the annual congress of the I.N.T.O. as being <i>prima facie</i> a meeting for the purpose of furthering particular claims or seeking redress for particular grievances, and they do not propose that normally the clause should apply to it, even when it is held in the presence of the Press, or reports of its proceedings are supplied to the Press.  The applicability or otherwise of the clause to congress would, however, depend on the general trend of the discussions thereat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, did anybody ever hear the like?  In order to introduce a simple kind of working machine, you have to go back to all kinds of almost star chamber regulations like that.  The general trend of the discussion at the <Col N="1300" /> Irish National Teachers' Annual Congress is likely to cause this arbitration scheme that is contemplated to be set aside.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (5) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Representations from any outside organisation on behalf of serving teachers in national schools will not be entertained and, accordingly, the I.N.T.O. will not move any such body to make representations on behalf of serving teachers in national schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that that paragraph would preclude the national teachers from having discussion with the managers of the national schools and getting the managers of national schools interested in whether their employees&mdash; the teachers&mdash;were being adequately paid.</P>
    <P>If you are approaching the making of a working arrangement, what is the use of binding both the managers and the teachers by some kind of regulation such as that?</P>
    <P>Paragraph (6) states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the teachers bring forward for discussion a claim which, if conceded, would involve extra expenditure, they will give an estimate of the annual cost of conceding the claim, and will indicate the estimated ultimate annual cost where this differs from the estimated immediate annual cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Surely, if machinery is required for conciliation and arbitration between any body such as the teachers and the Department with which they are so closely associated, the agreement for setting up a conciliation scheme arises out of definitely understood facts? Surely the machinery for setting up a conciliation group, where the various teachers and the Department of Education and the Department of Finance are represented, is the means for bringing forward matters of that particular kind?  It seems to me that a delaying action is being carried on against the teachers' organisation where it was perfectly demonstrated that a conciliation and arbitration scheme could work effectively, amicably and constructively if it was entered without any restrictions but with representatives of the teachers, of the Minister for Finance <Col N="1301" /> and of the Minister for Education, sitting down at a table and putting all their cards on it and coming to decisions at conciliation level as they did or otherwise coming to decisions at an arbitration level.  The Minister, I am quite sure, would do his very best to keep out of an absurd tangle of that kind.  However, other members of the Government find it very desirable to emphasise the principle of collective responsibility.  I think the Minister cannot shed responsibility for the present hold-up.  I should like to excuse him as much as possible.  I want to say how much I feel and appreciate the fact that, in spite of the trouble that is going on over this, the Minister and the Department appear to be working in the greatest possible harmony and co-operation with the teachers. These matters are of an irritating kind and drag over a long period.  It would have appeared impossible that primary teachers in Dublin would go out on strike.  Yet, they did, in 1946.  I am quite sure we will never reach that particular point again.  However, under the stress of present economic conditions, and so on, you never know where, in an atmosphere of irritation, things might go.</P>
    <P>I would press on the Minister and on the Government, that, in arranging an arbitration scheme with the primary teachers, they should not be denied access to the Minister.  It can easily be a very mollifying affair although it might come hard on the Minister.  Secondly, they should not require that the teachers would surrender legal rights or that the organisation would be required to disown teachers demanding their legal rights.  I do not think it is necessary to put down in regulations the extent to which there may or may not be agitation of a particular kind, including agitation at an annual congress, regarding such matters as conditions of service, and so on.  I do not think that is a matter for regulation.  If there is the intention to work the machinery of conciliation and arbitration, that intention should be quite sufficient to damp down any agitation or any publication of any aspects of the difficulties that were unreasonable or were irritating.  To require, say, <Col N="1302" /> that primary school managers would be formally and by regulation denied an opportunity of appealing or making representations on behalf of teachers is, I think, a very grave absurdity. The regulations suggested are regulations for delaying action more than anything else.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to overcome his difficulties in the matter and to establish immediately, even as from 30th June, 1953, the conciliation and arbitration machinery without so many qualifications as to the spirit in which people will enter it.  What is required is a clear intention and a spirit that these matters will be examined with the most scrupulous looking at facts of every kind and a situation in which the machinery can be used without being tied up in all kinds of irritating tape. I understand that a scheme of arbitration and conciliation has been arranged with the secondary teachers and I should like to know whether there is a clear understanding that the scheme, if it has been arranged, is a continuing scheme and that it will not be held up in 12 months' time when somebody thinks of another kind of regulation which could hold up any inquiry which requires to be made for a particular period or until some particular budgetary period comes along.  I should like to know also what is the position with regard to the vocational teachers and the possibility of a similar scheme being brought in for them?</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he had made the suggestion that a half-day a week should be set aside for some particular study, according to the wishes of the local teacher or manager. I want to commend the Minister's suggestion in that regard.  I did not understand that the Minister had already given authority to have it brought into operation.  He said he was waiting to see what kind of approval or otherwise would come to him with regard to it, but I suggest that he need not wait for any comment on it.  I think he will find it a most useful and fruitful experiment.  There are very many qualities and talents in our people and there are all kinds of special local interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> Even in matters such as turf-cutting the county council turf-cutting schemes in Mayo and Galway had to be organised on entirely different lines. There are varying local interests and local traditions.  It may be a tradition of the locality or a tradition of the teacher, but the Minister will find that the operation, even in a small number of places, of this voluntary period in the day would open the door to a very considerable amount of progress in the kind of education the people are looking for.  People say that they want more direct education in certain schools and we all know how necessary it is to have the basic work done but more and more it is being realised, particularly in the home, that the development of character and of satisfaction in life depends, if not upon some definite skill in craftwork of one kind or another, upon some definite interest that keeps the mind active and keeps possibly the hand active, too.  I strongly recommend to the Minister to go ahead with this idea.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has any suggestions he could make with regard to the staffing of small out-of-the-way schools.  I want to suggest, and to suggest it with regard to the Irish-speaking districts, that where there are small one-teacher schools, something might be done to develop among the senior pupils, in a small and almost semi-voluntary kind of way, the monitorial idea.  It ought to be possible to strengthen the work in the small schools in Irish-speaking districts by helping a few of the older girls or boys to take charge of some of the classes for a number of hours a week and perhaps to give them a summer course in some aspects of teaching work.  There is a rather important situation that has to be guarded in that connection.  It would be disastrous if any more of our small schools were shut down because to take a school, however small, from an out-of-the-way district&mdash;it is like taking the straw off the rocks&mdash;is to break the spirit in our people and to bring about a position in which there will be no children there at all.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister also if he is satisfied that he is <Col N="1304" /> making adequate preparation for the training of teachers for vocational schools.  There is, as he shows in his statement, very fruitful contact between our vocational schools and the voluntary educational societies which are developing in the country, such as Macra na Feirme, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, and Muintir na Tíre.  A new life is coming into these organisations, together with new confidence and much greater energy, by reason of the fact that there is a contact between them and the vocational committees and teachers, a contact which has been established for some time.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of that contact, however, to which I want to refer.  I do not know whether the Minister has come up against it or not.  In many cases, the vocational teachers give voluntary assistance to these societies. They visit their clubs and the homes and give classes and instruction there. I have heard of at least one vocational body that has intervened to prevent its teachers giving, although in a voluntary way, systematic courses of instruction for bodies such as these. It would be a pity if the vocational teacher who is prepared in her own time to give a course of six or 12 classes in cooking, needlework or other domestic work of that kind at a club of the Irish Countrywomen's Association or in their homes, should be prevented from doing so because there is an agenda for the work.  That would be very undesirable in view of the difficulty of getting vocational buildings erected as quickly as we would desire.</P>
    <P>The Minister has seen where, in Coachford, the local people have provided their own schools and he mentioned also schools which are being voluntarily provided in County Waterford and in Donegal.  There is that effort amongst people to prepare buildings and accommodation for the vocational education branch for the provision of organised courses. However, it would be very bad to interfere with or kill a course that was being done in a voluntary way and was being done in co-operation with these organised <Col N="1305" /> societies that have done so much to make our people understand the value of education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke of the position in regard to scholarships from primary to secondary schools or to the universities; in any event there is a very serious discrepancy between the amount of a scholarship which is given to one county and that which is given to another.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that it would be very desirable to have that general matter discussed with representatives of the General Council of County Councils. They have an understanding of the situation.  They have a certain number of representatives on the university bodies and they can quite easily find out full particulars as to what it costs to send a young person through a university course.  Whether a person comes from Leitrim or Cork, the university costs are very much the same.  They might be more costly for a person coming from Leitrim than for a person coming from Cork because the Cork student might be living at home and might not have the expense of lodgings, and so on.  I think the question of primary scholarships to secondary schools, and particularly that of secondary scholarships to the university, are matters which the Minister could very well have discussed with the General Council of County Councils.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions certain things which have developed in the National Library and in the National Gallery.  I would like the Minister to know that I met a number of people down the country who very much appreciate some of the photostatic assistance that has been given to them from the National Library.  I would also like to commend the work that has been done there on the micro-filming of our national documents, of which there has been a most interesting display in the Library quite recently.  I have heard that praised very much from rather unexpected people who are able to make use of it.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to know also that the lectures which have been given on the paintings in the National Gallery, and which he says have <Col N="1306" /> attracted a greater audience than he thought they might, have been very much welcomed, and the quality of the instruction and the review that is given there has been very much appreciated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on the method of recruitment to the teaching profession.  The present system means that about 80 per cent. of our teachers are recruited through the preparatory colleges. While I agree that that particular method is all right&mdash;we do get the best brains in the country at the age of 14&mdash; my point is that each year 60 boys and a similar number of girls are taken into the preparatory colleges and spend four years there; eventually, at the end of the course, the take the leaving certificate.  Due again to the good instruction given and the different facilities offered by the preparatory colleges, they all invariably pass that examination and thereby qualify to enter the training college.  I think that at the age of 14, when these boys and girls are taken into the preparatory colleges, they are not in a position to decide whether or not they would like teaching as a career.  Actually they become teachers by accident.  Because it is a good scholarship pupils do avail of it, especially in the western areas where Irish is the spoken language, and they enter the preparatory colleges.  It does give a chance to those students to obtain the leaving certificate but having gained it they should then be given the option of deciding whether or not they wish to become teachers. It is only at that age, say, 18, 19 or 20, that these young people can really make up their own minds in that regard.  It is a pity to see young boys who have a bent for engineering or some other profession being pushed against their will into teaching.  After all, teaching is a vocation.  As one inspector remarked: &ldquo;Teachers are born, not made.&rdquo;  It is not a good principle to take, at the age of 14, 120 pupils per year into the preparatory colleges to train as teachers.  We know from experience that about 99 per cent. of them qualify as teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some chance should be given to those <Col N="1307" /> students at the age of 18 or 19, when they do the leaving certificate examination, to decide for or against teaching as a profession.  There are snags in the way.  If any individual decides not to go forward as a teacher he is asked there and then to pay up fairly large sums of money to the State.  As his parents may not be in a position to do that the result is that he must go into the training college and become a teacher.  For that reason, I feel we are getting people into the teaching profession who would prefer and would be better in other professions.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I put down a question to the Minister to find out how many trained teachers left the profession other than by death or retirement at pension age, and I discovered that the numbers were fairly large.  I figured it out and if I am correct, I think about 15 per cent. of the boys who are trained leave the teaching profession; that is, the figure 69, which I think it was over the last five years, works out at about 13 per year, which would be about one-fifth of the boys in the training college.  If it is true that one-fifth of the teachers who are trained leave the profession, there must be something wrong.  I think one of the reasons for the exodus of qualified teachers from the profession is that there are greater enticements by way of salary, working conditions, and so on, in other professions for which they are qualified.  That is, to my mind, the cause for these people leaving, giving up teaching as a profession.  We know that teachers are not paid as high as members of other professions who have similar qualifications, and one cannot blame them if, when they find themselves qualified to undertake other work, that they desert teaching as a means of earning a livelihood.</P>
    <P>There is another important matter which affects the Gaeltacht areas and that is school meals.  I find in many parts of my constituency where schools are situated in Gaeltacht areas, that they do not come under the School Meals Act of 1930 and&mdash;I have mentioned this before&mdash;I think the schedule to that Act should be amended in order to bring in schools <Col N="1308" /> which are registered in the fíor-Gaeltacht areas.  Take, for instance, Rosguill in County Donegal.  It is a Gaeltacht and there is an Irish college there but the national school in that district does not have the benefit of school meals.  It is the same with Glencar.  It is a Gaeltacht area; the children are qualified for deontas&mdash;the £5 grant to Irish-speaking children. Yet, the pupils of that school have not the benefit of school meals, and I am sure there are other Gaeltacht schools in a similar position.</P>
    <P>I noticed Deputy General Mulcahy mentioned the half-hour per day which would be available for the teachers to decide whether to give instructions of value to the pupils outside the programme.  I find that the national school programme at the moment is very much overloaded.  The Minister will appreciate that the teaching of two languages in a school&mdash;and in any school teaching ordinary school subjects through the medium of Irish&mdash; has overloaded the present programme, and the teachers do find that they are always trying to rush against time because the course in arithmetic, history, geography, oral and written Irish and English, is very wide; and in the rural, two-teacher schools. where each teacher is in charge of four or five classes, I cannot see him achieving much, or doing any useful work in the half-hour which will be at his disposal to use in some way that will be advantageous to the children.</P>
    <P>I think that if a teacher decides to introduce some useful programme for the half-hour during which he is free to do what will benefit the children the ordinary programme should be cut down accordingly.  Otherwise there will be still more cramming in the time that is available for the ordinary school subjects, when one steals this half-hour from them.  If the Minister does make a regulation that teachers must use the half-hour per day and devote it to something which will be of local interest and which will be outside the school programme&mdash;if he makes that compulsory, I am afraid there will be many teachers in the country who will steal that half-hour and give it back to the humdrum teaching of tables and <Col N="1309" /> spellings, or something like that, which he has not enough time to do in the ordinary hours.</P>
    <P>Again, while on the programme, I would like to back what Deputy Vivion de Valera said in connection with secondary schools.  I think the same does apply to primary schools.  The children there are trying to get a smattering of everything and they leave school with a general knowledge of history, geography, Irish, English, mathematics and so on.  But one finds that when you meet them afterwards they are very indefinite when dealing with tables, simple mathematical or arithmetical problems or calculations: their handwriting is poor, their spelling is bad and I think more time should be devoted to handwriting, reading and the proper understanding of what the pupils read, and to tables, simple calculations and so on.</P>
    <P>I think a child who is efficient or very efficient at those things will be capable after leaving school of assimilating and amassing knowledge, because we Irish people are inclined to be lackadaisical and we are not definite enough in our statements, in our knowledge, and the school programme should be aimed to enable a child to have definite knowledge in the principal subjects like Irish, English and arithmetic&mdash;both Irish written and oral, and English written and oral.</P>
    <P>There is a shortage of qualified teachers at the moment and I suppose it is that which causes the Minister to mention the opening of a second training college fairly soon.  Although there is a shortage at the moment I hope never again will we arrive at the position, say, of the 'thirties&mdash;from 1932 or so to 1939&mdash;where qualified teachers had to spend three or four years doing substitute work because there was a glut of teachers.  Some of them went across to Scotland and England during those years and I know myself of many teachers who trained in those years and who had to wait for two or three or four years before they were able to find permanent employment in a school of their <Col N="1310" /> own.  That should be guarded against in any extension to the present training facilities.</P>
    <P>In connection with the £5 grant given to families who live in the Gaeltacht and who use the Irish language every day in their homes, I think that facility should be extended to include families outside the Gaeltacht where Irish is in daily use.  I find that Gaeltacht families who are given Land Commission holdings in Gálltacht areas continue to use Irish as the spoken language of the home, but they find that they are not given the £5 grant per child which was available to them in the Gaeltacht.  I think that the grant should be given to those families in whose homes Irish is genuinely the spoken language of the father, mother and other members of the family.</P>
    <P>In rural schools, especially in two-teacher schools, the history programme is divided into two parts&mdash;that is, the teacher in one year will teach the history from the earliest times to the Flight of the Earls, and in the following year will teach from that period to the present day.  As a result of that arrangement I find that the period of modern history, from 1913 down&mdash;a very important period&mdash;is left to the end of the year and, in consequence, pupils in the national schools at the present time are given but a poor idea of the struggle for independence in this country.  That happens because that period of history is done every second year and at the end of that long period.  I would suggest that the period of modern history from 1913 should be done each year as a separate unit altogether and then the teacher could go back over whichever other period comes up for attention that year.</P>
    <P>I think too, that our school readers both in Irish and English should contain the words of the National Anthem. We find at present that some pupils are not familiar with the words of the National Anthem.  The Minister should not, I think, sanction any school reader, whether an Irish reader or an English reader, which does not contain the words of the Anthem.  Finally may I say that I think the Minister has continued <Col N="1311" /> the work of the last Minister and has met the teachers' organisation very fairly?  We are looking forward to happy relations between the Department and the teaching profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one point I wish to raise on this Estimate and I hope that the Minister may be able to do something about it.  I am informed by some of the teachers and some of the authorities responsible for secondary schools, that they are dissatisfied with the method adopted in the setting of examination papers for leaving certificates and inter. certificates.  The criticism they have levelled is one with which I personally agree because it is not so long ago since I did the leaving certificate myself.  At that time, I recollect definitely that in the various papers set for examination there was a choice of questions.  I can recollect that there might be 12 questions on a particular paper and it would be unnecessary to do more than seven or eight of these questions.  That left a choice to every student.  The position at the moment is&mdash;and I have looked at some of these papers myself&mdash; that the choice has become very limited indeed.  In some of the examination papers at the moment there is only a choice in regard to one extra question and in some cases there is no choice at all to the student.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the students have changed very much since my time and I recollect that one of the thrills a student had, on getting a particular paper, was to have a quick scan over all the questions, first of all, to see what choice he had and, secondly, to see which was the easiest to start. Mind you it made a considerable amount of difference to the student if he saw a choice of questions, could get down to work straight away and get over the ones about which he felt confident.  That gave him a great feeling of confidence to tackle the remainder of the questions.  That choice, as I say, has disappeared.  There has been a complaint in particular of the method adopted in the present year.  I think myself that in the past there was more scope for the individual bent of <Col N="1312" /> students and a little more imagination displayed in the setting of papers.  I cannot for the life of me understand why there is not that choice nowadays. Surely it is not a question of saving paper.  I hope it is not.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too critical of the individual who set the papers but I should like if the views which other Deputies have on this matter, and which coincide with mine, were made known to the people responsible for the setting of these papers.  The remarks I have made are really made on behalf of the students as well as the teachers.  The Minister himself was young at one time.  I am not going to suggest how long ago that is but, at any rate, I am sure he would have great sympathy with young boys and girls who sit for these examinations. Many of them are excited in sitting for the examinations and it is a great relief to them to be able to make a choice of the questions on the examination paper.  All students are not alike. Some of them may find it much more difficult than others to face an examination although they may be equally as good and know their subjects equally as well, as students who can face an examination with great calm.  That is the only point I want to raise on this Estimate and perhaps the Minister might have some comments to make with regard to it when concluding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the Estimates which deserve special attention because the whole life of the nation revolves around education.  I am satisfied as a result of fairly long experience that education is making an advance and our people on the whole are as well educated as their counterparts in any other European country.  That is a fact.  When we come to review the position, however, we must ask ourselves: How fare our youth?  Whither are we going?  Are we moulding a national character and a national outlook?  It is on character and outlook that we must concentrate. Why is it that after 30 years of native government we have not succeeded in framing national character?  Something must obviously be wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the revival of the language <Col N="1313" /> is concerned, I believe that the Minister, the teachers and the children in the schools are playing their part. But there is some lacuna somewhere and I believe that it occurs after the children leave school.  Something will have to be done to remedy the present position in that respect.  There is too great a pursuit of materialism and that pursuit of materialism militates against the resurgence of a national soul.  So long as that pursuit continues, so long shall we remain without a national soul.</P>
    <P>People are no longer content to live the simple lives they led in the past. Because our people were simple they were happy, and that is true of even the worst days under the British.  The people knew what real happiness was because they had a proper sense of values.  Nowadays, even the people in good positions, with good salaries, are no longer happy because they have lost that characteristic that brought their ancestors and their forebears through all kinds of trouble and through every manner of vicissitude.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister knows that that is true.  I know that, like his predecessor, Deputy Mulcahy, he wants to see the rebirth of the nation's soul and a resurgence of Irish culture and Irish thought.  We will achieve nothing if we degenerate into a nation of shoneens.  At the moment we bid fair to become a nation of snobs, prigs and shoneens.  The problem is to dig out the roots of these now.  There will be no use in calling ourselves a nation if we do not make any effort to build up a nation.</P>
    <P>The money spent on education is spent to good advantage.  I have had some experience of that myself.  A family from my own county emigrated to England.  Two of the children went to school in England and, after a fortnight in the particular school, they were required to sit for examination with their English colleagues.  What was the result?  The two of them headed the examination list.  I need not tell you that we are very proud of that achievement in my part of the country.  That is proof that our educational system must be as good certainly as the system obtaining in England. <Col N="1314" /> We must, however, do something more to stamp an Irish character on the nation as a whole.  In order to do that I think we should concentrate on the children who leave school at 14 years of age because from 14 to 17 are three of the most formative years in the character of the child.  Indeed the lacuna that exists can in some degree be attributed to the loss the nation sustains because of children leaving school at 14 years of age.  They go into inferior positions.  They are not able to express themselves properly.  They are not able to think for themselves. The youth who speaks Irish and is sneered at by his colleagues promptly loses interest in the language.  Getting rid of that inferiority complex may be difficult but an effort will have to be made to rectify the present position if we are really sincere in our desire to rehabilitate the nation.</P>
    <P>Nowadays people's only desire seems to be to place their children in nice soft jobs.  Every child is not a bright child and it is not every child who will fit in successfully into the job his parents pick for him.  That is a matter that calls for some attention at the moment because the young people are rushing off to the cities, looking for jobs and the jobs must always be somewhat better than those held by a neighbour's children.  If the race to Dublin ends in failure they go over to England. There is no necessity for them to emigrate because there is plenty of work to be found here.  Having gone to England, they come home after a few months on holiday with their pockets filled with money and they are a disturbing influence in the lives of the young people who have remained at home.  They will boast of all the money they have but they never mention the enormous income-tax liability that they have to meet.  At the beginning of the holiday they have money to burn; at the end of the holiday they are as poor as when they first set out.  The craze for emigration is growing gradually worse.  It almost looks as if we will never be anything more than a shire of England.  Until we eradicate that craze we will never get anywhere.  Looking at the position to-day one is compelled to ask oneself: what was the good of all the sacrifice <Col N="1315" /> if our young people now go away so readily and, coming home for a holiday, tell us that life is not worth living here?  That inferiority complex is doing enormous harm.  It will have to be fought.  We will have to mould the character of our children.</P>
    <P>The man with the pledged word, the man of honour, the man of honesty is gone.  Lies, deceit and fraud are rampant.  Why that is so I do not know.  We are spending plenty of money on education.  The parents to-day are as good as those that went before them.  Nevertheless there is something lacking.  Building up the character and resuscitating the soul of a nation subject to tyranny for 700 years is, I admit, trojan work.  The present position must be reviewed.  We must discover if there is some other road we can travel to achieve our objects.  We will have to instil into our people a spirit of self-sacrifice.  That self-sacrifice must come right from the top all down through every grade in our society.  In that way we will imbue our young people with a new spirit. Five years of such a policy must get results.  That is the only way in which we will wipe out the snobbery and the shoneenism and bring the people together in the old simple way of life. We must have a definite aim.  We must have a definite object.  I am satisfied the Minister is the proper person to control the destinies of our youth.  I am satisfied he will do his job successfully if he is allowed to implement his policy in his own way.  He has shown his character in the past.  He is showing it to-day and I am satisfied that he will show it to-morrow.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should have no difficulty in thinking out a simple programme of education.  That is what we want.  At the moment we have too much cramming.  It is a fact that there are too many of our young people striving to engage in higher studies and to get to bigger and better schools.  The fact, however, is that what we want for 80 per cent. of our children is not a higher school education but a good national school education.  If our children get that from contented teachers, if they get a good <Col N="1316" /> grind in reading, writing and arithmetic, they will be able to do well for themselves when they leave the primary school.  It is true that there are too many children, belonging to poor as well as to well-to-do parents, trying to get to the bigger type of school. They are rushing hither and thither: their parents are spending money on their education and at the end of it all they find that there is no scope for the employment of the education they have received.  The result is that many of them are too proud to take work such as their parents are engaged on, and in the end they take the emigrant ship. We should get shut of that nonsense. If we do, then I suggest that life will be better for everyone.</P>
    <P>I am of opinion that the school-leaving age should be raised from 14 to 16.  It will be necessary for us to do that in order to correct the present position so far as education is concerned.  We should be able to blend education and religion better than we are doing at the moment.  In my opinion, far more of the time of the teachers should be devoted to religious instruction.  I do not think half enough time is given to it at present.  Religious instruction seems to end now when the children have received the Sacrament of Confirmation.  As I say, we should have more religious teaching in our schools.  More Christian Doctrine should be taught.  The reading of the Bible should be part of the education given to the children.  All that should go on until the children have reached the age of 15 or 16.  At present, they do not know the first thing about what their aim in life should be.  It should not be materialism and comfort, but rather a preparation for a better life in another world.</P>
    <P>These are the things which are forgotten as far as education is concerned &mdash;the simple things in life which should be taught to the children.  It is because they are not taught that our nation is drifting.  No one can stop that drift unless we take the hard, honest road, face these facts and train our people to a simple way of life, train them to get away from all the highfalutin nonsense about materialism and comfort.  Our aim <Col N="1317" /> should be to try and develop a sense of character in our people.  I admit that will be a hard job, due to the years of fighting and civil strife that we have had in this country, when in order to save our neighbours we had to tell lies.  The result of that has been to make our youth a nation of liars.  That went on for many years so that we might escape the tyranny that was grinding us.  We must get away from all that.  It will be a hard fight, but our people should now realise that they are a free people, and that we expect more from them than deceit and lies.  Our aim should be to raise up a manly people, people of character, of high spirit and nobility of mind, ready to make sacrifices and to help others.  I believe that if we were to concentrate on these things, in four or five years' time we would get good results.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we cut out all this nonsense about looking for big things and talking about higher education and higher studies.  We have some brainy people in our nation.  They will always get to the top.  Nothing can stop them, whether they are the sons of rich men or poor men.  We all know of men who, after a few years of education, left this country and made their mark elsewhere because they had the ability that God gave them and they used it.  There is no use in trying to cram education into the mind of the youth whose brain has not properly developed.  I myself knew many boys who were a complete failure at school. They could hardly read or write or spell when leaving school at the age of 14, despite the fact that they had good teachers.  Yet, in after life, they became men of balanced minds whose brains developed at a late age.  Many of them became well-off men.</P>
    <P>There is nothing of more importance in this country than the primary school.  In my opinion there is not enough attention given to easing the position of the teachers in the primary schools.  The result is that over a long number of years we have had a dissatisfied teaching profession.  Until we take steps to remedy that position, we are not likely to get very far.  In the past, many of our teachers had not more than £60 a year, and yet they <Col N="1318" /> devoted their whole lives and energy to teaching the youth of the country. Teaching with them was a vocation in life.  I want to see the teachers of the present day having that same vocation and showing the same spirit of self-sacrifice in the welfare of our youth. Unless we succeed in doing that, our teaching profession will not be anything more than a trade union.  That is one of the most dangerous things that I see at present, that our teachers should have to band themselves together, that they should have to fight and maybe perhaps strike because we have failed them.  If this House fails them, then we shall have done an enormous amount of damage to future generations of our people.</P>
    <P>I hope, therefore, that the Minister will make every effort to satisfy the members of the teaching profession, that he will be able to make them contented men and women, with a salary sufficient to enable them and their families to live in reasonable comfort&mdash; so that they will be able to say publicly and openly through the headquarters of their organisation: &ldquo;We are satisfied that an Irish Government is doing its best to improve our lot.&rdquo; Unless we reach that position we will not be able to get the education that we require for our youth.  The teachers' salary crux should be cleared up once and for all by this or by some Government.  There should be arbitration and conciliation.  Peaceful methods should be used to bring about a happy position so far as the teaching profession is concerned.  I think if an effort were made that position could be reached.</P>
    <P>We all know very well that at the present time an ignoramus of any type can earn far more than a principal teacher.  That is a thing that is upsetting members of the teaching profession.  They are wedded to their present positions and cannot leave them.  They can see any kind of a Tom, Dick or Harry who goes to England able to earn anything from £15 to £20 a week, while the teachers who helped to mould their characters have to be satisfied with perhaps £ a month or £10 a week.  I hold that, next to our clergy, the most important people in this country are the teachers. Their positions are almost as important <Col N="1319" /> as those of the teachers who are members of the religious orders. The moulding of the minds and the hearts of our youth is in their hands. If the members of the teaching profession are not contented they cannot do their work in the way they should.  We all know that it is in their hands to make this a good or a bad nation.  The salary trouble that has been brewing for a long number of years should have been eased long ago.  The reason why we are not getting the results that we expect is because something has not been done to ease that position.  On top of that we have too many bad schools.  I certainly do not blame the previous Government or this Government, for they have been trying to build new schools, but I know that there is a good deal of leeway to make up yet.  There are hundreds and hundreds of old shacks of schools, some of them over 120 years of age, which have been torn down and new edifices put in their places.  But it takes more than the Government to do these things.  We will have to see our managers and our Ministers of State and our teachers coming closer together and taking proper note, in the interests of a better type of community life for our people, of the need for more good schools in the country.</P>
    <P>Anywhere you go you can see, as throughout the Midlands, fine new schools properly built and equipped being erected, where there is a contented teaching staff working in a happy school; but a few miles further on you will see an old shack perhaps over 120 years of age with rats coming up through the floors, and damp everywhere.  It is humiliating and a disgrace after 30 years of native government and it is time that we spent millions of pounds&mdash;I do not care where it comes from&mdash;getting rid of those old shacks. You cannot expect a teacher to be contented when he sees a few miles away a lovely school in lovely surroundings with lovely outoffices and sanitation, and he has to come into an old shack with up to 70 or 80 children there together with steam-rising from their damp clothes and where they have no facilities, and to see that happening <Col N="1320" /> year after year.  We should get shut of these old schools.  We have spent millions and millions of pounds in other ways, badly spent money.  If we spent those millions to give proper facilities in the schools we would get somewhere.</P>
    <P>I know a good deal about teaching, because I am in the midst of it and because I mix a good deal with teachers, and I am satisfied that there is too much moving of teachers throughout the country.  A new teacher may come from the South of Ireland and settle down in the Midlands, and find no facilities there.  Often he is a married man with a young family growing up, and he finds that he has no home and no means of building one. Even where there is a new school there is no school house there for the teacher.  There should be an effort made, where a new school is built, to have at least a school house or two for the principal teachers in that school. There is no reason why we should not do it.  We build houses for Civic Guards and we make no provision whatever for national teachers although we must agree that they are the foremost persons in the land or in the parish.  They have to do everything for the community life there, be the secretary of this and the secretary of that, and we expect them after school hours to go out and start reviving the Gaelic League, starting feiseanna and all that, and they go home and have no house or roof over their own heads.  It is time that we had an Irish outlook and saw that where we built school houses we would build also good teachers' residences.  They are entitled to that.</P>
    <P>A new teacher may stay in such a place for a few years, but then we find him searching for advertisements in the papers and answering them and going to the big towns and cities because facilities are there for the education of their children and they can get a home over their heads.  Unless we tackle these things you will find that we will have only third- or fourth-rate teaching in the country areas and people leaving for the cities for the good things of life.  Let the good things of life be given to the people in the country areas, because every honest <Col N="1321" /> Irishman knows that the cities have nothing more than you can find in England, France and continental countries and that everything that is really good comes from the country areas, where people are living in communion with the Almighty Himself out in the green fields.  I have seen some teachers in country areas spending whole weeks there trying to find, not alone a house but a room for shelter, and they cannot get it; and many of them have to take the next opportunity of getting away.  They should not be put in this humiliating position of having been educated and giving of their best to carry on their profession in an honourable way and yet being unable to find even a shack to come to.  I think we ought to study this seriously and see where we stand.</P>
    <P>With regard to examinations, there is too much cramming and concentration on getting results.  Whether it is the national schools or the convent schools or any other type, the children are being crammed there to get results, and if they do not get them they are afraid of their lives, worried and troubled by what So-and-so will think about them &ldquo;if you don't win to-morrow&rdquo;.  You find the bigger schools publishing in the local papers the results they got, and another school will come along with its successes.  The effect is that the poor kids come to the ground and their nerves are racked.  I do not believe we want them to concentrate on examinations and results.  What you want to bring out is a balanced man or woman with a true vocation in life, and let them be content with the small things.  Do not be risking their health and spending enormous amounts of money from their parents' pockets for examination results when often you find that the money is money thrown away and the children are left with nothing to look to only the emigrant ship.  We ought to be content with the simple things. Let them have an ordinary simple, decent education.  We are training them for Ireland and not for export abroad, and for the future generation of the Irish nation built on the simple Irish way of life, and we should get rid of this highfalutin nonsense, because it is nothing more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1322" /> I saw some men myself who were educated in Oxford come home to Ireland and try to settle down, but they never could settle down because they were too highly educated&mdash;highly cultured, lovely people to speak to, but they were complete failures, and they were the greatest sources of trouble in any area I ever came into because they were too big for their boots and they could not stand down. These things go to show that the education that really matters is built on simple things, trying to turn out a balanced man, who can be a cultured man.  In this country over the last 30 or 35 years we had the Irish Volunteers.  Did they spring from the higher schools, the academies and all that?  No, they sprang from the ordinary national school, 90 per cent. of them, and they got no further, but they moulded the destinies of this country in their own way and made a success of it.  Ought that not be a headline for the whole lot of us?  We ought to follow it with strict attention because this country is just as good in the matter of education as any other in Europe and indeed far beyond some of them, because from what I read of some countries they are very primitive. We ought to be proud of that fact.  We have a good balanced people, and they are educated enough to hold their own with the best elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In connection with vocational education, I am satisfied that it is making a reasonable drive in the last eight or ten years.  There was a time when it was in its infancy and it was in a weak condition.  You could not get people to go to vocational schools then, but they are all crammed and filled up now by the people, as they realise that results are being got there.  There is, however, too much concentration on the big school in big centres, which is upsetting the people in the country areas.  They have to go to the big centre and there they get the new outlook and the new ideas and you never get them back to the country.  We will have to concentrate more on putting an additional class room to the national schools, no matter what the cost.  It will be worth it, so as to get a balanced nation.  Attached to the national school should be a centre for <Col N="1323" /> the vocational school, teaching cookery, dressmaking, carpentry and so on.  We should let the people learn to fend for themselves in their own homes.</P>
    <P>There should never be any necessity for a farmer in a country area to have to hire a carpenter, a contractor or even an engineer.  Every farmer should be able to do his own work.  Not that I am bragging or boasting, but I never allow in either the one or the other.  I do all the work myself and could not have done it had it not been that I went to those schools in my young days and made good use of them and when I left off I was able to see the road ahead and go along it.  I was able to build my own houses and do my own engineering, yet I am only an ordinary type of person.  I do not see why every farmer should not do these things for himself, instead of going to the State for this, that and the other. We have little State grants for this and that and at the end of the year we are growling that the taxation has gone up.  We want none of these State sops, if we are to educate our people to be balanced men, able to work for themselves and in the interests of the country.  It would save millions of pounds if we turned out the right type of people.</P>
    <P>The primary teacher should not have to continue on a smaller salary than the vocational teacher.  Primary education is the centre and the chief pivot and the national teacher should be the highest paid in the land, but he is not. Vocational teachers at a certain age have a higher salary than primary teachers.  That is wrong, as the primary teacher is the pivot of the whole machinery.  Until his salary is brought up to the level of the vocational teacher his troubles will not be eased.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I do not like in the revival spirit in connection with the feiseanna.  Many vocational teachers have to rush into that field and work up these feiseanna, not for the purpose of the revival or for an Irish Ireland but to put in teaching hours so that they can get better salaries.  That is a shocking spirit.  I give them every credit for going out <Col N="1324" /> in the open and working to spread these cultures, but I do not like materialism where there should be a spirit of self-sacrifice.  When you have these teachers working to get a stipend it is wrong and it is killing everything. You find the feis platform packed with vocational teachers of all types.  They take over centres and use them, not so much for the furtherance of the language as in order to make their salary go a little further.  That is a wrong spirit and a rotten spirit.  All honour to those who are doing that work: if they were content and had proper teaching hours they would do it for the sake of resurrecting the culture, without any charge, in that spirit of self-sacrifice.</P>
    <P>There are people who made trojan sacrifices, who will still and would, only that they are shoved to one side by this group of people who try to get their salaries up by putting in special hours in this way.  That shocking position should be ended, otherwise we will get no private enterprise or private effort from our people.  In our young days there was hardly a parish, let alone a county, that had not some Irish Ireland revival, some method of reviving the language and the culture. A man would get up on a crock of a bicycle, with perhaps no tyres, and go 40 miles to help a feis and would ride back in the middle of the night with not even a lamp.  Now you would not get a man to go in a Rolls Royce 20 miles unless there was some big carnival where he could have a royal time.  That spirit must change and it can be changed.</P>
    <P>I believe in self-sacrifice and in the spirit of the people, reviving these things in their own little areas.  Let every parish be the pivot of activity to interest the people at home, to get them work and to make them able to speak the Irish language and proud to speak it, at the crossroads, in the schoolroom and outside the chapel gate.  Let them be proud to do it in the face of those who sneer at it.  But they are too weak and not able to do it and they have no lead from the top.  I, myself, believe the Irish language can be revived and will be revived and should be revived and that an effort <Col N="1325" /> should be made by the whole lot of us. We must kill shoneenism and priggishness all over the country which sneers at the efforts of the people.  Why should we not have our language? Germany has her language, Belgium has her language, Holland has her language, Britain has her language. Why should we not have ours?  Surely we are not a set of shoneens after 30 years; surely we will make some advance, that we may see the day when this will be an Irish speaking nation and we will be proud of it.  There is no reason why we should not be able to step, four square, the whole nation, to see that it is revived and revived in a manly Irish spirit, not by flying in the teeth of someone else but by bringing the people along with us, saying at the top that we are in earnest.  I believe that there is no such thing as earnestness at the top. We have a few glib words every year and a few openings of feiseanna by Ministers or chief men.  But there is no effort being made; it is all linked up with political ballyhoo and that is what has us where we are to-day.  We should get away from that.  There will be very little progress until we let the people see we are sincere, that any money spent is well spent, that we are making an honest effort and not just trying to slip politics across someone else.  We must get that out to the people and then we will get somewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a man I am glad to see as Minister for Education.  He sprang from the people, when they wanted him he was there, and his spirit and outlook are the same as 20 years ago.  His predecessor, Deputy Mulcahy, was the same.  I was proud to see that type of man with the destinies of Irish education in his hands. It is in proper hands and in keeping with the spirit of the men who went before us.  If there had been a little more realism and sincerity and a more open approach to the many problems holding back this nation, we would have got better results.  We will not get them while we keep going as we are, with a discontented teaching profession, with national schools that are a public disgrace, with shoneenism bleeding the country white of its people, with boys and girls of 14 and <Col N="1326" /> 15 going out of the country while there could be plenty of work for every one of them in their own country areas where they could marry and settle down and build more houses.  We are allowing that drift because we are on different sides of this House, but I say the whole lot of us will come to the ground if we do not realise the responsibility that is placed on our shoulders by the living and the dead to carry on an Irish nation that everyone could be proud of.  We are adopting the slippery game, and if we keep going on as we are, people will rise up and curse the very name of the living generation, because we have sold the people.  The day is ripe for a complete review of our problems, to see if we are training our children to be future citizens of this country or if we are training them for another country.  I will not say any more, though there is plenty I could say.  We live in the midst of drift, not to the land but from the land, and that is directly caused by our own shoneenism.</P>

      <P>I wish to avail of this opportunity to bring under the Minister's notice that a number of schools in my area in North Mayo are in a very bad condition.  Deputy Browne, speaking in this debate last week, mentioned Callow and Straide, but I know some schools that are worse.  Last October I had a discussion with the Minister and some of his officials, but so far I regret to say that not one of the schools I mentioned has been repaired.  This is unworthy.  The winter will be coming on again and nothing is being done with these schools.  It is a sad state of affairs that teachers and pupils are compelled to spend their days in insanitary schools.  I hope the Minister will try to remedy this state of affairs.  Some of these schools have to be replaced. I know of schools that were supposed to be replaced for the last five years. There is one school, Treanbeg, that was examined two or three years ago.  New sites were examined.  I have been told that they are going back to the first site that was examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases new schools are required owing to the increase in the <Col N="1327" /> number of school-going children.  No matter how I try, I can get nothing done about providing the new schools. I hope the Minister will insist that good school accommodation will be provided.  Areas where new schools are required include: Doohoma, Muingingan, Treanbeg, Sheeaun.</P>
    <P>I come now to a question that worries us considerably in North Mayo. The population is very scattered.  I would respectfully request the Minister to widen the regulations governing the transport of children to and from school.  It is unfair that small children in cold, mountain districts should have to travel three miles and more in winter weather to and from school. They are bound to get wet and have to spend the whole day in their wet clothes in school and then tramp home again.  It should be possible to provide transport for such children.  That would prevent the possibility of their being patients in a sanatorium.  I would suggest that the Minister should consider transporting children, where there would be at least six children, from any place that is over two miles from a school.  The money would be well spent.  I know of townlands in Mayo where children have to travel four miles to school.  They are: Altnabrucky, Sheeaun-Burren, Glinsk-Glenamoy, Derryhillagh, Doonaroya. In these areas we cannot get the number of children required under the regulations.  Therefore, I would respectfully request the Minister to broaden the school transport regulations so as to allow children from backward areas to be brought to school.  The children in these areas are sufficiently handicapped already.  It is unfair to ask them to travel three miles to and from school every day.</P>
    <P>There is another question that is worrying me.  In certain areas in Mayo it is not possible to get a qualified teacher.  I do not know how the Minister will get over that difficulty. The children are already handicapped enough without having to depend on untrained or inefficient teachers.</P>
    <P>These are matters that I hope the Minister will attend to.  I know he is sympathetic towards the problems of <Col N="1328" /> the children in the country, especially those in backward, mountain areas.  I trust he will do his best to remedy the matters that I have brought before him to-day.</P>

      <P>We have gone over such a wide range in regard to education that I find it difficult to know where to begin.  It is, of course, the business of an Opposition to use all legitimate means to show the Government and the Department concerned in an unfavourable light.  I have no great objection to that but it seems to be that much of the discussion has been an advocacy of perfectionism.  If we are to tackle all the problems in the way that would be advocated here, I am afraid the Education Estimate would swamp the whole Budget.</P>
      <P>First of all, about the school buildings.  I have great sympathy with Deputy Calleary in regard to the building or the repair of schools in his district.  That is not a problem that confines itself to County Mayo.  It is a widespread problem and covers the whole Twenty-Six Counties.  If we are to get any respect for education or any concern for education in the country, one of the first things we must do as a Government, as public representatives, is to provide schools which will show the respect we ourselves have for education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied, of course, that the State is wholly blameworthy in regard to the present condition of the schools.  We have made a good deal of progress in the provision of well-designed schools suitable for their purpose.  I am not quite satisfied with the association there is between the Department of Education and the Board of Works.  I am not satisfied that a survey of the condition of school buildings has been completed, that we know what the problem is, and I certainly find myself in the Department of Education without proper control of one aspect of it, that is, the building and the repair of schools.  A change must be made in that association between the Department of Education and the Board of Works if we are to make the progress in the provision <Col N="1329" /> of school buildings that we should make.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to Deputy Cogan and to Deputy Desmond for the attitude they have taken up in regard to the maintenance of schools and the local contribution.  I am determined that, no matter what difficulties school managers may find themselves in, no school in future will be built in any area if there is not some attempt made to provide the local contribution.  The good times are gone.  The times when somebody could come into the Department of Education and get away with no contribution are finished.  There will have to be a local contribution if we are to cultivate any sense of responsibility in the people, any personal concern among them for education.</P>
    <P>I have heard this year and again last year something about the cleaning and heating of schools.  Some of the Deputies here were horrified at the idea that a much greater expenditure could not be undertaken or would not be undertaken in regard to cleaning and heating, particularly cleaning. They were horrified at the idea. Deputy Alfred Byrne was one, some Deputy in the Labour Party was another of those who protested against the idea that children should be in any fashion asked to keep the school in the condition in which it should be kept.  I have no desire to impose any undue efforts on teacher or child in relation to keeping the school in proper condition.  I read a few days ago in the <i>Irish School Weekly</i> an account of &ldquo;A Country School of Long Ago&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Two children arrived early to light the fire and dust the room; two remained late to sweep the room and leave things tidy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies are horrified that that should happen to-day&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Our annual examination was held in April.  School and grounds were thoroughly spring-cleaned for the great occasion.  Parents spread fresh gravel on the playground, and the manager got the well cleaned out, the hedges clipped, and the schoolroom whitewashed.  Then the <Col N="1330" /> pupils took over.  We swept and dusted and polished with a will.  The little ones gathered moss and primroses, for last thing on examination eve we filled the window-sills with damp moss dotted with bunches of primroses.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The <i>Irish School Weekly</i> for June 6th, 1953.  That is the story of a happy successful school where the teacher inspired many of the pupils to become the exemplary pupils which they became.  I can see no reason in the world why that condition should not be continued in the school.  I know that in the ordinary country school the charwoman will once a week give a thorough cleansing to the school.  Surely the children could do a good deal towards keeping the school neat and tidy during the week.  While I am being criticised very severely for making that statement, I still make it.  I think it is true. The only alternative to it is probably to spend at least another £100,000 on an attribute of education which has very little to do with education.</P>
      <P>As to the heating of schools, the whole trouble is the inadequate fireplaces.  Many of the old fireplaces are merely swallowers of turf and coal and provide no heat throughout the schoolroom.  We cannot very well remedy that in the older schools, those that have to be rebuilt.  But in the newer schools it is quite possible to give an even heating temperature and that is being done.</P>
      <P>When I came into the Department of Education, one of the ideas I had was that we would not be able to go full tilt ahead with the provision of the schools we need as our building trades operatives are absorbed in the housing drive.  Knowing that that would ease up at some particular time, I had hoped that we would absorb the disemployed building workers in a drive to provide these schools.  That can be done and it should be done.  I am making every effort to ensure that it shall be done and I want the full support of every Party in the House in getting it done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> Deputy Palmer kicked off by telling us that the teachers were improperly trained, that they were too secluded from the general life of the country, and urged that we should provide university training for them.  As I said in my opening statement, with very few exceptions, our teachers have proved to be good teachers, to have benefited as a result of the courses of training they got.  I have stated already and I say again that I see no reason for changing the system of training or the conditions under which teachers are trained.  If it is said that the students are too cut off from the general life of the country, the same may be said of every secondary school in the country. In our preparatory schools, the very same conditions obtain as obtain in the secondary schools throughout the country.  I think Deputy Cunningham had something to say about that&mdash;that many of them become teachers by accident.  I became Minister by a pure accident.  Whatever we become, very few of us become what we are as a result of a definite plan from the day we came out of the cradle.  Most world happenings are ruled by an outside power over which we have no control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ormonde spoke about the rather niggardly way in which the Government treated ex-teachers who retired at a particular date.  Those teachers got everything that was due to them according to contract.  They got something more; they got an <i>ex-gratia</i> grant which my predecessor, taking the same view as I did, made every attempt to secure for them and was unable to secure for them.  Owing to the more enlightened outlook of another Minister for Finance, I was able to secure a substantial benefit for them and there should be no particular grouse about that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer and Deputy Gallagher spoke of the extra-mural activities of teachers.  I have seen many of them interest themselves with work outside the school with which the children were concerned.  That attitude on the part of these teachers represents the difference between the professional man and, shall we say, the businessman.  One <Col N="1332" /> is prepared to do something away and beyond what he is paid for and the other is not.  If we are merely going to depend for education on the amount of work we can pay for, we will never have education.  If men are not sufficiently interested in the work to do that little bit extra, without pay, then there is very little use talking about professionalism among teachers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer also misunderstood the idea of training for backward children.  He said that putting children into a backward class gave them an inferiority complex.  That is not true.  We find that in organising a backward class and putting it into operation the child grew brighter and more effective. Some of them were able to go back again to the ordinary classes and do well in them.  It is in the ordinary schools where those children are left that the damage is being done and not where we are doing it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Palmer also said that a school inspector generally picks on the backward and dull child in the class and by questioning him makes him feel inferior and incompetent.  We all have experience of that.  Somebody comes along to examine and he puts his finger on the weak point.  I am sure Deputy Palmer exaggerated much because no inspector, no decent man, will try to embarrass a child of that nature.  I do not think there is any substance in Deputy Palmer's argument.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney and Deputy Desmond spoke about school books.  I cannot understand why the ordinary school book should pass to every member of a family.  I do not understand how the ordinary cheap school book can be used for more than one year by one child and survive to be used by another the next time.  There is a fairly reasonable amount provided for the purchase of school books by necessitous people.  It may be necessary that that should be expanded, but I do not think the argument that a book should pass from generation to generation holds good.  I have been trying to propagate the idea of the development everywhere of a school library.  I feel that would save books a good deal.  I think that the libraries would have a <Col N="1333" /> tremendously educative effect upon the child if we organised them everywhere. I am hopeful of doing that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham was rather doleful.  As usual, he made the statement that the teachers were not paid as well as the members of other professions.  Mind you, it would be very interesting to find out how a number of supposedly highly paid professional men are paid.  I want to be quite clear on the question of my proposal of free time for teachers to do what they want in the schools.  Deputy Cunningham disapproved completely of it.  He did not see anything in the idea.  He did not understand it.  I did not mention a half hour a day.  I mentioned a free half day every week in which the teacher might use his own initiative without inspection, examination or question.  I hold the idea that each teacher has his own particular line of country, some ideas of his own and some capacity of his own in respect of which he is far beyond his fellow.  If given an opportunity of using his particular gift on the child it would be valuable for the child.  It would be the ideal thing in the school to let the teacher do what he likes all the time. That is my idea, but all teachers have not the capacity to handle a problem like a school completely without regulations.  Some exceptional man might do it.  If we gave half a day a week to the teacher to permit him to do a particular subject or any subject he wanted it would have the effect of broadening the child's mind and of giving the child a much greater interest in education.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Cunningham talk about the overloading of the programme.  I have been hearing about the overloading of the programme for many years.  I am not concerned with anything in the schools except the teaching of the three R's. All this talk about the grave problem of teaching two languages, as if it were a most unbearable burden, is something in which I do not believe.  I do not believe it is an argument.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about Irish and the compulsory teaching of Irish.  The compulsion that is spoken <Col N="1334" /> of does not exist in the schools, to my mind.  It would be unwise, in my view, that we should try to educate any child in a language which he does not understand, and there is no attempt to do so.  Children are taught through the medium of Irish when they understand Irish and when the teacher is thoroughly competent to teach through the medium of Irish.  Otherwise, they are discouraged from the use of Irish in teaching the ordinary subjects.  I think that is as it should be, but this story about compulsory Irish is more than exaggerated.  It is untrue.  I want to say again that I have no use for those people who blather about &ldquo;bás don Bhéarla&rdquo;.  I think it would be tragic for us if we were to lose the English language.  I think the wise thing is to aim at bilingualism.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blowick spoke about the closing of schools in the Gaeltacht.  I am most adverse to the closing of any school.  It is only when I find it impossible to carry on in any reasonable fashion in such a school that I would consent to close it.  As far as I can remember, the problem arose in Deputy Blowick's area in relation to the impossibility of getting a teacher.  That is a problem which, I think, Deputy Calleary raised a while ago.  I have no way of forcing teachers to go into backward schools and, unfortunately, a school has to be closed now and again.  I think Deputy Blowick will admit that it is only under grave circumstances of difficulty that we close any school.  I am completely against the idea of closing a school if we can keep it open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned the question of trade apprentices not being accepted in vocational schools because the classes were already filled with amateurs&mdash;people who went there as a pastime.  I think that is wrong.  If <Col N="1335" /> Deputy Corish is right in what he says, I think that in the vocational schools we must make provision at least first for trade apprentices.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of the 7th June last, we read the following paragraph in an article entitled: &ldquo;Schools fit to learn in&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The educational authorities have too marked a tendency to boast of what they have done&mdash;a good deal, admittedly&mdash;and too little apparent anxiety to realise the vast amount that remains to be done.  The children of Ireland must be given the schools they deserve.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not correct.  We in the Department do not boast of what we have done.  We realise the vast amount that has to be done.  I think that we talk too little about ourselves and that we need to indulge in a little publicity. The annual report of all Departments arrives about three years late.  While it may be a valuable document from a statistical point of view it is very little use from a publicity point of view.  So little do we publicise ourselves that recently I read this extract in a Danish textbook used for the teaching of English:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;IRELAND&mdash;And now at last I shall tell you a little about Ireland. It is a farming country.  The people live in little villages and work in the fields.  Most of the Irish are poor. They grow potatoes, and keep cows, pigs and chickens.  The ground is generally too wet for corn, so the Irish do not eat much bread.  They use potatoes instead.  They live in small cottages; most of them have only two rooms.  The floor inside the cottage is only the hard ground, and the pigs and chickens go in and out as they like.</P>
    <P>There is a big city called Belfast, which has many factories.  They make Irish linen there, such as tablecloths and handkerchiefs.</P>
    <P>Belfast is in Ulster, which still belongs to Great Britain, but the rest of Ireland is now called the Irish Republic or Eire and is now quite independent of the British Empire.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> That was in a school book published in 1952 and used for the teaching of English.  Instead of saying that we talk too much about our accomplishments we ought to do a little talking about them and let people in other countries know what we are doing.</P>

      <P>Oh no.  I gave my views in relation to education, and what we are trying to do in that regard, in my opening remarks and I am now replying to the few worth-while points that were made.</P>
      <P>I agree very much with Deputy Calleary that there is a grave necessity for speeding-up the repair of school buildings and I am very much concerned with the reorganisation of the methods for tackling that problem.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Mulcahy that our relations with the teachers are good.  I think that as we appreciate their worth so also do they understand our difficulties.  We want to continue these harmonious relations and we hope that this conciliation scheme will be resumed immediately the legal proceedings are over.  Meanwhile, we have made certain arrangements which tend to preserve what I call the harmonious relations and, therefore, we have very little difficulty on that head at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to impress on the Dáil that we will not get respect or concern for education if we do not concern ourselves deeply with the provision of new schools and the putting of the structurally sound schools into good condition.  We will not get respect or concern for education unless we insist on a local contribution for the erection of the schools and we must try to insist on the proper maintenance of the schools.  I was in one school which was 120 years old.  It is a bright school and in perfect condition&mdash;as good as if it were built only ten years ago. There must have been a succession of good teachers and managers there.  On the other hand, I have seen other schools built as recently as 30 years ago and they are complete wrecks.  If we are going to permit anybody to allow <Col N="1337" /> schools to deteriorate to that extent in 30 years, we shall never overcome the difficulty of building all the schools we need.  Therefore, we must have not merely a strong effort by the Department of Education but also the co-operation of the people generally in maintaining and keeping the schools.</P>

      <P>I am concerned for this. You must give the children the fundamentals.  They must be taught to read, write and cipher.  If you cannot give them that, they cannot do anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in my opening remarks that I read all the textbooks for the teaching of the English language.  I found them good, interesting and educative.  I condemn the Baldwin Reader because, while it was written by a really good writer and was intended very much to be a rural reader, it was not something that would grip the minds of the children.  It was away and beyond them. It was for a city man with a sort of a yearning for the country but who did not understand what the country was. I hated the Baldwin Reader long ago. The only people I heard speak in praise of it were very old parish priests&mdash;and none of them became a farmer as a result of reading Baldwin.  It might be possible&mdash;and I should like to do it &mdash;to give some rural bias in our training in the schools.  I think it can be done, but not by way of Baldwin.  I have seen a number of charts and some exhibits in vocational schools which were <Col N="1338" /> of tremendous interest to me and which would, I think, grip the minds of children.  By way of such charts and certain exhibits, we would probably get an interest in local matters.  It all boils down, however, to the fact that it all depends on the teacher.  If we had the teacher we could do anything. Where you have a teacher with that particular type of mind, you can do anything with children.</P>

      <P>The problem is not great in the country.  In the rural schools, it is a very small problem and is of significant proportions only in a city like Dublin.  I am speaking not of what might be called mental deficients but of rather backward children.  Mental deficients have to be dealt with in another fashion, but there are children who are retarded from one cause or another and who have to be given specialised treatment to bring them forward.</P>
      <P>It is our experience&mdash;we have the good luck to have one good man handling that particular problem at the moment&mdash;that, with the exception of those who are abnormal, most of the backward children respond to sympathetic treatment, which they cannot get in the ordinary classes.  I do not know how we could handle the very few there are in the country, but here in Dublin the only way in which it can be done is by having special classes for backward children with a special type of sympathetic teacher.  We have been very successful in one school and we propose now to extend the idea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  The total sum estimated to be needed for the year 1953-54 amounts to £5,525,310. Of this sum £1,841,000 has been granted by way of Vote on Account, leaving £3,684,310 to be granted now to complete the Vote.</P>
      <P>Deputies will observe from the printed Estimates that the total sum required for 1953-54 represents a net decrease of £1,738,920 as compared with the revised Estimate for 1952-53. The decrease includes £1,315,000 for subsidies on dairy produce, which were discontinued last year, and £955,000 in respect of repayable advances to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Teoranta, for importation of superphosphate which was a special provision for 1952-53 and is not recurrent.  The only other substantial decrease is one of £100,000 in the provision for the fertiliser credits (wheat) scheme, under sub-head O (5)&mdash;Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, etc.&mdash;which is now in its final stages.</P>
      <P>The sub-heads which show substantial increases as compared with 1952-53 are the land reclamation scheme, for which an additional sum of approximately £397,000 is provided, the ground limestone subsidy provision which is increased by £150,000, and the Grain Storage (Loans) Act, 1951, for which an additional £150,000 is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Estimates for 1953-54 were printed, I have instituted some new schemes, and the necessary provision for them is being made in a Supplementary Estimate which has been circulated to Deputies.  The estimated expenditure involved in these schemes is being met from savings on the main Estimate arising from the decision to meet cold storage allowances on creamery butter from the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund.  Apart, therefore, from a token sum of £10, the <Col N="1343" /> Supplementary Estimate does not involve any increase in the total sum required for the year.</P>
    <P>I have already circulated to Deputies a White Paper giving details of the work of my Department during the past year.  In introducing this Estimate, I would like to touch on a few matters of particular importance. In doing so let me say at the outset that the agricultural picture generally is gratifying and the best thanks of the Government and the community are due to the farmers for the efforts they have made.</P>
    <P>The January 1953 Census of Live Stock shows as compared with the 1952 figures an increase in every category except poultry.  The highlight of the returns is the rapid increase in pig numbers from 551,400 in January 1952 to 764,700 in January, 1953.  Sheep numbers also show a very satisfactory increase and there too we are within sight of the pre-war level.  Cattle numbers have risen also though naturally not to such a striking degree.</P>
    <P>The fear of a serious decline in cattle numbers which was frequently voiced during the past year has proved unfounded.  In fact the cattle industry has contributed increasingly both in volume and value to the increase in exports.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that our balance of payments has shown a remarkable improvement in the past year.  This has been due on the one hand to a decrease in the value and volume of imports and on the other to an increase in the value and volume of exports.  The agricultural industry has contributed largely to this improved position.  Agricultural exports make up practically 75 per cent. of total exports.  In the year ended March, 1953, the total value of agricultural exports was £73,000,000.  The corresponding figure for the year ended 31st March, 1952 was £65,000,000 and for the year ended 31st March, 1951, was £57,000,000.</P>
    <P>On the other hand imports of wheat, maize and sugar declined from £19,500,000 in the year ended 31st March, 1952, to £16,000,000 approximately in the year ended 31st March, <Col N="1344" /> 1953.  The value of these imports amounted to £16,706,000 in the year ended 31st March, 1951.  Most notable in the development in our export trade has been the substantial increase in exports of carcase meat and tinned meat.  Exports of these two items amounted to £11,996,000 in the year ended 31st March, 1953, as against £8,514,000 in the year ended 31st March, 1952, and £2,747,000 in the year ended 31st March, 1951.  The past year has also seen the revival of our important trade in pigmeat.  Exports of pork carcases to Britain commenced in July, 1952, and of bacon and hams in November, 1952.  By the end of March, 1953, some 134,000 cwt. of pork and 62,000 cwt. of bacon and hams had been exported; the total value of these exports was £3,317,000.  The increase in pork exports is noteworthy, particularly as up to 1952 we had no exports of pork.  A most encouraging feature of this increase in pigmeat production is that it has been based mainly on home-grown feeding stuffs&mdash;indeed during the past 12 months imports of maize declined by as much as 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>The relatively recent and important trade in chocolate crumb has now reached a new high level; exports for the year ended March, 1953, were £5,308,000 as compared with £4,136,000 for the year ended March, 1952, and £2,718,000 for the year ended 31st March, 1951.</P>
    <P>There was also a notable increase in exports of sheep and lambs alive and dead.  The total value of exports of fat sheep, store sheep and lambs to Britain and the Six Counties for the year ended March, 1953, was £1,319,000 compared with £462,000 for the year ended March, 1952, and £369,000 for the year ended 31st March, 1951. Exports of mutton and carcase lamb amounted to £729,000 in the year ended 31st March, 1953, as against £297,000 in the year ended 31st March, 1952, and £400,000 in the year ended 31st March, 1951.</P>
    <P>The export of wool, which declined somewhat in the beginning of 1952 because of the fall from the very steep level which prices had reached following the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, showed an upward trend in the <Col N="1345" /> past six months or so.  In poultry and eggs we continued to maintain the export figures of the past few years. The marketing of eggs and poultry has encountered new problems since the British Ministry of Food decided to decontrol the price of eggs in Britain from the end of March last.  This is one of the changes in our export markets for which we must prepare. In the long run, however, these changes should not operate to our disadvantage if the quality of our eggs is maintained, if we produce more eggs in the second half of the year when prices are high, and if the costs of production are kept low by the better and more widespread use of home-grown feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>The question of feeding stuffs brings me to what has been one of the main features of Government policy during the past year.  I refer to the drive for an increase in the area under tillage.  Starting in the early part of the winter of last year and continuing until the end of spring, my Department maintained a steady publicity drive for increased tillage.  I have no doubt whatever that the substantial expansion of tillage provides the surest basis for a growing and profitable live-stock economy in this country.  The principal factor limiting the very necessary increase in our agricultural production is the large area of land under permanent pasture.  We have here some 12,000,000 acres of potentially arable land of which only about 1,750,000 acres are under tillage, leaving 10,000,000 acres of grassland of very varying quality.  Up to 3,000,000 acres should eventually be tilled annually in order to ensure the optimum use of all our arable land.  The drive which we instituted has, as far as we can see, produced good results.  I expect a substantial increase in the area under wheat and the overall area under tillage is likely to be greater than it was last year.  I should like to think that our farmers now realise the value of feeding barley as a stock food.</P>
    <P>It is my policy to maintain and extend the use of education and educational propaganda so as to bring the farmers of this country to realise that a prosperous future for them lies in greater tillage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> The Government, in advocating a substantial increase in tillage, has two main purposes in view.  In the first place, we are convinced of the need to maintain a large area under wheat, which is a security crop.  To ensure that an adequate area of wheat is sown we have guaranteed what every reasonable person must regard as an attractive price.  We must avoid finding ourselves in the position, should international conditions alter, of having to depend to an unnecessary extent on the goodwill of other countries to maintain a supply of bread for our people here.  The fact of being put in such a position of dependence could have very serious repercussions should conditions arise in which normal supplies would be seriously threatened. Secondly, and this is also most important, we are quite satisfied that there can be no permanent and profitable expansion of live-stock production in this country and particularly the production of pigs and poultry so long as we continue to depend largely on imports of maize.  Neither the supply nor price of maize is within our control or even affected by our purchases, while we have now, through the growing of feeding barley, high-yielding potatoes, fodder beet and silage, the means at our disposal to achieve such an expansion profitably and independently. Imported maize is now too dear as the principal food for pigs and poultry. While its price has over the past year come down somewhat, it has in recent months hardened again and there is no guarantee that we shall ever have abundant and cheap maize in this country again.  Only by producing our pigs and poultry on feeding barley and on oats grown on the farm can we hope to compete in the export market.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of an area under tillage commensurate with the total amount of arable land offers a magnificent opportunity for good rotational farming and a substantial increase in the ploughing up and reseeding of old permanent pastures.  Grass in our conditions is still the cheapest feed and we can get good grass most quickly and profitably by more tillage.</P>
    <P>Over the past year there have been frequent references to the alleged <Col N="1347" /> stagnation of our agriculture.  Our farmers have been accused of producing now little more than their great-grandfathers did 100 years ago.  I should like now to put very briefly before you a few points which I think will place this matter in better perspective.</P>
    <P>It would be very hazardous to draw any definite conclusions from comparisons of output now and output 100 years ago, if only because of the great uncertainty attaching to the earlier figures.  Moreover, any comparison between agricultural output now and output then must have regard to the special circumstances of production in the different periods.  A point too often forgotten is that the total population of the Twenty-Six Counties declined by 42 per cent. between 1851 and 1951 and that, in recent times, there has been a continuing decline in the number of male workers engaged in farm work.  The number of these workers fell from 579,409 in 1934 to 499,542 in 1948, to 452,704 in 1951, and to 441,000 in 1952.  That is to say, there was a decline of almost 24 per cent. in the number of male agricultural workers between 1934 and 1952.  The volume of net agricultural output excluding turf was approximately 2 per cent. higher in 1952 than in 1934; this means that output per male worker increased by around 27 per cent. between 1934 and 1952.  I hope that the figure for 1953 of agricultural output will indicate a still greater level of output.</P>
    <P>In comparing agricultural output here with that of other European countries full regard should be had to the fact that, while the population of this country fell drastically over the last 100 years, that of other European countries increased considerably.  This increase in population has in itself created a growing and secure internal market for agricultural producers in these countries.  The internal market in many European countries has been further widened by the expansion of industrialisation.  Producers in these countries could expand their output in the knowledge of an expanding home <Col N="1348" /> market for their production.  The existence of a large industrial sector in the economy naturally gives greater resources and flexibility to the State for support, where necessary, of the agricultural producer than in the case of countries with a relatively less substantial industrial sector.</P>
    <P>In some discussions of agricultural output, I have noticed a tendency to decry the system of small holdings which prevails in this country as an obstacle to expansion of output.  This point of view leans heavily on the possibilities of increased output through large-scale mechanisation.  It should be remembered that very high levels of agricultural output have in fact been achieved in farming communities where the average holding is much the same as in this country and particularly where agricultural effort is directed largely to the production of live stock and live-stock products.  Furthermore, in a predominantly agricultural economy such as ours, the system of small holdings is of very great national and social significance.</P>
    <P>The scope for guaranteeing prices to agricultural producers here is, in practice, limited to a few commodities which can be wholly absorbed on the home market.  Over 30 per cent. of our total agricultural output is disposed of in outside markets.  If the amount of agricultural output consumed by farmers themselves is deducted from the total, the proportion of the remainder disposed of on outside markets is approximately 46 per cent. Because of the limitations of the home market, any increase in agricultural output over present levels, apart from increased production of wheat, sugar beet and feeding stuffs, must be sold abroad.  The level of output is therefore directly influenced by the scope and nature of the export outlets available.  Where these outlets have been reasonably satisfactory, the agricultural community has taken advantage of them, and it may be remarked that in recent years exports of beef and cattle, in terms of live animals, have risen as follows:&mdash;1948, 405,000; 1949, 523,000; 1950, 591,000; 1951, 642,000; 1952, 739,000.  On the other hand, the <Col N="1349" /> relatively unfavourable export prices for eggs in 1951 caused a marked recession in our poultry and egg production.</P>
    <P>Our principal need still is for greater economic activity and a higher level of international trade on the basis of balancing our international accounts. Realisation of this objective will require a further and rapid expansion in agricultural production and exports. The farming community of this country has not failed us in the past and I am confident that our farmers will respond to the requirements of the present circumstances with the same goodwill that they displayed in the emergency years.</P>
    <P>Hopeful signs in this direction are indeed increasing.  During the past spring I was very glad to see a considerable increase in the usage of fertilisers.  Fertiliser prices went up considerably in 1952 mainly because of the effects of the Korean war, and purchases fell away.  Indeed we know that many other European countries had the same experience.  Supplies this year were good, prices were lower and possibly, too, because of a fuller realisation by farmers of the benefits to be derived from fertilisers much greater quantities have been used than in the spring of 1952.  By comparison with other countries in Western Europe, however, we are still relatively very low in the scale of fertiliser utilisation, and there is accordingly great scope for further improvement.  One of the surest and most direct ways of securing increased agricultural production is to use fertilisérs adequately.</P>
    <P>The increase in the use of ground limestone continues.  In the year ended March, 1953, almost 500,000 tons were delivered as compared with 280,000 tons in the previous year.  There are now 27 grinding plants working, and one further plant is about to commence work.  Six more are planned.  The limestone transport subsidy scheme has up to now been eminently successful but, as the grinding plants are now fairly evenly spread throughout the country, I am at present giving consideration to whether more efficient <Col N="1350" /> means of utilising the subsidy provision can be devised.  There is no doubt that deliveries of ground limestone could be considerably improved if farmers would order their lime and accept delivery of it in the summer months.  There seems to be a fairly general opinion that ground limestone should be applied in the spring; it can equally well be spread during the summer and autumn months.  At the moment the bulk of the demand for ground limestone arises in the late winter and spring.  This results in a back-log of orders and consequent delays.  There is no reason why delivery could not be efficiently spread out over the year to the greater satisfaction of everybody.  Much the same tardiness in ordering takes place with fertilisers and here, too, there is an unnecessary and avoidable strain on the delivery system during the spring months.  These extreme seasonal variations in demand for ground limestone and fertilisers only result in greater cost or poorer service to the farmer.</P>
    <P>The increase in the use of lime and fertilisers is clear evidence of the good results of the educational and advisory work of my Department and of the county committees of agriculture.  The number of soil samples sent for analysis to Johnstown Castle Agricultural College during the spring of this year showed a very big increase.  I am considering proposals to relieve the pressure on the laboratory at Johnstown Castle and to speed up the work of testing by the provision of additional centres.  Considerable interest was evoked during the spring in the results of trials carried out at Johnstown Castle by my Department with ground limestone.  These results were given wide publicity in the Press.  They showed how over a period of six years the total increase per acre in the production of crops at present-day prices was £100 greater as a result of the application of ground limestone at a cost of about £2 or £3 per acre.</P>
    <P>In the past six months I have introduced a demonstration scheme to help county committees of agriculture to provide 20 tillage demonstration plots and 20 grassland plots in each county <Col N="1351" /> instructor's area.  This scheme is designed to indicate to farmers locally and practically the advantages of adequate liming and manuring.</P>
    <P>Land reclamation under the farm improvements scheme started about 1940 and continued during the war.  In 1949, the then existing scheme was extended and divided into two sections, A and B.</P>
    <P>Under Section A, a farmer who is prepared to carry out reclamation work himself is assisted by way of free grant. The grant amounts to two-thirds of the approved estimated cost of the work, including labour and materials, subject to a maximum grant.  The maximum grant has now been raised from £20 to £30 per statute acre, which includes a sum not exceeding £5 per acre to cover the cost of lime and fertilisers where necessary.  The benefits of the increased maximum grant will apply not alone to future applications but also to cases in progress.</P>
    <P>In future, arrangements for the purchase and application of lime and fertilisers to the land reclaimed under Section A will be made by the applicants concerned.  When they satisfy the Department's local officer that the requisite lime and fertilisers have been applied, a payment to them of the amount withheld from the grant to cover the provision of lime and fertilisers will be made.</P>
    <P>The number of applications received is approximately 102,000 representing 878,000 acres.  Under Section A the number of grants approved is 72,000 representing 336,000 acres, with a grant expenditure of £2,450,000 including the cost of lime and phosphates.</P>
    <P>Under Section B a farmer who is unable or does not wish to carry out the reclamation work himself, can request the Department to carry out the work on his behalf.  In such cases the farmer is required to contribute two fifths of the estimated cost of the work, subject to a maximum contribution of £12 per statute acre.  If he does not desire to pay his contribution in cash, he can arrange to have his holding charged with the appropriate amount which will be repayable by way <Col N="1352" /> of annuity calculated on the basis of 3½ per cent. interest and ½ per cent. sinking fund.  The yearly annuity for each £100 worth of work done is £4. The provision of the facility whereby farmers could arrange to have their holdings charged with an annuity necessitated the passing of the Land Reclamation Act, 1949, which empowered the Land Commission to be the collecting agency with the same powers of collection as that body has in respect of its own land purchase annuities.</P>
    <P>The number of farmers who have asked the Department to carry out the work for them is 15,280.  Plans prepared for 4,120 cases represent an acreage of 70,350.  Approximately 38,000 acres have been reclaimed on 2,060 holdings.</P>
    <P>Work is carried out on the holdings of farmers by the Department using its own machinery or employing contractors.  The Department has acquired machinery to the value of approximately £360,000.  There are 21 full units and 4 subsidiary units of drainage and reclamation machinery operating throughout the country.  In addition, there are also operating throughout the country miscellaneous items of equipment, such as excavators, crawler tractors, etc.  Arrangements for the disposal of the machinery operated by the Department, the decision in regard to which I announced at the end of 1952, are now in train.  It will be a gradual process so as to ensure the minimum dislocation of the work.  Seventy-one contractors have been assisted by way of grant or grant and loan under the land reclamation machinery scheme in acquiring machinery for land reclamation work.  A few independent contractors are also carrying out land reclamation work.</P>
    <P>Under Part IV of the land reclamation scheme, i.e., the fertilisers scheme, facilities are provided whereby farmers may have a soil analysis report on their lands on payment of a soil testing fee of 1/- per acre and may obtain credit for the purchase of fertilisers repayable as an additional charge added to their land purchase annuities.  Applicants are required to pay 10 per cent. of the cost of the <Col N="1353" /> fertilisers in cash and may pay the balance by way of annuity.  This scheme also is operated under the Land Reclamation Act, 1949.  Applications totalling 2,792, representing 143,600 acres, had been received to the end of April 1953, under this scheme. Soil tests had been made on 2,240 holdings, representing 113,500 acres, and delivery and spreading of fertilisers has been effected or arranged for approximately 900 holdings, representing 44,000 acres.  A large number of farmers, having had the soil tests taken, do not avail themselves further of the facilities provided under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Drainage pipes, both home manufactured and imported, are used in considerable quantities, and there is a ready market for all good quality home manufactured pipes.  The home production of pipes is, however, still grossly inadequate to meet the requirements of the land reclamation scheme and imports of clay pipes from Holland and the six north-eastern counties had to be continued during the year.  To the end of March, 1953, approximately 20,000,000 pipes had been imported.  Following the publication in March, 1951, of the Standard Specification (Concrete Land Drainage Pipes) Order, 1951, a number of concerns are now producing concrete pipes, which are being used in suitable ground conditions.</P>
    <P>As regards the special Connemara scheme up to the end of April, 1953, 818 applicants had been approved for grants amounting to approximately £22,000 for the execution of work on 1,097 acres.  The maximum grant has now been raised to £30 an acre with the existing maximum allowance in addition, of £8 per acre for lime, phosphates and potash.  Six hundred and two applicants had requested the Department to undertake the reclamation work for them, and work had been completed or was in course of completion on the holdings of 108 of these applicants, the area involved being 620 acres approximately.</P>
    <P>As a result of experiments carried out over a few years by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, the company was satisfied that high bogland properly <Col N="1354" /> drained, manured and cultivated, is capable of producing good crops of grass, potatoes and sugar beet.  It was accordingly decided to afford Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann financial support for a scheme of reclamation by way of grant in respect of such acreage as might be successfully reclaimed.</P>
    <P>In addition, it was decided to provide a grant under the land reclamation machinery scheme towards the purchase by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann of machinery to the value of £20,000, for use in bog reclamation work.  A grant of £6,666 13s. 4d. was paid to the company in respect of the purchase of such machinery.</P>
    <P>Under these arrangements, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann has been engaged in reclamation work at Reen Bog, Kenmare, and at Gowla Bog, near Ballyforan, County Galway.  To date, an area of approximately 17 acres reclaimed at Reen Bog and 165 acres reclaimed at Gowla Bog have qualified for payment of grants from land reclamation scheme funds.</P>
    <P>The new land reclamation scheme came into operation in June, 1949. Under Section A, up to the end of June, 1951, there were, roughly, 36,000 grants approved in respect of 159,000 acres.  The amount involved in grants was approximately £1,144,000.  The amount which was paid for work completed was approximately £177,000.</P>
    <P>Now the position is that grants have been approved in approximately 72,000 cases for 336,000 acres.  The amount approved for grants is £2,450,000.  A total of £895,000 has been paid in grants.  Therefore, a sum of £718,000 has been paid in grants since June, 1951, as against a sum of £177,000 paid before that date.</P>
    <P>Under Section B &mdash; up to the end of June, 1951, there were 2,030 plans ready, comprising 28,500 acres.  The cases completed or in course of completion were 474, involving an area of 9,200 acres.  At present, 4,120 plans, involving 70,300 acres, are ready.  The number of cases now completed or in course of completion is 2,560, involving approximately 49,000 acres.  Therefore, since June, 1951, 40,000 acres have been dealt with, as against 9,200 acres before that date.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1355" /> In 1949-50 expenditure totalled £228,147; in 1950-51, £568,666; in 1951-52, £1,619,460; in 1952-53, £2,517,602.</P>
    <P>These figures serve in themselves to demonstrate the progress made in land reclamation since the new scheme started.</P>
    <P>It is not alone in soil testing that a growing interest in the application of scientific methods to agriculture is evident.  In recent years there have been considerable increases in the number of instructors in agriculture employed by the county committees of agriculture.  In March last for instance there were 115 instructors by comparison with 105 in March, 1952, and 88 in March, 1951.  This and other signs of greater demand for scientific instruction by farmers are very welcome.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer here, too, to the use farmers have been making in recent years of veterinary aids for the combating of diseases in cattle and sheep.  A few years ago a scheme for the vaccination of calves against fluke and against worms was introduced.</P>

      <P>There was in the first few years of this scheme a notable decline in calf mortality but we have noticed over the past year that the decline has not continued.  The mortality is not, of course, anything as great as four or five years ago, but I think there is a <Col N="1356" /> danger that farmers have become overcomplacent.  I would strongly advise them to continue the use of the recommended treatment as the benefits to be derived from the very small expenditure involved are very great by comparison with the losses which can be caused by neglect.</P>

    <P>We have now in operation a total of seven main artificial insemination centres and 28 sub-stations, and the intention is to increase this number.  In 1952 there were 76,000 inseminations as compared with 32,000 in 1951 and 11,000 in 1950.  About 50 per cent. of the <Col N="1357" /> total inseminations were of dairy shorthorn cattle.</P>
    <P>This brings me to what I might call the cattle controversy, which has been occupying a considerable amount of space in the columns of newspapers over the past year.  A few months ago I reconstituted the Live-stock Consultative Council, to which I nominated as many as I could of the foremost authorities on cattle breeding.  On my meeting with this body I found very considerable divergence of opinion on the live-stock breeding policy this country should follow&mdash;one set of views tending to cancel out the other. I am satisfied that the best breeding policy is to improve the milk-producing qualities of the shorthorn cow without impairing the beef-producing qualities. At the same time it should be recognised that no one is compelled to keep shorthorn, or predominantly shorthorn, stock.  Farmers are free to keep Ayrshire or Friesian herds if they so choose.  I think, however, that too great a switch-over to milk production would not be in the country's best economic interests.</P>
    <P>It can be definitely, forecast, I think, that the external market for our meat products will be more stable than that for our milk products.  We are going to have to meet much greater competition in milk products than in beef.  I consider the shorthorn is the animal best adapted for our policy.  It is capable of giving a reasonable quantity of milk, good calves, good stores and good beef.</P>
    <P>Up to now I have dealt mainly with production achievements, problems and practices.  The farmer, like every other producer has, however, to take into account and adapt himself to, market requirements.  That brings me to one of the most important aspects of the agricultural industry, namely, the markets available to the farmer for his products.  About 30 per cent. of our total agricultural production or 46 per cent. of the net sales off farms have to be disposed of in markets outside our control.  We in the Department and the farmers themselves must keep these markets under constant review.  There is a steady trend away from price control and bulk purchase <Col N="1358" /> in our main market&mdash;Britain.  For some time poultry and tinned beef have been freed from price control and bulk purchase, while price control on eggs in Britain has recently been removed. It would be unwise to think that this is the end of the process.  Accordingly, we are facing a position in which the farmer's returns tend to be determined by the quality he can offer the individual consumer abroad and the level of his own production costs.  Markets outside Britain, particularly the American meat market, have in general contracted for a variety of reasons during the past 15 months.  The question of our trading relations with Britain has been under discussion for some considerable time and I hope to make an announcement on this subject to-morrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why to-morrow?  If the Minister has anything to tell us could he not tell us now?</P>

      <P>If I gave it to-night you would have nothing to say to-morrow. You have enough to go on with to-night.  Every farmer can rest assured that a prime objective of Government policy will be to secure from other countries the best possible prices for agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>I would not wish to conclude without referring to the subject of milk.  In an endeavour to ascertain, as far as costings will allow, the production costs of milk, I have provided the Milk Costings Committee, which commenced its work on the 1st October last, with the staff and other facilities requisite to its task.  The committee is going ahead with its work but, for obvious reasons, it will need to ascertain figures for a full 12-monthly period.  It is therefore unlikely that a report will be ready before early 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without prejudice to the report of the committee I should like to remind Deputies that the saturation point of demand for butter in this country and for other milk products abroad may well have been reached at present prices.  There is no export market at present or in sight for butter at our present costs of production and the home market is now consuming per <Col N="1359" /> head of the population more than any other country in the world.  Up to the present we have been fortunate in obtaining satisfactory prices on the limited export market for our other milk products but competition from other countries is expected to become more severe in the future.  The difficulty already experienced in disposing of any substantial quantity of fresh cream in the British market should be a warning.</P>
    <P>If the dairy farmer wants to assure his income from milk he must produce it more economically and this can best be done by increasing milk yields.  It is quite feasible to increase milk yield by another 150 gallons per cow by the better feeding and management of stock.</P>
    <P>This afternoon, at Question Time, Deputy Dillon put me a supplementary question regarding the bonus on spring lambs.  I would like to give this information to Deputy Dillon and the House because at Question Time the Deputy did not seem to be satisfied with the answer which I gave him. Pending completion of the proposed new annex to the 1948 Trade Agreement, the schedules of prices for fat cattle, and fat sheep and lambs as well as carcase beef, mutton and lamb exported to Britain during the year mid-April, 1953 to mid-April, 1954, have not been settled.  As regards live fat cattle and fat sheep and lambs the Ministry agreed as an interim measure to apply, as in previous years, the increases granted in the prices for British home-bred stock under the February price review.  In the case of sheep and lambs there was a general increase of ½d. per lb. carcase weight for all grades.  As regards carcase meat, the Ministry are paying interim prices of the same actual amount as last season pending settlement of the appropriate carcase differentials.  The Ministry had agreed in principle last autumn to apply to Irish fat lambs in 1953-54 the variable spring lamb bonus then fixed with the representatives of the National Farmers' Unions in Britain for home-bred fat lambs.  The bonus is for a short period  up to about mid-July <Col N="1360" /> and applies only to first-grade lambs not over 16 weeks old but yielding carcases not less than 26 lb.</P>
    <P>Following reports recently that, because of payment of the bonus in the Six Counties, large-scale export of lambs was taking place from here across the Border, and that the direct exporters to Britain could not compete, the British Ministry of Food was specially asked to pay the spring lamb bonus right away for Twenty-Six County fat lambs exported to Britain. The Ministry agreed to do so as a provisional arrangement pending the detailed price discussions for the 1953-54 season to follow on completion of the new annex.  The prices paid since mid-April for fat stock and meat exported to Britain have not, of course, been published by the Department pending completion of the annex.</P>
    <P>The type of lamb affected by the spring lamb bonus now introduced would normally be exported to Britain in carcase form only.  Those being marketed here until the Ministry agreed to apply the bonus to cross-Channel exports were, in fact, getting the benefit of the bonus by reason of the trade taking place with the Six Counties so that the producer was not suffering.  What was happening was that the direct exporters in the Twenty-Six Counties were unable to compete for such lambs for export to Britain, and all that the payment of the bonus now for cross-Channel exports does is to enable the direct exporters to operate at the current price for such lambs.</P>

      <P>Last Wednesday.  Lamb to be slaughtered, dressed and consigned to the British market, arriving there on Wednesday, was purchased presumably in this country on Monday or before.  The information that that extra bonus was available was made known to the Live-stock Exporters' Association.  The information about that extra price per lb. for lamb was made known to every meat packer.  If the average weight of a carcase was 40 lb. it represents approximately £1 per lamb.  Now to my knowledge there were eight special buyers out from one packing firm for lambs in the course of the last ten days, and there were lambs brought to the fair in the course of the last week.  Now I ask every Deputy in this House, if you got 25 ewes last year and went to the trouble of weaning 30 lambs and a fellow turned up at your holding and paid you for the lambs, or if you went to the trouble of taking them to the fair and you sold them, and you then discovered that you had sold them £1 cheaper because he knew from the Minister for Agriculture something that you did not know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It leaves me speechless to think that a futile incompetent like the present Minister could so disgrace his office.  Did any Deputy in this House ever believe it could be told that in respect of the price receivable for live stock in this country the only section of the community which was <Col N="1362" /> not informed of it would be the farmers when the Minister for Agriculture was the informant?  The packer was told, the dealer was told; he did not bother about the farmer.</P>
      <P>Why is the price schedule for live stock published whenever it is changed in the public Press for everyone to read?  Why is that not communicated by confidential letter to the packer and the dealer?  Why is every change in the price schedule for cattle, sheep and meat published in the advertisement columns of the Irish papers by the Department of Agriculture if it is not necessary?  What Deputy in this House says that the farmers should not have been told of this change?  What remedy had a farmer to whose land a man came last week and offered to buy his lambs, he not having sold lambs at a fair for 12 months?  What comfort is it to him now to know that if he had been attending fairs in preparation for his sale he would have discovered that the market was stiffening?  All he knew was that somebody came to his land and offered to buy the lambs.  All he knew was the last price a neighbour told him he got for lambs.  Did the payment of this bonus last Wednesday make any difference in the price of lambs?  It increased the price of lambs, did it not?</P>

I think they are the first people who ought to know of it.

      <P>It is a monstrous thing that the small farmer with 30 or 35 lambs should be £30 the poorer to-night because the Minister who ought to be his protector, his defender, who ought to be most deeply interested in the small farmer's welfare, considers it unnecessary to tell him that the price of his lambs has gone up, and that he would have the effrontery to grin in this House in recollection of what he had done.  This unfortunate man looks to me like the Punch in a Punch and Judy show.  Every colleague he has whacks him over the head and then he is sent in here to laugh at his own grotesqueness.  I hear this unhappy man getting up in the House to-night gently <Col N="1364" /> to rebuke his colleagues for having slandered the farmers so energetically during the last 12 months.  He is quite right; his colleagues, in declining degrees of ignorance, have devoted themselves to a slanderous campaign for the past 12 months to demonstrate that the Irish farmer is lazy and incompetent, that he has failed to produce in comparison with the continental farmer.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had it to tell us that the Belgian trade unionists said to him in explanation of Ireland's distress: &ldquo;Mais, monsieur, nous travaillons.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Did the Minister for Agriculture until to-night intervene in that chorus to tell his colleagues what he thought of them?  Did he tell the Minister for External Affairs to stop bumbling about what he did not understand? Did he tell the ridiculous Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to trouble himself with telephones and not with cattle?  Did he warn the Minister for Industry and Commerce to stop interfering in the business of the live-stock industry &mdash; and to mind his manners when he went to Carrick-on-Suir to announce the resurrection of the warble-fly inspector?  Did he ever ask the Taoiseach when his colleagues in the Cabinet would be stopped telling him how to do his work in public?  I understand that more than one of his colleagues has acquired the prerogative of intervening in private in the administration of the Department of Agriculture.  That is a disagreeable aspect of the domestic affairs of this Government into which I have no desire to intrude; but in public, at least, the Minister might be spared the humiliation and indignity of being kicked about by his own colleagues.  I welcome his late gesture of defiance, which emboldened him to claim that the Irish farmers are not as lazy, not quite as lazy and incompetent as his ministerial colleagues have been proclaiming up and down the land.  I would be grateful if the members of the Fianna Fáil Party would take note of this revolutionary declaration by this Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>No.  There is very little <Col N="1365" /> said by the Minister to-day that I do not endorse.  As to his reference to the land rehabilitation project, the increased acreage dealt with and the increased grants made, I congratulate him from the bottom of my heart.  I never had a doubt of it.  I knew from the beginning there was not a day lost or a moment wasted, and that just as soon as it was physically possible for the most high-minded public servant to get the work done and the money distributed amongst the people it would be done.</P>
      <P>I knew there were some contemptible frauds who hoped to bewilder the public mind by protesting that the work was not going ahead sufficiently rapidly.  Whenever that allegation was made in this House I repudiated it and said the ground work had to be done and no diligence or zeal on the part of officers of the Department could avoid that, but that the House would yet see that when the project was under way it would reflect boundless credit on all those responsible for initiating it and putting it into operation.  My cordial congratulations to the Minister for having the tale to tell that he told the House to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister, at some stage, to look back on some of the things he said himself after he had taken charge of the Department, on some of the things he was sent in here to say by his brilliant colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, on some of the things he came in here to say and for which he now has to apologise by implication.  Did he see that his colleague the Minister for External Affairs was repeating recently the falsehood that land costs £200 an acre to rehabilitate under the project?  Does he remember my bringing him to this House to stigmatise that statement as a falsehood?  Has he taken any steps to tell his colleague, the Minister for External <Col N="1366" /> Affairs, not to repeat that falsehood? He dare not, he might lose his job if he did, for he holds it on the sufferance of the Minister for External Affairs.  Let me say this to the Minister&mdash;he would enhance his personal dignity, he would be a better man, if he told the Minister for External Affairs to mind his own business, even if it cost the Minister his job.  One can sometimes pay too much even for so exalted a position as Minister for Agriculture in this country.</P>
      <P>Where are we going, Sir, if a day has dawned when the Minister for Agriculture, introducing his Estimate on a Tuesday, should casually announce to the House that a trade agreement was being completed but he will not tell us what it is all about?  If he is going to say it to-morrow, where is he going to say it?</P>
      <P>Where is he going to make the announcement?  Surely this House and the humblest Deputy in it has the right when the Agricultural Estimate is introduced and the Minister tells us the substance of a trade agreement is available, to hear it.  Why will he not tell us?  Is there something in it that he does not want us to comment upon? Have not the people got the right to know?  If an agreement has been made, finished and completed, which affects the people, have not they the right to know?  Have not they the right to know through Parliament? How do we function if the Minister feels free to say that he just will not tell?  I think it turns our proceedings in this House into something less than they ought to be if this is not the first place the tale is to be told in an affair of that kind.  If we, the members of Oireachtas Éireann, do not pay the Oireachtas that respect, how can we expect our neighbours to do as much and, if they do not respect the Oireachtas of which we are members, it will be too much to ask them to have much respect for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is an insult to this House to tell us, on the occasion of the Minister's Estimate, that he is going to tell to-morrow what must be of prime interest to every Deputy who is concerned for the matters for which this <Col N="1367" /> Estimate makes provision.  Is there any precedent for the Minister announcing that he will not tell the Dáil, but that he will publicise the facts to-morrow?</P>

There is some distinction, I think, between the announcement of a Government's intention to adopt a certain course and the announcement of the terms of a trade agreement, the existence of which was first revealed, typically enough, by the Minister for Lands, in Mitchelstown, the completion of which is mentioned by the Minister for Agriculture to-night, but the revelation of which is postponed to another occasion.</P>

      <P>Deputies on this side of the House have very often reiterated the agricultural policy in which we believe, and it can be crystallised in a phrase&mdash;one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under the plough.</P>

      <P>We aimed, and will shortly aim again, to expand the live-stock population of this country to the point where all the live-stock food the land of Ireland is capable of producing would be fully employed and that thereto will be added an ever-expanding supply of additional feeding stuffs whencever they can be got at best value, further to maximise production for export.  Remember, we never thanked God that the British market was gone forever and we never believed that the farmers of this country could prosper by keeping an Egyptian bee. I heard the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party exhort the people of Ireland in the County Cavan to join with him in thanking God that the British market for live stock was gone forever and telling them that he understood that an alternative practice which might help them to overcome their temporary embarrassment was the production of honey and that the most prolific source, he understood, was the Egyptian bee.</P>

      <P>We believe that the land of this country may be most advantageously used for the purpose for which it was given us by God, that is, to get for the man who is living on it the best return possible for himself, his wife and family, always provided he leaves it in autumn a little better than he found it in spring by walking his produce off his land.  The figures provided for us by the Minister to-day emphasise the soundness of that general policy.  He has rejoiced, rightly rejoiced, in the steady increase in the numbers of our cattle, of our sheep and of our pigs.  He will be anxious, I know, in his characteristic generosity, to point out that these remarkable increases began after the 1948 Trade Agreement which provided a remunerative and long-term market for live stock in this country.  Is there a beast or a carcase being sold out of this country at the present time to Great Britain except under the terms of that agreement?  Is there a beast or a carcase being shipped from this country at the present time except under the terms of that agreement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, under the 1951 Trade Agreement.  Those agreements had this dynamic quality, that they did not fix a price.  They fixed a price relation which has resulted in five increases in the price of live stock over the last three and a half or four years without any fuss or bother, except this, that on the day any increase began to operate the Department of Agriculture did not communicate with the packers, did not communicate with the dealers. They put a notice in the public Press addressed to the farmers to tell them what the new price for stock was to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister heartily on that expansion in our live-stock population.  I agree with him entirely that, so far as cattle are concerned and, particularly, dairy cattle, their basis and foundation must be grass; grass growing for the longest period <Col N="1371" /> it is possible to get it to grow in any calendar year and grass ensilage for the dormant months.

      <P>That fraud was good enough to fool the farmers while they were being led up the garden path. Now they are called in and the Minister is preparing to break the news to them that he is washing his hands of the whole business.  But, as he is washing his hands, he is preparing them for the news that we are reaching saturation point in this country for butter at 4/2 per lb.  Deputy Collins of Limerick, a very knowledgeable man, is sitting behind him.  What does he think the Minister means by that?  I will listen with great interest to hear Deputy Collins on that statement. Does Deputy Collins ask himself now what the Minister thinks will happen when we reach saturation point in the consumption of butter at 4/2 per lb.? Will Deputy Collins ask the Minister in the course of this debate what he proposes to do with his, Deputy Collins's, constituents if and when that point is reached?  I will ask him.  The Minister has warned us that in his judgment we are fast approaching saturation point in the consumption of butter at 4/2 per lb. and that there is nowhere in the world he can find a market for butter at that price.  I thought he was going to say &ldquo;so we have decided&rdquo;.  I sympathise with poor Deputy Collins's disappointment when the situation at that stage is left in the air.  I hope the members of the Fianna Fáil Party will intervene in this discussion to give us their opinion of what will happen when we reach that saturation point.  The interruptions are not so fast and furious now.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to another dirty fraud.  The Minister for Agriculture announced, for the purpose of misleading his own colleagues, in my opinion, that he proposed to increase the maximum grant payable under Part B of the land rehabilitation project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That part of the project under which the farmer does the work himself&mdash;Part A.  He deceived some of his unfortunate colleagues into the belief that this new departure represented a concession which would offset the decision to sell the rehabilitation project machinery.  A great many of the less sophisticated members of the Party understood the Minister to say that he proposed to increase the grant payable to farmers under Part A of the scheme by £10.  Some of them still believe that.  Do they not?  That is not what he said.  What he said was that he was going to increase the maximum grant payable to £30.  What is the actual grant payable?  Two-thirds of the estimated cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Maximum £30.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before you could qualify for a grant of £30 you would have to prove to the Department that you were going to spend £45 on the acre you reclaim.  I have got the figures for the average that the Department paid per acre laid down under that part of the scheme up to the day I left the Department of Agriculture.  What was the average?  Eight pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In your time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and that represents an estimated cost for the work, and the Minister will not deny that the work was properly done on £12 per acre.  Suppose it had been £20, £24 or twice or three times what, in fact, it was an acre, the maximum grant which a man whose reclamation costs £24 was <Col N="1373" /> £16.  How does it benefit him to tell him: &ldquo;You are going to get £16, but if you manage to spend more we could give you up to £30.&rdquo;  There is not a single farmer in Ireland who would benefit by this arrangement.  He could just as rationally have said that he was going to increase the maximum grant to £40, £50, £100 or £1,000 an acre.  Was not that a mean and fradulent thing to do?  Was it not a mean and fraudulent thing to mislead the people in that way?  Was it not an unworthy thing to do?  It was done to cover up the selling of the land reclamation project machinery.  What did that involve?</P>
      <P>So long as the Department had machinery at its own disposal the position was that under the land reclamation project any farmer, however small or poor, could, by sending a postcard to the Department of Agriculture, put upon them a statutory duty to come and drain or rehabilitate his land, move ditches, provide fences, carry out drainage or any other work requiring to be done and where the work was of a character that it was not physically possible to do it with spade and loy to bring to him whatever machinery was requisite to get the work done.  The same privilege accrued to the wealthiest farmer in Ireland.  As the situation worked out and as we foresaw it would work out we provided under the original project that where anybody was prepared to engage in the contracting business he could get a grant of one third the cost of his machinery from the Department and the Department would sponsor a loan of one third of the cost and he would have to put up one third of the cost of the equipment himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many fellows did that.  I know of one fellow who brought home £2,000 that he had earned on the ground nut scheme and on other colonial work in Africa.  He combined with three other fellows who had come from England with their savings and they constituted themselves contractors under this scheme.  Inevitably, when the officials of the Department went down to the various farmers and asked them to get the business done the larger wanted <Col N="1374" /> 20 or 30 acres done.  That was a good substantial job.  Then you came down to Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Kerry and the small farmer, doubting it could be possible that he was to be treated on precisely an equal footing with the sort of farmer for whom he usually worked as a migratory labourer, eventually summoned his courage, took the project at its face reading and called on the Department of Agriculture to come and do his couple of acres or roods and there was no contractor who would undertake the work.  You could not get a contractor to bid for the job but the law continued to operate and the fact that you could not get a contractor to bid for the job did not cancel the statutory duty of the Department to go to the smallest farm in Ireland if it was summoned there under the project and so long as they had their own machinery they had a statutory duty to go and they went.</P>
    <P>They gave scandal to some Fianna Fáil Deputies, and Deputy Bartley was quite shocked at the idea of sending great machines down to the little patches of land in Connemara.  He thought it grotesque and, as he says, a great many of his Fianna Fáil neighbours thought it was quite shocking, and that the spade and the loy were good enough for these people.  Were they not getting the dole and what more did they want?  I took a different view.  I thought there should be at his disposal exactly the same facilities that were put at the disposal of the wealthiest men in Ireland.  That was a point of view.  It was at the disposal of everybody who owned land in Ireland from the wealthiest landowner down to the poorest farmer on the smallest farm.</P>

      <P>The more they did the more land they reclaimed which required rehabilitation, and not an acre could be touched that the officers of the Department did not think stood in need of it.  The more it produced the better pleased I was.  The Department of Agriculture had exactly the same duty towards the wealthiest farmer and the smallest.  If no contractor was available the duty remained on the <Col N="1375" /> Department to go with their own machinery and do the job themselves.</P>
      <P>What is the position now?  The position now is that the wealthy farmer can still put that statutory duty on the Department, and there will be contractors prepared to do the job.  Is not that so?  Has the small farmer got that right any more?  The Department has no machinery to do it.  If they find no contractor prepared to take the job what can the small farmer do?  He will do what the Minister means him to do, put on his nailed boots, get out his spade and his loy and do the best he can and put it out of his mind for ever that he has any right to demand from his own Government the amenities which are now only available to the big man.  Do the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party want that?  Do they now think that that is right?  I am astonished.</P>
      <P>I always thought that our aim and purpose was to bring within the reach of our people the amenities and facilities that were withheld from them in the past&mdash;and Deputy J.J. Collins thinks that that is all wrong.  I understand that we can agree to differ, but it is good to know that what Fianna Fáil have done they have done with their eyes open.  Some day they will learn that our people do not agree with them.  I think that is a disastrous decision and I am happy to tell the House that it is a decision they may expect to see reversed in the course of this financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When you bring them to us I hope the Minister will have thought better of the folly of introducing Hereford bulls into the stations. Has he seen the records of some of these stations where 40 per cent. of the insemination has been done by Hereford bulls?  Does the Minister ask himself why the artificial insemination centres were started at all?  They were not started just for fun.  They were not started primarily to spare people the trouble of driving the cow down the road to the bull.  They were started for the purpose of improving the live stock of the country and bringing within the reach of the farmers the services of the best pedigree bulls that could be procured.  It must have been to some end if it was designed to improve the live stock of the country.  I cannot imagine how we could improve the live stock of the country by breeding cross-bred cattle.  None of the heifers or cows going to those stations are Hereford cows.</P>
      <P>Surely the original purpose of the scheme, and the only justification for the scheme, was to make accessible to farmers the services of bulls which it would have been impossible to bring within their reach except through the medium of artificial insemination? Was not the ultimate end of the whole plan to ensure that there would be nothing in these artificial insemination centres but proven bulls and that the whole purpose of the Department's activities would be to keep records and and procure proven bulls in greater numbers as the years rolled by so that ultimately we would have nothing in the stations but proven bulls?  The very essence of that whole plan was that you could concentrate on shorthorns, Kerrys and, perhaps in certain areas, Friesians.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there was no compulsion in regard to the breed you want to keep in this country if certain people wanted Friesians or otherwise. Personally, I would have adhered strictly to Shorthorns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1377" /> The Minister agrees with me that the foundation stock of the country must be the dual purpose Shorthorn cow.  How, then, can he justify creating a situation in which 40 per cent. of the services in an artificial insemination centre are by a Hereford bull? What useful purpose is done to the live-stock industry by that?  Far from being a help, in my opinion, such an artificial insemination centre is doing serious damage.  I do not for a moment wish to say that the Department of Agriculture should claim the right to tell a farmer what bull he will bring his cow to.  But if the Department is providing at great expense, both of money and skill, the facility of an artificial insemination centre, then the Department has the right to say: &ldquo;While not desiring to restrict a farmer from bringing his cow to an Aberdeen-Angus or a Friesian bull, and so forth, the primary purpose of our artificial insemination centre is to improve the foundation stock of the country.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan)</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Beegan does not understand.  I do not want to get rid of the Hereford or to restrict anybody, but why should you set up an artificial insemination centre to induce a farmer to bring his cow to a bull which will result in a cross-bred beast, if your purpose is to help to improve the foundation stock of the country. Deputy Beegan will not argue that a cross-bred beast will make a serious contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a great part of Connaught the farmer will insist on the Hereford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let him.  He is welcome to it.  Nobody wants to restrict him in any way.  But somebody must provide the farmer with a shorthorn cow to bring to the Hereford bull.  If there is one living creature in the world that will not provide a shorthorn cow to bring to the Hereford bull, it is the Hereford bull.  Is that not so?  Whatever brand of bull is provided in an <Col N="1378" /> artificial insemination centre should function to provide the small farmer of Connaught with a class of cow that he can profitably bring to any bull&mdash;I think Deputy Beegan would agree with me that there is one way to do that through an artificial insemination centre and that is to make accessible to the farmer the best strain of shorthorn blood available, so that he will risk bringing his cow there in the belief that if she has a heifer calf she will be worth keeping and if she has a bull calf he will be readily saleable.</P>
      <P>If there are farmers who, having a good foundation stock of shorthorn cattle, feel that for two or three generations they want to cash in on the calves as they are dropped, then by all means bring their cows to the neighbour's bull, be it black or white face.  But why use an artificial insemination centre to that end?  I am sure the Minister was gravely wrong in that decision.  I cannot but think that in taking it he lost sight of the principal purpose that was in mind when the scheme was set up.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke of a new tile factory for drainage which I understand is to be set up in Clare with the co-operation of Dutch interests.  I wonder will we want the tile.  Is the Deputy sure of that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to tell us what are the Groups G and H referred to on page 109.  I believe there was a scheme to set up three divisions of the Department under a senior inspector to deal with plant breeding, soils, fertilisers and so forth, but I do <Col N="1379" /> not recognise the form set out there and I should be glad to know if it is an implementation of that scheme.</P>
      <P>I was struck, in listening to the Minister's statement, by his reference to the soil testing facilities provided at Johnstown and if Deputies will look at the White Paper which he was good enough to provide us with, they will find that he describes it as being a development of facilities which were initiated in 1947.  I think the House should know the scope of the facilities which existed in February, 1948.  The total soil testing facilities of the Irish Republic on that date consisted of one man and a boy in a back room in Ballyhaise who were employing as their agitator for the samples submitted a disused medicine bottle tied to an abandoned bicycle wheel, which it was the boy's function to turn with the first finger of his right hand.</P>
      <P>That splendid equipment in Ballyhaise may indeed have been germinal of the institute at Johnstown which, I think, we may claim to be a fair rival of any similar equipment on the Continent of Europe, but, if it is true that it may be so properly described, I can only say that the parable of the mustard seed fades into insignificance because, if the tree that grows from the mustard seed is the greatest tree from the smallest seed, then the laboratory grown from the Fianna Fáil provision for soil testing in 1947 is an even greater miracle; but I am glad that my successor appeciates what is now there and thinks of extending it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read with emotion in the Book of Estimates on page 109 of the veterinary inspectorate.  I wrote a note opposite it: what has become of the scheme for the reorganisation of the veterinary services?  That is a classical problem in the Department of Agriculture.  When I assumed office in 1948, that scheme for the reorganisation of the veterinary services was coming up the mountain, and in fact I spent quite a considerable time in eager anticipation of the door flying open any day and at least a draft scheme being laid before me, but the draught was all I ever got in the three years I was there. I wonder does the Minister have the <Col N="1380" /> same experience now.  I want to say this quite deliberately that, if he has, it is time to do something about it. There is something wrong with a division of the Department which is in labour for five years and does not produce even a mouse.  I should be glad if the Minister could tell us what if any progress has been made in the investigation of the oedema disease in pigs and the copper and cobalt deficiency in calves which was under investigation in the veterinary research station.</P>
    <P>Before turning to wheat, I want to ask the Minister why he has decided on a reduction in the money appropriated for agricultural leaflets and whether the Baldwin's rural reader will shortly be published?  I think there ought to be a substantial increase in the appropriation for leaflets because the plain fact is that there ought to be a committee of scientists set up to rewrite 90 per cent. of the leaflets.  Most of them are grotesquely out of date.  There is very little of the Department of Agriculture of which I would ever feel tempted to say I felt ashamed, but I am sorry to say that the leaflets are something which, I think, reflect little credit upon us in their present state.  Many of them are so grotesquely out of date as to be positively misleading and they are still being issued.  I know that it is not an easy task to undertake the rewriting of these leaflets, but the sooner it is undertaken, the better it will be for everybody.</P>
    <P>I understand that there has suddenly turned up in the bacon factories a new genus of inspector the exact nature of which nobody knows but whose principal function as I understand, is to sit doing nothing.  They take certain records, and I think they are in some way associated with the Pigs and Bacon Commission, but the scarcity of work which they are required to undertake is, I understand, a source of embarrassment to the firms in whose premises they attend, because the ordinary employees of these firms find it extremely difficult to be as diligent as they would wish to be when they are perenially attended by a public servant whose primary function seems to be to twiddle his thumbs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> The Minister spoke of the Grain Storage Loans Act.  I was glad to hear him speak of it but he did not tell us much about it.  I would like to know what provision is being made or what storage is in contemplation.</P>
    <P>There is a feature of the situation that lies ahead of us which requires consideration.  I believe the whole of the people of this country depend for their survival on the land and unless that land yields a profit for those who work it, everybody in Ireland will ultimately be doomed.  The Minister rightly pointed out that in our circumstances greater and greater regard must hereafter be had to our foreign markets because the capacity of our domestic market to absorb the output of agriculture is strictly limited.  There are between 10,000,000 and 12,000,000 acres of arable land in this country. I do not think we can afford to leave a single rood of that land unprofitably employed.  The present price payable for wheat grown in this country works out on the average of 88/6 per barrel for dry Irish wheat.  Wheat of comparable quality and moisture content fell 10 cents on the Chicago wheat pit yesterday and, on the basis of that price, 1 dollar 88 cents a bushel, is probably purchasable delivered here in Ireland to-day, at somewhere in the region of 77/- as compared with 88/6. I think we may assume that in respect of every bushel of dry Irish wheat taken into an Irish mill this year the consumer and, in our circumstances, the treasury, must provide a subsidy of from 15/- to £1 per barrel.</P>
    <P>Now we are planning to extend that acreage.  We worked up the acreage here to 662,000 in 1945.  If the present acreage should rise to 500,000, on the basis of our present yield we might easily have 8,000,000 cwt. delivered into the mills here.  Two-fifths of that would be 3,000,000 barrels.  That would be approximately our entire requirements, and at present prices would involve a subsidy from the Exchequer of some £4,000,000.</P>
    <P>If the standard of living of all our people depends on the profitable user of the land and if there is a market, as the Minister tells us and as I quite agree, for all the live stock and live-stock <Col N="1382" /> products we can produce and process in this country, how long is it proposed indefinitely to expand the acreage under a crop the production of which, far from earning a profit, engenders an annual loss which grows greater with every increase in yield? I think it is time the House took it under review.  I should like to see every acre of land in this country producing crops, cereals, roots and grass on which to build up the live-stock industry of this country so that we might export live stock and the products of live stock in ever-growing quantities. I would like to see the farms of this country recognised for what they truly are, the most valuable factories the Irish nation has.  In those factories I would like to see processed, not only all we are able to produce from the soil but as much additional raw material as the occupants of those factories were capable of processing, so that we might send out an ever-increasing quantity of agricultural produce to whoever was prepared to pay us a remunerative price.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister has come to recognise it.  I would like to see being brought within reach of our people the lime, whencesoever it may come, and the fertilisers, at a price people can afford to pay.  However, there is one thing all of us know is still lacking and no multiplication of the county agricultural instructors will put it right, and that is the education in modern methods and the liaison with <Col N="1383" /> the departmental schemes which are there if he would only get the people to avail of them.  I know of no means whereby that can be done but by bringing a parish agent into close contact with the people at their request in their own homes, who will know his way to the Department and will bring the resources of the Department to the immediate and proximate service of those who need them; and who will make available to the people amongst whom he permanently lives the scientific knowledge and know-how which only a parish agent can effectively demonstrate under the conditions and on the holdings where the people actually live.  If the Minister should ever awake to the fact that that concept is a rose and smells sweet let him call it by another name, but let him operate it all the same.  He knows just as well as I do that the instructors under the county committees, no matter how hard they try, do not get the chance effectively to do the job that wants doing.  That is not the way to go about it.  The peripatetic instructor storming around the country on a bicycle or car covering an area far too great and having no direct responsibility for any particular area of his own, just leaves little or no trace after him.</P>
      <P>A man with exactly the same qualifications and no greater zeal, functioning as parish agent&mdash;to my knowledge in three parishes in Ireland &mdash;produced in 18 months results which other methods and instructions and advice have not produced in 20 years.  I would exhort the Minister, seeing that he has come so far to agree with me in other things, to come this far and agree with me in that as well.</P>
      <P>I see on page 3 of his White Paper where he says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The total home production of meat and bone meal is readily disposed of and it is expected that the supplies position will improve considerably in the near future when an additional plant in course of construction comes into operation.&rdquo;</P>

And the Minister for Industry and Commerce read the farmers of this country a lecture on that matter and clearly implied, in the course of his observations that if exhortation from him did not produce results, the resources of civilisation were not exhausted and that he would re-institute the warble fly inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, that Minister fixed a price for <Col N="1385" /> Irish hides of 4d. per lb. when the tanners of this country were paying the Argentinians 3/6 per lb.

      <P>Is it not a strange day that would dawn in this country when the Minister for Agriculture is no longer responsible for the hide of a cow?  I do not wonder that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle expresses amazement that the Department of Agriculture has sunk so low that it claims to have nothing to say about the hide of a cow.  May I make the submission, Sir, that there was a day in this country when no part of a cow was a matter of indifference to the Minister for Agriculture and if that time is past may I exhort the Minister for Agriculture to let us have a renaissance in Upper Merrion Street.  I want the Minister for Agriculture to tell me is he prepared to do this.  Will he tell his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the best steps he could take for the eradication of warble fly would be to disinterest himself in the fate of the hides of our cows?  He, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, has fixed a price for cow hides in this country.  The world price for cow hide is 1/8 per lb.  The price that a man gets who has hides to sell if he lives in Ireland and has his cow slaughtered for consumption or export from Ireland is 8d. per lb.  There are 60 lbs. on an average in a cowhide. Eight times 60 is 480 pence.  There is is a levy of £2 per hide on every beast slaughtered for consumption or export out of the country.  And who gets the proceeds of the levy?  Is it the taxpayer?  Is it the poor?  Or the agricultural community?  Is it an institute for agricultural education or something like that?  No, it is not.  It is the tanners.  And it is the tanners who boast that they never made profits such as they are making now.  One of them found himself in the position of being able to distribute a bonus&mdash;not of 100 per cent. shares, but of 166 per <Col N="1386" /> cent. shares&mdash;and maintain his dividends.  Now, is it designed to procure cheaper boots for poor people in Ireland?  Oh, no.  It is designed to facilitate the man who gives himself a bonus of 166? per cent. shares and maintains his dividends, encouragement to compete in foreign markets.</P>

It is to tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce to go to blazes, to tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on behalf of the farmers of this country that, in respect to the warble fly, the farmers of this country will do sweet Fanny Adams in order to earn profits for the tanners, to tell the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the warble fly can be got rid of overnight if he will mind his own business and make accessible to the farmers of this country nothing more than the price that is available in the world for the hides they have to sell.</P>
      <P>I shall undertake within one year, on the basis of a fair price being paid for Irish hides, to set in motion steps which over a quinquiennium will virtually end the warble fly pest in this country.  Certainly, as an Irish farmer, I would not walk a yard to involve myself in expense or trouble to prevent the warbling of a hide for the benefit of tanners whose prime concern is to plunder the agricultural community of this country.  It ill-becomes the Minister for Agriculture to sit by like a dummy while his colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, proclaims the virtue of the tanners.  I think the time has come when his voice might with advantage be heard on this subject so as to remind us all, including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that the hide of a cow is not an article in which the Department of Agriculture has no interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not move to refer this Estimate back if I had no better reason for referring it back than the words of the Minister's speech.  There is very little in what he said here to-day with <Col N="1387" /> which I do not find myself in complete agreement.  That is the plain fact, but I confidently ask the House to refer this Estimate back to mark the Dáil's disapproval of the contemptuous way in which the Minister for Agriculture is habitually treated by his own colleagues; to mark our disapprobation of the impudence of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in swaggering around the country as an authority on agriculture when he would not know the difference between a sheep and a goat; to mark our disapprobation of the grotesque spectacle of the Minister for External Affairs having the impudence to intervene in the administration of the Department of Agriculture; to mark our strong disapprobation of the action of the Minister for Agriculture and of the Minister for Lands in telling our people that there is a trade agreement, the contents of which the British know and the contents of which these Ministers know, but the contents of which the Minister does not think he has any duty to communicate to Dáil Éireann; to mark our emphatic condemnation of the conduct of an Irish Minister for Agriculture who agrees on a price for lambs produced by farmers on the small-holdings of Ireland and who accepts the proposition that while he has a duty to keep the canner and the dealer up to date, the farmer can learn it through the Press, can learn it from his losses, can learn it from the bitter experience of seeing someone else getting a profit on the work he did.</P>
    <P>I would be distressed for the future of agriculture in this country if I felt that the impetus of the work our Government did would have time to run down before the people grew tired of our most unworthy successors.  I am happy to say that Cork and Wicklow are about to create a situation in which that imminent danger will be removed. I think it right for the record that we should reject this Estimate but, as I say, it really does not matter a damn what we do about it.  He will not be there next autumn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Stripped of its trimmings, the Minister's speech really boils down to praise of the land reclamation <Col N="1388" /> scheme, a bit of very modest boasting about the increase in the numbers of live stock and a little bit of boasting about the increase in agricultural exports from this country but there is quite a considerable amount of very careful disregard, a very careful shying away from certain aspects of the agricultural industry that certainly the Minister should not fight shy of and about which he should give the House a full account.  One of the most remarkable statements that he threw in just casually was the fact that he was going to make an announcement about a trade agreement some time to-morrow, presumably at some dinner, presumably in the company of people who mean nothing to the farmers and who are interested in nothing in this country.  Why, this House here is not only beneath the notice of the Minister but is too contemptible to be favoured with an explanation or at least some hint of what the agreement contains. All I say on that subject, pending the Minister's release of the terms of that trade agreement, is that I hope that the new trade agreement will not be any less favourable to Irish farmers than were the terms of the 1948 trade agreement.  I hope also that the Minister will have made a much better contribution towards securing a sound and solid trade agreement than his predecessor, Deputy Smith, did in 1947, five or six months before he went out of office, when Deputy Smith was Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister cross-questioned Deputy Dillon in regard to some aspects of the 1948 agreement.  He asked did Deputy Dillon know about the 1947 agreement and the previous agreement in 1941. Whether or not Deputy Dillon knows about those agreements the Irish farmer certainly knows all about them because one of the disastrous results of the 1947 agreement was the fact that the Irish farmer was compelled to sell his produce to the English consumer at a lower price than the English consumer was willing to pay had he been made pay it.  The increase in the price of live stock, in poultry and so on, details of which the Minister gave the House to-night, has been due directly <Col N="1389" /> to the favourable terms of the 1948 trade agreement.</P>
    <P>The terms of that agreement are still in force.  Let the Minister try to convince any farmer down the country to the contrary.  He will not succeed because the man who pays the piper knows at least a little bit about the tune.  Looking back over events it is not very pleasant to remember that since 1939 the Irish farmer has been selling his produce on the English market at a lower price than could have been obtained had there been a firm bargain made with the British Ministry of Food.  That bargain was made in 1948, somewhat late but better then than not at all.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Budget debate apparently a statement made by me aroused the ire of Deputy Moran.  That statement was that the increased agricultural exports were due not so much to increased production but to the fact that our own people were denied the purchasing power at home by the Minister for Finance.  They had to go without the things they were accustomed to buying during the inter-Party régime.  I repeat that statement now.  The Minister for Finance told us&mdash;the Minister for Agriculture did not give us the exact&mdash;figure that increased agricultural exports during the last financial year amounted to approximately £22,000,000.  He told us that at the same time production had increased by approximately £2.4 million.  I am firmly convinced of the argument I put forward during the Budget debate.  A good deal of the increased agricultural exports went across the water because our own people were denied the power to purchase them at home through the budgetary policy of the present Government.  That is exemplified in the price of butter, one of the commodities used most extensively in the ordinary household.  I am beginning to wonder somewhat at the conflicting statements of the Minister and his colleagues as to what the situation will be by September, the end of the peak milk producing season.  The Minister is hinting at a surplus despite the fact that last year we had to purchase 93,000 cwt. of New Zealand butter.</P>

      <P>Call it anything you like.  Saturation point is reached when we are in the position of meeting our own requirements rather than having to import 120,000 cwt. of foreign butter.  Surely it is logical to conclude then that the next step will be a surplus over and above saturation point.</P>

      <P>There will be evidence of it by the end of this year's peak milk producing season in September or October.  Before the autumn frosts set in there will be plenty of evidence of that in the cold stores all over the country.  We can then sit back and say we have a surplus of our own butter for the first time for years and we will have achieved that by one means and one means only, namely by increasing the price to such an extent that our own people can no longer afford to buy it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is right in everything he has said.  He said that every two Ministers in the present Government seemed to be engaged in a tug-of-war. Quite clearly, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Health are pulling the people to pieces between them so far as health is concerned. The Minister for Finance goes a step further and denies our people the ordinary essentials.  I suppose all the Ministers must dance to the tune that we are, as a nation, living beyond our means, eating too much, drinking too much, smoking too much, dressing too well and travelling too much.  The policy of the present Government is that we must tighten our belts.  The talkative Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, talking on subjects he does not really understand, has to make his own contribution to the general slashing down.  The Minister for Agriculture has to make his contribution.  The Minister for Agriculture has charge of the most important industry in the country.  He should tell his colleagues to keep their fingers out of his pie. Irrespective of what he may think of Deputy Dillon, his predecessor in office, there is a leaf he could take out of Deputy Dillon's book in relation to the way in which Deputy Dillon managed the Department of Agriculture.  He was not hampered or hamstrung <Col N="1393" /> by his colleagues.  The Minister should keep his colleagues out of the Department of Agriculture.  If he tells them straight out that he will not tolerate their interference they will have more respect for him.  He should manage the Department of Agriculture in his own way.</P>
