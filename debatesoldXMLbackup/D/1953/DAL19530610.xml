      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that in view of the useful and sometimes dangerous duties performed by members of the coast life saving service and having regard to the high cost of living the remuneration and travelling expenses allowed are entirely inadequate; and, if so, he will have the service rules and regulations so modified as to entitle better payment to those engaged and arrange that look-out posts are manned and equipped with all modern requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The coast life saving service is a voluntary organisation the members of which continue to pursue their normal callings.  Attendance of the volunteers is required only at quarterly exercises, each of about four hours duration, and on any occasion on which they may be called out for emergency service.  The remuneration of the volunteers for attendance at exercises was increased in 1946, in 1948, and again as recently as April last.  The payment for attendance at wreck services was increased in September 1952.  Any travelling expenses necessarily incurred are met by the Department.  Further increase in the payments for these services is not at present in contemplation.</P>
      <P>As for equipment, supplies of a new type of rocket and apparatus of the most modern kind have been ordered for the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if public access to the sea at Brittas Bay, County Wicklow, for citizens anxious to avail of this amenity without the payment of a levy to private persons has been established by An Bórd Fáilte and if not if it is proposed to establish such a right under the authority vested in this board by the Oireachtas in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of An Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will already be aware from the reply which I gave to a question by him on the same subject on 4th December, 1952, the exercise of the functions conferred by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, in relation to the provision and improvement of means of access to places of scenic or other interest to the public is the responsibility of An Bórd Fáilte.</P>
      <P>However, I understand from the board that up to the present they have examined 11 cases of this kind.  In two of these cases the owners of the properties concerned have agreed to the provision of public access, and the other nine cases are still under examination.</P>
      <P>As regards the two specific cases mentioned, I am informed that the Deputy has been in communication with An Bórd Fáilte and that he has been informed of the position.  The board hope that it will be possible to reach an early amicable settlement with the parties concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider altering the regulations governing the allocation of relief work to unemployed persons, to permit of the employment of any unemployed man fit and able to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reasonable assumption that an unemployed man fit and able to work will avail himself of the facilities placed at his disposal by registering at the local employment offices and will, accordingly, be included in the &ldquo;live register&rdquo;.  The live register of persons seeking employment is divided into (a) claimants to unemployment benefit; (b) applicants for unemployment assistance; and (c) others&mdash;i.e., persons who are not claiming either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, and are registering for the purpose of obtaining work.  This last category is relatively very small.</P>
      <P>Unemployment benefit is payable only for a limited period, and is intended to tide workers over relatively short periods of interruption of employment.  Recipients of unemployment assistance, on the other hand, may have been unemployed for relatively long periods, and may include persons who have exhausted their right to unemployment benefit.  For this reason, and also because the rates of unemployment benefit are higher than the unemployment assistance rates, the unemployment assistance recipients must be regarded as the most necessitous group among those registering for work at the employment offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> It is not proposed to make any alteration on the lines suggested by the Deputy in the regulations governing the recruitment of workers for employment schemes, as such alteration would only reduce the amount of employment available for unemployment assistance recipients.</P>

      <P>National schools in the Dublin County Borough and in the other county boroughs closed for summer vacation on the first Monday in July and remained closed for not more than eight weeks from that day.  This period, which was availed of to the full in almost all schools, covers practically the entire months of July and August. The vocational and secondary schools in those areas commence vacation by the first Monday in July and do not reopen again before the end of the vacation period for the national schools.</P>
      <P>The national schools in all other urban and rural areas were not required to close until the third Monday in July, though they might have been closed before that date if the managers so desired.  This arrangement was intended to make provision for local circumstances, particularly in rural areas.</P>
      <P>The arrangements which I have indicated provided reasonable facilities for the fixing of family holidays.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the method of question and answer across the floor of the House does not provide a suitable opportunity for clarifying a very involved question. I can read for him a circular which was issued to all local bodies dealing with this matter.  It was as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1908, as amended by the <Col N="928" /> Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, it is provided that the expression &ldquo;working classes&rdquo; shall &ldquo;include&rdquo; mechanics, artisans, labourers and others working for wages, hawkers, costermongers, persons not working for wages but working at some trade or handicraft without employing others save members of their families, and persons, other than domestic servants, whose income does not in any case exceed £3 a week and the families of any such person who may be residing with them.  For the successful administration of the Housing Acts, there must be some line of demarcation and every person who does work of some kind cannot reasonably be considered as belonging to the working classes.  Strict interpretation of the expression in any particular case would be a matter for court decision, and the meaning of the term in its popular sense as at present applied by housing authorities derives from their long experience in the administration of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, it is mainly, in fact, entirely the responsibility of the local authority concerned to place their own definition on what I have read out, and to take the responsibility of any decision they arrive at.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply dealt with the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  My question covers not merely people under the Working Classes Acts, but people under the Labourers Acts, and it is under these latter Acts that the term &ldquo;working for hire&rdquo; occurs.  Is the Minister also aware that there is a proviso in the Act of 1919 that any question that may arise as to whether a person is a person to whom this section applies shall be determined by the Local Government Board and their decision shall be final and conclusive?  Is the Minister not aware that he is the successor of the Local Government Board and therefore his decision is final and conclusive?</P>

      <P>It was, naturally, pleasant enough for me to be able to report to the Dáil that this turf development project is proceeding satisfactorily, that production is increasing in accordance with the programme and that the financial results are such that Bord na Móna not merely is now able to commence the payment of interest upon the capital invested in this project, and the repayment of advances previously made, but was also able in this year to announce a reduction in the price of turf sold to commercial users.</P>
      <P>I have been gratified by the manner in which the Bill was received by the Dáil, which indicates that the project is now accepted and supported by all sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> Deputy Vivion de Valera raised one question to which I should have adverted when introducing the Bill. I had given information concerning the supply of machine-won sod turf and milled turf for electricity production and indicated that in regard to output everything was proceeding according to plan.  Deputy Vivion de Valera asked, however, how the utilisation of turf for electricity generating affected the cost of electricity.  I think it is desirable to give the House available information in that respect.</P>
    <P>For the year ended 31st March last the average fuel costs of generation per kilowatt hour were as follows: At the Pigeon House station, where coal was used, .96d.; at the North Wall station where oil was the fuel, .79d.; at Portarlington, where turf was used, .76d. and at Allenwood, where turf was used, .81d.  Since the end of that financial year the prices of coal and oil were reduced and also the price of turf for the Portarlington station.  At Allenwood an increase in the price of turf was necessary.  So that these figures are not applicable to present operations.  They are, however, the figures for the last financial year.  At present, so far as I can ascertain, the fuel costs per kilowatt hour work out as follows: at the Pigeon House, where coal is used, .82d.; at the North Wall, where oil is used, .64d.; at Portarlington, where turf is used, .64d.; and at Allenwood, where turf is used, .84d.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the explanation of the big difference between Allenwood and Portarlington?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Portarlington bog is now fully developed.  At Allenwood, full production is only now being obtained.  The second generating unit only came into operation about six months ago.  I think it must be assumed that the costs of turf at Allenwood will always be higher because the development costs of Allenwood Bog were higher than at Clonsast, where a large part of the development expenditure was incurred before the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I want to make clear is that the utilisation of turf for electricity generation does not make <Col N="938" /> electricity dearer.  Even if we were to judge the merits of turf solely upon that narrow basis, the case for it can be substantiated.  From the point of view of its effect upon the national economy, there can, of course, be no question at all.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the problems of securing the utilisation of turf for commercial purposes.  Deputy Morrissey expressed anxiety as to the availability of a market amongst commercial users for turf produced by Bord na Móna over and above the requirements of the E.S.B. and many Deputies referred to the measures which are being taken to increase the utilisation of turf for industrial purposes and by local authorities in charge of public institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  The Minister knows, of course, that that is one of the things that give some concern. There is no difficulty about disposing of it for electricity generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make it clear that, so far as the policy of the Government in that regard is concerned, it is precisely the same now as it was when the White Paper on the turf development programme was issued in January, 1946.  In paragraph 9 of that paper it was indicated that the aim would be to ensure that new power projects would be designed to use turf, that ranges, grates and stoves to be installed in houses built in turf-producing areas under the auspices of the Department of Lands or local authorities <Col N="939" /> or with the aid of State subsidies, would be designed to use turf efficiently and economically, that boilers and equipment using solid fuel installed by local authorities in new institutions should be designed so as to permit of the efficient and economical use of turf as a fuel and that factories using imported fuels and located in areas where turf is competitive in price with other fuel should install turf-burning equipment as a condition precedent to the grant of State assistance in any form.</P>
      <P>I have already in the course of this debate expressed some surprise at the reluctance of a few industrial concerns and of some local authorities to utilise turf or at their action in entering into contracts for the supply of equipment designed to use fuel oil without even considering the economies of turf. Bord na Móna have at the present time a team of expert consultants who are visiting the institutions of local authorities and business concerns in all districts in which they are in a position to offer a regular supply of turf and are endeavouring to teach them that the utilisation of turf will mean a saving in costs as well as giving service equally efficient as other imported fuels.  I hope to have the co-operation of Deputies who are members of local authorities in the various turf-producing counties in ensuring that commitments are not made in respect of schools or institutions in these counties for the installation of equipment in which turf cannot be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been surprised to find a reluctance to consider turf even in the case of authorities conducting institutions in areas surrounded by bogland. With the development of this Móna jet burner by the board's research department it can I think be asserted that, except where the use of oil or coal is an essential part of the industrial process involved in any factory, fuel costs for ordinary steam raising purposes can be reduced in all locations in the turf producing counties by installations for the use of turf. Free advice on that matter is available to all industrial concerns and to all public bodies from the board's technical <Col N="940" /> staff.  There is no question of making any charge for the advice.  These technical experts of the board will be only too willing to go to any place where that advice is needed and put their expert knowledge at the disposal of those who seek it.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna also have an organisation set up for the purpose of promoting sales.  That is an organisation separate and distinct from its technical staff.  At an early stage in Bord na Móna's operations I, as Minister, approved of the principle of the board's not endeavouring to set up its own retail selling organisation and encouraged it to seek to develop sale for its products through existing fuel merchants where the co-operation of the existing fuel merchants could be secured.  I think that is a good principle. I think it is undesirable that a State organisation of that kind should upset existing trade methods if it can adapt them to its purpose.</P>
    <P>In some cases, however, Bord na Móna has been forced into the position of establishing its own retail services either because in certain areas no organised retail system existed or because co-operation from existing merchants was not forthcoming to a sufficient degree.  Within the past six months they have inaugurated retail services in a number of towns in Counties Roscommon, Longford and Kerry and it is considered that the scheme will probably be extended to include Galway and other centres later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the past six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the reason that was started was because the turf could not be sold?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy misunderstands the position in that regard. I will deal with the points he raised later.  I am referring now to sales of machined turf produced from Bord na Móna's permanent bogs.  It is for the purpose of building up the market for that turf that this sales <Col N="941" /> organisation is being built up where necessary.  I still think that the board should endeavour to work within the ambit of the existing retail sales organisation provided by private traders wherever it can be done and that it should undertake its own retail distribution services only where no other course is open to it.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should say, in order to make clear to some Deputies who may misunderstand the position, that Bord na Móna as such has no function whatever in regard to hand-won turf. It is true that until recently a marketing organisation was maintained by Bord na Móna whose function it was to advise private turf producers as to available markets and sometimes to assist them in making the necessary contacts to enable them to dispose of their turf.  Bord na Móna, however, only came into contact with hand-won turf during the war when, for reasons due to scarcity of fuel, certain temporary arrangements had to be made to collect, store and distribute hand-won turf.  Bord na Móna was used because it was the most suitable organisation for the purpose, but it was always intended that it should revert to its original position in which it had no responsibility for hand-won turf at all as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>That situation has now ended.  Bord na Móna has a very big job on hands in organising the production of turf for power generation purposes.  It has been given a target of 3,500,000 tons of sod and milled peat by 1960, and it will strain the resources of its organisation to the limit to achieve that target. Whatever has to be done by State organisation in relation to hand-won turf will not be a matter for Bord na Móna.  In my view, the time has come when hand-won turf should also get back to the same marketing arrangements that existed before the war, seeking local sales which should be possible because of the price advantage which it enjoys.  Our estimate is that there will be a market for privately produced hand-won turf this year of about 230,000 or 240,000 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that in certain western counties the output of hand-won turf <Col N="942" /> increased enormously under emergency conditions and that the reduction of activity in hand-won turf to normal dimensions is causing some economic upsets there.  It was precisely because we desired to restore the conditions of comparative prosperity that existed in those areas during the time of maximum demand for hand-won turf that we decided to establish there small power stations to be based upon hand-won turf purchased from local private producers.  Four of these stations have been planned.  It will take a couple of years to get them into operation, but the work of getting them established is, I am told by the E.S.B., proceeding as rapidly as possible.  The purpose of these stations is definitely a social one. It is to improve the social conditions in these areas.  I do not want to suggest that it will be possible to work them on as economical a basis as the much larger stations located on midland bogs.  They will be less economic than the larger stations, but the economic consideration is of less concern than the social advantages they confer.</P>
    <P>There is the further consideration that if a situation should arise in which hand-won turf was required for other purposes in another fuel emergency, then these small stations could be closed down without any considerable upset to the electricity supply system and the turf diverted to other purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That development will not come for a few years more and in the meantime why not keep the semi-automatic bogs in production this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These semi-automatic bogs were also a residue of the emergency period.  After the war the county councils were relieved of responsibility for turf production.  Bord na Móna took over the work the county councils had been doing in some instances.  It is true that they operated on a much reduced scale as compared with the work the county councils were doing during the war.  A number of these bogs have been closed down since and this year there was a further reduction. In every case the bog chosen for the discontinuance of work was one in <Col N="943" /> respect of which either the board experienced difficulty in getting enough workers to keep these bogs operating last year or are now in a position to offer alternative employment to the staff concerned.</P>
      <P>Let us be quite clear.  That form of production is entirely uneconomic. Heavy losses were sustained and considerable difficulty was found in disposing of the turf.  In fact, a large portion of the turf produced was ultimately disposed of at a heavy loss to the E.S.B.  The E.S.B. took it although they did not require it.  It would not be possible to continue diverting these turf supplies to the E.S.B. without upsetting the turf production programme of Bord na Móna which is designed specifically to produce turf for those stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it not proved during the period of office of the inter-Party Government that several of these bogs were economic units but that the uneconomic bogs were lumped in with them with the result that they became uneconomic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the semi-automatic machine bogs were economic. It is necessary to remember that as late as 1951 there were fuel scarcities, and that deliveries of coal from Britain were much shorter even than the quantities the British had contracted to give us.  That situation is changed.  To attempt to market that turf at a loss through local markets would, in my view, completely destroy the market of the private turf producer. That, I think, would be very undesirable.  If the turf was sold at a loss at a subsidised price the competition with local private users would be unfair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is true that the turf last year was offered for sale at a price which was unremunerative from the point of view of Bord na Móna.  The bulk of that was shifted to the power stations.  In some cases, where the production was a considerable <Col N="944" /> distance from the power stations, the price paid by the E.S.B. for the turf did not go far beyond the actual cost of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of it was not fit to be shifted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any desire to carry on semi-automatic turf production for relief purposes would have to be implemented through the local authorities or some other body.  It is not the business of Bord na Móna.  In the case of Roscommon bogs they would argue very strongly that they are at present encountering considerable difficulty in recruiting sufficient workers for the permanent bog at Lanesboro' where they are not merely able to offer employment but also houses for workers who would come to take emploment in that locality.  That brings me to the board's housing programme concerning which some Deputies were seeking information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was given to Roscommon County Council.  I pointed out that in Galway there was a first-class <Col N="945" /> market in regard to the semi-automatic produced turf.  Has the marketing section made any effort in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Galway is concerned turf can be supplied at the board's permanent bog at Attymon to anybody who requires it.  Bord na Móna is now concentrating upon its one job of selling its own production. Up to the present Bord na Móna's permanent production was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E.S.B. This year it looks as if the output of Bord na Móna will be running ahead of the E.S.B. requirements and that situation is bound to arise one year or another between this and 1960 when the whole programme will have been completed.  In some years the board will be moving faster than the E.S.B. and in other years the E.S.B. may be moving faster than the board.  The aim is to keep Bord na Móna expanding in line with the needs of the E.S.B. Developments in regard to milled peat will, of course, take place in or about 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to housing, I think I should make it clear that Bord na Móna is not undertaking the building of houses for the purpose of making a contribution to the national housing programme.  It is building houses for the purpose of offering an attraction to suitable workers to take employment with them.  In the case of Lanesboro', the Longford County Council proposed to Bord na Móna that workers employed by it and living in county council houses should be transferred from these houses to the board's houses.  Bord na Móna did not consider that because they said they had no need to provide houses for workers already comfortably housed.  The board's aim is to have houses available when suitable workers are available so that they can be immediately accommodated in the vicinity of their work.  Therefore, the board would always aim at having in each area some houses not allocated as an inducement to people to take employment with them.  They are still in a position to offer employment to a fairly considerable additional number of workers, <Col N="946" /> and only this morning they advertised for these workers indicating, as one of the attractions of the job, the availability of houses in the vicinity of the work at reasonable rents.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey asked me about turf by-products.  So far as peat wax is concerned that process has been brought to the commercial stage, but further investigations are now proceeding with a view to locating bogs in which the peat is particularly suitable for the application of that extraction process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is telling us something which I was told over three years ago.  Over three years ago I was informed that they were satisfied it was a commercial proposition and that the bog to be exploited for that particular purpose would be located in Donegal or Kerry.  Has there been any further progress for the past three and a half years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the industrial propositions which I have given to the industrial development authority.  It is only in the past six or seven months that they secured the services of an expert who is going to investigate the peat in a number of bog areas with a view to deciding which is the most suitable for the application of this process.  I gather that the difficulty in securing the commercial development of this process was that it was more likely to be successful as a business proposition with some types of peat than with others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some talk of the manufacture of insulated wallboard by a Swedish firm.  How definite that prospect is, I do not know but, at any rate, Bord na Móna have been cooperating to the extent of preparing and forwarding various samples to the firm for tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to peat moss is not that handling and transport costs here have affected the board's competitive position in the American <Col N="947" /> market but rather that, following upon devaluation, the increase in shipping freights made the net price which they were able to secure in the American market uneconomic.  Up to the present, Bord na Móna have succeeded in obtaining a somewhat better price in America for their peat moss than other continental countries supplying that market but the board think that some of these countries must be selling at prices which are recognised to be unremunerative but which are nevertheless accepted for the purposes of getting dollars and, in other cases, it is clear that they must be able to obtain lower freight rates than are possible here.  Bord na Móna have continued to maintain supplies to the United States in order to keep contact with that market but the fact is that far more remuneraive markets are opening up here, in the Six Counties, in Britain and in the Channel Islands. The increased output which they hope to secure in this year will be designed mainly for these more profitable markets.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the whole question of what is going to replace the bogs when they are worked out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have not seen the report, however, and I do not know what its recommendations are likely to be.  A very considerable amount of investigation has been carried out by that committee through the staff that was allocated to it and various types of plant in use in other countries have been investigated.

      <P>They leave a deposit. To come back to the subject of the reclamation of the cutaway bog, the first advice I got was that the reclaimed land of the midland bogs would be suitable for agricultural purposes.  So far as I know, there has been no change of view about that.  I am informed that the Mayo bogs, when worked out, will be suitable for afforestation or are more likely to be suitable for afforestation than for agriculture.  In no case yet, however, has the work proceeded to the point where anything practical is done in that regard.  In the case of the midland bogs, the land is still required for spreading grounds.  Only after a very considerable portion of the bog has been worked out will an area be available for experiment and which will not be required for the board's immediate operations.  I know, however, that Bord na Móna have been in consultation with the Forestry Division, on the one hand, and have themselves carried out certain experiments, on the other hand, with a view to ensuring that some valuable asset will still be left there when the work on the bogs is completed.  The top layer&mdash; the spagnum moss&mdash;which is removed <Col N="949" /> in the first instance, is preserved with a view to restoring the fertility of the land when the bog is worked out.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan was, I think, slightly unfair to Bord na Móna when he quoted Stacey May as saying that their development work was painfully slow.  I do not think Mr. May was criticising the Bord na Móna organisation. He was referring to the characteristics of the work and drawing our attention to something that we all know, namely, that there is no possible means by which the development of a bog can be speeded up.  It takes from two to three years to drain a bog and nobody has discovered how to do the work in a shorter period.  Consequently, it was necessary to give the board ten-year programmes&mdash;targets to be reached within ten years from the date of starting.  The only thing I can say is that, to date, their progress is such that there appears to be no reasonable doubt that the target in respect of each programme will be realised within the prescribed period.</P>
      <P>Personally, I think that we have in Bord na Móna a very efficient organisation composed of people who are real enthusiasts for their work.  I have found, and I am sure others have the same experience, that people going to work on the bogs get into a mood in which either they come to hate the sight of a bog or else they become real enthusiasts.  By this stage, Bord na Móna is composed largely of people who are enthusiasts and, with an organisation of that kind, you can get things done far more effectively and expeditiously than by another type of organisation where the same enthusiastic drive is not forthcoming.  The fact that everything has gone according to plan so far is, I think, the best assurance that it will continue to go according to plan in the future.</P>

      <P>The only reason why I have asked the Minister the question is that yesterday I received men who had walked from the Curragh to Dublin in an effort to get back to Wexford.  When they went to the Curragh and elected to work at piece-work, and were getting on well too and hoping to earn good money, they were forcibly switched to fixed rate work which was 1/10 per hour. One of them was a married man.  It meant that he would earn £4 9s. per week and that, after paying £2 to Bord na Móna for his digs and keep, it just was not worth while.  If those are the conditions that apply to them, then Bord na Móna will have difficulty in getting the required number of workers there.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the method by which the Irish language was taught in the good days of the Gaelic League was, relatively speaking, much more satisfactory than the method which is being generally used in the schools to-day, and I have often made the plea here that the teaching of Irish or the imparting of Irish to non-Irish speakers ought to be made much more attractive.  The Gaelic League made it attractive inasmuch as the learning of the language was combined and associated with social activities, usually in the form of singing and the form of dancing especially. I venture to remark that many of the older people in this country and even in this House who have a speaking knowledge of the language got their fluency from Gaelic League activities in their Gaelic League days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My personal belief is that there is too much inferiority complex, so far as the speaking of the language is concerned, and too much reprimand from people who have the language fluently, which deters young people, and especially adolescents, from using even the small amount they have.  I have met people who, if I said &ldquo;An tAire Oideachas&rdquo; would come right back at me with &ldquo;An tAire Oideachais&rdquo;.  I do not think that in the speaking of the language, we ought to pay severe attention&mdash;I stress the word &ldquo;severe&rdquo;&mdash;to grammar and the finer technical points, because any of us who have met a Dutchman or a German during his initial period in this country knows that he makes outlandish mistakes. Tenses, moods and everything else are wrong, but he has words and conveys an idea.  He knows how to ask for a meal, how to ask what town he is in and which is the road to such-and-such a place.  He has not got the right <Col N="952" /> tense or the right case, but one finds after months of practice that he has the English language, as we know it, pretty fluently.  That is the view taken by many of the older Irish scholars and in this connection I might be permitted to quote An Fear Mór who is of the opinion that, if we laid much more stress on conveying an idea than on being absolutely correct grammatically, the Irish language would progress much better than it is progressing at present.</P>
    <P>I said when speaking here last Wednesday that so long as we regarded Irish as a strict subject, as a subject to be taught strictly in the schools, we could not have progress, because it turns many of the students against the language.  It is my opinion, too, that the teaching of ordinary subjects in schools through the medium of the Irish language is not good either for the Irish language or for the general education of the children.  One of my constituents remarked over the week-end, speaking of the teaching of subjects through the medium of the Irish language, that his children&mdash;I will not say that they are stupid children&mdash;would probably grow up to be illiterate in two languages.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I want to make one suggestion in answer to the Minister's invitation with regard to giving a half-day per week to a teacher to do what he liked with for the general well-being of the students.  I suggest that on some of those half-days throughout the year, plays in Irish be produced.  That would serve a very useful purpose so far as the language is concerned.  At present there is terrific competition with the language from the cinema and the radio and every song or play or film, apart from some portions of the Radio Éireann programmes, is in English. That is something the Minister cannot compete against in his effort to revive the language and it is something the students cannot compete against.</P>
    <P>It does not seem as if we can produce films in this country through the medium of the Irish language so we must of necessity look at and listen to British and American films, and the new words and phrases being picked up by the children of to-day are solely <Col N="953" /> in the English language.  I do not know how it can be done, but I wonder&mdash; I think it is possible&mdash;if, through the Department, through the school managers, certainly through the teaching orders and, above all, through the vocational education schools, there could be established holiday camps for the holiday period where nothing but the Irish language would be spoken. That would serve two useful purposes&mdash; the purpose of giving a good holiday, a cheap holiday and a beneficial holiday to students from the cities and large towns and also the purpose of providing practice for students in the Irish language without the fear of failing in an examination or a reprimand from a teacher.  I have often quoted here the success that has attended the efforts of the County Wexford Vocational Education Committee in relation to Coláiste Carman.  Nobody can call it a school; neither could one call it a Butlin's Holiday Camp, but in my opinion, and I might say in my experience, anybody who has attended there for two weeks or a month, whether boy or girl, has found that he or she will learn much more about the Irish language than they ever did for a period of, say, two or three years in either a secondary or a primary school.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Irish language should be a subject in the first year of any child's education.  I do not believe it should be a subject even in the second, third, or fourth year.  I believe ordinary children, unless the parents have Irish or unless they are in Gaeltacht districts, should not be introduced to Irish as a subject in the schools until they are at least nine or ten years of age.  It gives these young children enough to do to add two and two, to multiply three by four or to spell without the confusion of two languages, when the first words they ever learned were in the English language and when the first directions they were ever given were in the English language.  Therefore it is, in my view, confusing to those children to have to try to think out and express their first thoughts with half Irish and half English.  I know one young boy at least in my home town who, at seven years of age, even though he speaks <Col N="954" /> English quite well for his years, can only write his name in Irish.  That may be desirable; but he is able to write his name only in Irish because he has been taught most or all of the subjects in the school through the medium of Irish.  When he is outside he knows no other language but English.</P>
    <P>These, as far as the Irish language is concerned, are my comments.  I am afraid I have not been very helpful to the Minister.  The only reason I make these observations is in an effort to tease out the big problem which the Minister has, which Ministers for Education have had in the past and will have for many, many years to come.  I would merely close my remarks on the Irish language by repeating what I said in the first instance: as long as we regard Irish as a subject which must be passed in examinations, as long as there is reprimand, as long as there is punishment &mdash;I will not say physical punishment&mdash; for not having the Irish language, we can never expect the young children and the boys and girls up to 18 years to have any love for the language.  The only way we can have Irish revived is by trying to get the students and the young boys and girls of this country to attain a love for it.</P>
    <P>I would like to support the appeal that has been made here by Alderman Byrne and, I think, Alderman Butler and Deputy Palmer for increases in the capitation grants to secondary schools.  It is a big reflection on past Governments to say that there has been no appreciable change as far as I know since 1921.  The burden has been greater on some schools than on others. I do not think anybody would take exception if I mentioned in particular the Christian Brothers who do not cater for a particular section but whose classes are composed in the main of boys who could not be regarded as being really wealthy and who could not be regarded as students who could afford to pay large fees.  As a matter of fact, many of us know that a big number of students&mdash;to mention one type of school&mdash;in the Christian Brothers' secondary schools receive <Col N="955" /> their entire secondary education from about the age of 13 or 14 up to the age of 18 years completely free.  I think some assistance should be afforded to those secondary schools and if the Minister will bear in mind the type of school of which I have given an example, I feel he will be inclined to consider favourably an increase in the capitation grants.</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion I would like to give to the Minister for what it is worth.  There is talk of economy now in the general administration of the Civil Service and I would suggest that the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations could be used as means of entry into the Civil Service. In the first place, it is most annoying for students, whether boys or girls, at the age of 14 or 15 in the case of the intermediate certificate and at the age of 18 years or so in the case of the leaving certificate to say that in one year they must do the intermediate or leaving certificate examination and if they want to enter the Civil Service they have to do a similar examination a month, two or three months later.</P>
    <P>This situation is peculiar inasmuch as the examination for a clerical officer and writing assistant in the Civil Service is of the same standard as the intermediate certificate.  Therefore, I would suggest that if the Minister wants to achieve economy for the Minister for Finance in that respect, he could use the intermediate certificate as a means of entry into the Civil Service for, say, writers, and for clerical officers; similarly the leaving certificate could be utilised in the same fashion for entry into the Civil Service for a post such as junior executive officer.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is a long tradition or recent practice, that is the custom in examinations of coupling history and geography together.  I cannot imagine how these two subjects got together.  If a young student is reasonably good in history, it is possible for him&mdash;and it has often happened&mdash;to fail in that subject that is described as history and geography. In the intermediate certificate examination I think that the maximum marks <Col N="956" /> for geography are 150 and those for history 250&mdash;it may be vice versa&mdash;but if a student secures good marks in history and passes on the basis of the maximum being 250, it is quite possible for him, if he does not do well or does badly in geography, to fail both in history and geography.  I can see some connection between history and geography but I would submit that a big portion of geography could very well be associated with mathematics rather than history.  History is a subject which depends more on memory than anything else, the retention of dates, different occurrences and that sort of thing.  The Minister may disagree but that is the way I learned history.  In any case, I think the Minister will agree with me that there is not a great connection between history and geography.  Why one should hang on the other for the purpose of passing the collective subject I cannot imagine.</P>

      <P>There is, but there is a big proportion that could very well be associated with mathematics rather than history.  My main point is: why should one depend on the other for the purpose of passing the collective subjects when, for the purposes of the examination, they are regarded as one subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one observation I should like to make in regard to vocational education.  I think sight should not be lost of the fact that it should be genuinely vocational.  I know cases where carpenters' apprentices could not be admitted to woodwork classes by reason of the fact that the maximum number of vacancies in the class had already been filled and filled by people who had taken up woodwork merely as a hobby.  I think that tendency should be guarded against. These classes are filled with professional people and semi-professional people&mdash;people who do not depend on woodwork for a living.  I think the original intention and the desire of people who are on these vocational education committees&mdash;I am sure it <Col N="957" /> would be the desire of the Minister also&mdash;is that a preference should be given in these classes to people like carpenters' apprentices or apprentices to metalwork, as against people who merely use the classes as a hobby and for the purpose of acquiring knowledge to enable them to beautify their homes.  I have some knowledge of what is happening in that regard and it is something that the Minister should look into immediately.  I think that concludes the few remarks I have to make on this Vote but I should like to ask the Minister to expand slightly the observations he has already made with regard to the progress of the Irish language, not alone in schools but in the country generally, because progress inside the schools and progress outside the schools are two quite different matters.</P>

    <P>It is my belief that, if the Irish language is to become again the language of the majority, and if our bright hopes for the future of the language are not to meet with frustration, we must have a complete change in our approach to the problem.  We must drop the classical-cum-cultural approach, regarding Irish as a language of the past.  We must treat it as a language of the present and the future, using it as a vehicle of thought in the language of everyday life in dealing with current events and not as a language of sean-aimsearachta and folklore.  We must, in effect, give our young people a thoroughly good dose of cheap and efficient modernism in Irish and a worthwhile attempt must be made to convince them of the desirability and the necessity of preserving the language.  It must be made as attractive as possible to them.  Up to now, no serious step has been taken in this direction.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly various Governments have done a reasonably good job in regard to the teaching of the language in the schools but unfortunately about 80 per cent. of this good work is lost through our failure to foster and promote that knowledge of the language after school life, through the medium of the radio, films, our newspapers and light literature generally.  Radio Éireann gives altogether too much time to English in its school programmes and children's hours.  If the comparatively small audience that is catered for by Radio Éireann's Irish programme is to be extended, they must be given a radio fare which is <Col N="959" /> bright, pleasantly varied and of a rich entertainment value.</P>
    <P>As regards films through the Irish medium, a minimum requirement is to provide a sufficient supply of short Gaelic &ldquo;talkies&rdquo; which would permit of Irish being heard for at least nine or ten minutes in every picture show throughout the country.  If the comic strips in our newspapers, which are now without exception given in English, were given in Irish I feel they would prove very effective in popularising Irish.  We are all well aware of how avidly &ldquo;Little Panda&rdquo; in the <i>Irish Press,</i>&ldquo;Curly Wee&rdquo; in the <i>Independent</i> and &ldquo;Mutt and Jeff&rdquo; in the <i>Evening Herald</i> are read by young people and even by some grownup people as well.</P>
    <P>The publication in the daily newspapers of news items and concise accounts of current events in simple Irish would attract a very wide reading public.  The Government, for their part, must give attention to the issue of various papers, pamphlets, leaflets and advertisements in Irish and must give serious consideration to the curtailment of the ever-increasing flood of imported foreign publications, in order to give Irish publications a chance.  I think if these methods were adopted, and put into operation, they would prove very effective in popularising the use and achieving the continuity of the language revival movement after school life.</P>
    <P>There is little need for me to emphasise the importance of the Gaeltacht in relation to the language revival movement.  I feel sure that the efforts of the Government in establishing a permanent organisation under a Parliamentary Secretary for the economic and social development of the Gaeltacht will be welcomed enthusiastically. The setting up of that organisation to make life more attractive and provide work in the Gaeltacht will serve a twofold purpose: in addition to helping to stem the tide of emigration from the areas where it is greatest, it will go far on the road towards saving the language.  I think it was Dr. Douglas Hyde who said that there is little hope for the <Col N="960" /> language if the Gaeltacht goes.  Year after year it is growing smaller as its population, through emigration, grows less.  Every person who leaves the Gaeltacht is not only a loss to the Gaeltacht but a loss to the nation as a whole and, in particular, a loss to the language revival cause.  For that reason I feel certain that the Government will have the co-operation and the good-will of everybody in its efforts to foster the cradle of the language, in its simplicity, its culture and everything else so dear to the hearts of our Irish people.</P>
    <P>I come now to a matter which has been a serious source of friction between the Department and the teachers for some considerable time. Recently it has caused much resentment and dissatisfaction amongst the teaching profession.  I refer to the salary question and to the impasse that has arisen in relation to the re-establishment of conciliation and arbitration machinery.  While I do not intend to criticise the Government for the delay in this matter or to question the justice, or otherwise, of the plea on which action has been deferred, I feel that something might have been done by way of an interim salary increase pending the establishment of arbitration machinery in order to secure the good-will of the teachers and restore that harmony which is so essential to the success of our educational efforts.  At the moment the State is spending a pretty substantial sum on the education of children.  If it is to get a proper return for this expenditure it is absolutely essential that we should have a contented teaching body.  I know there are many factors influencing the position but one of the principal factors for the purpose of achieving success in our schools is that we should have happy and contented teachers, free from financial cares and worries.</P>
    <P>The recent budgetary statement announcing increases in teachers' salaries as from the 1st of April of this year will, to some extent, restore some degree of contentment.  It will be appreciated even though such an increase is only in common with other <Col N="961" /> increases which have been granted with the Government's approval to group after group of organised workers during the past year to meet the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>I would also urge the Minister to go a step further in the recent measures he has taken for the equation of the salaries of vocational and secondary teachers and I would appeal to him to include primary teachers in that levelling up.  It is difficult to understand why primary teachers were omitted in the first instance in view of the urgent necessity for immediate adjustment in their salaries, and in view of the fact that such a step would make for ease of administration and for a unified teaching body.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should depart from this salary question without expressing some disappointment at the insufficiency of the award made to those teachers who retired prior to January, 1950, an award which was equivalent on an average to about only one-third of the original demand.  It cannot be denied that the original demand was a just and fair one.  Consequently one cannot but expect expressions of acute disappointment at the insufficiency of the award and, in particular, at the decision to spread the payment of the award over a three-year period, a decision for which there is no justification in my opinion.</P>
    <P>I notice that in the Estimates this year there is an increase of £7,700 in the allowance for training colleges.  If this increase indicates an increase in the number of teachers undergoing training it is something to be welcomed. The acute shortage of trained teachers at the moment is causing very grave concern.  That is a matter demanding serious consideration and an immediate extension of training facilities to enable more trained teachers to be turned out annually. This shortage of teachers has resulted in the present unsatisfactory practice of recruiting to the service ever-increasing numbers of untrained teachers.  I understand some 270 untrained teachers have been appointed to the primary schools during the past three years despite the issue of a circular by the Department&mdash;I think <Col N="962" /> it was in 1946&mdash;that after a prescribed date only trained teachers would be appointed to the position of junior assistant mistress.  I think it is about time these regulations were implemented and only trained teachers appointed to vacancies in our schools. All existing junior assistant mistresses with over ten years' teaching experience should be given the status of trained qualified teachers and placed on the appropriate salary scale.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which calls for reform.  It is a matter arising principally out of lack of accommodation and insufficiency of teachers.  I refer to the size of some of the classes in the schools in the bigger towns and in the cities.  Some of the classes are so large as to negative the efforts of the teachers.  All experts agree that the ideal class is the small class.  When a class goes above 20 it becomes less efficient.  The bigger the class becomes the less efficient it is.  We may reach the stage wherein, instead of having the child sitting bored and unnoticed&mdash; one in a herd of 50 or 60 children&mdash; it may be better for the child to be out in the open air exercising its limbs or using its eyes and ears.  I understand that in Dublin and in other cities in the State there are classes with as many as 70 and 80 pupils in them. Not for one moment could anybody imagine that the pupils in such classes are receiving the education to which they are entitled.  The most that any teacher can do is to control such a large class and keep the children quiet, if he can even do that.  I think that there should be an end put to this system by the provision of accommodation and a sufficiency of teachers as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>You have another side to this.  You have the one-teacher school which is all too prevalent throughout the country and which is equally to be condemned on the ground that no worthwhile or efficient teaching can be done.  There should be no school in the country to-day with a teaching staff of less than two, and thus put an end to the inefficiency and the slavery, as one may describe it, of any single individual being asked to cater for the educational needs of <Col N="963" /> children ranging from infants to those in the seventh standard.  That cannot be done, and the result is that both teachers and children are suffering.  One of the consequences is that the children are not getting the education they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring to the Minister's attention the question of the employment of substitutes in our schools.  The periods of employment for substitutes in our schools are not reckoned for incremental and pension purposes, with the result that substitutes for any long period are very difficult to secure.  This affects principally young teachers who have finished their training who could be very usefully employed as substitutes during their probationary period.  If the Minister were to have the services of these substitutes admitted for incremental and pension purposes he would be doing a very great service to the teaching profession and also to the children, because their education must suffer through the all too frequent change of teachers.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is to be heartily congratulated on the progress made during the past year in the provision of schools suitable for the decent accommodation of our children, and on the plans which he has formed for the future, which I hope is an indication for both teachers and parents that there are good prospects of this problem being solved within a measurable space of time, I cannot help, however, expressing some disappointment at the reduction in the grant this year for the heating and cleaning of our schools by £1,000.  Probably the Minister will justify this reduction by stating that the allocation for this purpose last year of a sum of £66,000 was not all expended.  I admit that schools which have been recently built do not require as much in the way of a grant for this purpose as the schools which they have replaced, but we have schools throughout the country which are in a very bad state of repair. Some of them are in a derelict condition and these require considerably more by way of grant to keep them in a decent state of cleanliness, to heat <Col N="964" /> them properly and to maintain them properly.</P>
    <P>The amount of the grant to any school is limited by the average daily attendance and by the local contribution. Now, with the increased cost of materials and services, this grant, and a local contribution, are not sufficient to provide the heating and cleaning which are so essential for the health of the children, not to mention such requirements as the repair of broken windows, doors, desks and floors.  I would urge the Minister to increase the grant to the schools which are in a bad state of repair so as to help to dispel the physical discomforts and so provide an atmosphere for the normal healthy development of our children pending the provision of accommodation suitable for our children during their school hours.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is anything more I have to say, except to mention that I have noticed, since the return of Fianna Fáil as a Government, that there has been a recurrence in certain newspapers, aye and even in this House, by certain Deputies of the campaign against what is mistakenly termed compulsory Irish in the schools, with the suggestion that there should be a reversion to Irish as a voluntary subject.  We are all well aware of what little heed certain sections gave to Irish when it was a voluntary subject.  We can only assume that those people would again show their contempt for Irish if it became a compulsory subject.  There should be no question of creating a position in which those people, who wish to reject and despise the language, would be free to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two matters in connection with our schools that I want to raise on the Estimate. During the period of office of the Minister and of his predecessor, the schools in my area have been brought up to a good standard.  Yet, we have a big number of schools which are in urgent need of repair.  I shall mention two in particular&mdash;Callagh and Straide.  Both schools have been inspected by the Department, and I am sure the inspector has reported on them.  I understand that they have <Col N="965" /> been more or less condemned, and are to be replaced by new schools.  Work, I understand, will be carried on in them for some time as a result of a reconstruction grant which has been made available for both schools.  I hope that the Minister will do what he can in regard to the provision of new schools in both places.</P>
      <P>There is a new school to be provided at Crossmolina.  The number of children on rolls seems to be increasing. The area in which the school is situate is a small one, but there is a very big attendance of children at the school.  The present one is of the old standard size.  A small addition was built to it some time ago.  A new boys' school is to be provided on a separate site.  I would ask the Minister to hurry up a decision in regard to the erection of this new school. The site for it has been purchased.  I understand that the manager has made arrangements in regard to a local contribution. Water and sewerage are to be provided by the local authority.  All the formalities have been completed, I understand, and all that is being awaited now is the decision to start work on the new school.</P>
      <P>In regard to schools which are situate, say, 200 or 300 yards from the local town arrangements should I suggest be made for the provision of water and sewerage.  In fact, I think that should be made compulsory in areas where schools are not too far distant from a town which has these facilities. We can all realise what a great advantage it would be to the children attending those schools to have a supply of pure water available for drinking purposes. The children are in school for long hours and so a supply of pure water is really essential for them for health purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of cleaning of the schools, in some cases there is someone employed to do the sweeping and cleaning.  In the case of all schools, I think it would be of advantage to have a compulsory arrangement, that someone would be employed to clean up the schools after schools hours. It is not fair to ask the young boys or girls to remain over after school to <Col N="966" /> sweep up after a dusty day.  As the previous speaker said, you have old schools with old fireplaces, where they are sometimes waiting for the erection of a new school and there especially the dust is more general than in new schools.  A cleaning arrangement of some sort should be compulsory and someone should be employed specially to do it.</P>
    <P>Vocational education is of great benefit in rural areas to the boys and girls.  The regulation for the erection of vocational schools at present, regarding the number leaving school at a certain age and inside a certain radius, means I am afraid&mdash;unless some provisions are made by the Department to ease the regulation&mdash;that the rural areas will have very little hope of reaching the day when a vocational school will be erected in the area, where there may be a very big number of the young population attending schools.  The regulations provide that there must be a certain number of boys or girls leaving the national school around the age of 16 and that is confined to a radius of three miles.  The Department may extend it and go a little further.  If more of such schools were made available in rural areas or a smaller type, say, a one-teacher school, it might meet the ordinary demand for the local boys and girls.  It might ease the demand on the bigger schools, on the three-teacher and four-teacher schools in towns with a big population.  In those towns the town population can more than supply the limited number of places, while the boy in the rural area who is one, three or in some cases ten miles away, has not a hope of getting a place.</P>
    <P>Vocational education is one of the greatest things that can be operated for the young people.  In my area I know young boys who attended a vocational school and after their term there they went out working on their own and turned out to be first-class tradesmen, housebuilders or carpenters. You could not improve on the standard they reached after they left the vocational schools.  The same thing applies to young girls.  They get a standard of education in these vocational schools which is of immense <Col N="967" /> value to them.  If the scheme were extended more into the rural areas it would give an opening to such boys and girls.  Those who have got the standard of vocational education leaving those schools can get employment now wherever they go and they can carry their qualifications from those schools with them and look back on the education and training they got which has made them able to compete in the same job with people in this country or outside it anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>In the rural areas now there are many big garages, sometimes near small towns, and there seems to be some regulation that apprentices must have a certain standard of vocational education before they can be taken into those garages.  If that is compulsory and if the boys in the area convenient to the garage have not the possibility of attending a vocational school fairly near their homes, they will not get employment in the local garage&mdash;where they would have to work for a very small weekly wage while serving their time.</P>
    <P>In regard to the school medical examination, provision should be made in all schools for up-to-date accommodation for that inspection.  The Minister and his officials will agree that sometimes when the medical inspector, the doctor, calls to a school in a very backward place, perhaps on a mountainside, he has neither the accommodation, the light nor water that he needs.  Many of those schools are of an old type with poor fireplaces, they may have been condemned and the people may be waiting for a new school. Special provision or special regulations should be made to provide proper accommodation for that medical examination, so that the full benefit of the scheme may be given to the youngsters concerned.</P>
    <P>In regard to the local contributions for reconstruction or the building of new schools, I admit that the Department has been very fair and that the grants they give are very generous, but even with a generous grant the local contribution is a heavy strain on the <Col N="968" /> manager.  He has to find a lot of it himself, rather than see the school left in the same condition.  If it is going to cost £800 or £1,000, he may be asked to put up £100 or £200&mdash;it may be more or less&mdash;and it is hard for him to get that money.  The Minister will agree it is no easy job.  He has to collect it from the area where the children are leaving the school.  If he tries to collect it from those who are attending the school for the time being, those people may not have children attending in five years' time and may not wish to contribute for the time being, as they would not be making use of the school after it was put in repair.  I know the Minister has been reasonable and fair and that the local contribution is only a small portion of the cost, but even so I can assure the Minister&mdash;I feel sure he is aware of it himself&mdash;that it is no easy job for the manager to collect the sum necessary to have the work done.</P>
    <P>The question of maintenance arises. When a school is being reconstructed or repaired the manager is required to make a local contribution which may be anything from £50 to £200.  It is not easy to get that.  There is a second charge for maintenance.  Maintenance costs may run to £200 or £300.  That is the main difficulty.  The present Minister and the previous Minister and every Minister for Education in my time and everyone connected with education were generous.  During the last 30 years a big change has been effected in regard to national schools. Schools are now coming up to a good standard.  There are some beautiful new schools.  Old schools have been repaired.  There remain a big number of schools in backward areas which are in urgent need of repair.  I trust that the work will be continued so that within the next five to ten years there will not be any school that is not of the highest standard, providing good accommodation and comfort for the young children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy will congratulate the Minister on the fact that additional work and additional money is being provided for the reconstruction of schools and the building of <Col N="969" /> new schools.  That is a matter for satisfaction.  It is impossible to fail to observe the new school buildings that are springing up throughout the country.  They are extremely well designed and, to the layman's eye, very suitable for the purpose for which they are intended.  Satisfaction should be expressed because of the fact that money is being provided for the reconstruction and improvement of school buildings.</P>
      <P>I do not hold the view that the people of the parish or district or the parents should depend entirely on the central Government for all the money needed for this purpose.  Nothing is more important than that there should be a sense of local self-reliance and local patriotism which will inspire the local people to put up portion of the cost.  That principle should be enunciated by all Deputies and brought home to the people generally.  If this country is to depend entirely on the State for everything the people need from the cradle to the grave we will cease to be a free nation.  The principle of a local contribution is sound.  Deputy Browne referred to the amounts required for the reconstruction or improvement of a school as being in the neighbourhood of £200 or £300.  These may seem considerable sums but it is possible to raise these sums by active local endeavour without the necessity for a collection, merely through the provision of entertainments in the parochial hall.  That has been done in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to primary education it is more important&mdash;I think the Minister has expressed the view&mdash;to make our children good, independent, self-reliant citizens capable of making their way through life than to stuff them with a lot of figures and facts derived from books which will be completely forgotten after leaving school. It is more important that children should be able to read and write well and to have a taste for reading and writing than that they should be crammed with subjects which are perhaps distasteful to them and which are acquired mainly for the purpose <Col N="970" /> of an examination and are forgotten almost immediately.  I hope that theory will be kept in mind by teachers</P>
    <P>Last year I suggested that there should be an organised move on the part of teachers to find ways and means, by co-operation amongst themselves, to improve the standard and methods of education.  We have now, thank God, an organisation of farmers for the purpose of acquiring better methods of farming.  It would be a good thing if teachers, particularly young teachers, came together to find ways and means of overcoming the difficulties they encounter, to find better methods of teaching, to learn all that there is to be learned about teaching and to develop a spirit of enthusiasm to make their schools better and to turn out better citizens.  Such a move was long advocated in regard to agriculture.  It was a long time coming but it has come and, if fostered, will do an enormous amount of good. It should come also in education.  For many years teachers organised but it was mainly a trade union movement for the purpose of improving their position.  It is essential that they should come together and consult with a view to making education more effective.</P>
    <P>Every teacher will admit that a great deal of the work he does goes down the drain, so to speak.  A teacher meets past pupils who have left school only a short time and finds that they have forgotten a very great deal that they have learned.  He encounters many ex-pupils who were fairly bright at school but who make complete failures of their lives and he wonders was it, perhaps, due to some fault on his part.</P>
    <P>These are questions that teachers should be discussing between themselves and these are problems which they should be trying to solve.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with those Deputies who regularly every year in this debate demand that children in the primary schools should be completely exempt from doing any form of manual work. The whole basis of education is to teach people at an early age to use both their minds and their bodies to the best advantage in going through <Col N="971" /> life.  Complete concentration on brain-work alone for young people is neither right nor desirable.  It might be said by some that children go to school to acquire a formal education in literary subjects.  It might be said that as far as manual instruction or physical instruction is concerned they can get that in their homes.  We must remember, however, that every home is not a model home, and I think that every school should try to be a model school inasmuch as it would give a certain amount, not only of mental training, but of manual or physical training. Children generally have a certain amount of distaste for too much brain-work. They are inclined to tire after a certain amount of it.  They like a little relaxation.  No normal child objects to being asked to do a little work in the matter of brightening his or her immediate surroundings or the school itself.  The old ideal in regard to that was that children should be taught to make their school better, brighter and more attractive, taught to help in the cleaning of the school, cleaning the windows if you like, in making the school bright and cheerful and perhaps in planting flowers or shrubs about the school so that it would look more like a home or farmhouse. That should be the ideal in regard to education.</P>
    <P>If there is a plot of ground adjoining the school, a real effort should be made to employ the children for a short time each week in planting it and so brighten the minds of the children. The natural instinct of a child is to look at everything that is growing. Children have a love for growing plants and vegetables and everything of that kind and the training that they would receive in attractive work of that kind would be beneficial to them all their lives.  It is not right for children to do hard or unpleasant or distasteful work, but it is right to encourage them to do work which is attractive to them and which they will enjoy doing with their hands.  It ought to be the fundamental basis of education to teach children to write well and to read, to give them a taste for reading what is good and desirable.  In that way you are laying <Col N="972" /> the foundations for an education that is suitable for children whether they are to spend their lives on the land or doing manual work or eventually to graduate to higher vocations.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in what I might describe as primary education for our agricultural and rural community and our working population generally.  It is in this field that there is great need for development.  I mentioned this matter last year in a general way, and I am glad to notice that during the past year in the County Wicklow concrete proposals were put forward for improving vocational education.  These proposals in regard to West Wicklow have come from the local branches of Macra na Feirme, or the young farmers' clubs. They have put up to the local vocational committee proposals for extending and improving vocational education.</P>
    <P>The broad outline of their plan is that Baltinglass, where there is a well-equipped vocational school, should become the principal centre for the whole of West Wicklow area and that affiliated, if you like, with that principal centre there should be a number of sub-centres, in Dunlavin, Hollywood, Blessington, Kiltegan, Rathangan, Grangecon, etc.  Those sub-centres would each possess a small hall or building or a large room in some place in which evening classes would be held.  In the principal centre there would be day classes of course and evening classes as well.  In the sub-centres there could not be day classes, but there would be evening classes in woodwork, domestic economy for girls, rural science, which is most important for farmers and farm workers, adult education, and Irish.  There would also be public lectures, educational films and discussion groups.  In addition, in each of them you would have a branch of the county library.</P>
    <P>In the main, these are the proposals put up by Macra na Feirme so far as West Wicklow is concerned.  They are constructive proposals and they should be examined and implemented if possible.  It would mean, of course, some small addition to the staff of the central vocational school.  There would <Col N="973" /> need to be a rural science teacher, and, of course, he would be largely engaged in conducting the evening classes in the different sub-centres.  If these proposals are implemented, it is hoped to bring about a position which is altogether desirable, that no boy or girl leaving the national school and intending to take up manual work or intending to go for a higher education would be left without an opportunity of obtaining additional education.  As far as young farmers and young farm workers are concerned, it is very often difficult for small farmers and even more difficult for farm labourers to send their sons to a day school and take them away from their work.  When they reach the school-leaving age, their services are very often required on the farm.</P>
    <P>They can all attend the evening classes and I think evening classes are all-important.  In that way they can acquire the theoretical knowledge which is essential to the agricultural labourer and the farmer who would benefit immensely by learning all there is to be known about the various aspects of the industry, the value of fertilisers, the constituents of the soil, the values of feeding stuffs and the qualities of the different breeds of live stock.  In addition, perhaps, they would get a little smattering of veterinary knowledge which is also very important.  Furthermore, girls would receive extra knowledge in addition to their ordinary education.  They would also receive domestic economy instruction which would fit them to take up positions available at the present time and would ensure that they would become good housewives later in life.</P>
    <P>I think the plan submitted by Macra na Feirme in regard to West Wicklow is a good one.  It is a good thing that the young farmers have come together and put up proposals of this kind to the Minister for Education.  It is a good thing that we have that spirit of progress and that desire to improve the most important thing in regard to life generally which is the improvement of the general knowledge of our people so that they will become better citizens, better farmers, better workers and be better qualified to fight their <Col N="974" /> way through life.  This proposal of the young farmers' clubs in West Wicklow raises another question and I wonder whether the Minister has given any attention to it.  It is the proposal on the relationship between the Department of Education and the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>In regard to education, the primary function of the Department of Education is to educate but the Department of Agriculture also shares a little responsibility in this connection inasmuch as its function is also to provide agricultural education.  Some line of demarcation should be drawn between the functions of the Department of Education and those of the Department of Agriculture.  As far as the organising of day or evening classes is concerned that should be the function of the Department of Education. They should be finally concerned with the provision of vocational education in every form for the younger people, particularly vocational education.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture have enough to do.  Their agricultural instructors visit the farms operating the various schemes and the Department provides an advisory service.  That is their function and it is one which gives them plenty of work to do.  I know that at the present time instructors of the Department of Agriculture are finding it difficult to cope with the amount of work they have to do with regard to soil testing and matters of that kind.  The organising and holding of classes should be left to the Department of Education through the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>If we had a scheme such as is outlined by Macra na Feirme for West Wicklow I think you would fill a very great need and provide a very sound general vocational education for all our young people.  I should mention that the Macra na Feirme organisation in regard to West Wicklow touched upon another aspect of this problem.  There is, as I have said, one principal centre &mdash;I think that is what it is called&mdash;the vocational school in Baltinglass which is a day school.  It is not physically possible for any youngster residing outside a four or five mile radius of Baltinglass to attend those classes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> The question arises whether it would be desirable to provide some form of transport or whether the Department of Education would assist in some way in providing that transport so as to cater for those living outside a five or six mile radius of Baltinglass.  A five or six mile radius is a rather wide radius.  In fact, you could hardly expect a youngster of 15 or 16 to cycle more than that distance anyway.  In West Wicklow you have, perhaps, children living 15, 20 or 25 miles distant from the vocational schools.  If it were possible to assist in some way in regard to transport it would help greatly.</P>
    <P>A certain percentage of the children would need to travel.  Others who would not require the full programme of education provided in the day schools would attend the night schools in their own district but there will be a certain number who would need or desire to benefit from the full programme of education in the day school at Baltinglass.  The number might not be very great but it would be desirable to provide some form of transport.  I mention this not because it is a local problem but because there is probably a similar position in other areas.  It is just a question of whether it would be cheaper to help in regard to transport rather than multiply the number of day vocational schools throughout the country.  I feel that some assistance in regard to transport would be the better of the two propositions because you would have larger classes and it would be possible to have a more efficient school.  The cost of building at the present time is enormous.  I know the cost of transport is also heavy.  Nevertheless, I think the provision of transport would be the cheaper of the two propositions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the heating of schools, it is time that more schools, whether they be new or old, adopted more modern methods of heating.  An open fireplace in a school-room is hardly the best way to heat a school.  Most of the heat travels up the chimney along with the smoke and I suppose the draught of the chimney adds to the draughtiness of the school.  Science has made some progress in regard to heating and <Col N="976" /> it is desirable to see if it would not be possible, by installing a modern heating system, to provide (1)  a more efficient heating system and (2)  perhaps an even cheaper heating system.  I am not in a position to suggest what particular type of heating system should be adopted&mdash;whether it should be a storage system of electric heating or fuel utilised in a more beneficial way with the aid of modern heating appliances.</P>
    <P>I know that it is usual to ask the State to do everything for everybody and at the same time to reduce taxation but you cannot have it both ways. Even if it were possible for the State to provide money for everything for everybody, without increasing taxation, that might not be the best thing for us.  I consider that it is a good education for our people to learn to be a little more self-sufficient not only nationally but parochially and even individually.  An organised effort on the part of the community in every parish and district could work wonders in regard to improving the appearance of a school and its surroundings and in regard to maintaining and heating it and making it comfortable for the children.  I suppose that if the Minister asked local people to do certain things they would say that he was going to take a burden of his own shoulders and put it on those of somebody else.  I consider that an organised effort should be made by the people themselves in every district to get the utmost value they can out of the amenities provided by the State at present rather than to seek to make bigger demands upon the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister has provided an account in regard to progress in education during the past year, and I hope that next year he will be able to give us an account of still further progress. I understand from the Minister's statement that the report of the Council of Education will be published in the near future.  I sincerely trust that it will provide scope for further improvements in regard to education. I hope that it will provide some concrete ideas of a constructive nature and that it will help us to improve our educational standards.  The whole progress <Col N="977" /> of the nation depends upon the type and standard of education which is provided.  I am sure that no Minister has ever taken office as Minister for Education who was more conscious of that fact than the present Minister. I think everybody will wish him success in the efforts which he is genuinely making to improve education both in the higher spheres, about which I know but little, and in the lower spheres of primary and vocational education, about which I know something and in which I take a very considerable interest.  I believe that it is in that particular field that there is the most room for development.  We are, perhaps, giving higher education to too great a number of our people. We are, perhaps, educating too many people for the learned professions and not enough for the ordinary productive avocations of life.  Every acre of waste land in this country is a reflection upon our educational system.  Every inefficiently worked farm is a reflection upon our educational system. Every up-to-date homestead and farm and every up-to-date workshop and factory is a tribute to our system of education.</P>
    <P>I think there is a very wide scope in this country for development not only in relation to agriculture but also in relation to the skilled trades.  We are only just at the beginning of the mechanisation of agriculture and with its development comes the need for skilled mechanics of every kind who will help the farmer to get the most out of his machinery by keeping it in repair.  The blacksmith, the shoemaker and craftsmen of that kind are being pushed aside and craftsmen of a new type are taking their place.  The vocational schools are helping to train our people in these new crafts.  On every farm there is a need for constructional work&mdash;for the building of concrete walls, of modern outhouses, and so forth.  Such work can be carried out by farmers' sons provided they get training in it at the vocational school.  An immense and extending field of work lies before the vocational schools.  I hope that the Minister, in co-operation with the Council of Education in the first place, with the <Col N="978" /> parochial authorities in the second place and last, but not least, with the young farmers' clubs in the various districts, will help to make agriculture more attractive from the point of view of our young people generally and particularly in rural communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The trend of this debate has been towards the policy in relation to the Irish language.  Many speakers here have taken the line that the approach to this problem does not appear to be the proper one.  We heard a very good contribution from Deputy Ormonde on this problem, but he spoiled a very good speech by his final reference to compulsory Irish.  It is very well known that the question of compulsory Irish for this country was decided upon by Sinn Féin and Deputy Ormonde's Party has no monopoly, so far as the Sinn Féin policy is concerned.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the present system of teaching Irish here does not create the type of enthusiasm which will establish the language in the minds of the people.  It was mentioned earlier in the debate that a teacher who meets one of his former pupils in the primary schools a couple of years after that pupil has left the school and who addresses him in Irish, finds that he is unable to reply to him, notwithstanding the fact that that pupil during his school years had Irish drummed into him.  That clearly demonstrates that the policy in relation to the restoration of the language is the wrong one.  The learning of Irish for examinations is apparently a mechanical matter.  So long as a pupil can pass examinations by learning Irish in a mechanical way, the object is achieved and, rightly enough, a Deputy who spoke earlier said that, instead of having these examinations which brought the test of the language down to a fine art, it might be better to encourage the language in a general way instead of providing the type of knowledge required for these highly competitive examinations on which in many cases the career of a child depends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could devise a system which would create in the children a natural appreciation of the language, it would <Col N="979" /> be more successful.  When one sees the wonderful change which is brought about in the knowledge of the language secured by the lucky child who can go to the Gaeltacht for a month in the summer, once or twice during his school years, we should examine what has brought about the grip of the language which that child gets in such a short time, compared with the other child who has the language drummed into him one day after another.  The reason, of course, is that the acquisition and adoption of the language is associated with the child's recreation, with the fun and games and the eventful life of the child during that month or two in the Gaeltacht, apart from the fact that the language he uses there is exclusively Irish, or at least is expected to be and in most cases is.  They get a grip of the language because it is associated with their natural inclinations, with their recreation and all that happens during their holiday.  I think we should take a lesson from the results that can be achieved by these brief holidays in the Gaeltacht by the lucky few of the thousands of children who are being taught Irish at present.</P>
    <P>I should like to say at this stage that we should examine the possibility of having something like an Irish week. That would create a spirit of co-operation amongst the community in general in the effort to restore the language as a spoken language.  It can be done but we do not seem to have advanced very far on the road towards it.  I say that it can be done because one has only to cross the Irish Sea to hear the Welsh people speaking their own language, and similarly Scottish people speaking their language.  We should be able to restore the language if we adopt the proper approach and go about it in the proper way.  Apparently the system adopted up to this has not brought the success which was expected and desired, and for that reason we must change our approach.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the possibility of holding an Irish-speaking week because it might instil in our people a community spirit that would be associated <Col N="980" /> with the language.  For one reason or another our own people are sometimes inclined to ridicule the language and people who try to use it in public, and I feel that if this idea of an Irish week were adopted the person who would despise the language would be the person who would be ridiculed and not the person trying to use the language.  We had this year an effort to revive Irish culture and it is intended to have similar occasions in future years.  That is a good thing and I feel that the revival of the language might be approached in the same way seeing that the policy which has been in operation now for 30 years has not achieved all that was expected, as we must admit.</P>
    <P>In the primary schools, the present approach is more classical and cultural than practical, and, when it is a matter of giving children a start in life in the years during which they attend the primary school, from the ages of eight years up to 14 years, I think we should have a more practical approach and seek to equip the children as best we can for the years ahead.  For instance, the children are taught geometry, mathematics and other subjects all of which are intended to help the child to think for himself and to reason for himself, but there are other aspects of normal life which will present themselves to the children in later years which are not dealt with in the primary schools.  I feel that they should be.</P>
    <P>In the case of girls at these schools, from the ages of 11 or 12 to 14 years, they should get some practical demonstrations in relation to normal house duties.  These children leave the schools without being told how to sew a button, except where there are special needlework classes in the schools, how to boil an egg properly or how to make a cup of tea.  These are the things they will be doing in future years as part of their ordinary household duties and I feel that the elementary aspect of household duties should be taught to children in these schools.</P>
    <P>I am very glad to say I know of one national school in County Dublin where the teachers voluntarily give that instruction <Col N="981" /> during their spare time; after the school has closed they give instruction of that nature to the more senior of the pupils if you can call them senior when they are 13 or 14 years of age.  It is a very desirable thing to equip them in that way with those practical lectures and demonstrations because what they thus learn at the primary school they will remember afterwards due to the fact that it is absolutely elementary.</P>
    <P>Similarly young boys of 13 or 14 years of age, should be given demonstrations and lectures in relation to ordinary handiwork in the home in connection with the various problems that arise there, the maintenance of the home and the other small matters that need to be attended to.  I feel young boys ought to get some education of that kind.  Of course, all the pupils should be given lectures in relation to the civic spirit, particularly in regard to their fellowmen and to their country.</P>
    <P>It was said that teaching girls and boys the elementary matters I mentioned apart from a proper civic spirit is a matter for the parents to attend to at home.  Unfortunately the circumstances in all homes are not the same and the chance of every pupil getting the advantage of demonstrations and lectures of this nature is not there.  Therefore, when you get the group of pupils together, it would be an advantage to let them have this instruction in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>A problem facing many poor parents all over the country at the present time is the cost of school books.  It is a problem that faces parents every year according as the children advance from one class to another.  I wonder whether the Minister would consider the adoption of a standard set of school books which could be used from one year to another.  If we take, for instance, the 4th standard in a primary school and a certain set of books for that particular standard&mdash;English literature, Irish literature, mathemathics, history and geography and any other subjects that might be taught in 4th class&mdash;would it not be <Col N="982" /> possible to have a standard type of books which would enable a child having reached the 4th standard to go through the year with those books and the following year to give the children who advance from 3rd into 4th class the same books and the same education from those books.</P>
    <P>There is an inclination, I know, to change from one year to another the type of books used for teaching the same subjects.  The result is that the parents whose child has gone on one year and whose next child comes into that standard are faced with the necessity of buying a new set of books. That is why I would like the Minister to examine the possibility of having some kind of standard books which might result in that economy which is very important where the children of very poor parents are concerned.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, in my experience I have found in connection with school repairs, that the allocation of finance and the preparation of plans for such work seem to take a very long time, in fact, an unreasonable time.  Would it be possible for the Minister to examine this question?  We all know these arrangements are made between the school manager on the one side, the Minister on the other side, with the Board of Works taking an active part in it, too, in relation to the plans.  Of course, the parish priest or the school manager, whoever he may be, finds it necessary to get some of the finance for the cost of those repairs.</P>
    <P>Could anything be done to improve the machinery which results in the long run in having a school repaired? I have in mind a school at Corduff, near Lusk.  It is about five years now since the parents of the children going to that school first began to agitate for having certain repairs carried out. Unfortunately the work has not yet been done.  I do not know whether the Department, the Board of Works or the manager is to blame, but in any case the children and the parents are suffering at the moment.  The school yard is in a very bad state of repair and the children in the normal way playing about in what is only a mud bank naturally fall and their clothing <Col N="983" /> is destroyed.  It is a hardship on the parents to find their children coming home with mud from head to foot in consequence of the fact that this school yard has not been properly repaired.  I understand one reason for the delay is that the Board of Works requires the yard to be done according to specification, which might be a very costly matter, whereas if they were prepared to give a smaller amount in order to have a fairly good job done the problem would be met but the requirements of the Department would not.</P>
    <P>There is also a crowded school at St. Margarets, which is outside Finglas.  I was very glad to see during the year that the new school at Kinsealy was opened.  I think there were 180 pupils there and the school originally was built for 40.  Some of the children used to bring their chairs with them and others used to have to take turns sitting on the existing seating accommodation.  We have a good school there now but the conditions I have mentioned are now in the school at St. Margarets.  I know efforts are being made to arrange with the Department for the provision of a new school there and I am mentioning it in this debate because I would like to bring the urgency of the matter to the notice of the Minister.  St. Margarets, of course, is linked up with the schooling arrangements in Finglas because it is the same school manager who is concerned.  The problem of Finglas has become very great owing to the large number of corporation houses that has been built.  At the moment it is necessary for the children to go in busloads into the city national schools wherever they can get accommodation because there is not sufficient accommodation in the old national school; it is not really an old school which is in Finglas but it was not built to accommodate a rapidly growing city population which we have in the Finglas area.</P>
    <P>I would like to have a statement from the Minister regarding the school building programme.  I suppose the school at St. Margarets which I have <Col N="984" /> mentioned is only one of hundreds of national schools that are required throughout the country.  I would like a statement from him regarding the progress which is expected to be achieved during the coming year.  The building programme in the matter of private housing has been considerably curtailed but of course the provision of national schools does not come into the same category.  For that reason, I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that the building programme in regard to schools will be pursued with all speed.  A very elaborate plan for the provision of school buildings all over the country was decided upon some years ago and that policy has been pursued vigorously. I should like, as I have said, an assurance from the Minister that it will be continued.</P>
    <P>There has been a very remarkable development in regard to vocational education which compensates in some measure for the fact that many children are obliged to leave school at 14 years of age.  At that age they are neither children nor adults.  They are physically unfitted for the manual work that might be demanded from them and they are not mentally equipped for other work for at least two or three years more&mdash;until they reach the age of 17 or 18.  In the meantime the vocational schools come to the rescue. If it is not the policy of the Department to increase the school-leaving age from 14 to 15 or even 16 years, I think the need for vocational education will become even greater.  We have seen the advantages which vocational education brings not alone to city areas but also to remote rural areas.</P>
    <P>I am aware that every effort is being made by various local authorities in co-operation with the Department of Education to provide this vocational education.  Vocational classes are being very well attended and they are a very valuable asset for children when they leave the primary school.  There is an inclination I know on the part of some people who have hobbies to take advantage of the classes provided for adults.  I am very glad to reiterate the view expressed by other Deputies, that we should <Col N="985" /> make sure that vocational education will, first of all, be made available for persons to whom it will be of practical advantage by way of enabling them to earn a livelihood and to contribute something to the community.  When these services are availed of by persons who desire to pursue carpentry, for example, as a hobby, for the purpose of making dressers or wardrobes that can be used in their own homes, I think the advantage of vocational education is nullified to some extent. I feel that the real advantage of such education is that it enables young people to become craftsmen and to enter the various trades.</P>
    <P>I should like to find out from the Minister, if he himself is not responsible for controlling the circulation of some of the vulgar comics that are circulating through the country, whether anybody else can be held responsible. I know that the circulation of these undesirable comics amongst young people is not a matter that comes within the functions of the Minister for Education but, at least, it can be said that comics do make an impression on the minds of children and for that reason they can be associated with education in a general way.  The education to be derived from them is not unfortunately of a good type and for that reason I should like to hear some comment from the Minister in relation to the vulgar comics I have mentioned.  Sometimes these comics are a great attraction to certain types of children but even in the case of harmless comics, the print is so small that it might be injurious to the children's eyesight.  I think a standard size print should be laid down in relation to these comics.  Children read them, study them and enjoy them, but in most cases a very cheap type of small print is used.  In the long run it might prove harmful to the children's eyesight although the comics may be quite innocent in another way.</P>
    <P>A problem that arises in national schools all over the country is the cost of heating such schools.  The question of securing the necessary finances to purchase turf or coal for these schools is an annual problem.  I am aware <Col N="986" /> that in many private concerns cheap heating arrangements which are not of an elaborate type are now being used.  In fact, it seems that the more elaborate the heating arrangement, the less effective and the more costly it is. I should like to know from the Minister whether the question of providing simple cheap heating plants in schools has been considered.  Possibly oil heaters or turf burners would be far more effective than a fire of coal or turf in an open grate where most of the heat goes up the chimney.  The ideal arrangement would be to have a uniform heat all over the room.  It might be argued that an oil heater or a turf burner would not have a very attractive appearance but I think that the desirability of having a proper uniform temperature in the school room should overcome that objection. It would be helpful if the Department would indicate to school managers all over the country the type of heating plant they consider most useful in these days because, I think, most of us must admit that the open grate is out of date, especially so far as school rooms are concerned.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the progress made by the Department during the past year.  I think it is the only Department of Government at the present time that has shown anxiety to get ahead and to make progress.  Finally, I want to say that the difficulty existing between the teachers on the one hand and the Department on the other, should be remedied.  It does not make for harmoney in the work of education and, having given some study to the matter, I think the problem could be solved. There should be a little give and take on both sides and the Department should not, I think adopt an unreasonable attitude towards the teachers in relation to the matter at issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to learn from the Minister's speech that he has endeavoured to initiate a survey of the Dublin City schools in an effort to further the education of backward or mentally retarded children.  I think it will be generally agreed that such education is a very urgent matter and <Col N="987" /> I sincerely hope that the Minister will deal expeditiously with the problem. These unfortunate children need all the help we can give them in order to imbue them with hope and confidence. It is difficult for the normal child to make his way in the world to-day. What is it for the child who is backward? He has a very poor chance in this competitive age.  Anything the Minister can do to remedy the present situation will meet with the approval of every Deputy and with the approval of the parents of these children.  The teachers who are working at the moment with these children deserve our thanks.  They will get every blessing for their work.  It is a noble work and it deserves the highest praise.  I appeal to the Minister to deal expeditiously with the matter.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister, I do not slavishly want to adopt the educational methods of other countries but it must be agreed that we lag far behind many countries in relation to the provision of school libraries and physical education.  I can speak with more authority on physical education than I can on school libraries.  I think the provision of such libraries is an excellent idea because it gives the children an opportunity of widening the scope of their knowledge with the aid of books, other than text books.  I think every effort should be made to have a good supply of such books in the schools.  The local authorities could help and I, as a member of the Dublin Corporation, will do everything in my power to see that any improvement that can be made in school libraries will be made.  It is a good thing to see the children reading good books instead of the comics about which we heard so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are very far behind other countries in relation to physical education. I think that is a great pity.  I have personal knowledge of the physical education that takes place in countries like Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Poland.  Possibly there may be other ideas behind the physical education programme in such countries.  All I am concerned with is the general physique of our children. Proper recreational facilities improve <Col N="988" /> physique and make the children mentally alert.</P>
    <P>We should pay tribute to the teachers who, far from regarding themselves as having fulfilled their obligation when they have finished teaching, devote a great deal of their spare time in the evenings and over the week-ends in the interests of their pupils in relation to physical training and recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>I am associated with swimming here in Dublin.  We have a Schools Swimming Association and it would do the Minister good to see the teachers spending their Saturday mornings teaching the children how to swim down in the baths in Tara Street.  We are all concerned with reducing drowning statistics.  Whilst that matter does not come under the jurisdiction of the Minister, I think it is germane to point out that if children are taught how to swim, not alone will they be able to possibly save their own lives but they may at some future date be able to save the lives of others.</P>
    <P>Last year in Dublin a young boy, Charles Beare, age 13, a pupil of the Christian Brothers School in North Brunswick Street, who learned to swim in the primary schools instruction class, saved a school pal, aged 12, from drowning in the canal.  In Cork a young boy, Dominick Kelly, dived into the River Lee and rescued a four-year-old child.  Not alone did he rescue the child but he also rescued a man who had gone to the child's assistance. Two people are alive to-day as a result of that lad's pluck.  That is one reason why I am keen on this type of education. It is certainly worth while. The Minister in his speech said that he would like to see one day, or a half-day, set aside upon which teachers could indulge their liking for a particular subject.  He felt that would help to broaden the outlook of the child.  I would appeal to teachers to adopt that suggestion.  The Minister asked for comment or criticism.  I think that is an excellent idea and one that should be adopted.</P>
    <P>In Dublin we have the Primary Schools League, the Pembroke Schools Sports Committee and similar bodies doing excellent work.  I think we should put it on record that we are <Col N="989" /> very grateful to the teachers for the work they are doing because, by voluntary effort, they are trying to fill the gap in the ordinary school curriculum. Their voluntary effort is something of which we should be proud. Unfortunately we have only two swimming baths in Dublin.  I know this is really a matter for the Minister for Local Government but, if any proposition is put forward relative to the provision of swimming baths, I appeal to the Minister to bear in mind what I have said in relation to swimming instruction in the schools.  The existing baths are a disgrace and steps should be taken to remedy the position. The Minister should support any proposition put forward in that respect.</P>
    <P>I know one school in Dublin where the staff arrange an annual visit for the children to places of scenic and historical interest, such as Glendalough and the Boyne Valley.  That gives the children an opportunity of visiting these places and opens for them a window, as it were, to the cultural and historic past.  I know the young people enjoy these trips.  Other associations, such as the Junior Red Cross, are doing excellent work.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a special tribute to the Dublin Municipal School of Music.  I have attended all the concerts this year.  The standard has improved considerably and I was very much impressed at a recent concert in the Gresham Hotel.  On a visit to Warsaw recently I went to a schools concert and the music was first class. I would like the pupils in Dublin to get every opportunity of continuing their studies.  If that is given we may possibly have less complaints in future in connection with the staffing of the Radio Éireann Orchestra.</P>
    <P>I think that we have very good talent in the Municipal School of Music which should be watched and developed so that those who possess it may in time be in a position to man our orchestras. I have always held the opinion that they should be manned by our own people.  That is not possible at present because the standard required is very high, and those who get positions on them must as a rule spend some time studying under famous musicians from other countries.  As I say, the talent <Col N="990" /> that is available in the Municipal School of Music should be carefully watched and every effort made to develop it.</P>
    <P>There is in Dublin&mdash;the matter has already been mentioned in this debate &mdash;great concern regarding the question of untrained teachers.  I am personally aware that this is a matter that is causing a great deal of concern to the parents of children attending our city schools.  I should like to see the Minister tackling it as early as possible.  I know it is a big task, but I am sure that if he gets down to the work he will do what he can about it.  One of my own children is attending a school in the locality where I live.  He was transferred from one class to another. There is an untrained teacher in the second class, and we can see the difference.  I think that is a matter that requires urgent attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy A. Byrne referred to the Dublin Corporation and the Department of Education regarding the question of school sites in our housing schemes.  I think he should know that the housing committee of the Dublin Corporation make every effort to help the Archbishop and the priests who have to deal with the schools.  There was no need to mention the matter here so far as getting co-operation from the housing committee of the Corporation is concerned.  I believe that we are barred in some way from selling sites for schools.  We have carried out some very good schemes with the approval of the Archbishop who has paid tribute to us time and again.  I do not think the Minister has anything to worry about so far as the Dublin Corporation is concerned. It will do everything possible to provide sites for schools, if it is within its power to do so.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to join with other Deputies in paying tribute to the Minister and his staff for the courtesy they have shown at all times to members of this House.  On the few occasions that I had to trouble the Department I received nothing but courtesy from the Minister and his staff.  It is one Department where you are received with open arms and given every possible help.  I have had little to do with other Departments of State.  I <Col N="991" /> should like on this occasion to thank the Minister and his staff for their courtesy to me.  The Minister's report on a good year's work can, I think, be summed up by saying, go h-an-mhaith ar fad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCrowe" hpid="Mr. Crowe Mr. Crowe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to direct the Minister's attention to the dilapidated condition of some of our country schools, not only to their dilapidated condition but to the paths leading to some of them in mountainy areas.  In one such area, I know that some 20 children, in order to reach the school, have to wade through a river, morning and afternoon.  There is no bridge to enable them to cross the river.  Deputy Gallagher was speaking a little time ago about a young hero. It struck me very forcibly at the time that many of these children would have been drowned but for the fact that a young hero came to their rescue.  I would, therefore, appeal to the Minister to do what he can to get a bridge provided for that area.</P>
      <P>Many children attending country schools have to travel morning and evening along what we call Mass paths. I mention that as one of the difficulties which these children have to contend with.  We have many areas of that sort in the country.  I would be prepared at any time to show the Minister over the difficult country which the children have to travel in order to reach school. When they do reach the school, one must confess that the school buildings are in an appalling condition.  We know, of course, that some of the fine men who helped to make this country got their education in schools of that kind.  In conclusion, I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to do the best he can for some of our national schools which are situated in backward country areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to come back to one point that has been made on previous occasions on this Estimate.  It is the question of whether it is necessary or not to review our basic approach to education in this country.  A great deal of useful work has been done.  There are, however, certain traits developing in our national character.  Some have developed, <Col N="992" /> and some are, undoubtedly, a legacy from a bad time, but they have left us in ways, compared with other peoples, a little bit indolent, a little bit distrustful of the future and a little bit reluctant to put in effort to-day with the faith that we will reap to-morrow, and with too great a desire to look at, or to judge, the worth-whileness of anything by whether it gives an immediate return or not.</P>
      <P>That, of course, is very understandable in our history.  There was a time when, if the proprietor of a holding were to improve his land&mdash;even if he was to sow more than he did the previous year&mdash;he immediately ran the risk of an increase in his rent or of some other penalty attaching to his own energy and improvement.  That is the historical factor in the case.  In the same way, in the case of those working under conditions where there was no security, there was no incentive to build for the future.  It is noticeable, however, in other countries that have prospered and have built themselves up, that their efforts have been characterised by a willingness on the part of the population to knuckle down to work in the faith that, in due course, they would reap the reward of their labours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering how far our educational system has a bearing on that problem and, of course, it is only in so far as it has that the subject is relevant to this Estimate at all.  How far can we throw our educational system, so as to build up national morale? The question could be put that way and the answer will have to be sought in two ways.  One is from the point of view of establishing the ideal and establishing the will to achieve; that you might call the spiritual or psychological side of the problem.  The other side is the giving to the child and the citizen of to-morrow the physical and mental equipment that would enable him to be efficient in achieving the development that we all say we want to see in this country.  In regard to the first, basically in our outlook&mdash;in recent years, anyway&mdash;our people are getting a fairly sound introduction to principle in regard to both national and spiritual concepts and even to broad social concepts I think that <Col N="993" /> some attention is being given; but enough has not been done to relate those principles to action.</P>
    <P>For instance, we are shy about trying to develop in the child a pride in ourselves and in our own traditions and a pride in our history, tragic as it has been in parts.  We give lip service to it and we insist on some aspects of it, but perhaps our very insistence on some of those aspects, without going further to give a complete picture, may have been more harmful in the long run.  We do not seem to appreciate as a people that it is worth while to try and we will not appreciate it, unless what we are trying for is shown to us to be worth while; and that seems to me to be something tied up very closely with the education of the child in the home and the school.  Without going into any further detail on that particular aspect of it&mdash;and it is fundamental&mdash;one has to consider the practical aspect of giving to the child the equipment necessary.  Perhaps when one considers that side of it one seems some of the reasons why we have failed on the first leg.</P>
    <P>In modern life there is an awful lot a child has to be fitted for.  There has been a great deal of development.  On the other hand, the potential of the human being has not increased markedly in that period.  We find ourselves now in a set-up where the individual requires a certain knowledge over and above that which the average citizen required, say, 50 years ago. Nowadays, for instance, it is desirable to know something about mechanical transport, no matter what you are at, whether you are a labourer or whether you own a car.  Driving a motor vehicle has really become a normal incident in the life of any modern person. In agriculture, there is a considerable amount of machinery involved nowadays.  In any industry there is machinery involved.  Even though at first sight it may not seem to require anything more than was required in days when tools and mechanisms were simpler, on an analysis it will be found that it does require some further knowledge.  The result of all this is that that type of learning is an addition to the child at the present day. <Col N="994" /> Couple that with the fact that in practically any branch of knowledge you care to take there have been very rapid developments nowadays and that these tend to be passed on through teachers to students, and the more teachers specialise in a particular subject the greater that danger is.  The almost inevitable result of that is to try to do too much in schools in regard to imparting knowledge, to try to cover too wide a field.  The result of covering too wide a field is that you do not do certain things with sufficient thoroughness and if certain basic things are not done with sufficient thoroughness, character suffers.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion, when pursuing that point perhaps a little bit more concretely than I have done to-day, I tried to point out that there are people who feel that a weakness in our national character to-day is a lack of sustained application, coupled with a lack of attention to detail and a lack of thoroughness which may conceivably I think largely be attributed to a certain failing in the type of education that we have been giving our children for the past 25 or 30 years. It is attributable to that, which in turn is probably attributable to the broader factors I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I can only talk with a certain amount of experience from my own experience and those of my contemporaries under the intermediate system. We happened to be the victims, my generation happened to be the victims, of a rapid swing-over from the old intermediate system with much learned punditry about education, without any realisation that education primarily has to fit a child for life and that a lot of the theories propounded about it are rather airy when they become unrelated to life.  Be that as it may, I was the victim, in company with others of my generation, of what I may call the sudden swing-over from that intermediate system to the new.  It would be most unfair to blame the present Department or the Minister or his predecessor for the experiment. The experiment may have been justified and I know there has been considerable correction back, I am not at all unaware of that and I know that the lesson was learned; but in its first <Col N="995" /> swing it was damaging and I often wonder whether the damage done to that particular generation is not one of the things we are paying for now. The inevitable result of it was to turn out, not the complete man that was talked about so much as the gentleman dabbler in everything.</P>
    <P>The old intermediate system may have had its faults.  We heard a lot about cramming, but at least the people trained under that system knew what they knew.  Again I am mainly relating myself to the secondary system, the secondary teaching of that time.  There was a restricted course in geometry, say, but it was Euclid, it was one system, one logical system, and even though the Fifth Proposition of the First Book was the final Waterloo of many of us, by pursuing that system there was a very sound elementary practical knowledge of geometry given and a certain training in logic as well.</P>
    <P>In regard to arithmetic, two and two made four and the ordinary manipulations of multiplication, division tables and so forth were considered as a <i>sine qua non</i> to efficiency and, if you did not know them, you did not know them and you paid the penalty. Later on I have heard the thing dismissed as merely a numerical mistake, that the principle of approach was all right, that it was merely a numerical mistake.  If the boy who made that mere numerical mistake was an accountant afterwards it might be a rather serious matter.</P>
    <P>Under the old system they knew what they knew.  They could rattle off tables, reckon a simple sum, do a simple sum in algebra and apply it.  They knew something in English.  They knew a little bit about grammar.  What they knew they knew.  They could frame a sentence properly and could write it properly and, if they fell down on either the basic spelling or the framing of a sentence or even the legible writing of it, they had to account therefor to the teacher of those days. When all is said and done, it was a good system, whatever its defects.  It was a particularly good system for the Irish character.  It was, perhaps, <Col N="996" /> capable of adjustment, of improvement, but it did mean that the child knew something definitely, was made to attend to detail, was trained in sustained application at a particular point and in detail of execution.</P>
    <P>Under the new system that came along&mdash;I have already touched on an example&mdash;you could do some kind of mathematical operation and you nearly got full marks if the approach in principle was right.  The little numerical error of making two and two five did not matter an awful lot.  You were brought into an English class. There was no set text.  The idea of learning a bit of set stuff properly was cramming.  You were let wander all round the place.  I know of a case and I will substantiate it to the Minister if he desires, where it got to the stage&mdash;there was no text there to be quoted&mdash;that when they put a bit of poetry on the English paper all they could say was: &ldquo;Quote lines embodying similar sentiment.&rdquo; That was the nearest the examiner could get to see had the child learned anything by rote at all.  In the old days he would get a particular passage of a particular text to quote.  I know a case where a question like that was framed and two boys in the one class scratched their heads; they had never heard of anything similar; they proceeded&mdash;the Minister will appreciate this&mdash;to write their own version and put a bogus name underneath.  The examiner could not detect it and, judging by results, they got away with it.  I was told that that justified the system, that it brought out the best in them, but it is not chancers that we want to train and that is what that would tend to do.</P>
    <P>Coupled with that, a certain amount of intellectual snobbery tended to come in, quite unconsciously.  It arose from the rather natural desire of the specialist. Unfortunately, secondary education and education in particular subjects tended to get a little bit into the hands of the specialist.  The specialist is a first-class man in his own way, but the specialist in any particular subject has to be guarded against when it comes to the general education of the child.  Put it this way: You have a <Col N="997" /> mathematical specialist looking after mathematics.  He sees nothing else. Therefore, he crams the curriculum with the calculus.  He is not satisfied with an elementary knowledge of graphs.  He has to put in the whole analytical geometry of plane conic sections.  He sees a number of other little enticing spots and they become more enticing because of the way physics has developed and particular abstract notions have become important and, forthwith, in 1925, we blossomed out with a curriculum that was certainly very broad.</P>
    <P>While that was happening we had the Latin scholars prescribing, and very rightly so from the specialist point of view, some of the highlights of the literature of ancient Rome, including Horace and other gentlemen who were not so straightforward and easy to understand.  Although there was not a prescribed text there was a wide range there.</P>
    <P>You could take any other subject almost and find the same.  The result was the child simply could not attend to detail.  Take the unfortunate child in the secondary school and consider all the subjects he had to do.  He had to roam over a whole wide field of mathematics and could only do it at the expense of his basic technique.  He did get a chance to acquire a knowledge of a lot of abstract notions at the expense of facility in reckoning, facility in fundamental operations, the operations which he would be most likely to need outside, unless he became a specialist in mathematics or physics.  The child, while he was in that particular dilemma, on the one hand, had a field in Latin open to him which would tax him if he were going to specialise in classics on top of that. We had a certain tendency in the same direction in Irish where we should have been concentrating on the vernacular, the spoken language.  On top of that you had the broad airy fields of English literature as then completely undefined.</P>
    <P>The result was, of course, that the child was not a competent mathematician. He learned enough to make a lot of simple things complex for himself. <Col N="998" /> Many of us who went through that have suffered, even though some of us did later specialised in the physical science and the mathematical end of things.  We suffered till the end from a weakness in basic techniques and some of us who have had associations with others who were trained under the old system have often been envious of the ready facility of people trained under the old intermediate system.</P>
    <P>In regard to Latin I would not feel so entitled to speak but I could say that many of us who went through at that time were as ignorant of Latin at the end as we were the day we were introduced to mensa.  Why? &mdash;I think it was a bit of a tragedy&mdash; because you were pitchforked straight into this advanced stuff without being given a basic simple training, with this insistence on perfect classical form, affected snobbery, if you like to call it that.  We lost what could have been a living thing for us through our liturgy.  There was a whole ocean of poetry opened up to us in the liturgy alone, in simple intelligible language, if we were brought to it.  We all missed that because we got tied up in all kinds of technical niceties and were hammered on the knuckles because we could not write or translate some complex bit of Horace, or something like that.</P>
    <P>I understand it is practically time to report progress but I want to say before I finish to-night that I am talking, of course, specifically with relation to the late 'twenties because the situation was, to some extent, corrected.  I think there is room again for another look at the problem, and the point I want to make now&mdash;and I will come back to it the next day&mdash;is, cannot we bring the teachers and the parents into this, cannot we look at it soberly and overall; get away from the specialist approach and try to see if we can build up the morale and efficiency of our people with a sound faith in the future because this country is one of the countries that has a future, if we grasp it.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the amendment is put, I should like to say that I really do not understand it.  This proposed new section under (c) says that &ldquo;institutional services shall be given in the institution to a specified class of persons&rdquo; and in (d)  that &ldquo;institutional services shall not be given in the institution to persons of a specified class&rdquo;.  If it said that services shall be given to persons suffering from a special type of disease I could understand it, but I do not understand what is meant by a specified class of people.  Does it mean people belonging to what is called the middle class or the working class or people who are often referred to as of independent means?  Does it mean &ldquo;class&rdquo; in that sense?  Frankly, I do not understand what it means.  If it means what it appears to mean, then it seems to me that we should be even still more reluctant to give the power to a central authority to decide that a specified class of persons should not receive treatment in a particular institution in a particular area.  Perhaps the Minister will be good enough to clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be classified in two ways: (1) according to the ailment or treatment required, for instance cases of maternity, and (2)  in respect of persons like children, but not classes in the ordinary sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am really concerned about this.  As it is phrased, I do not think it could be held to apply to what the Minister stated he has in mind.  It could be and must be held to apply in the sense that the Minister says he does not want it to apply or it is not intended to apply.  The new section says that &ldquo;institutional services shall not be given in the institution to persons of a specified class.&rdquo;  I am not questioning the Minister's intention, <Col N="1000" /> but it would be open to the interpretation that people of a certain class, let us say the middle class or working class, were not to get treatment in a particular institution.  The Minister has stated that the intention is to deal with people who require a particular type of treatment or with children as opposed to adults or people suffering from specified diseases.  But the Minister, I think, will agree that that certainly is not set out here.  Any ordinary layman or member of a local authority reading it would have to come to the conclusion that it meant classes as distinct from diseases or children as opposed to adults.  It appears to me that, in order to secure that the Minister's intentions will be fully met and carried out and that it will go no further than is intended by the Minister, this proposed new section would have to be amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the legal way of dealing with what we have in mind, certain ailments or certain classes such as children.  The same words are used in the section of the 1947 Act.  It is always interpreted in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning the Minister's <i>bona fides.</i>  We are not, however, legislating for this year or next year or three years hence.  It is possible that in some years to come somebody in a central authority may read this as referring to a class rather than to a particular category such as children or maternity cases or people suffering from specified diseases.  In trying to understand the ordinary meaning of words, when you get in the proposed new section that &ldquo;institutional services shall not be given in the institution to persons of a specified class&rdquo;, I do not know how it can be contended that that could not be read to mean what we do not intend it to mean.  I think the Minister might have another look at the section.  If he is prepared to do that it will satisfy me on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reply to some remarks made by Deputy McGilligan on this amendment last night.  He made a number of suggestions which, as I said earlier, would appear to any <Col N="1001" /> person who has any knowledge, particularly any intimate knowledge of the whole question, as Deputy McGilligan had in recent years, as quite outrageous. He referred to the scheme devised by me as Minister for Health on the authority of the Deputy himself and his colleagues in the inter-Party Government.  As usual, where possible, he quoted and brought in an ecclesiastical authority described before as the ecclesiasical hatched. He described the scheme as being one in the words of Most Reverend Dr. McQuaid, Archbishop of Dublin, of vague promises or something of that nature.  I deprecate the introduction of this ecclesiastical figure into controversy in the Dáil.  I feel it should not be done under any provocation. While I accept without question, and accepted without question, the ruling of the Hierarchy in relation to the inter-Party scheme as regards the moral law, I cannot find it possible to accept any decision as binding on me that has been made by a group or an individual where the medical content of a scheme is concerned.  Where pure medicine is concerned in health legislation, I feel that our ecclesiastical authorities would be the first to admit that they have no more knowledge, generally speaking, than the average layman.  I know that will be twisted and all sorts of suggestions made that I repudiate the authority of the Hierarchy.  That is not so.  History shows that was not so.  I accepted, without question, the ruling given by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of no details of the scheme being prepared in accordance with the distinct and clear direction of the inter-Party Government, of course that clear direction was given by me to the Cabinet and is in the records of the Government.  All documents submitted by me and considered by them in relation to the whole question of health legislation and particularly in relation to the amendments of the 1947 Act which a number of us felt were needed were put forward by me.  The memorandum submitted by me included a suggestion that Section 3 should be included in the proposed amending Bill for the 1947 Act which was proposed by the <Col N="1002" /> inter-Party Government and with which I was in agreement.  I submitted that this particular section should be included in the amending Bill if the Government wished to take powers to change the mother and child part of the scheme proposed by the inter-Party Government.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is a most important point because the whole of the controversy and particularly the controversy in regard to this particular Bill is likely to turn as far as I am concerned at any rate on the question whether the scheme shall be free and have no means test or be on the lines of the other legislation.  As I said, that section was submitted for the consideration of the inter-Party Government. It was clearly pointed out. There is no question of trickery, subterfuge or any intention to mislead on my part.  I put it into the documents which are in the records on the Government files telling them if they wished to bring in a scheme with a means test they should include this particular section in their amending Bill.</P>
    <P>Again, fortunately for me, the documents and the records will show that I was directed by the inter-Party Government, Deputy McGilligan and his colleagues, to strike out that section which would have allowed them to have the particular scheme which they now say is the only one they could conscientiously accept.  The full memorandum was not only submitted to and considered by the Cabinet and by Deputy McGilligan but it was submitted to him in the ordinary course of Cabinet procedure as Minister for Finance.  So, for Deputy McGilligan to suggest that this health legislation was my sole personal creation is an outrageous fabrication.  As I said before, fortunately for me, all these facts are available and can be ascertained at any time if the House wishes to pursue the matter any further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello at a later stage quoted from a letter in which I asked for Deputy Costello's approval after the October meeting with the Hierarchy. I am quite sure that a number of people are a little bit hazy as to all the events in relation to that meeting with the Hierarchy at that time. <Col N="1003" /> I will not deal at too great a length with them.  I will only deal with them briefly.  I was summoned to the Palace in Drumcondra and met two Bishops and an Archbishop without specifically enjoying that I could not have advice or assistance.  Consequently, I am afraid I can only put forward my recollection of the matter.</P>

That interview took place and, as far as I am concerned, ended satisfactorily.  Concessions were made by me and I understood that agreement was reached with their Lordships on these points.  The important consideration is, was Deputy Costello satisfied at that time that the scheme was approved of by the Hierarchy following that meeting?  Deputy Costello, who was Taoiseach at that time, went to the Archbishop of Dublin the following morning and following that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I suggest that if their Lordships objected strongly at that time, and if the Taoiseach objected to the scheme which he discussed on the previous day with their Lordships, then I suppose that I would have known at that time.  I would have been told in October of that year and I would not have been permitted by the inter-Party Government to carry on as I did carry on&mdash;again, fortunately, the records are there&mdash;with repeated references to this scheme by public announcements in the papers, by approximately a fortnight's speeches at various functions, by brochures for which Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, provided the money; by leaflets for which Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, provided the money; by half-page advertisements in the newspapers for which, again, Deputy McGilligan provided the money and also by a radio broadcast made by me, with the authority of the Government, to publicise the details of the scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to go into past history, but rather a serious charge was made by Deputy McGilligan last night.  I will finish in a few moments because what I have to say is very simply dealt with.  I have here the 22-page document of the scheme. Finally, on the 12th December, 1950, the Irish Medical Association circulated a memorandum in which they <Col N="1005" /> quoted the then Taoiseach, Deputy Costello&mdash;in December of 1950, following the October meeting with the Hierarchy at which, apparently, the scheme was condemned&mdash;as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was his considered opinion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>that is, Deputy Costello's&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that neither the Dáil nor the Seanad would approve of any amendment of the Act or regulations which would envisage the omission of a free service for all in connection with the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That, I think, should deal with the suggestions made by Deputy McGilligan. As far as I can see, he indulged himself in a magnificent effort at the technique which became known during the period of the war as &ldquo;the technique of the big lie.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I think that any suggestion that Deputy McGilligan was not a party to the then mother and child scheme and that there were no <Col N="1006" /> details of that scheme can be refuted by the following facts.  Deputy McGilligan, as Minister for Finance, made available a vast sum of money for that scheme.  Surely he did not make that vast sum of money available on the general assumption that I was bringing in something that would be quite useless or inadequate.  Surely, as a responsible Minister for Finance, he made that vast sum of money available on the consideration of detailed documents. I may say that my experience of Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance was that he, or whoever was responsible in his Department, was most meticulous in pursuit of facts when the question of granting money was concerned.  I find it difficult to believe that Deputy McGilligan would like it to be current that, as Minister for Finance, he disbursed vast sums of money for nebulous schemes which were merely the figment of my imagination.</P>

      <P>Is there anything to be concluded from that quotation except that Deputy Dr. Browne was under the impression that the Hierarchy were not opposed to the scheme?  Towards the end of that same letter, this is what Deputy Dr. Browne had to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It will be interesting to know whether your withholding of approval of the scheme is due either to the supposed opposition of the Hierarchy or to the possible opposition of any individual member of the Hierarchy.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, if that means anything, surely it means that approval had been withheld and the Deputy wanted to know if the withholding of approval was due to the fact that the Taoiseach supposed that the Hierarchy were opposed to the scheme or that there was possible opposition to it by some individual member of the Hierarchy.  If there is anything to be said in answer to that, I should be glad to hear it said concisely by somebody&mdash;either by Deputy Dr. Browne or by one of the people who really do not admire him but who are using him for the time being.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne talks of the publicity, the advertisements, the radio talk and the pamphlets which he said were paid for by me as Minister for Finance.  I suppose it is not any great news to the members of this House to learn that the Minister for Finance does not examine the details of everything. He is not a censor.  Money was provided for publicity but letters were written about the type of the publicity.  On the 15th March, the then Taoiseach addressed a letter to Deputy Dr. Browne.  In the fourth paragraph of that letter the then Taoiseach said to Deputy Dr. Browne:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1009" />&ldquo;I am afraid you do not appear to realise the serious implications of the views expressed in that letter since you have, by advertisement and otherwise&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that covers radio and pamphlets</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;continued to publicise the scheme to which objections have been taken. Such action might well seem to be in defiance of the Hierarchy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are two of the points that were referred to.  In addition, a special pamphlet was issued.  To that, the Taoiseach at once took exception. There was a possibility of some address being delivered by Deputy Browne to the Irish Medical Association and to that, in the most direct terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Your letter addressed to-day to the Irish Medical Association has been brought to my notice by the information bureau.  I have directed them not to issue it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne was told not to go on with his scheme. He speaks of his advertisements, and he referred to a pamphlet which is covered by the phrase &ldquo;advertisement and otherwise.&rdquo;  Objection was taken to it.  He was told that his scheme did not represent Government policy, unless certain objections made by the Hierarchy were removed, and the Deputy's only answer was to write what, in the light of the circumstances, must be regarded as this completely fatuous letter of 19th March, which opened by asking if he was correct in thinking that the then Taoiseach was under the impression that the scheme was objected to by the Hierarchy.  That was a scheme which, within a month, was to bring the condemnation from the Hierarchy expressed in the letters read to the House by Deputy Dr. Browne himself and expressed in language by the Archbishop which represented a thorough-going and comprehensive condemnation of the scheme.  I have told the Deputy with regard to his statement in regard to expenses that expense was, of course, carried and that there was expense which had to be met on the Vote for the Department of Health.  That expense was expense with regard to reliefs under the old legislation, and it certainly had nothing to do with expenses under any new mother and child scheme proceeding from the 1947 Act.  The reason for that was simple.  There was no such scheme and never was, but there were a whole lot of vague generalities.</P>

I am not doing that under any order of the House because I do not believe there is any such order.  I will circulate that if necessary.  Of course, the proper thing to do would be either to have it admitted that it is a correct version or produce something that would refute it, and I do not know which of these is to be done.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are amused they have a funny way of showing it. They would not qualify as the cinema type.  The position now is the Minister is asking for power that by Order he could direct that certain things should be done.  The power that he wants is to have certain institutional services carried out in certain institutions; institutional services include treatment. I put it to the Minister now that the bare and literal interpretation of that is that he asks for power to direct that certain treatment shall be carried out in certain institutions and the amendment seeks to add that the health authority shall comply with such a direction.  I take that to mean that it is going to be legal for doctors to carry out certain treatment and it will be illegal for doctors to refuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked for protection for doctors.  I do not suppose that anybody wants to impose an obligation on doctors to do operations or to carry out treatment that is contrary to their <Col N="1020" /> conscience but why not say so?  We have already said so in regard to another matter in which the Minister was more precise.  Deputy Cowan was even more precise than the Minister when he said that the amendment was not required but the amendment was put in to protect a person from being asked to undergo treatment that was contrary to that person's religion.  It is easy to add the simple amendment I seek and I ask that it should be done in order to clear up this matter and to give a doctor the same conscientious freedom as a patient.  Against all this is the fact that the Constitution by a particular Article guarantees freedom of conscience and guarantees that freedom of conscience subject only to two inhibitions.  One is public order and the other is public morality.</P>
    <P>The question of what are the requirements of public order or public morality that might conflict with the guarantee of freedom of conscience is a matter for the courts, not for this House.  That was decided in the case where the Government of the time tried to get a ruling from the courts in regard to private property.  It is a simple matter to make the amendment which I suggest and there is all the more reason to do it when I am told that the danger is remote and is not likely to occur.</P>

      <P>He said last night that he never approved of the health scheme put up by Deputy Dr. Browne.  He was careful to quote documents only from March, 1951 on, and he asserted very definitely here last night that he never at any time approved of the scheme put up by Deputy Dr. Browne. I had a few hours to spare to-day and I came across correspondence carried on between the two Departments and nothing could be more definite than the Minister's approval of the scheme, starting in 1949, all through 1950 and up to 1951.  The Deputy, of course, is <Col N="1021" /> a master-hand, in this House and elsewhere, at making an assertion and running away from it.  He is always prepared to make a statement if he knows that documents cannot be produced against him.  I suppose he came to the conclusion that if he said the same thing to-day the documents would be produced against him, so therefore he did not say it.  I would not be surprised now if he said that he did not say that at all last night because he is quite capable of doing that.</P>
      <P>In the interests of truth, perhaps it would be no harm to give some new facts about the scheme that was put up, starting from 1949.  On the 1st March of that year, the then Minister for Health put up his scheme for the City of Dublin and afterwards put it up for the counties, and the Minister for Finance wrote back approving in principle on the 16th July, 1949.  He told us here last night that he never approved of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps a delusion.  It is the most charitable interpretation we can give to the Deputy's statement last night.  This is an interesting point in his approval in principle.  He told us last night that he never approved of the 1947 Act both for constitutional and moral reasons.  Well, if he disapproved of the 1947 Act for moral reasons, he evidently did not understand what the moral principles were, because when he was conveying his approval on the 16th July on the scheme put up for the City of Dublin, he said there was one thing he did not approve of and that was that part-time doctors should be employed under the scheme.  He advocated the employment of whole-time medical men.  So the Deputy who told us last night that he could see in 1947 that the Bill was wrong both constitutionally and morally, had forgotten his morals evidently in August 1949, when he tried to induce the Minister for Health to change from a part-time, choice-of-doctor system, over to a whole-time medical practitioner system.  The Minister for Health resisted that and the Minister for Finance wrote back pressing to have that point considered.  Eventually he <Col N="1022" /> gave in to the Minister for Health and did not persist in pressing the matter further.  Eventually a sum of money was put into the Estimate for 1950-51 and at a meeting of representatives of the two Departments in March, 1950, the Department of Finance representatives agreed to the proposals which had been submitted by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Following that, discussions went on about the Estimate of the following year&mdash;that is the Estimate of 1951-52. Deputy McGilligan asserted very definitely here last night that there was no approval as far as he was concerned of any money in that Estimate for a new mother and child scheme.  Well as I have shown, it was agreed in the previous year.  In this year, 1951-52 a detailed Estimate was put up to the Department of Finance in the ordinary way.  Under sub-head (h) a sum of £980,000 was put in.  It was pointed out that £690,000 would be required for the new mother and child service, in other words, that if the new mother and child service did not come into operation during that financial year the Estimate could be reduced by £690,000.  All the details were given of a domiciliary service and so on.</P>
      <P>The Estimate in proof came back on the 1st February, 1951, with this £980,000 in the proof copy and sub-head H was for a mother and child service.  The proof was forwarded for checking under cover of a letter from the Department of Finance, dated the 30th February, 1951.  The Estimate was checked, returned to the Department of Finance and the following note accompanied the letter going back to the Department of Finance in February, 1951:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am also to particularly request you to furnish a copy of the final proof of the Estimate as the Minister is desirous to see the note which is to be appended to sub-head H&mdash;Grants to Health Authorities&mdash;regarding the provision for the Mother and Child Service.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was more than evident to me to-day, looking through these documents, that at this stage in February, 1951, the then Minister for Health had come to <Col N="1023" /> be suspicious of the Minister for Finance and had asked to have the proofed copy submitted to him before it was sent to the printers and it was for that reason that letter was sent.</P>
    <P>Now the Estimate was subsequently issued with a footnote.  Deputy Dr. Browne stated here last night that a certain amount of money was cut off all the Estimates around that time.  The footnote that was put in to sub-head H is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As many details (such as capitation rates, number of persons participating, date of commencement, etc.) affecting the probable cost of this service in the year 1951-52 cannot be finally determined at this stage, an accurate estimate of the additional outlay for that year cannot yet be given, but it is probable that it will be in the neighbourhood of £300,000. When fuller information has become available a Supplementary Estimate for the additional amount involved will be introduced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan was then Minister for Finance.  He was responsible for sanctioning these Estimates and, I presume, for any footnotes that appear. How any Deputy in that position could now say that he never approved of the mother and child scheme and at the same time be responsible for agreeing to that footnote I do not know.  It is entirely inconsistent, again, if you like, due to some form of delusion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne has already mentioned the fact that the Irish Medical Association circularised their members on the 29th November, 1950, and there is a reference to a meeting held on that date between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Deputy Norton, and members of the Irish Medical Association.  In this circular, referring to the Taoiseach's statement, the following appears:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It was his considered opinion that neither the Dáil nor Seanad would approve any amendment of the Act or regulations which would envisage the omission of a free service for all in connection with the scheme.  He gave an assurance <Col N="1024" /> that if this difficulty of a free for all service could be overcome by some kind of formula agreeable to both sides that other matters, such as the inclusion of general practitioners in the scheme and the preservation of professional secrecy could be settled without much difficulty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That circular was sent out as a result of a meeting held between the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and members of the Irish Medical Association.  Is it possible that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste could have argued so strongly with the members of the Medical Association for a mother and child scheme of which the Minister for Finance had not approved?  In my opinion it is not possible.  The approval of the Minister for Finance must have been given.</P>
    <P>In connection with the letter to which reference has been made, the letter issued by the Hierarchy at that time, I would like Deputies to remember that the scheme put up by Deputy Dr. Browne reached the Taoiseach on 7th November, 1950, and he met the members of the Irish Medical Association on 29th November and told them that a free scheme would have to be agreed to and that other matters could be adjusted subsequently. We come along to 12th February, 1951, and we find Deputy Dr. O'Higgins addressing a meeting of Fine Gael South Central Dublin Executive on the 10th February.  A report of that meeting appears in the <i>Irish Times</i> on 12th February.  Deputy Dr. O'Higgins addressing that gathering said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1948 the Government changed but the law remained.  Dr. Browne became Minister for Health and it became his legal duty to carry out the law, or to rescind or to curtail it.  Even if he so desired to do the latter, he could not succeed in view of the previous support for the Bill.  He faced his responsibility energetically, enthusiastically and courageously.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;He faced his responsibility energetically, enthusiastically <Col N="1025" /> and courageously.&rdquo;  The statement continues:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No one has ever given such intense devotion to health improvements. He drafted a scheme in compliance with the law for free treatment for all.  This scheme was submitted to the doctors and rejected by a ballot vote.</P>
      <P>A new situation then arose&mdash;the scheme complied with the law but the scheme was not in itself the law. The Minister made it clear that he was not wedded to that particular scheme but that the law required free treatment for all and, subject to the acceptance of that principle, any workable scheme would be acceptable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Remember, that was 10th February, 1951, when Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Costello, Deputy Norton and Deputy Dr. O'Higgins were going out publicly and saying that so long as it was a free scheme they could get over the other matters.  Last night Deputy McGilligan kept us for hours telling us that he had never approved of the scheme.  Another ex-Minister said that there was no scheme at all.  We know what to expect from these gentlemen; when people make assertions like that, so far removed from the truth, they are prepared to say anything.</P>

It must have been held in secret because the <i>Irish Times</i> does not say where it was held. I do not think the picture would be complete if I did not quote Deputy Dillon.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, but they gave it up after a time.  Deputy Dillon in <Col N="1026" /> this very long speech took as his theme the corporate State, but he was not in favour of the corporate State.  He favoured democracy.  He said&mdash;the words he spoke are in inverted commas:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The ardent Christians who have unsheathed their unsleeping swords profess to be especially scandalised because all applicants for the mother and child service are not to be subjected to a means test&mdash; why?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was Deputy Dillon, but another colleague of his, Deputy McGilligan, had never approved of any scheme from Deputy Dr. Browne because he knew from the beginning that the 1947 Act was wrong, both constitutionally and morally.  Deputy Dillon went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the service is freely available for all, while all are equally free to avail of it or not at their own absolute discretion, why is it necessary or desirable to require a man, who is worrying about his wife and longs to procure for her every safeguard which science can provide, either to suffer severe economic privation or prove to the relieving officer by a full disclosure of his intimate family affairs, that he is not financially able to provide this necessary care out of his own means?</P>
      <P>If the integrity of the family is sacrosanct, the fewer occasions provided for public officials to trespass on its intimate secrets the better for society and the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon evidently knew in November, 1950, that there was a scheme there.  I think it was Deputy Morrissey who said last night there was no scheme.  Deputy Morrissey did not know that there was a scheme there at the time.  Deputy Dillon knew that there was a scheme, and he was horrified to think that anybody could condemn a free-for-all scheme.  He talked of those &ldquo;ardent Christians who have unsheathed their unsleeping swords&rdquo;, and so on, but Deputy McGilligan did not know or did not approve of any scheme put up by Deputy Dr. Browne. Why?  His Taoiseach and his Tánaiste were meeting the Medical Association <Col N="1027" /> and telling them: &ldquo;You must take the scheme of Deputy Dr. Browne, the Minister for Health, and you must especially accept it without a means test, and if you do then any difficulties that follow can be got over.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, later on in his speech, said that the doctors had accepted that.  I do not know whether that is true or not because I have not come across it from the doctors themselves, but Deputy Dr. O'Higgins says that the Irish Medical Association had accepted that and were prepared to meet the members of the Government to discuss the other details and let the free-for-all scheme go through.  While all this was going on, all these negotiations and all these meetings between the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Deputy Dillon and Deputy Dr. O'Higgins&mdash;between all these Ministers&mdash; Deputy McGilligan knew nothing about it, that is, if he was telling the truth last night, because he told us here last night that he never approved of the scheme put up by Deputy Dr. Browne.</P>
    <P>His Department did.  Is he now going to claim that he did not know what his Department was doing?  Is he going to claim that he was merely a rubber stamp&mdash;that is a good defence, if you like&mdash;and that his Department carried on during his absence, that he did not interfere with them and did not know what they were doing?  That is the only kind of defence that I can see that is consistent with what he said last night, because he did say over and over again last night that he never approved of the scheme put up by Deputy Dr. Browne, even though it is in the printed Estimate that that approval had been given.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan talked a lot here last night and to-day.  Would it not be well to clear up the matter and see what the truth is?  It appears to me anyway that Deputy Dr. Browne was not suffering from delusions.  He had a perfect right to claim that he had put up a scheme and had got approval for it.  All the evidence goes to show that he did get approval.  Not only did he get approval as reported in the newspapers&mdash;in the speeches made by <Col N="1028" /> these various colleagues of his at the time&mdash;but even the Book of Estimates proves that he got approval for the scheme.  Therefore, I think it is necessary that we should have some clarification on this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne said here that he was anxious that this whole matter should be cleared up.  As far as I can see from the documents he has nothing to fear by having the matter cleared up, and it might be as well if there was some sort of an investigation, or a publication of the documents if you like so that every man might investigate it for himself, because that might bring to an end the assertions made by ex-Ministers on the other side who are seeking, and have been seeking for some time, to give the impression to everybody that if there was a Browne scheme they knew nothing about it; that if there was a Browne scheme it was a bad scheme and that no one would approve of it, and that they knew nothing whatever about it.  As I say, I think it would be as well to have the matter cleared up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a straightforward proposition.  The Minister maintains, and has satisfactorily proved, that there was a mother and child scheme.  I do not believe that 10 per cent. of the people really think for a moment there was not a mother and child scheme.  Let us suppose there was none.  Then Deputy McGilligan, having asked us to accept that, proceeds to quote the Hierarchy as condemning a mother and child scheme.  You cannot have it both ways.  If it was not there, how can they condemn it and how can they write extensively and analyse section by section and condemn a scheme that was not there?</P>
      <P>There is a second point.  The whole dispute between Deputy Browne and other members of the inter-Party Government was over a mother and child scheme.  If there was no such scheme, why did they sack him?  They cannot have it both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble with Deputy McGilligan is that he was not able to give as much attention to the Department of Finance as he might have given during that particular period and that parts of it, like the matters quoted by the Minister, may have escaped his attention or escaped his knowledge, and if that is so we ought to make some allowances for that fact.  As I see it, the Fianna Fáil Party here, the Labour Party, the Independents&mdash;and I think I can say all the Independents&mdash;want to get a satisfactory Health Bill into operation. Every Deputy concerned with progress must object to the obstruction and hold-up tactics we have had on this Bill up to now.  Although what Deputy McGilligan says, what Deputy Browne says and what the Minister says is very interesting, the people decided the issue a couple of years ago.  This whole matter was before the electorate in the last general election and there were four Deputies who deliberately stood for election on the basis that they supported Dr. Browne and what Dr. Browne did.  Those four Deputies were elected by the electorate and we are here in this House entitled&mdash;because we were deliberately elected on that issue&mdash;to say that we want a satisfactory Health Bill put into operation as early as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed to-day.  We listened to Deputy McGilligan last night.  He quoted from certain official documents, of which he said he took copies and brought with him, so that he could use them in his own defence at some time. These were selected documents that the Deputy chose in the hurry out of office.  He had not very much time to <Col N="1032" /> prepare.  These were just a few documents that he got his hands on and perhaps he said with his shrewdness: &ldquo;This matter will come up again; I will be able to quote this against Dr. Browne&rdquo;.  Obviously, from what the Minister has said, he did not bring with him all the documents.  I do not think he had time even to go through the files, because as Deputy McGilligan knows it was only on the evening before the change of Government that it became clear to his Taoiseach and to himself that their days in office, their hours in office, were numbered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a bit surprised at your saying that.  I am trying to keep to the amendment, but having heard all the things we heard last night and to-night, even the Chair would have difficulty in knowing what the amendment is or what the section is. However, I will do my best to keep within the limits.  Last night we had Deputy McGilligan quoting, or attempting to quote, extensively from a document which he was saying here was a letter issued by the Bishops.  Last night he was doing that.  To-day he never mentioned that letter.  I referred to the Deputy's retreat in an observation to the Minister&mdash;his retreat from that letter was like Napoleon's retreat from Moscow.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned about that.  What I am concerned about is that every Deputy saw in the House last night that Deputy McGilligan's conduct disgusted his own Leader, Deputy Costello.  It was clear that not one other Deputy of Fine Gael in the Front Bench mentioned this Bishop's letter or alleged letter, except Deputy McGilligan.  The men sitting beside him on the Front Bench were disgusted with his conduct, and rightly so.  Deputy MacEoin was disgusted with his conduct, as he went completely out of the House and would not listen to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy General Mulcahy came in but he did not take that side.  Deputy Costello sat there, fed up, obviously <Col N="1035" /> very annoyed that a colleague, not only a colleague in his inter-Party Government, a colleague of his Front Bench in opposition and a colleague in their honourable profession, could have stooped so low as Deputy McGilligan did last night to make use of a document which was never intended for circulation, and which does not exist as far as the people of this country are concerned.</P>

      <P>I think it would be easier to read the Deputy's hand. Deputy McGilligan has failed, he has failed disgracefully, he has failed dishonourably in the role he set himself last night.  Deputy McGilligan ought to be ashamed of himself, and I am sure, whether he is ashamed of himself or not, his colleagues are ashamed of him.  I could not see a Deputy like Deputy Liam Cosgrave coming into that Front Bench to sit there and listen to the conduct that we had from Deputy McGilligan last night.  To-day there was no reference to this Hierarchy letter.  He failed last night, deliberately failed.  He did damage to his own Party.  He did damage to himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to say in conclusion is&mdash;this will be relevant to the amendment I hope&mdash;that on another debate in this House recently I referred, and the Minister referred to it last night but not in the same language, to these Sadleir and Keogh tactics.  Deputy McGilligan is entitled to adopt this Sadleir and Keogh line, but Deputy McGilligan will be no more successful than Sadleir and Keogh were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, the great majority of the Deputies in this House want a Health Bill.  We want to get down and work.  We want to get down and give of our best to provide the best Health Bill we can, but Fine Gael have made up their mind to obstruct <Col N="1036" /> it and hold it up, and Deputy McGilligan has taken his own guerilla line in regard to it.  We can, if we are allowed, make the best Health Bill we can.  I do not say that this is the sort of Health Bill that I myself would be glad to father, but if it is the best Health Bill we can get in the present circumstances then it is our duty to get that.  Why cannot we do that?  Why cannot we get the chance of providing a good Health Bill?  Why does Deputy McGilligan waste the time of the Dáil talking about amendments that should be in the Bill but he would not go to the trouble of suggesting one amendment&mdash;not one amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>He said he was not against it but, just as he twisted and turned against Deputy Dr. Browne when he thought it was good politics, he has twisted and turned again, and he is making the same mistake now as he made then.  Deputy McGilligan has ensured by his conduct in this debate that, as far as his own Party are concerned anyway, Fine Gael, they bear the brand they always had, a brand of reaction, opposition to anything that is progressive.  Let them have that.  Let them have that role if they like, but that rôle will get them nowhere in Irish politics.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to Fine Gael, if they are not interested in the health of the people, to sit quiet there on the Front Benches and let the rest of us who are interested in the health of the people make the best Bill we can under present circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that he has powers already in other legislation, including the Public Assistance Act, similar to the powers he is looking for in his amendment. After all that has passed, I think it <Col N="1037" /> would be no harm to read the amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.  Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by Order made in respect of a specified health institution, direct&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that institutional services of a specified class shall be given in the institution,</P>
      <P>(b)  that institutional services of a specified class shall not be given in the institution,</P>
      <P>(c)  that institutional services shall be given in the institution to a specified class of persons, or</P>
      <P>(d)  that institutional services shall not be given to persons of a specified class,</P>
      <P>and the health authority maintaining the institution shall comply with the direction.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In so far as the discussion has been anywhere near the amendment, it has related to the first part, that is, that institutional services of a specified class shall be given in an institution. We might look at (b) in order to get the Minister a little bit away from the fog that, largely of his own initiation, is created around this amendment. Reading (b) in the way in which Deputy Costello recommended that it should be read, (b) would mean that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may, by Order made in respect of a specified health institution, direct&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that maintenance in an institution,</P>
      <P>(b)  diagnosis, advice and treatment at an institution,</P>
      <P>(c)  appliances and medicines and other preparations,</P>
      <P>(d)  the use of special apparatus at an institution,</P>
      <P>of a specified class shall not be given in the institution.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Will the Minister say where powers of that particular kind exist already and what particular purpose he has in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> We have a declaration as to what &ldquo;institutional services&rdquo; means but where have we a definition of &ldquo;a specified class&rdquo;?  Can the Minister give any reference to the various classes that might be specified and in respect of which he seeks statutory power to be able to require that such a class shall not be given treatment in some particular institution?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned before, in giving services to a particular class, it might be children, it might be maternity cases, it might be unmarried mothers or, if it is a specified ailment, the example I gave already was smallpox or, possibly, say, tuberculosis.  I think the &ldquo;specified class&rdquo; could refer to either the class of person, which is children, or the class of disease, such as smallpox.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the question of disease is included in the idea of &ldquo;institutional services&rdquo;?  &ldquo;Institutional services&rdquo; covers diagnosis, advice, treatment, maintenance and the use of appliances and apparatus. Surely &ldquo;institutional services&rdquo; covers the question of disease and, as there is a statutory definition of &ldquo;institutional services,&rdquo; would the Minister say where there is any definition of &ldquo;specified class&rdquo; or where it is intended to have it and will he say, again, where he has authority in previous Acts, as he says he has, to cover the proposal contained in paragraph (b) there?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is consistent with the Minister's attitude, but it is not informative.  It certainly is not an adequate explanation for the fact that in such a sweeping way the Minister takes power to himself here.  As I say, <Col N="1039" /> the Minister simply mentioned smallpox when introducing the amendment. Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll intimated that it had been necessary to segregate particular classes into particular institutions already and that under the tuberculosis scheme that was very successfully and widely done and that it was done by persuasion.  If there were powers to do it by Order, I do not know why it should be stressed that it was possible to do it in the case of tuberculosis by persuasion.</P>
      <P>Here the Minister is taking to himself, over the heads of the local authorities that will provide and will be supposed to administer the institutions, to make these sweeping decisions and the only excuse we get is, smallpox. I suggest to the Minister that it is a quite inadequate explanation.  The inadequacy of his opening remarks have been stressed to him already.  He had time since yesterday to clear his mind on the matter and we are in the position now that we are back to the old explanation, smallpox.</P>

      <P>I referred last night to the objection which was taken by the Hierarchy in October, 1950, where they stated that certain powers taken were in direct opposition to the rights of families and were liable to very great abuse and stressed that there was no assurance that they would be used in moderation to justify their enactment.  I do not think it is going too far to say that that means that, if powers are open to abuse and if that abuse is contrary to faith and morals, then the Hierarchy's insistence was that these powers should be removed, that they would not be content with an assurance that the powers would be used in moderation.  In other words, that the fact that things were capable of being abused was enough to have them condemned.  That was in 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1953, as I said last night, in the document which the unfortunate public have not been able to see, they spoke of undue interference.  They protested against undue interference with the medical profession.  They spoke about health education which even involved a scheme to direct a child according to <Col N="1040" /> materialistic principles.  They had a phrase which amounted to a comment that the present legislation extended an already full medical service directed and controlled by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quoting.  I am paraphrasing what I am reading from.  There is objection taken to a centralised and bureaucratic system and further objection taken that the power given to the Minister for wide regulations covering every detail of medical services in time to come interfered with the patient-doctor relationship. I want to apply that to this. I must make a brief reference to the position of the doctor.  This particular enlargement of ministerial powers offends against the comments that were made in a letter which the public should have got round about the end fortnight of April this year.  They were prevented from getting that by the action of the Government.  I think it was a deplorable action that these people took.  I think the House is entitled to get what the Bishops had desired to publish in the exercise of what they call their teaching office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment allows an Order to be made and, under that, a direction can be given with regard to certain services.  Once that direction is given, a health authority must comply with that direction.  I have asked several times, does anybody want to impose <Col N="1041" /> on any medical man any Order which would be in violation of his conscience? I assume that nobody wants to do that.  I asked then would the test contained in the letter of the Hierarchy of October, 1950, be applied.  Is this possible of abuse?  Is it such a thing that might be met by an assurance that the power which the Minister was getting would be used in moderation?  Even if that assurance were given and accepted, would the matter still not fall under the criticism that the clergy made in October, 1950?</P>
    <P>These institutional services are defined in the Act referred to so often and they include advice and treatment. I do not know whether we can get accommodation or agreement upon what is being discussed.  There is power to direct by Order and a direction will go out to have services in an institution and these services will include treatment.  Once these orders are given with regard to treatment, the health authority must comply.  The health authority can only comply through their medical officer or possibly through the medical officer of the Minister's Department.  These directions for certain treatment may be as objectionable as the matter in relation to the patient, the matter discussed by the Minister, apparently, with the Hierarchy in relation to the patient. These discussions led to an amendment that no patient was to be asked to undergo treatment contrary to the teaching of his religion.  Surely the same thing ought to apply to the doctors.</P>
    <P>As to the mother and child scheme, I quoted from a letter of the 5th April, 1951, from the Hierarchy:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is to be noted that the proposed scheme failed to give clear evidence of the details of implementation. The scheme, as set forth in vague, general terms, has the appearance of conferring a benefit on the mothers and children of the whole nation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a good summary of the position as it was on 5th April, 1951. The scheme was set forth in vague, general terms but there was nothing to enable the implementing details to be seen.  The Deputy may wonder if he <Col N="1042" /> likes, but there was something which caused trouble between the members of the Cabinet and Deputy Dr. Browne that was called a mother and child scheme.  There must have been a scheme because he was got rid of.  I read through the letters of the Hierarchy at that time and they occasionally talk of a mother and child service.  They occasionally talk about proposals and again the word &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; is brought in.  In a series of documents there are remarks criticising the whole thing as being very vague, not capable of implementation and the finding of finance in a way different from that in which it was found.  I am leaving that over for examination.  The Minister was attempting to get away in the end from the documents that he made use of to-day.  By the way, I gave the wrong date in connection with the document yesterday.  I gave the date as the 1/1/51.  The right date is the 11/1/51.  The document is File 102/67/50.</P>
    <P>There is talk in the document here of progress with regard to hospitalisation parts of the scheme, especially with regard to local authorities.  That is put forward as a scheme of full details to be carried out if the matter had not abruptly been brought to an end.  The other point which was not relevant to the discussion last night would show the methods contemplated. Once again the Department of Health intended to oblige dispensary doctors (apparently satisfied they have the necessary powers) to cave in and accept the mother and child scheme. That anticipated the other discussion.</P>
    <P>That was the plan at the time. Compel the dispensary doctors to cave in.  When the Minister publishes his documents, may I suggest, in order to get further clarification, he might add two documents to the ones he said rather vaguely he would publish&mdash;the opinions, briefly summarised, of the two attorneys who commented upon the proposal in the 1947 Act.  I allude to that for the reason that in recent discussions about new health proposals since the re-emergence of Fianna Fáil we were always told that they would be guided by the Constitution and by <Col N="1043" /> the directive Article 45.  That directive Article was in the Constitution in 1947 when the proposals of 1947 came along.  The Constitution in 1947 is the same as it is now.  The Attorney-General who gave Fianna Fáil a ruling in 1947 is possibly the same gentleman who gave a ruling with regard to the proposal in 1952.  I would like to have that put before the House in contrast with the view of the Attorney-General who advised the Government on the 12th March, 1948.</P>
    <P>There were three aspects really to the controversy from 1948 until 1951. There was, first of all, the moral matter which occupied a good deal of the attention of the Minister for Health of those days and the Hierarchy.  Then there was the constitutional aspect which did not take much time so far as the Government at that time was concerned.  It was finished by a ruling given on the matter in which Deputy Dillon, as a private citizen, had taken an action before the courts in order to have a declaration from the courts that certain sections of Part III, mainly those sections which the Attorney-General on the 12th March, 1948, as far as legal opinion went, condemned and which Deputy Dillon wanted to have the court condemn. That was the action which was pending at the time the Hierarchy wrote to the Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, at the end of 1947.  That was the action then pending which gave the then Taoiseach, Mr. de Valera, his excuse not to reply to the Hierarchy's letter, but to state that the moral aspect of the matter would be considered once the constitutional question was got out of the way.</P>
    <P>The third matter was the practicability of the proposals.  That should have meant co-operation but it meant collision with the medical profession so that there was controversy going on on three fronts.  That is now presented here as a scheme which had the approval of a Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not desire to repeat myself particularly, but when the Minister was asked a question with regard to this proposed amendment he <Col N="1044" /> said the powers already existed under Section 36 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939.  He alleged that Section 36 of that Act covers these powers.  Section 36 of that Act says that when a local authority has established in its area an institution for dealing with a particular class of person or where they have made an arrangement by which that particular class of person will be dealt with by an institution not under their authority that particular class of person will not be treated at the expense of that local authority except in the institutions they have provided. The Minister refers the House to an authority of that particular kind. The lack of explanation on the Minister's part in regard to this amendment shows that the amendment takes revolutionary powers to overrule any local authority with regard to its institutions and the purposes for which they would be used and in such a way as to direct the particular class of treatment that may be given to a particular class of person.  So that in respect of the general line of work that will be carried on in an institution and in respect of apparatus, treatment and matters of diagnosis, the Minister can direct, over the heads of the local authorities, against the experience or even against the prejudice of the medical people serving in the institution. He can direct them in regard to their work and treatment.  The Minister's whole attitude is either that of direct deception of the House or of pawning off on us a proposal that he knows nothing about.  Perhaps he does not know what the results of it will be and perhaps he does not know who is behind it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers the Minister is taking here are clearly the powers provided under Section 36 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939.  Reiterating the talk about smallpox in a parrot-like way will not cover up the wide and revolutionary powers in this amendment.  I would ask him to treat us and the House in a reasonable and responsible way and let us know something of what is in his mind as regards the various classes into which people might be divided and the various types of institutions.  Would he take any normal county and attempt to give us a <Col N="1045" /> picture of the institution and the types of segregation of the different cases that might be recognised in relation to these institutions?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I cannot follow Deputy Mulcahy's line of argument very clearly.  I cannot see the reason why the Minister should not have power under certain circumstances to direct a local authority to give certain treatment to certain classes.  It would be rather a queer position if each local authority hospital decided all matters of policy themselves. We might have a situation which we would not like if something in the nature of a serious disease or epidemic broke out in this country. Power should lie in the hands of a central authority&mdash;the Minister, in this case&mdash;to direct a local authority hospital to give certain treatment to people. That power must lie in the Minister's hands because local authorities might feel like refusing to adopt a certain attitude or to give certain treatment.  That disposes of Deputy Mulcahy's point.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has suggested that an attempt is being made under this Bill to give power to this Minister to force doctors to give treatment contrary to their conscience, to diagnose ailments, and so forth, and to act generally contrary to their conscience. I, for one, do not accept that at all.  I am quite satisfied with the statement the Minister has made in the matter. The only argument that Deputy McGilligan put up to back his case was that the power envisaged in this new amendment to the section, which was brought in by the Minister, is contrary to the advice of the Hierarchy.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan then proceeded to paraphrase, as he so described it himself, the subject matter of a letter allegedly written by the Hierarchy to the Faithful.  I am an Independent Deputy in this House and I hope I am a member of the Faithful.  I heard nothing whatever concerning objections of the Hierarchy to this particular amendment.  From what I can gather in this House, the Hierarchy wrote a letter to a number of papers but that letter has not been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> I, as an ordinary Deputy of this House, have not seen that letter.  But Deputy McGilligan comes in here and purports to quote from that letter or to paraphrase it.  On matters of faith and morals I take my teaching and advice from the Hierarchy and certainly I am not going to take advice on matters of faith and morals from Deputy McGilligan.</P>

If I wanted legal advice I am sure that he or any member of his Party who is also a member of the legal profession would be capable of giving me first-class advice on legal matters.  I deplore that any attempt should be made by Deputy McGilligan to sway my mind by arguments on moral grounds&mdash;arguments that he puts up to me in this House and which are based, according to himself, on a letter from the Hierarchy which he seems to have in his possession but which I, as an individual, know nothing about.  Therefore, I cannot accept for a moment the fact that the Bishops have criticised the powers that will be given here.</P>
      <P>I understood that there were certain matters which worried the Hierarchy and that the Government informed the Hierarchy that they were prepared to meet their wishes.  As far as I am concerned, that has been done because I got no indication and I have heard nothing to the contrary.  No statement has been issued that the Government have done something wrong and contrary to the wishes of those people. I think it is the right of the leaders of the Catholic Church and, indeed, of the leaders of all Churches to make their opinions known to the Government.</P>

      <P>I want to put this. I do not believe that any Government in this country would dare for a moment to try to prevent the Hierarchy from making their views known to the faithful.  That suggestion has been made by Deputy McGilligan.  The allegation has been made in this House that the Government tried to prevent the Hierarchy from making their views clear on this Health Bill.  I, for one, cannot accept that allegation.</P>
      <P>If Deputy McGilligan wishes to get the majority of the members of this House to support him in his objection to this amendment, he will have to produce some other argument in its favour besides quoting from or paraphrasing a document in this House which I have not seen and which I know nothing about.  Consequently, as far as this amendment is concerned, I intend to support the Minister.  I feel that there was never any intention that members of the medical profession would be forced under the terms of this Bill or under the terms of this amendment to give treatment or to act in a manner contrary to their conscience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party are not satisfied with this section. Deputy McQuillan has stated that he <Col N="1048" /> cannot see any real danger in these powers being given to the Minister. More than anything else, our fear is for the future.  The powers which the Minister seeks are wide powers.  In this section, the Minister is empowered to direct what type of patients are to be treated in a particular hospital.  He is further empowered&mdash;mind you, I do not say he is going to use these powers &mdash;to direct what treatment is administered in that hospital.</P>
      <P>For the benefit of Deputies, I will cite an instance of what has already happened in this country.  There are certain restrictions with regard to a drug called cortisone, a comparatively recent discovery, which I think all Deputies know is for the purpose of treating rheumatism, amongst other things.  At the present moment there are certain restrictions, as by ministerial Order, with regard to the utilisation of cortisone and the venues or the hospitals in which cortisone is used.  The distribution of cortisone&mdash; in the Dublin areas, at any rate&mdash;for dispensary patients is confined to the teaching hospitals and to St. Kevin's Hospital.  It was originally, and until recently, confined to St. Kevin's Hospital until a case arose in which a physician in St. Vincent's Hospital wished to treat a patient with cortisone and found he was precluded by this particular regulation from doing so&mdash;and it was not possible to move that patient from St. Vincent's Hospital to St. Kevin's Hospital.  The regulation was subsequently changed so that teaching hospitals were included.</P>
      <P>Quite recently, another case arose in a hospital in Loughlinstown.  The Deputies opposite, and the Deputies who support them, have stressed all the time their interest in the welfare of the poor.  This was a dispensary case in Loughlinstown Hospital.  He required treatment with cortisone and he was unable to procure that treatment on account of the regulation which exists in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am citing that case to prove to Deputies how very dangerous this measure may be.  Cortisone is not, in the main, a life-saving drug, but if we are to have legislation like this, we are going to restrict the powers of doctors to treat patients.  It is a very dangerous <Col N="1049" /> thing.  You are allowing the State to interfere with medical treatment.</P>
    <P>Orders were directed to the county medical officers of health with regard to certain immunisation treatment that they were to use a particular product. For the benefit of Deputies, I should explain that there are different types of drugs which may be used for immunisation against different diseases.

I will grant the Minister that, but the original Order was that the county medical officers of health should instruct the dispensary doctors as to the type of product they would use.  It does not exist now, I agree, because it was withdrawn.  Why was it withdrawn? It was withdrawn because it was found to be impracticable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are two perfectly fair instances for fairminded Deputies to consider of interference with medical treatment by ministerial Order.  You can call it by any name you like&mdash;I call it State control.  That is what we object to in the Fine Gael Party, because we believe in the freedom of the individual.  I think I am right in saying that the Hierarchy, who have been quoted here, believe in the freedom of the individual, as they have proved, to their honour and glory, out behind the Iron Curtain.  I am not suggesting that a Fianna Fáil Government are going to impose these restrictions, <Col N="1050" /> but we object to this State control for the future, and, as free people, we are entitled to object to it and entitled to express our opinion, even though it amuses some of the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches.</P>

      <P>That is the general impression.  In medical circles, it is the general opinion that it is a quasi-Government concern.  The Deputy, as Minister, however, restricted the dissemination of streptomycin.  He was approached by the representatives of the doctors, the Irish Medical Association&mdash;I presume that I am allowed to state in this House that the Irish Medical Association represents the doctors&mdash;to ask him to withdraw these restrictions, because they acted as an inhibiting force on the treatment of patients.  To his honour and credit, he <Col N="1051" /> withdrew it.  I am asking the Minister now if he will withdraw this.</P>

      <P>I have given him certain factual cases where treatment has been interfered with.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is going to interfere, but I am suggesting that the Fine Gael Party respects the freedom of the individual, respects the right of private enterprise, respects the right of doctors to treat patients in hospitals and respects the right of the staff to be free people and to act under the doctors, without dictatorship or control from the Minister for Health.  Take this legislation whatever way you like, it is an attempt to force State control on a free people, and the Fine Gael Party is only doing its duty in opposing that.  We will continue to oppose it, so that the Irish people can remain a free people, so long as we are returned here to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>The Deputy got very excited over all this.  With regard to cortisone and, for that matter, streptomycin, they were drugs introduced into this country when very little was known about them.  The then Minister, in the case of streptomycin, and I, in the case of cortisone, were approached by the teachers of medicine.  I was asked to restrict cortisone.  I do not know anything about cortisone, but this particular man said to me: &ldquo;If you allow it to be freely used, you will have numerous deaths from wrong treatment.&rdquo;  Was I to take the responsibility of saying: &ldquo;I do not believe you&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The Minister is entitled to make his statement without interruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a Minister for Health must look after health and prevent people from being killed, if he is warned about it.  What happened then was that cortisone was allowed to be used in every teaching hospital, until it became better known.  Any doctor can get it through a teaching hospital, so far as I know, and it is expected that somebody in that teaching hospital will warn the doctor who gets it of its dangers.  I am not taking responsibility for it&mdash;the teaching hospitals can do what they like about it. With regard to streptomycin, I believe that there was somewhat the same danger when it came out first, that it might not be properly used, and it was restricted in the beginning until the time came when it could be released.</P>
      <P>I never said, and I do not say now, that this section can be accepted by the Dáil because it will be used in moderation.  What I say is that it cannot be used in any other way.  A doctor cannot be directed to give special treatment under this section. It is not possible.  I am not going to take Deputy McGilligan's law on that, because I am afraid his view is a little too prejudiced for acceptance in this House.  If Deputy Esmonde is prepared to take Deputy McGilligan as the law authority on a matter like that, he can do so, but I will not.  I am not going to accept his opinion on it.</P>
      <P>County medical officers of health, we are told, were directed to treat people in a certain way.  There is one regulation, the only restrictive regulation I know&mdash;in the case of infectious diseases, the Minister may make regulations restricting the list of prophylactics and only restricting the list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words if a thing is off the list the doctor cannot use that, but he can use what is on the list if he likes. He is not compelled to use anything on the list if he does not think it is good treatment.  That was done&mdash;as Deputy Dr. Esmonde is probably aware&mdash;because there were from time <Col N="1053" /> to time most dangerous types of drugs advertised, prophylactics, and so on. I do not think that the men who are working under the local authorities object to having regulations of that kind.  I am quite sure that if any number of medical officers of health come along and say that such a thing should be added there would be no difficulty about having it added.  There was never any compulsion that they should use special treatment.  There was that degree of compulsion, if you like, that they were not permitted to use certain new drugs until something more was known about them.  That was all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing I would like to say arising out of a point made in particular by my colleague, Deputy Dr. Esmonde.  As a doctor I cannot see how it is not necessary from time to time to have controls and limitations on certain drugs, particularly in the early stages when they are introduced.  Take the example of B.C.G. vaccination.  It is now working successfully in this country, but in the early stages of its use it was not open to any doctor to use it.  Its use was restricted to trained vaccinators.  When drugs are brought in shortly after laboratory work has been done and they are in the experimental stage, surely Dr. Esmonde must agree that it is essential that they are only used by trained people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde says that the first group to control cortisone here was the State.  I am not saying this to criticise my colleague in any way but because I want it made clear that certain controls are necessary.  If he looks into the use of cortisone in this country he will see that the first people to control its use here were the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll seems to have missed the point of my argument.  Of course, I agree as a doctor that there must be a certain control on drugs.  The point I have been making here is that with regard to cortisone&mdash;I think I made it perfectly clear&mdash;certain hospitals for dispensary patients are allowed to use <Col N="1054" /> cortisone whereas other hospitals are not.  Will the Deputy appreciate the fact that if a dispensary patient is in a certain hospital and that particular hospital is not allowed, by ministerial or other order, to use cortisone, is it not commonsense that that dispensary patient cannot get the treatment in that hospital?  Will the Deputy see that I accept there must be regulation of drugs.  The Minister mentioned cortisone as being a dangerous drug.  It was a new drug 18 months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The voluntary hospitals only got the power to use cortisone quite recently, after this particular incident I quoted this evening where a voluntary hospital wanting to treat a patient with cortisone could not get it other than through the St. Kevin's hospital doctors.  That is the position of affairs as I have said.  If the Minister tells me that is wrong I will accept his word.  However he has not expressed any opinion one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am trying to stress is that this section deals with the regimentation or the control of hospitals. I do not want to make any particular case about cortisone any more than anything else.  I just want to stress that as an incident where certain dispensary patients in certain hospitals, as a result of this regulation, were unable to receive treatment.  Therefore, I think it is wrong that the Minister should seek such powers under this section.  I have been accused by the Minister and Deputy Dr. ffrench O'Carroll&mdash;I think they misunderstood me&mdash;of objecting to the control of dangerous drugs.  There are plenty of other regulations for dealing with dangerous drugs without giving the Minister these absolutely unlimited powers.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the Minister for Health <Col N="1055" /> will abuse these powers, but I say it is against the principles of free people. I said that before and I repeat it again, and that is why we object to this legislation for the future.  In our objections we are in good company with other people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to stress the point that the objection to this section and this amendment is the power it gives the Minister to make regulations and to make Orders.  They are very wide powers and there is practically no restriction.  We suggest and recommend that no doctor would be directed to give treatment that was contrary to his conscience and I think that is a reasonable amendment to suggest and to put in.  However, the Minister resists that.</P>
      <P>I have said here before and now I repeat, that I have no doubt whatever that the present Minister for Health would not outrage any of the canons or rules of common decency, nor indeed would he, intentionally anyway, restrict our liberties.  But this Act is to be a permanent measure.  Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour as at present constituted will pass out of the world in a certain number of years.  Another Minister of Health and of a new type may occupy that position and we are trying to guard against that.  At least that is one of the reasons we are trying to provide this safeguard.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that a number of things said here to-night were not said a considerable length of time ago.  We had the antics of certain Deputies here in trying to convict or at least accuse certain people of certain things relating to a document that has not been published. I think that was contemptible but I leave it at that.  With regard to the Deputies who declared they were elected to bring in a free mother and child welfare scheme, no matter what anybody else said, whether they be Bishops or lay people, we would like to know where these four are now.  If Deputy Dr. Browne, as he says this evening, accepts the direction of the Hierarchy in this country on matters of faith and morals, is it not a pity that he did not say it to his colleagues in the Government in 1951?</P>

      <P>I assert that if Deputy Dr. Browne accepted the decision of the Hierarchy conveyed in their letter, there would have been no need for a crisis.  It was because he refused to accept it and because the Government of the day were not prepared to accept the proposals&mdash;not his scheme but proposals&mdash;which he had outlined and which they had condemned, that that situation arose.  What I asked the Minister here on the last occasion when the Money Resolution was being debated was: did his Bill meet the requirements of the teachers of Christian philosophy in this country?  I said that if he said it did, I would accept his word.  The Minister did not answer that question and he has not answered it yet.  We do know that a document has been circulated or has been issued. I do not know its details exactly, but I do say that in my opinion from what the Bishops wrote in 1947 to the then Taoiseach and what they wrote in 1951 to Deputy Costello, who was then Taoiseach, the present Bill does not come within their requirements.  I may be wrong in that but it is a reasonable question to ask the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of theology.  Does the Minister want to take the lead in opposition to the Hierarchy and Catholic teaching? Does he expect a poor ordinary Deputy like myself to lead an agitation against it?  Is it not reasonable that the Minister and I should be on the same lines on that particular matter?  Why should there be a dispute about the health scheme?  Why should there be any trouble about it?  Why will we not take the ordinary teaching that is there for us?  Of course, we are a free people and we can reject it and go outside the Church if we want to, but if we are going to retain our standards, surely there is no reason in the world why the Minister, the Government or this Party here should not accept the teaching laid down.  Why should there be any issue at all about it?  I am only suggesting that this Bill as it stands and the amendments the Minister has put in&mdash;in particular this amendment&mdash; do not in my opinion meet the requirements.  If the Ministers says they do, I stand corrected because again no matter what I may say about the Minister, I do not think he would tell a lie on that matter.</P>

      <P>Some amendments&mdash;whatever the qualifying words were.  The Minister for Finance said that they were minor and consequential amendments.  Deputy Killilea can get <Col N="1058" /> up and contradict what I am saying by a speech of his own instead of resorting to interruption.  So far as I can read&mdash;and I do not claim to be a McGilligan nor even to be up to the standard of a Peadar Cowan&mdash;my reading of the Bill is that it does not come within the requirements which have been laid down.  This section gives power to the Minister to make an Order that an institution is to give a certain type of treatment or is not to give a certain type of treatment and when he makes that Order, whoever is obliged to carry it out must carry it out.  That Order can carry a direction to a doctor or an institution to administer treatment that is not in keeping with either their religious beliefs or consciences.  Why give that power?  Why not put in words to meet that danger and you then have this power in a restrictive way?  Let me conclude with the statement that the whole question of the 1947 Act was raised positively in 1947 and was answered by the then Taoiseach in 1948, just immediately before the change of Government.  The relevant documents are now available.  They were quite clear to the Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, in 1951, and they are equally clear to-day.  Only those who want to be deliberately dense will suggest that it was not on a question of faith and morals the Bishop spoke, but merely in accordance with some social teaching.  That is nonsense.  I submit this amendment should be carefully considered by every Deputy and that we should not have charges thrown across the House that some Deputies are trying to be better than others from the Catholic point of view. There is no point in that.  If we get to that stage it means that no matter what a person may think, if he is going to be classed as a lay theologian, or accused of trying to be more Catholic than Deputies on the other side, you are intimidating him.</P>

He told us that he has these powers already and he referred us to Section 36 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, for powers that are therein contained, but that have absolutely nothing to do with this. When we ask him about diseases or about purposes, all we hear is &ldquo;smallpox.&rdquo; Here is, as it were, a smallpox amendment that gives the Minister dictatorial power to direct what shall be done in the various institutions under local authorities&mdash;over their heads, if necessary&mdash;and to direct everything that shall be done inside them, to divide people up into specified classes and he will not give us any idea as to what the specified classes will be.  He takes these sweeping powers and refers us to Section 36 of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, and to smallpox.  He then says that if we ask him any more questions he will not answer because we are trying to teach him religion in trying to get him to explain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the section and I am opposed to the amendment.  I am opposed to the Bill generally.  I am opposed to the Bill for the reasons I have already given. I do not like the wording of the Bill <Col N="1061" /> which says payments will be made as directed by the Minister particularly when the responsibility for payment will be passed on to the local authorities. For that reason I do not like the section and I do not like the amendment.

      <P>The suggestion has been made that the Hierarchy has been silenced by an Iron Curtain.  I do not believe the Hierarchy can be silenced by an Iron Curtain drawn by the Taoiseach, or by the Minister, or by anybody else.  Important Churchmen behind the Iron Curtain that does exist were not afraid to voice their opinions when matters affecting the faith and morals of the people were at stake.  They suffered and are suffering a great deal for doing that.  I do not believe the Taoiseach, or the Minister for Health, will be able to silence the Hierarchy if he is doing something opposed to faith and morals.  But that does not make me any more favourably inclined towards the section and the amendment.  I am opposed to any section which gives the Minister authority to say what payments will be made when, at the same time, he can say that he will only pay part of the cost and the local ratepayers will have to pay the remaining cost.  I oppose the section and I oppose the Bill on that issue alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every institution receiving monies from a health authority shall be subject to inspection by persons appointed for the purpose by the health authority.</P>
      <P>I hope it will be possible for Fine Gael to listen to the arguments I am putting forward on this amendment and to judge them on their merits without any heat or hysteria such as they have shown on more innocuous amendments brought in by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid I do not believe it will be possible for the Minister to help in relation to the suggestion made here, but I would like to put forward some considerations which must now arise in relation to the continued further administration of our voluntary hospitals. The old position was that the voluntary hospitals were enabled to carry on by reason of the fact that the annual deficits, which at present run between £500,000 and £750,000, were paid out of <Col N="1063" /> the moneys invested by the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  A decision was taken by the Minister for Health that the capital sum should be spent in the provision of further hospitals rather than have the money invested to provide interest from which the deficits could be paid.  That money has now largely been used up in building hospitals or allocated in some other way for the provision of hospitals and a new position arises.</P>
    <P>The position which now arises, I understand, is that this House will in the future be asked to vote a large part of the running deficits of many of these voluntary hospitals.  I know quite well that, in putting forward the suggestion that institutions receiving money from health authorities should be subject to inspection by persons appointed by these health authorities, is open to a certain amount of misrepresentation.  I hope that misrepresentation will be kept to the minimum.  My only reason for putting forward the suggestion is because of conclusions which I had reached in two capacities.  First, as a former Minister for Health, I saw reasons for thinking that local representatives and representatives of the Department should have the right of access to these voluntary hospitals. Secondly, in my capacity as a doctor I did not see that these institutions would suffer any grave disadvantage if we did have that right of access.  I am not in the slightest bit anxious to upset in any way their general working conditions.  I am sure a number of Deputies would be ready to pay tribute to the work which they have done over the years.</P>
    <P>I think they have done good and useful work.  At the same time, I feel the time has come when we must review their position, with the least possible inconvenience or upset to anybody, so as to make them a little more suitable for meeting the changing circumstances which largely revolve around the fact that, from now on, the taxpayers, whom we represent here, will be providing tremendous sums of money to cover the running of these voluntary hospitals&mdash;something in the region of £500,000 or £750,000.  I suppose <Col N="1064" /> it would be optimistic of me to hope that the figure will ever become a stable one.  At any rate, the position facing us is that in the next ten or 20 years some Minister or some Government, will be asking the representatives of the taxpayers in the Dáil to provide considerable sums of money for the running of these institutions As I have said, I do not want radically to interfere with the running of them. Quite candidly, I confess that I am not particularly concerned to upset the peace of mind of their managements. If that were to happen I believe it is the patients who would suffer, and the main consideration that ought to weigh with us is their welfare.  The patient that I have in mind particularly when I put down this amendment, was the public patient.  He is a taxpayer, and in that capacity is paying the running costs of these institutions.  He is the person who is called upon to foot the bill, to pay the piper.  I am asking, why should he not be permitted to some extent, to call the tune in regard to the running of these institutions? Everybody knows that these institutions were started many years ago, some of them 200 years ago.  I think that probably most of them were started with the best possible intentions in the world by people who were revolted by the privations, hardships and sufferings which the rule of another nation had imposed on our poor people.  We have, therefore, to give their founders credit for setting up these institutions for the care of the sick poor of our country.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to be in any way offensive, I believe that the general attitude dominating these institutions was one of a supercilious looking-down on the pauper who was dependent on their charity for his continued existence, his restoration to health and his care in them.  I do not think that attitude has persisted completely, but I think that it still persists to a certain degree in relation to some of these hospitals.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why we should not now move towards the achievement in these institutions, of the attitude which, to a large extent, is beginning to appear in our public authority institutions <Col N="1065" /> where the patient as a ratepayer or taxpayer knows that he has a perfect right, as a citizen of the State, to the treatment which he receives. He knows that he is paying for it&mdash; that he is paying the salary of every man in these public institutions, from the hall-porter right up to the medical head of the hospital, and that consequently he is accepting nothing on charity.  He is accepting the treatment he receives because he has a perfect right to it as a citizen in a free democracy.  This amendment is an attempt to bring a little more of that democracy into these institutions, and a little more of the egalitarian outlook in regard to the treatment of medicine into them.  It is for these reasons that I think we should have the right of access to these institutions.</P>
    <P>There are many considerations which, I think, we should keep before our minds.  The dominating one is that we, as the representatives of the taxpayers, are going to spend vast sums of money on the administration and running of these institutions.  From time to time, over the last 30 years, we have laid down here certain guiding rules, principles and regulations which we considered were likely to react to the best interests of the patients in our institutions.  In doing that, we imposed restrictions on our county councillors and on ourselves in regard to many of our functions and duties concerning these institutions.  Therefore, I think that the conditions which we laid down for our county councillors and for the members of this House who are on the management committees of hospitals and institutions generally, should be the beginning of our approach to the controlling management of the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am of opinion that we should lay down, and gradually introduce the same guiding principles for the management and controlling governors of these voluntary hospitals.  I do not think it can be said that Deputies on any side of this House can be accused of being in any serious way dishonest, corrupt or likely to evade their responsibilities as moral individuals, or in any way likely to do anything which would be contrary to normal Christian behaviour <Col N="1066" /> in a modern society.  I am not going to side-step into a discussion on the moral law.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we have seen fit over the last 30 years to lay down these guiding principles.  We have them, first of all, in the establishment of the Local Appointments Commission. The fact is that the county councillors and Deputies who are on these hospital boards are bound by the excellent provisions of the Local Appointments Commission in the making of appointments to our local authority institutions, from the smallest right up to the very largest and in all aspects of our medical service.  That is a system which can do nothing but improve&mdash;I cannot see how it could disimprove&mdash; the standard of medicine and the standard of treatment which our patients must receive in the voluntary hospitals, if we are to continue to pay the bill for these hospitals, which are now dependent on us to keep them going.</P>
    <P>Again, in relation to contracts, in relation to the provision of equipment, food or clothes, in any of the aspects where the taxpayers' money is laid out in these institutions, we have a responsibility to ensure that the representatives of the Minister or of the local authority shall have access to the boardroom of these institutions, in order to ensure that the standards we have laid down will be followed.  They are very excellent standards which no one could quarrel with.  I would urge the Minister, therefore, to give consideration to this proposal.  It is not a new consideration of mine or a new idea that I have had.</P>
    <P>As far back as the time of the Meath Hospital Bill I was largely instrumental in ensuring that a majority of local representatives would be appointed to the board of that hospital.  Whether I was instrumental or not I do not know, but I was most anxious that it should occur and it did.  It has not led to any deterioration in the affairs of that hospital.  In fact, I understand that a considerable improvement has taken place.  That is a precedent which has been established and which could readily be followed, at least to some <Col N="1067" /> extent.  We must expect that, not immediately but in the next ten or 20 years, it is conceivable that we will continue to vote large sums of money to institutions, some of whom behave in an exemplary way and some of whom behave in a way we would not accept at all for our local authority institutions.  It is not the exemplary and well-organised institutions I am concerned about, it is those which will abuse the fact that it has a free hand in questions of administration which arise in the running of a hospital.</P>
    <P>Though it is not completely analogous, there is a certain similiarity between this and the taking over of the G.S.R. and handing it over to C.I.E., or the taking over of the G.N.R. and running it by a statutory board.  I am not suggesting that we could take over the voluntary hospitals and I hope no Deputy will follow me and say that I said we must nationalise our voluntary hospitals.  I am merely suggesting that, now that we are going to hand out large sums of money to these institutions, we should exercise the care which, as private citizens, we would exercise in the disposal of our own private money, were we laying it out in anything like the tremendous amounts which will be asked of us from time to time in the Dáil.  It is a principle which we have accepted in relation to other organisations and institutions and in relation to one hospital already.</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion that I know will be put forward, the possibility that we would be interfering with religious orders in the running of their hospitals.  I do not think there is the slightest need to have any fears in that regard at all.  Religious orders run in an excellent way many of our local authority institutions.  Most of our county homes are staffed by these ladies, who do magnificent work in the very trying circumstances of our appallingly derelict county homes, in many cases.  Similarly, in many of our county hospitals the religious carry on their work, as is also the case still in St. Kevin's, I understand, and in Galway Central Hospital.  Therefore, it is possible to have a considerable <Col N="1068" /> degree of democratic control or supervision without in any way interfering with the autonomy of the religious order or of the medical officers.  What we are suggesting is that these men who have been nominated by the people, as a result of a public open vote, who put themselves and their policies forward in different ways, who are elected to local authorities or to the Dáil, perfectly honourable respectable men on both sides of the House, no one can question that&mdash;should be given access to the activities and to the boardrooms of these hospitals.</P>
    <P>If you examine the membership of many of these hospital boards, it will be found that very few members are any higher in character, personality or ability than members of this House, or of the average local authority.  Most of us are as good as the people on these boards and I do not see why we should not have access to these board-rooms. Most of the elections to these boards take place in a completely undemocratic way.  On the Catholic side it is done through the Knights of Columbanus and on the Protestant side it is done through the Freemasons. It is completely undemocratic and I do not think it should be permitted.</P>

        <i>Defensor fidei</i>.  If we are willing to put ourselves forward for election, if we go to the trouble of getting up on soap-boxes and holding <Col N="1069" /> meetings at street corners, trying to declaim to the public that we believe in democracy, we must pursue it to its logical conclusion and see that the spending of public moneys shall be carefully supervised.  That is all that is being asked for here.</P>
      <P>I have no objection in the world to the people who at present sit in these boardrooms or run our hospitals, whether they are Knights or Masons, taking the ordinary course of going to the people and being elected and, by virtue of their authority, derived either from the Dáil, the local authority or the Minister, whatever it may be, being then appointed to run those hospitals.  Then they have won their right.  But, if we profess ideas of democratic control of our institutions generally, I see nothing wrong at all in my proposition, with Deputy Cowan, that we should have right of access to those institutions.</P>
      <P>We are not sending in any fanatical commissars to the institutions.  We are merely asking that the perfectly normal, reasonable, honourable men who have gone before the public, who have been nominated by the public to look after and control their affairs and who do their best on both sides of the House to do that, should be permitted to follow this money into a particular sphere of social activity where a tremendous amount of money is spent every year and where increasing sums of money are to be spent in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dr. Browne has made a very reasonable case for this amendment.  He has made it quite clear that he does not want to interfere with the autonomy of the voluntary hospitals as the Minister himself has not done in this legislation.  There must be many members of the House listening to this discussion who are members of local authorities.  If people who pay taxes, and so on, are paying out a great deal of money for voluntary hospitals, it is perfectly natural to ask that they should have the right to make inquiries, to find out why such a thing was not done or why they could not obtain this, that or the other treatment. <Col N="1070" /> It is natural that, as public representatives and as the guardian of the money they are putting up, they should be in a position to have at least sufficient authority to make inquiries and to be presented with the facts and to be able to get full information on points that they raise.</P>
      <P>As far as Dublin Corporation is concerned, I know that in the case of the voluntary hospitals that we pay grants to or finance in one way or another, we always have representation on the governing body.</P>
      <P>Apart from making these few remarks I rose to ask the Minister does he know if that applies to all local authorities throughout the country? Where they make money available to voluntary institutions, of a medical or other kind, have they the right, or is it merely a courtesy, to representation on the governing bodies of the institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>There are representatives of local authorities on the boards of Cork voluntary hospitals.  This year in the case of one voluntary hospital, there was an attempt made to get representation of doctors on the board. I was one of those who put in a notice of motion at one time to that particular hospital and got representation for the doctors with the idea that we would be satisfied with one or two who would be able to give technical advice to the lay members of the board.  This year, as most people know, subscribers of one guinea a year to the voluntary hospitals can elect 15 trustees to the board.  That is the position in Cork. Those 15 trustees, when elected, can elect 12 members to the board of management.  If that situation is to develop, where you have families of doctors subscribing guineas and attending a meeting and voting on to the board a certain number of trustees&mdash; their number this year was limited; they did not look for all but they did not even get what they looked for&mdash; that by virtue of paying a guinea subscription to a voluntary hospital they would be enabled to elect trustees, it would not be in the best interests of democracy or in the best interests of the people as a whole.  It is wrong that a number of doctors on a board should <Col N="1071" /> vote for the appointment of doctors to the particular institution while at the same time they are members of the staff of the particular hospital and attend as honorary surgeons or honorary physicians.  There is no doubt about it that they earn a certain amount of money in these voluntary hospitals, whether from private patients or public patients does not matter very much.  It is wrong that people should act in a dual capacity, running the board of management and acting on the staff of the hospital.  It is not in the best interests of the people that doctors should vote when appointments are being made to the staff, particularly if they themselves are members of the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I do not agree with Deputy Dr. Browne on some of his ideas about the voluntary hospitals. I think they are fulfilling a very useful purpose.  If they are to be allowed to continue, my opinion is that they must be left as they are.  It is possible, as Deputy Dr. Browne says, that this inspection would not make an awful lot of difference, but I think they would consider that it would make a terrible difference.  They would be violently opposed to it, I am quite sure and, for that reason, I think we would be making a great mistake to impose such a thing upon them because they would see in it, I am afraid, the beginning of control of some kind or another which is entirely opposed to the idea of the voluntary hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards this board of management, the section concerns the local authority sending patients to a voluntary hospital or to any institution and the idea underlying this amendment is that in such case, where the local authority has made an agreement with the voluntary hospital to send them patients, it should have the right of inspection.  I do not think there is much really to be said for this particular amendment.  For many years the position has been that local authorities were sending their patients to voluntary hospitals.  On the whole, I think they were quite satisfied and it is presumed that, under this particular clause, that practice will continue. It is most unlikely indeed that, <Col N="1072" /> even if we passed this amendment, the local authority would be likely to use it.  If they have any cause for grievance with any particular voluntary hospital the obvious thing, as they have done in the past, is that they will just leave it and make their arrangements with another hospital instead.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, opposed to the amendment, first of all, on the general consideration of interfering with the voluntary hospitals at all as they are now constituted and, secondly, because I think in the particular instance that the power will not be used and that from that point of view it is unnecessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see very clearly the Minister's point of view in regard to this amendment.  This amendment is, in fact, a clear indication of what will happen in the near future.  The Minister says: &ldquo;I do not want to interfere with the position as it is&rdquo;.  What is the position?  The position is that anyone can pay two guineas into the funds of a hospital and become a governor.  Anyone in Ireland can pay two guineas and become entitled to elect the people who run the hospital.  For two little guineas that is what you get in regard to these hospitals.  But the present Minister and his predecessor, Deputy Dr. Browne, have pumped tens of thousands of pounds into the hospitals.</P>

      <P>The money of the public who subscribed it.  I will go beyond that even if I am wanted to. We have put into these hospitals millions of money from the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  That has dried up.  Now we are voting millions of the taxpayers' money and the local authorities are also contributing to the hospitals.  Is it not a queer state of affairs that by paying a miserable two guineas you can have some say in the running of a hospital, but because you contributed as a local authority or as a Government tens of thousands of pounds you have no say in the running of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the difficulty in which the <Col N="1073" /> Minister is in regard to this.  I know what will be said about these things. But should not the public who put tens of thousands of pounds into these hospitals have some say in the running of them?  Should they not have as much say as the people who put up a miserable two guineas?</P>
    <P>In the Meath Hospital&mdash;I do not know why it is called the Quaker Hospital&mdash;certain people thought that the Quakers should have no control and each of them contributed two guineas to run out the body which had controlled the hospital for very many years.  Miserable, petty-minded individuals put up two guineas each and hunted out a body which had run the hospital for a long period.  We in this city are contributing to that hospital tens of thousands of pounds.  As Deputy Dr. Browne said, when we reconstituted it by Act of Parliament we provided that the majority of the governors should be members of the Dublin Corporation and of the Dublin County Council.  Has that in any way affected the efficiency of the hospital? It has not.  I happen to be one of the members of the Dublin Corporation who is a member of that hospital body and as such I can inspect it at any time I like.  When that Bill was going through, I was insistent that a very large measure of control should vest in the medical board of that hospital cure the people who become patients and, as far as I am concerned, I consider the medical board are there to cure the people who become patients and any help they can get from us as governors they will get for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Why can we not have the same thing in the other hospitals?  What is wrong with it?  How many voluntary hospitals could exist to-day if they had not had subventions from State or local authority funds?  How long are we to have the position that individuals can subscribe two guineas to keep a hospital going?  Take any of the big voluntary hospitals in Dublin. There may be subscriptions from governors of £1,000 and a subvention from the State and local authorities of tens of thousands of pounds and the system is that the people who contribute the £1,000 in subscriptions run the hospital, but the State or the local <Col N="1074" /> authorities that in fact keep the hospital going are to have no say in it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulty of the Minister so far as this amendment is concerned.  In a very short time these charitable subscriptions given by generous and charitably&mdash;minded people will dry up, and when they dry up we will have a new system of control of these hospitals.  If the Minister says that he will not accept the amendment of Deputy Dr. Browne and myself for the reasons he has stated, we can just keep patient for a very short period and and then we will have control of the hospitals by the people who put the money into them.  The people who pay the piper should always call the tune.  The people of Ireland keep the hospitals going, and they should control them through either the Dáil or the local authorities.  That may be deferred for a very short period, but it cannot be deferred entirely.</P>
    <P>People who go into these hospitals may have cause for complaint about this, that and the other thing which they would like their local representatives to look into.  It is a queer position that I, as a member of the Dublin Corporation or as a member of this Dáil, may be told of something happening in a hospital which is entirely wrong and contrary to all our conceptions of Christianity.  A person may arrive at a hospital at 10 o'clock at night to be told that he cannot be admitted and that he had better go to some other hospital.  While seeking admission to another hospital he may spend the time during which his life might have been saved and die.  If I put that up to the Minister in this House, although the State is paying millions of money to these hospitals, he can answer: &ldquo;I have no authority, I have no responsibility in the matter.&rdquo;  That is not a right position. These hospitals should be subject to some supervision by the local authorities or by the Minister or the public. I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 11th June.</P>
