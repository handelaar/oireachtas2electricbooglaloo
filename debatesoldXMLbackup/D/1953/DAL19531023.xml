      <P>This Vote is similar to the Vote passed last night.  It is a very important Vote.  The amount included in the Vote is not sufficient to meet the needs and demands of the people, particularly those living in rural areas. The Parliamentary Secretary, coming from an area west of the Shannon, is well acquainted with the needs of the people, especially small farmers living <Col N="496" /> in culs-de-sac off main and county roads.</P>
      <P>There is a huge mileage of roads in County Mayo and, therefore, a great mileage of culs-de-sac and by-roads. A big percentage of the people were forced into backward areas in years gone by.  Even under native Government these people have not been provided with suitable entrance to their homes and holdings.  Relief schemes are made available on certain conditions in certain areas, but unless there is a certain number of registered unemployed in the electoral division it is not easy to have repair work carried out on a road.</P>
      <P>The same applies to Land Commission roads.  In the area that I represent, a great deal of land was taken over by the Land Commission and a big percentage of it was allotted by way of addition to small holdings to people who were resident or employed on the land prior to acquisition, or to tenants living a distance of one to three miles away.  Roads were made to accommodate the people who got the land.  They were made on very poor foundation.  The land was mapped out and striped; fences were erected on both sides and the road was made between the fences.  The foundations were soft.  The roads were well made by the Land Commission and gave great service to the people and provided suitable entrance to the land from the trunk road or county road. However, the roads did not stand the strain of increased traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go further and say that inside the last five or 10 years extra traffic that was never intended 20 or 25 years ago has been passing over those roads, culs-de sac and by-roads leading off the main roads, the county roads, into a village.  The traffic has changed from every point of view, from the time when it was possible that some of the people living in those areas would perhaps only go out on those roads on a very special occasion to get connected to the main road or the county road. Now all this has changed altogether and it is a daily routine with the people that they have to pass out to get on to the main road.  The point I am coming to is that I know that on plenty <Col N="497" /> of those roads you now have a new kind of traffic.  You have the private lorry and the lorry haulier and the tractor all making use of those roads even from the main road, perhaps, into some place where some method of work is available to somebody who employs either the lorry or the tractor or there is some work on which the lorry or tractor man can make use of those roads.  All that heavy traffic is making things difficult as far as some of the people are concerned in those areas.</P>
    <P>I understand that the regulations as far as the local authorities are concerned and as far as this Vote is concerned provide that there is a percentage of the people living in certain areas who cannot by any method or regulation get anything done on those roads except in a very small way.  It is just a chance from time to time that you might get one little road or two done in an area of, say, two electoral divisions.</P>
    <P>When one road is done you might irritate people living in other areas where they say: &ldquo;Such and such a road was done last year or two years ago, and why cannot something be done on our portion of the road?&rdquo; I know that the Parliamentary Secretary has his own trouble as far as demands are concerned especially with roads like this.  I also know all the difficulties that face the people of Mayo and Galway, and I think that the Board of Works and the Parliamentary Secretary should come to some agreement by a survey so that those culs-de-sac and roads that would not in the ordinary way qualify for a relief scheme grant from the point of view of the present regulations will be attended to.  In our own county I am a member of the local authority where we had this question of the by-roads on every annual estimate.  It is one of the burning questions, and every member of the council has a similar grievance in his own area because of the fact that those roads do not come under the control of the county council so that members of the county council have no authority to expend money or to make it available to those roads in grants.  They feel that if the county council takes any responsibility for the <Col N="498" /> repair of any of those by-roads it becomes a question of the council taking them over, and if the council take over one of those roads they have the full responsibility afterwards for maintenance.  Contract roads are a fairly big responsibility with the county council from the point of view of the extra traffic and the general regulations as far as the contractor is concerned, with the result that the county councils are perhaps up to 100 per cent. as far as they can go where the contract roads are concerned, without the responsibility of taking over any additional roads.  As far as these roads are concerned, to my recollection there was a suggestion that in the annual estimate we should make a small tax on the rates and by this small tax we could have a special repair grant scheme where a local contribution was necessary to qualify for the repair of those roads, and that in that way, over a period of, say, five years, we would have met a big percentage of the needs of the people living in areas such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I was, however, given to understand at the time that a contribution like that by a local authority would commit the local authority to responsibility for the full maintenance of the road.  I am satisfied that I am quite safe in suggesting that because of the fact that the county council, as is stated here, have the responsibility of administering the distribution of this money and the working arrangement of it in the areas where the money is made available, in a similar way if the council were allowed to make this local contribution percentage and this Vote was entitled to make a reasonable contribution in that way we would seem to be reaching the stage at which the people living in those areas would have the accommodation.</P>
    <P>I know plenty of areas where turf and bogs are not as plentiful now as they were 25, 30, 40 or 50 years ago, areas where bogland and bog accommodation are running out, with the result that the people who were cutting turf in one direction 40 years must now go in another direction.  In that way roads that were designed for traffic covering the bog areas 20 or 40 years <Col N="499" /> ago where people were living in perhaps two or three villages as far as four or five miles away from those bogs are now inadequate, and people going to the bogs have to pass into the culs-de-sac and by-roads through those villages, and very little is being done with those by-roads though they are available to a big section of the people from different parts.  For the four, five or six people living on both sides of the roads, they are the only entrance they have into and out of the village to connect with the main road or the county road.</P>
    <P>If the road was eligible for repairs by the county council and recommended for work in the ordinary way the number of registered unemployed would require them to be called on to put up a local contribution.  The contribution, as I understand it, is based on the valuation of the people living in the area, and if we called upon the two, three, four, five or six people living in that area to make a local contribution, in a lot of areas they would be satisfied to make it for the repair of the road which is specially intended for themselves but the people who use that road at only one period of the year, to take their turf from the bog, feel that it would not be fair that they should be asked to contribute to the making of the road to the bog.  In fact, some of the people concerned use the road only one month in the year and if there was a call for local contribution, not one penny would be subscribed by them.  In view of all that has been done for the trunk roads, the main roads and the county roads, I think it is about time that something was done for the section of the people for whom I now plead.  We are improving our main roads and our trunk roads in an endeavour to attract more tourists and we are making every effort to repair county roads.  As a matter of fact, steamrolling has now been extended to the county roads.  In all the long years, practically nothing has been done to tackle the problem of those people who live on the roads of which I have been speaking.</P>
    <P>There is a road in the electoral division of Deel and many applications have been sent in by the residents in <Col N="500" /> the area: it is at a place called Rathmore.  There are four or five families living in the area which that road serves.  Many other people have occasion to use this road in order to get out on the county road and from that county road they get on to a main road and they have to do that round when they want to bring home the turf. I have a clear recollection of that road. I remember attending a funeral there some years ago and the road was in a desperate condition and certainly it was most unfair to the people there to leave it as it was.</P>
    <P>I know that applications were made in respect of that road and I am making special mention of this matter now because I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will attend to it without delay and give it his sympathetic consideration.  I am certain that if the road is inspected the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials will be only too willing to agree that the repair of that road should get priority in the repair schemes.</P>
    <P>There is the possibility that there may not be a sufficient number of registered unemployed in the area to enable a 100 per cent. grant to be given in respect of the repair of that road but in the adjoining electoral division or within a radius of two or three miles you will find a sufficient number of registered unemployed and, though they may not be in the same electoral division, they are living along its border.  I suggest, in connection with the making available of this money, that if there are areas in which there are not a sufficient number of registered unemployed to qualify for a grant, some of the registered unemployed in an adjoining electoral division should be considered in conjunction with the registered unemployed in the area in question.</P>
    <P>It sometimes happens that, in a certain area, you will always find that there are a sufficient number of unemployed and that, in that area, money has been spent every year over a period of years with the result that it has the advantage of a good road, and so forth.  It may also happen that, in an area immediately adjoining that electoral division, there may be a road which is in such a bad state of repair <Col N="501" /> that it hardly deserves the name of &ldquo;road.&rdquo; I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will note that point for future consideration in connection with the giving of grants.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the problem of culs-de-sac.  I know how important this matter can be to the people living along them because I have had much experience of it as a member of a local authority.  I know that every member of a local authority is anxious to assist, by every means possible, the residents of culs-de-sac and all those other people who have occasion to use these culs-de-sac.</P>
    <P>I think that the Department of Local Government is the Department which is responsible for our roads.  If the local authority were prepared to levy even a small tax on the ratepayers in their annual estimate, and if they were allowed to use the money derived from that tax on those culs-de-sac, back roads and accommodation roads for, say, a period of five years, and if that money were supplemented by a grant either from the Board of Works or some other Department dealing with roads, much good and badly-needed work would be carried out.  It would be well if the county council were allowed to administer such a scheme on the understanding that the local authority would not be committed to any further responsibility so far as maintenance is concerned.  If the job of repair were well done it would last for ten or 15 years and the local authority would have no further responsibility after having put the road into a proper state of repair.  I believe that some scheme like that would go a long way towards giving suitable accommodation roads to those small farmers throughout the country who live a long distance from main roads and trunk roads.</P>

      <P>I was not present when the Parliamentary Secretary introduced this Estimate but I assume that the fundamental purpose of this particular Vote is to provide for the extraordinary unemployment situation which we have at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> Let us examine this Vote now and bear in mind the present unemployment situation.  Having regard to the total amount provided this year, I think that it would be fair to say that the sum which this House is asked to provide for unemployment is a very puny effort when one has regard to the numbers of unemployed in our cities, towns and rural areas.  I think I would be putting it very mildly indeed if I said that the amount which the Government asks for this year is not half enough nor quarter enough to meet the situation which this country and, in particular, this Government is faced with.</P>
    <P>I have no criticism of the amounts paid in salaries, wages and travelling expenses to those people who are responsible for the employment and emergency schemes.  When we read this total of £685,000 odd we must bear in mind that, out of that amount, over £70,000 must go for salaries, wages, allowances, travelling and incidental expenses.  Therefore, the net amount for actual employment and emergency schemes is but £600,000&mdash;and that £600,000, despite the fact that unemployment is greater this year than last year, is £100,000 less than was provided for the year 1952-53.</P>
    <P>This is one of the Votes on which Deputies can speak exclusively on the question of employment.  In other Votes, emphasis is laid on the work done or the work to be done.  Listening to some of the speeches from both sides of the House last evening and this morning, I have discovered that what many Deputies regard as the most important thing in this Vote, and the moneys provided under it, is the doing of a particular kind of work.  That, in itself, is important but, as far as this Vote is concerned, the important thing is the provision of work for men who have been sick, idle or who are not able to get work in this country.  I would say to the Parliamentary Secretary that if the main intention of this Vote is to provide work, by way of different types of schemes, he should press upon the Minister for Finance, who, in turn, should press the Government, to introduce from time to time Supplementary Estimates for the provision <Col N="503" /> of extra money where there is an extraordinary situation in the matter of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I submit that we have that situation at present.  I do not want to minimise or to exaggerate it, or seek to distort figures, but it has been stated emphatically by the Taoiseach that, in many of the smaller areas particularly, the housing programme, as visualised after the survey of 1947, has been completed.  We all have evidence of that and it must, therefore, be appreciated that, the housing programme in these areas being finished, there must be an increase in unemployment, especially amongst unskilled workers. Deputies have an example of that in the towns of Gorey and Enniscorthy, where house-building schemes have stopped completely, and one is therefore forced to ask oneself what is to become of these unskilled workers, especially those who, for the past three, four or five years, had fairly constant employment on these schemes.</P>
    <P>I suggest that they are signing on at the labour exchange and, if that is the case, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Finance should be well able to make a case that much more money is needed for the provision of work for these people who have been disemployed through the cessation of house building.  Unfortunately, we know that that is not the case, that, on the contrary, the Vote has been cut down by £122,000, if one compares it with the amount provided for the year 1952-53.  It must be readily admitted, too, that there is less work in the rural areas and that the amount provided this year should be much bigger if the original intention of the Vote, the provision of work, is to be carried out.</P>
    <P>All of us have come to realise that, with the introduction of machinery into the agricultural industry, there are fewer and fewer opportunities for rural workers to get employment.  Where a farmer had work for two or three workers three, four or five years ago he is now well able to carry on the business of his farm with one man because of the introduction of farm machinery.  Cottage building in the rural districts has diminished over the <Col N="504" /> past few years, and, as I said, the Taoiseach told us some few months ago that the house-building programmes of many of the county councils have been completed.  There is less money available between road works and Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes and generally the situation is such that there are very few opportunities for unemployed workers in rural areas at present of getting employment.  From that point of view, the Vote, under the heading of rural employment and minor employment schemes, ought to be stepped up rather than cut down by a substantial amount as is the case.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has attempted to explain away the decrease in respect of one of these headings by saying that the Minister for Local Government has provided more money for work on county roads.  Be that as it may, the Minister for Local Government, on the one hand, can boast about more employment in the rural areas by saying that there is more money for county roads, while the Parliamentary Secretary can say he cut down a particular heading because the Minister had found it possible to provide more money for county roads. I suggest therefore that the increase boasted of by the Minister is very much offset by the reduction which the Parliamentary Secretary has made.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion here last night about the situation in Dublin City.  I am not a member for the city, but I think the demonstrations that took place during the summer and the situation as it is in the city in the matter of unemployment are of concern to every Deputy.  In recent weeks, there has been an attempt, successful, in some degree, to provide additional employment, but I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary now if it is not a fact that the money being provided to give employment in the city is part of the money which these men would have received in the ordinary course, money which is being made available a few weeks or months in advance of the time at which it would ordinarily be made available.</P>
    <P>No matter what any Dublin Deputy or the Parliamentary Secretary may say, in this Vote there are no additional <Col N="505" /> moneys for the provision of additional employment in the city.  The Fianna Fáil or Independent Deputies may have had a private assurance from the Minister for Finance or the Government that £1,000,000 would be made available for the provision of employment, but so far as we can see from the Book of Estimates, there is no evidence of any such provision, unless, as I say, there is some private arrangement between the Dublin Fianna Fáil Deputies and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned last night that there was a sum of £57,000 to be advanced to Dublin for the provision of work in the form of relief schemes.  A sum of £57,000, while it might seem a very large amount, will not give the amount of employment that is required, especially in the winter months.  It might seem big, but it will not relieve the unemployment situation in the city to any great extent.  If there is any hope in the setting up, as has been suggested, by the Government of a national development fund for the doing of national work, and incidentally the provision of employment, it will be all to the good, but I am afraid that this national development fund is just the Transition Development Fund, which was very good in itself, with a different name.  We can only wait and see what the Government proposals in this regard are, but, so far as the Labour Party are concerned, the National Development Fund Bill will receive a warm welcome, if it is a Bill which will provide a sum of money annually to meet extraordinary situations of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The larger towns are very disappointed that the amount to be spent under sub-head F&mdash;Urban Employment Schemes&mdash;is £34,000 less than last year.  We have an instance in the town of Wexford, where unemployment is greater than it was last year&mdash; in fact, greater than it has been for a number of years&mdash;that the relief schemes grant is less than it was last year.  That seems a rather funny situation, remembering, as I said at the beginning, that this Vote was originally intended to meet unusual <Col N="506" /> situations in regard to unemployment.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by telling the Parliamentary Secretary that he and his chief, the Minister for Finance, should be ever ready to come into this House to ask for more money under this particular Vote.  As it is, we have this £685,000 or £700,000 spent year after year just as a matter of course. The expenditure is no more or no less in any particular month of the year.  If there is an extraordinary unemployment situation, so far as building, for instance, is concerned, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary should ask this House to provide for the workers in that industry during the period of unemployment.  The original intention underlying the Vote was that the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary should come into the House and ask to be given more money to provide work for the people unemployed.  The tragedy of the situation is that when men find themselves unemployed for a matter of two, three or four weeks, their first reaction is to emigrate to Britain to find employment there.</P>
    <P>The further tragedy is that when they go to Britain and get employment there, they are wont to stay there and, after they have been in a job for some time, to send for their wives and families.  We in this country do not seem to be concerned at all about people who are forced to emigrate to Britain because of unemployment here; yet if we want money for several other things we always seem to be able to provide it.</P>
    <P>When we want money to boost the tourist industry&mdash;I am not objecting to that&mdash;we seem to be able to get it in this House in a matter of minutes. Similarly, when we want money to do certain things for the horse-breeding industry we can get as much as £250,000 for the mere asking of it. When we want to increase salaries in a particular direction we can also get it but when it is a matter of providing money for the relief of those who are unemployed, the cry of the majority of Deputies in this House is: &ldquo;We cannot afford it.&rdquo;  We should remember that while these schemes are called relief schemes, and whilst the original intention was to provide work for certain <Col N="507" /> classes during periods of unemployment, the money so provided can be utilised on many useful schemes which would build up the country.  If bog roads, county roads or any type of road can be constructed or put into repair, I suggest that any money this House votes to promote schemes of that kind will be money voted in the right direction and it will have the additional merit of providing employment for those in need of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suppose that very much more can be said in connection with this Estimate as practically everything that could be referred to has been already dealt with by previous speakers.  The two most disappointing and unsatisfactory features of this Estimate are the reduction in the Urban Employment Schemes Vote of £34,000 and in the Vote for the development of bog roads of £20,000. I have no idea how many urban areas would qualify for an urban unemployment scheme, but I have in mind the one urban area in my own constituency, Killarney, where there are no industries and where during the winter months there is always a great deal of unemployment.  Up to the present, there had always been a pretty generous grant for that urban area.  In fact, people had come to look at it as, and to call it, a Christmas grant.</P>
      <P>One would also have expected an increase in the Vote for bog development because in those areas where turf generating stations are to be erected, for a few years before these come into operation I think everything possible should be done to ensure that good roads will be made into bogs likely to be developed by private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall that Deputy Cowan yesterday said that money had been voted for the development of bog roads for the past 30 years and he asked how was it the work had not been done. Anybody who understands the situation with regard to bog roads knows that roads already made will always require repairs.  In these days especially, when people as a rule transport turf from the bogs in lorries <Col N="508" /> and by means of tractors and trailers, bog roads are likely to fall into a state of disrepair very quickly. In fact, I think the great mistake that the employment schemes section make is that they do not, before these roads become very bad, make provision for voting a certain sum for their repair. The same remarks would apply to roads repaired under the minor employment scheme.  As a rule the money voted is not sufficient to complete the work.  Some people will say that even though the engineers actually recommend a sum that should complete the work and place the roads in a fairly decent condition, the men employed on the schemes do not exert themselves to any great extent in order that the work may be completed. Be that as it may, it is only right that when certain money is voted for the repair of roads under the minor employment scheme, if the road is not completed in any one year, a further sum should be voted in the succeeding year to complete the work.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that in certain areas large sums of money had been allocated for the repair of roads, steamrolling and so forth.  While such work will give a good deal of employment in a particular area, it must not be forgotten that roads running into pockets or through townlands also deserve to be remembered and a generous grant should be allocated for the repair of these.  While minor employment schemes will help to give temporary employment during a certain period of the winter to the unemployed, I do not think that the scheme as a whole has ever been a great success because the work is not carried out with the efficiency with which it should be. The people employed seem to be under the impression that the money is simply voted to be drawn by them and they do as little work as possible.  The engineers and the gangers employed should see to it that the men give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>That must be confined to Kerry; it is not general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking from my own experience.  That would be much <Col N="509" /> better not only for the men themselves but for the carrying out of the necessary repairs to these roads.  In the rural improvements scheme section, good work has always been done. When these roads have been put in a proper state of repair it is a pity that after two or three years a further sum is not granted so as to redress or resurface them or to open drains to take off the water.  When roads are put in repair in that way there should be some provision by which the county council would take over and be responsible for their future repair, especially roads serving townlands with five, six or more inhabitants.</P>
      <P>Then there are farmers living in places where they have to cross a river or even rivers to get to their homes.  Just because there is only one house in the place the Special Employment Schemes Office are not empowered to erect a bridge.  It was rather strange that when these estates were being purchased some sum was not retained from the purchase money to erect bridges in such cases.  There are about 50 such cases in my own constituency.  Sometimes when these farmers go to a fair or market or to church, or on some other business in the morning, when they return later they cannot reach their own homes because of floods.  Some provision should be made by which money would be allocated for the erection of bridges in such cases, even on the condition that the person concerned would have to contribute a generous portion of the cost.  I am sure that such people would be willing to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the experience of the Special Employment Schemes Office, I am sure, that when money is devoted to minor relief schemes or rural improvement schemes trouble arises sometimes in connection with the appointment of gangers.  It might be a question of a political dispute or neighbours not being good friends.  It frequently happens in such cases that the grant is lost.  When a local person is appointed ganger, if some of those through whose lands the road runs or persons who are to be employed on the work are dissatisfied with the ganger appointed, the engineer of the Office <Col N="510" /> of Public Works should have full authority to bring in a ganger from an outside area, in other words bring in a stranger.  In fact, it would not be a bad idea if that were done in all cases because, no matter what my friend, Deputy Murphy, may say, I think that a ganger from outside the area would see that better work would be done.</P>
    <P>On the whole, I am sure the Special Employment Schemes Office do their best to allocate the money as generously as possible in the different electoral areas.  I think, however, it was Deputy Blowick who referred last night to the fact that unless there is a certain number of unemployed in a particular electoral district, ten, 12, 15 or 16, whatever the number is, no free grant can be allocated in such a case.</P>
    <P>That is scarcely fair to the district. It would be well if the office would consider in that case joining two electoral areas together and making an extra allocation to provide for those unemployed in the electoral district where there is not a sufficient number to qualify for a minor employment scheme grant.  In that case I am sure that they would all be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that at all times when approaching the Office of Public Works I personally, and I am sure all Deputies can say the same, have been always received with the greatest courtesy and that the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials have always tried to do their best to meet our demands, which of course are not always capable of being met in the way we would like.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is generally agreed by all Deputies that the money expended under this Vote is usefully employed and that the benefits conferred would compare favourably with the results obtained from money expended under any other schemes that come before this House. The Parliamentary Secretary, when replying to the debate on Votes 8 and 9 last night, mentioned that it was very easy for Deputies to come into this House and agitate for different kinds of schemes which would entail additional expenditure.  Everyone agrees <Col N="511" /> with the Parliamentary Secretary in that.  The cost of any extra works that are provided or any additional services made available to the people is bound to be borne by public funds and the money must come from the people's pockets.  However, I think that the Parliamentary Secretary has carried that attitude a little too far. He has a rather conservative outlook and I believe his only fault is that he is entirely too soft for the job he holds. It would be quite in order and possibly admirable for all concerned if his colleagues on the front bench held the same view.  I have the feeling that the Parliamentary Secretary is afraid to expend any extra money under this Vote, while his colleagues are not afraid wantonly to waste public money on many other proposals which they have brought before this House.</P>
      <P>During the course of the discussion on this Vote 12 months ago, I advised the Parliamentary Secretary as strongly as I possibly could to increase the allocations under the Vote in the present year.  The result, however, is quite the opposite.  Not only is there no increase being made but, as pointed out by previous speakers, there is a fairly substantial reduction&mdash;almost one sixth of last year's Vote.</P>
      <P>There is no need to dwell upon the many benefits which accrue from the schemes carried out under the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote.  They confer a dual benefit on the people.  Not only are they beneficial to many farmers, particularly small farmers living in rather remote areas, but they give to the workers in rural districts an opportunity of productive employment.  That being the case, surely to Heavens there is a stronger claim for more money out of the vast amount of money it takes to administer the affairs of this country?  We are spending over £100,000,000 this year&mdash; £101,000,000 to be exact&mdash;and we are getting an additional sum by way of loan of £25,000,000.  In other words, we are supposed to have approximately £130,000,000 available for use.  Out of that huge sum, only £600,000 is made available under this heading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary, outlining the <Col N="512" /> Vote, was most disappointing and that the people who have made applications for these schemes will be very disappointed.  Similarly, workers throughout the country, who are expecting some improvement in this scheme for the forthcoming year, will be equally disappointed.  The amount is entirely inadequate and the Parliamentary Secretary himself will see that even in respect of any scheme approved during this present month of October there is not one penny available for the implementation of it.  I think there is not.  That is a scandalous state of affairs.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy who approaches the Parliamentary Secretary's Office, say, from September onwards, is told that, irrespective of whether the scheme is approved or not, it must wait over until next year before it can be implemented, that there is no money available.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I regard him as one of the most decent gentlemen in this House&mdash;has completely failed in his obligation as being the man in charge of the Office of Public Works and the Special Employments Schemes Office. He should have made the case much clearer than he did to the Government and he should have got from them, if they value his advice or recommendations in any way, at least three times the amount of money that is required in this Vote.  I think it is due to the fact that the money is made available in a very niggardly fashion that we have an increased number of a certain type of letter sent out covering contributory schemes and even contributory rural improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>I have here the type of letter which is going around the country now, from one end of it to the other in greater numbers than before.  Before I read this note, I should say I agree that it would be entirely out of place for any Government Department wantonly to waste public funds, but I do not think that arises in connection with many of these works.  Here is what is sent out to applicants:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am to refer to your application under the above scheme for a grant towards the cost of a particular work and to say we have had the <Col N="513" /> proposal inspected.  I am to inform you, however, that the cost of carrying out a certain work would be too high in relation to the utility which would be afforded and in the circumstances we regret that we must regard the work as unsuitable to be undertaken by us.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I claim that that type of letter is being used much more extensively now than it was when Deputy Donnellan was in charge of the Board of Works. It must be because there is no money available and because the Special Employments Schemes Office is failing in its duty completely.</P>
    <P>I had one case in my particular area where 14 families in the Berehaven Peninsula would benefit by a certain work costing in or around £400.  This work was the development of a bog road and I believe also there was some drainage work involved.  The bog could be utilised by 14 families in the particular district.  The Special Employments Schemes Office has the same opinion of that type of work benefiting 14 families as they have of this particular work I have mentioned. I should like to get the figures as to how many of these letters have been sent out during the first six months of this year and how many were sent out in previous years.</P>
    <P>Another important question in dealing with particular schemes, such as bog development schemes, concerns the system by which it is ascertained that a particular work warrants a 100 per cent. grant.  I have had the experience of seeing two applications being made for two particular works, side by side, to the Special Employments Schemes Office.  In one case, where the work was of little or no use, a 100 per cent.  grant was made available. There was little or no general public utility involved.  In fact, it could be truthfully stated that that couple of hundred pounds which was definitely made available for that particular work would only benefit one single individual for the improvement of the bog where he was cutting his turf.  On the other hand you had a work of general importance, benefiting several people, which was turned down <Col N="514" /> or at least rejected, as a minor employment scheme and the beneficiaries were asked to make a contribution. That may be reasonable enough but I maintain that such a state of affairs should not exist.  I put this case before the Special Employments Schemes Office and it was agreed by the office that this work for which a 100 per cent. grant was made available was a work of little or no value. Whose responsibility is that?</P>
    <P>I understand that when application is made for a particular work the names of beneficiaries are attached to the application forms and that each of these people has to be approached by the responsible officer of the Special Employments Schemes Office with a view to ascertaining what benefits this particular work, if carried out, would give them.  In the case I have mentioned four of these people, who, it was alleged, by the Special Employments Schemes Office would benefit from this work, informed me that not only would it be of no benefit but it would be detrimental to their interests.  I asked them if they were approached by any responsible officer or supervisor and they said they had never heard of the matter.  To 30, Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, at the same time a form was sent by some responsible officer of the Board of Works telling that office that this work would be of first rate benefit to these people, though they knew nothing good, bad or indifferent about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy mind giving us the specific case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already given the specific instance to your office.  As a result of my representations, I believe an inspector of the Department visited the area and ascertained that the information which I gave him was completely and entirely exact.  So much so that the money which was made available and which had been sent out for the implementation of the particular scheme was cut out.  I have given full particulars to the responsible officers in the Parliamentary Secretary's Department of that case.  I think it is unfair and unjust that that should happen.  That <Col N="515" /> is only one case, but it is a clear-cut illustration of how the Special Employments Schemes Office works.  I think that should not happen.  I have already given the Parliamentary Secretary full particulars of that type of case.  I am afraid that, at least in the constituency of West Cork, there are several more cases of that type.</P>
      <P>I would like to know what authority any representative of the Special Employments Schemes Office has for making a written declaration to the director of the office that a particular scheme would benefit people when the people themselves claim, and rightly so, that it would be detrimental to their interests?  I think that is a glaring scandal and that I would be failing in my duty if I did not bring it to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary and to the notice of the Deputies in this House.  It will bear investigation any day.</P>
      <P>Another item mentioned by Deputy Palmer was the selection of gangers. We have little cause for complaint in West Cork so far as the selection of gangers is concerned.  The system has now been changed, so that instead of the Special Employments Schemes Office carrying out these works through the local council they will in future be carried out direct by the office itself.  That may mean that the gangers who have been operating on these schemes may not now be employed by the office.  Heretofore they were directly employed by the county engineer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to rural improvement schemes the position that obtained in my area, so far as the employment of gangers on them was concerned, was an admirable one.  It is only natural that the beneficiaries who have to pay contributions for the works done would be anxious to get the best ganger possible and should make representations to the county engineer for a particular ganger who, in their opinion, would give the best results.  I must say that in connection with this matter we are very fortunate in West Cork, because all our gangers were first-class men.  However, the engineer <Col N="516" /> accepted the recommendations made to him and gave the beneficiaries the choice of ganger if that could be arranged at all.  The result was that everything went on smoothly.</P>
    <P>Now that the system is being changed, I should like to know what method will be employed by the Special Employment Schemes Office for the employment of gangers.  The county engineers in the different counties will not, I understand, have anything to say to that in the future. I hope that those gangers will be employed on their merits, on their qualifications to supervise and carry out work and on getting the maximum output possible.  I sincerely hope that they will be appointed on those grounds and not because of political qualifications.  We have too much of this business in this country of people of different political views and public representatives trying to get positions for some of their own particular friends for which, possibly, they have no qualifications at all.  I think that, now that the Special Employment Schemes Office is about to select gangers in the different parts of the country, it will select men who will give satisfaction to its engineers and to the beneficiaries.  If the office does not adopt that course, then there will be many complaints from the beneficiaries who probably will be paying substantial sums by way of contributions for the particular works carried out with the feeling that they are not getting value for the money they have paid towards the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Another item which, owing to widespread unemployment, gives rise for complaint is the recruitment of men for work carried out by the Parliamentary Secretary's office.  It is a very difficult job, particularly in many areas where you have a substantial number of unemployed men. For instance, in several districts you have, for every man that will be needed on the job, five or six applicants, all of them, possibly, equally deserving.  I think that the best method of avoiding the bitterness which, unfortunately, has arisen in a few cases amongst workers and local people, <Col N="517" /> would be to apply the rotational system.  I think that would meet the requirements of the case.  I would direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to this, that where, say, a scheme is to be implemented in a particular district, nine or ten workers may be required for the operation of it, but in fact you may have 30 or 40 applicants seeking employment on the scheme and all are equally deserving.  The work to be done may not call for any exceptional skill. Therefore, I think that the rotational system would be the best to apply in a case of that kind.  It would avoid any bitterness or differences amongst workers and the local people.</P>
    <P>There is another small item that I should like to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary.  The position is one that may be fairly difficult to meet.  I refer to the case of many poor applicants who would like to avail of some particular scheme.  They are unable to do so, however, by reason of the fact that they are not able to make up the local contribution.  So far as those small farmers and other people are concerned, they have no objection whatever to the making of a contribution for a scheme which may be a very admirable one.  The contribution is relatively small in proportion to the cost of the work but there are many in my constituency who, in connection with schemes of that kind, would like very much if the Department could devise a system whereby it would accept work from them on the scheme in lieu of the payment of money.  I have the idea that such an arrangement could be made with very little difficulty.  The cost of the work would, say, be £400 and the contribution £30.  If the Department would accept work from the beneficiaries of the scheme until they had paid the contribution in that way it would, in my opinion, be a very good thing.  If the Department could devise a scheme of that kind the Special Employments Schemes Office could not lose on it, because if the beneficiaries failed to honour their obligations then the office could close down the scheme.  I do not think that situation would ever arise.  I am <Col N="518" /> aware, of course, that there may be some difficulty in implementing a system of that kind but the fact is that in many instances these poor people find it very difficult to get together a contribution of £35, £40, and in some cases £50.  Instead of making a contribution in cash they would be prepared to give their labour free and make up the contribution in that way.</P>
    <P>In connection with these schemes it had always been the aim until quite recently&mdash;I hope we will return to that system in the future&mdash;for contributors to get first preference in employment for the supply of materials.  That is not the position at present.  In connection with a number of schemes recently, the position has been that, instead of the local people who contribute to the scheme getting employment in carting the material required for the scheme, the material is brought over a distance of many miles by county council lorries.  The haulage of that material costs a lot.  It eats up a lot of the money allocated for the scheme, and, in my opinion, it is not the best way of carrying out the job.</P>
    <P>I want to express disappointment at the inadequacy of the amount of money that is being made available. I think, however, it would be unfair of me if I did not convey to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the people in charge of the Special Employments Schemes Office the gratitude of the many beneficiaries in my constituency.  The number of people who availed of the rural improvement schemes are also very satisfied with the return which they got from the Special Employments Schemes Office. They appreciate very much the work that has been carried out.  Unlike Deputy Palmer, I have no complaint to make.  I can say that in all cases, without exception, the people were more than satisfied with the output given in connection with the different schemes.  I have never yet heard, in West Cork, at any rate, complaints being made by people who got grants from the Special Employments Schemes Office.</P>
    <P>I would like to put this matter before the Parliamentary Secretary, <Col N="519" /> which arises all over the country.  We have, unfortunately, the position in Ireland that a number of people may be living along a small road or boreen and for some reason or another there may be a tenant who is not agreeable. Before, one such person could hold up a particular job if he was a rather spiteful person or if he had some illfeeling or ill-will against the other users of the road, he could object to facilitating the Special Employments Schemes Office and could hold up work for an indefinite period.  I think it was the former Parliamentary Secretary who made some move to rectify that position so that if two-thirds of the beneficiaries were willing to avail of the work the objections of the others would not be sustainable.</P>
    <P>That may be the case so far as the rural improvements schemes are concerned but I would like to know what is the position in regard to minor employment schemes.  I believe if you had 15 people benefiting by a minor employment scheme and one person who would not benefit but had land adjoining objected, he could get the whole scheme deferred.  Where objections are made to the implementation of schemes by a particular individual he should be asked to state clearly and definitely why he is objecting and what adverse effect the particular work would have on his holding if it was carried out.</P>
    <P>I regret very much to say it is my opinion, and I feel sure the opinion of many other Deputies, that these objections mainly arise from spiteful motives, because I cannot see how if a particular road was improved it could have any adverse effect on people surrounding it.  These people should be asked to put their cards on the table and to state clearly that they are objecting and if those objections are deemed frivolous or unsustainable by the responsible officers of the Department, that work should go ahead regardless of what they think.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on the same note as Deputy Corish by asking the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this whole position so far as the sums of <Col N="520" /> money allocated are concerned.  I hope that when he is bringing his Estimate into this House for the coming year it will be much more substantial than the present one, and I think he would have the blessing of this House if he were to bring in a Supplementary Estimate for the current year.  I feel sure it would meet with no objection.</P>

      <P>We in the Dublin Corporation have provided schemes with a high labour content and there are further schemes that could be carried out.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to introduce Supplementary Estimates to meet the schemes we hope to put forward.  We are anxious to put as many men to work as possible and we in Dublin should be treated in a special manner.  We do not want to see people walking the streets of Dublin and I think any effort we make should get the wholehearted support of every Deputy here, including Deputy McQuillan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards my own constituency I must say the schemes carried out there &mdash;in Glasnevin especially&mdash;are appreciated by the residents.  There were some laneways and footpaths in the Glasnevin district which were a disgrace to the country and money was spent on making improvements.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to assure us that there would be no hold-up in the provision of money for the schemes we propose.  I must say that in regard to any schemes we suggested the Department of Local Government have wiped out a great deal of red tape which we usually find in the Custom House.  The Department of Local Government and the Department of Finance have met us in this respect and we are grateful for it.  Every member in the Dublin Corporation from all Parties is concerned in this and I think it should be the same with this House.  No scheme that we put forward should be knocked down for the want of money.  Our main concern is to do things in the city which should have been done <Col N="523" /> many years ago.  We are not going to put up any wild schemes; they are sensible schemes.  We have good technical officers and they went to a great deal of trouble in regard to these schemes which are for the benefit of the citizens.  The citizens pay their rates promptly and it is about time, since there is a question of unemployment, that these men should be put to useful work.</P>
    <P>Our technical officers in the corporation are working hard at the moment with plans and they will be submitted in due course.  The Dublin Corporation will do its best to see that the unemployment problem is solved to the best of their ability.  There was some talk last night about public parks and the planting of trees.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House very long.  I just want to sum up.  The Government has made an announcement with regard to relief in certain types of cases, resulting in remission of rates arising on valuations on new buildings, business premises and factory buildings, and also on reconstruction of ordinary premises, including dwelling-houses.  In my opinion, that will satisfy the situation for the present, until such time as the Government can conclude its survey and can come into the House with a comprehensive Bill for the purpose of revaluing the whole country, with particular consideration for the City of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to say that the Private Bill that has been introduced would, if it were accepted, only cause a great deal of controversy and misunderstanding, <Col N="524" /> winding up possibly in a great number of cases having to go to the law courts for decision.  I hope that the Bill which I envisage the Government will be bringing in will be simple, that it will be a measure permitting of understanding by everybody of its contents, which will avoid costly litigation, trying to sort out and settle differences between rating authorities and occupiers of premises.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when this was discussed, on Wednesday evening, I said that as far as the City of Dublin is concerned the whole situation has changed.  Areas which were on the outskirts in non-built-up areas had structures and buildings on a valuation basis in accordance with the then situation of those premises.  To-day they are the centre of an extended city area and should in many cases be revalued for higher ratepaying so as to bring about a more equitable position between occupiers of business premises, factories and houses, than exists at present.</P>
    <P>No one can say&mdash;and I think Deputy Morrissey, who will follow me, will agree&mdash;that the present distribution of the burden is on an equitable basis. He himself would be the first, I am sure, to agree that there are certain buildings undervalued and others overvalued and that some proper basis should be laid down.  I say to the Minister that when he is considering the Bill which I hope he will bring in with regard to the reconstruction of premises, there should be a formula. Possibly where additions are made the additions should be in relation to the extra cubic capacity added as compared with the whole structure to which it is added, and the increased valuation or the increased rates payable should bear some relation to the original figure and not as presently applied, where sometimes the Valuation Office appears to be taking an opportunity to clap on to a building a penal increase rather than a just increase.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am not impressed by the Private Bill which is being brought in. There is some suggestion that the announcement by the Government was <Col N="525" /> a panic announcement resulting from the introduction of this Bill.  I can assure those who are promoting this Bill that I myself was one of those who had been discussing this for some considerable time.  I think Deputy Alfred Byrne himself knows that this matter was discussed by us in the corporation many months before this Bill was introduced.  We all felt that we had to find ways and means of bringing about relief of unemployment by making it possible and attractive to people to build new properties or improve existing ones.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I cannot get away from the statement made by Deputy O'Higgins that this particular need only came to his notice as a result of the impact on the ratepayers resulting from the introduction of the rules and regulations in connection with the hygiene part of the previous Health Act.  I say again that if any Cabinet agreed to bring in new regulations they should have known then what the results would be by way of additional imposts on people who would have to fulfil directions in making premises suitable for the sale of food and so forth.  They should have known and should have made the announcement then and there that is now suggested in this particular Private Members' Bill.</P>

      <P>I thought Deputy O'Higgins, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, made fairly clear its contents and what it purported to do, but in view of Deputy Briscoe's speech it seems that he must not have got it fully across.  This is a simple Bill, which proposes, first, that existing premises, where there are no improvements, alterations or additions carried out, shall not be increased beyond their present valuation.  A great number of people outside the House, and I think a great many members of the House, are not aware, or were not aware up to now, that the valuation of a premises, even though that valuation has been standing for 30, 40 or 50 years, can be increased, can&mdash;as has happened, and I can give examples&mdash;be doubled or more than doubled, without the owner of those <Col N="526" /> premises spending a shilling on them by way of improvement or reconstruction or addition to them.  In fact, without the revaluation which Deputy Briscoe talks about, it is well known and ought to be well known to Deputies from various parts of the country and from cities outside Dublin that there is a process of revaluation going on all the time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey is entitled to make his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given Deputy Briscoe a very fair offer.  I am prepared to give him the names and addresses, and indeed there are colleagues of his sitting behind him who can give him that information too. <Col N="527" /> There is no use trying to say that that is not so.  The first operative section of this Bill&mdash;Section 2, I think&mdash;says in effect that where there are no improvements carried out, no alterations, no additions, the existing valuation shall not be increased.  That is all it says and I do not think any member of the House will find fault with that. I know the Minister has something in mind.  I know the reason he had the biggest gallery of officers seen for a long time here on Wednesday night, and I will deal with that when I come to it and the reason for it.</P>
      <P>The next section is where improvements or additions or structural alterations to the premises are carried out and the premises are revalued. The section says that they shall be revalued only in respect of the actual improvements carried out to the premises and that the valuation people will not take the opportunity to revalue the whole of the premises, and that when they are revalued in respect of the new work that additional revaluation shall not become operative for a period of seven years.</P>
      <P>The next point is that dealing with farm buildings as distinct from farm dwelling-houses.  It is admitted that where a farmer erects a new farm building, whether a piggery or a barn or whatever it may be, that is already covered in one of the old Acts.  But he is not covered where he builds an addition to an existing farm building or where he improves it or puts an additional storey on it or a new roof on it.  Not only are the valuation people entitled to come in and revalue those farm buildings in respect of those improvements but they actually have done and are doing it.  That is, of course, incontrovertible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That deals with the three main points in this Bill.  I would like to correct a misapprehension of Deputy Norton's.  Deputy Norton, speaking on Wednesday night, said that the only thing in the Bill with which he found fault was that it had not a section in it to cover ordinary dwelling-houses where there was an addition to or an improvement in an ordinary dwelling-house.  That is not necessary <Col N="528" /> because that case is already covered under the Remission of Rates Act and we are dealing here only with premises which are not covered and which are suffering.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe's sole contribution and his solution for the problem in the City of Dublin, he says, is that the whole of the City of Dublin should be revalued and the valuations brought up to and in accordance with present day standards of value.  How many Deputies in the City of Dublin are prepared to subscribe to that solution of Deputy Briscoe's?  Do we not all know what would happen if the whole City of Dublin were revalued to-morrow?  The whole city from the smallest house to the largest premises would be revalued upwards and very much upwards.  There is no question whatever about that.  That is not the solution.  That would not remove the anomalies which Deputy Briscoe says exist to-day in respect of valuations in the city.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this in a sensible way and try to see how absolutely absurdly we are all acting in relation to this matter.  In the interests of public health we are exhorting people from dairymen to shopkeepers to improve their houses in respect of the dairying industry, to modernise them at very considerable cost.  They are doing that as far as they can afford it but instead of getting any incentive to do so or being encouraged to do so, immediately a man does that he is revalued and he is penalised heavily for carrying out something which he is told is in the national interest and in the interest of public health and pure food.  That is one side of it.</P>
    <P>How many hundreds of thousands of pounds have we spent over the years, and particularly in recent years, in trying to encourage the tourist industry in this country?  Has not the present Government and every other Government, members of county councils, the Tourist Association which had its annual meeting yesterday, the Tourist Board, Fogra Fáilte which got £250,000 last year for publicity&mdash;has not everybody been exhorting every shopkeeper, restaurant <Col N="529" /> keeper, hotel keeper and guest-house keeper in this country to improve their premises and to provide to the fullest possible extent modern amenities so that we can take the fullest advantage of what is undoubtedly a very valuable portion of our economic life, the tourist industry? But what happened?  Somebody in Dún Laoghaire, Cobh, Crosshaven, or Bundoran or Kilkee or somewhere like that decides they will turn over a large private house and keep a number of guests.  Suppose they do not even spend 1/- on it.  Suppose it does not require any additional outlay to enable them to keep guests.  The mere fact that they turn it into a guest-house brings their valuation up automatically.</P>
    <P>Supposing somebody has an old-fashioned bad hotel, out-of date, with possibly one bathroom, if there is even one, with probably not a wash-hand basin in one room in the house, and probably one lavatory for the whole house, and they decide&mdash;in many cases by going into debt in the bank if they can get the money in the bank&mdash;to try to carry out improvements and to have either a guest-house or a hotel to which we can without any shame and with a certain amount of pride invite foreigners to come and stay and spend their money.</P>
    <P>The very minute he puts a porch in front of the door, the very minute he puts in a bathroom, the very minute he puts in a second lavatory, the very minute he puts in a wash-hand basin in the cloakroom, down come the valuation people and that man, whom we are exhorting to do all this in the national interest as well as in his own interest, is penalised and has to pay through the nose for the work he has done.  Is it not crazy?  But, to make it still more crazy, we now announce &mdash;mark you, I agree with it&mdash;that we will give every facility we can afford to people who cater for tourists, we will give them loans to carry out the type of improvements to which I have referred.  But, immediately they carry out those improvements, they will be penalised.  There is not a Deputy here&mdash;I do not care from what part of the country he comes&mdash;who does not <Col N="530" /> know as well as I do that there are great numbers of people, not merely business people, hotel proprietors or guest-house owners, but ordinary people who would like to improve their houses and their premises, and would improve them, but they are afraid to do so because of the penalty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe challenged me a while ago because of something I said. Let me give him a case now, not entirely on a par with what I was talking about but one of which I have personal knowledge.  A few years ago the back wall of an old, small licensed premises in this city was condemned by the corporation.  The owner was told he would have to rebuild the back wall.  He proceeded to do so.  His house was so small he could not put an additional lavatory inside the four walls and he decided to take advantage of the fact that the back wall was being re-erected to do what we see all over the country, namely, put a small abutment jutting out from the back wall.  What happened?  His valuation, before the corporation compelled him to build the back wall, was £70.  When the back wall was built it was exactly doubled.  His valuation to-day is £140.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with a particular aspect of all this.  Remember, this is why the Minister for Finance is sitting over there and not the Minister for Local Government.  Remember that when the valuation of a house is increased that does not mean only an increase in the rates.  Remember, so far as a licensed premises is concerned, it means an increase in the rates; it means an increase in the licence duty; it means, if the owner is on a valuation charge from the E.S.B., an increase in his E.S.B. charges.  Above all, do not forget, and this is the reason why we had the big gallery here on Wednesday evening and the reason why we have some prominent officers out of the Minister's Department here to-day and the reason why we have the Minister himself here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not require any lessons from the Minister for Finance in good taste, good conduct or good manners.  May I say, with respect to the Chair, that the Chair's interference is only called for if I name an official?  I have not named an official. I am not naming any official.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair says that is disorderly, I withdraw.  May I be allowed to say, in fairness to myself, that there was no thought further from my mind than any disrespect to the officials, and I think the officials themselves probably know that?  The Minister knows quite well the point I intend to make.  Do not forget that when the valuation goes up the famous five-fourths, which the present Minister for Finance was responsible for putting on the Statute Book of this country, comes into operation and one pays one's income-tax on one's house, not on the full valuation but on five-fourths of the valuation.  Therefore, one's rates go up; one's income-tax goes up; one's licence duty goes up and, if one is on a valuation charge, one's E.S.B. charges go up.  That is the reason why we have the Minister for Finance sitting over there and not the Minister for Local Government. All that has been a cause of very great hardship on many citizens.  It has been a complete deterrent in great numbers of cases against people carrying out improvements to their property and, incidentally, giving useful employment. Not a shopkeeper to-day will replace his old three-pane or four-pane window <Col N="532" /> with modern plate glass because his valuation will be increased.</P>
      <P>These are statements of fact.  They cannot be challenged.  They cannot be controverted.  I am not blaming the Valuation Office.  I am not blaming the rate collectors.  I am not blaming the local authorities.  The law is there and they must carry out the law.  That is their duty.  It is our duty, I submit, if we see that the law in its administration is causing hardship and retarding necessary and essential improvements, to change that law.</P>
      <P>I do not want to labour this but, putting it mildly, it is absurd to talk about the tourist trade, about improving our hotels, our guest-houses and our amenities in the holiday resorts, to tell the people at Tourist Association annual meetings and through the Tourist Board and Fogra Fáilte that we are prepared to give them every encouragement when, in fact, we are penalising them for carrying out what are admitted to be improvements, not only in their own interests and for their own benefit but in the interests of and for the benefit of the country as a whole ultimately.</P>
      <P>I do not presume for one moment to know any more about this matter than any other member of this House. Every statement I have made so far could be made by any other member of this House from his own experience in his own part of the country.  There is no question about that.</P>
      <P>The administration of this valuation code, particularly in relation to what we are trying to cover in this Bill, would be harsh even in normal times and would place a very heavy burden on very many people.  With the very high level of rates to-day, when rates are running from 25/- to 35/-, and in extreme cases to 40/- in the £, and when the whole tendency, despite anything that can be done by the local authorities or their officials, is towards ever-increasing rates, surely that is something likely to place an intolerable burden on our people.  In any case there can be no question whatever that it is a complete deterrent against improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> Deputy Norton has already dealt with one very important aspect. From the point of view of providing work, additional work could be provided in this country almost immediately if this fear were removed from the minds of our people, and an important employment potential would be created throughout the country. There is no doubt that in the improvement of these business houses, private dwelling, farm buildings, and so on, we are and would be creating a very valuable national asset apart altogether from increasing the market value of the citizen's property.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Briscoe talking about the Bill which the Government propose to introduce.  So far as I am personally concerned, I do not give a hoot who gives this relief, if it is given. I would prefer to hear the Government saying here and now: &ldquo;Very well, we will take over this Bill or we will introduce a measure that will give the reliefs that you are talking about here.&rdquo;  I and my colleagues, Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Sweetman, would be prepared to withdraw the Bill immediately.</P>

      <P>If I wanted to play the usual game I could prolong this debate for quite a long time.  I could have come here this morning fully furnished, not with one example but perhaps with 500 examples.  I suppose I am in a position to get more information on matters concerning valuation than the average Deputy.  There are other Deputies who can get as much and maybe even more than I can but I could illustrate what I have been saying with example after example from all parts of the country as well as from this city.</P>
      <P>When I was interrupted by the Minister I was saying that if the Minister was prepared to give an undertaking that the proposed Government measure would contain, amongst other things, the bare essential safeguards which are in this Bill, we would be quite ready to withdraw the Bill.  We cannot withdraw this Bill unless we get some sort of statement to that effect from the Minister or until such time as we see the Government Bill. So far as statements regarding the Government's intentions in regard to this matter have been made by the Taoiseach or by the Minister for Local Government, their proposals will not go even half way to meet the points which we think it is essential, in fairness to the citizens, to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the Minister&mdash;he probably will not believe me but it is true&mdash;that I am not concerned as to who brings the changes about.  I do not care two hoots who gets the credit for it, if it is done.  I am prepared and my colleagues who are associated with me in the preparation and moving of this Bill are prepared to discuss the matter either in the House or with the Minister and any of his colleagues outside the House.  I do not mind.  All that I and my colleagues are concerned with is to get what we think is bare justice in relation to the operation of the existing <Col N="537" /> valuation laws.  So that there cannot be any doubt left in anybody's mind and that nobody can at least successfully twist or misrepresent what I have said so far I want to reiterate what I said.  In anything which I have said or anything which my colleague, Deputy O'Higgins, has said, or in this Bill, there is no reflection, nor is there any reflection intended, against either the Valuation Office or its personnel or any local authority or any rate collector.  What I say is that they are only doing their duty carrying out the law as we allowed the law to remain, and they cannot change their actions, their efforts and their line in relation to valuations until such time as we change the law.  All we are asking, and we are entitled to ask it, is that the House would consider this private Bill on its merits.  All I ask the Minister to do is to consider it on its merits and to speak to it, either for it or against it, on its merits.</P>
    <P>I think that any member or members of this House who go to the trouble, whether it is little or not, of preparing and presenting to this House a private Bill whether it is well-drafted or otherwise dealing with a matter which affects so many citizens are to be commended rather than to be abused.  I am not so sure that this would not be a better House if we had more private Bills introduced by private members from any side of the House dealing with matters of which perhaps they have more knowledge even than the members of the Government because very often by force of circumstances they are closer down to what is really happening than any Minister can be.  That is the position in a nutshell.  We only ask to have this Bill dealt with on its merits for itself and if it is given effect to either through this Bill or through a Bill introduced by the Government we will be perfectly satisfied.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey is one of those Deputies who thinks that, when he is short of arguments, bluster will enable him to bulldoze those who venture to criticise proposals with which he is associated.  He is the one Deputy in this House who, making <Col N="538" /> a pretence to be courteous, to be well-mannered, to choose his words carefully, invariably, whenever a thrust gets home, loses his temper and begins to behave like a bully and a braggart in a low-class den.  That is why, when I referred to the defects in this Bill which must be obvious even to the laymen who have studied it and when I ventured to point out to him the slippery ground upon which he is treading by reason of the bad drafting of this Bill, he applied to me the epithet &ldquo;dirty.&rdquo;  I fling that epithet back in his face.

      <P>Having disposed of Deputy Morrissey's personal reference to me, having disposed of his reference to the fact that a number of officers <Col N="541" /> are present in the House listening to this debate, may I get back to this Bill?</P>
      <P>When he was introducing this Bill, Deputy O'Higgins said that it is part of Fine Gael policy.  I could describe this as a half-baked measure from the half-baked policy of a half-baked Party.  The Deputy devoted the greater part of his introductory remarks to pointing out how seriously and how gravely rates press upon the general body of the citizens.  We had long dissertations about the position of the farmer, the position of the businessman and the position of those shopkeepers who were compelled, under regulations issued in 1950 by the then Minister for Health, to carry out improvements in their premises in order to ensure that they would be licensed for the sale of food and food-stuffs. We had all that&mdash;but we had not a word about the effect of this Bill upon the general body of ratepayers who do not own their houses, who are not in a position to provide themselves with bathrooms or with any of the other amenities to which Deputy Morrissey refers but who are simply to go on paying, year after year, rates which are unduly high because certain better-off sections of the population escape, for one reason or another, their due responsibility for paying their fair share of the rates&mdash;the responsibility which was originally envisaged when the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, was being enacted.  What is the purpose of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the better-off classes in this country will be better-off still and that the burden of the reliefs which they secure will be piled upon the workers and salaried classes and those others who are not engaged in business and who have not premises which can be adapted for a business use of one kind or another.  I have now, I suppose, been a member of this House for 26 years and, in all my experience, I have never seen a more blatant piece of class legislation, produced in the guise of providing reliefs for a section of the citizens, than this measure represents&mdash;and that is the measure which has received the endorsement, <Col N="542" /> through its leader in this House, Deputy Norton, of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Few people reading Section 2 of this Bill would grasp the fact that its primary purpose is to deprive the local authority of the only machinery which exists at the moment of ensuring that the rates levied by them on all owners or occupiers of premises will be adjusted to the capacity of the individual concerned to pay.  That is the primary purpose of this Bill and that is the purpose for which it has been introduced.  It is quite true that the local authorities may not avail of the machinery to which I have referred and that the poorer ratepayers in general suffer on that account, but that is no reason for depriving them of any hope of relief.</P>
    <P>I want to say this to those people who are thinking that there is some social purpose to be served by the enactment of this measure&mdash;even if it were possible to enact it in its present form.  I do not know whether my words will carry any weight with Deputy Davin or Deputy O'Leary, but certainly they ought to carry weight with Deputy Corish because he knows well what is involved.  The first effect of the enactment of Section 2 would be to increase further the existing poundage rates in the administrative area of any local authority in which this Bill became effective to any significant extent.  I say that, because one way in which local authorities can secure an increased revenue, without increasing the general poundage rates, is to ensure that premises which, in social justice to everybody, require to be revalued would be revalued so that the rates would be levied on them in accordance with the existing law.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that the first result of the operation of Section 2, if this Bill were to be enacted, in any area in which the Bill became effective to any significant extent, would be to increase the general poundage rates.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Save and except in the case of the improvement or enlargement of any building or the erection of a new building, the valuation of a tenement shall not be increased.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Has Deputy Davin now grasped my point that you cannot increase the valuation of any premises or of any piece of property such as a mine or a quarry unless there has been an improvement or enlargement of the building or the erection of a new building?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>What does all that mean?  Deputy Morrissey gave us some hint when he talked about buildings <Col N="544" /> being taken over and converted into hotels.  There need not be a penny spent on a structural alteration to a hotel.  A wine licence could be procured and, in due course, a hotel licence could be procured and there would not be any increase in the valuation of the building, nor would there be any increase in the licence duty which would normally be attached to a building which was being used as a hotel and which had a hotel licence to sell beer and spirits.  The whole community would be deprived of the increment in revenue which would accrue to it if the law were permitted to operate as it is at present and were not, shall we say, shackled by the introduction of Section 2.</P>
      <P>A building in Fitzwilliam Street, Fitzwilliam Square or Merrion Square, used at present as a residence and rated accordingly, could be converted, without one penny piece being spent on a pot of paint, not to speak of carrying out any structural alteration, into an office building, in which every floor might be let at a rent of hundreds of pounds per annum and the citizens of Dublin would get no benefit from the change of user.  At present if that happens in the City of Dublin, these hereditaments cease to be valued as residences and are valued as business premises, but if Section 2 is passed that will no longer be the case.  If I were some of the Deputies opposite, I might say that there must have been an awful amount of property jobbing to make this section attractive to a great number of people, as we are told it is.</P>

      <P>Let us see what in fact, that principle is.  We know now what the intention is.  Section 11 of the Valuation Act of 1852 lays this down:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And such valuation in regard to houses and buildings&rdquo;</P>
      <P>whether they are business premises or not&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;shall be made upon an estimate of the net annual value thereof&rdquo;</P>

      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;that is to say, the rent for which, one year with another, the same building might in its actual state be reasonably expected to let from year to year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Mark that, and let us turn back to these buildings in Fitzwilliam Square or Merrion Square.  At the present moment it is almost impossible to get any person to rent a house in Fitzwilliam Square, Merrion Square or any of these places which were formerly exclusive residential districts in this city and use it as a private dwelling-house.  In these circumstances the letting value of such houses as single residences is abnormally low and the valuation is abnormally low. The valuation at the present moment may be to the order of £100 or £120, and the citizens of Dublin will get out of such a building something to the order, based on the existing rate poundage, of £170, £180 or perhaps £200.  But convert these premises without using a pot of paint&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;from a residence and let them be let as business offices, <Col N="549" /> then their letting value soars at once. Under Section 11, of course, the valuation would be correspondingly increased and the citizens of Dublin would directly benefit by that fact, because, as I have said, the nature of the user of the premises is changed.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of this Bill&mdash;make no mistake about it&mdash;is intended to prevent that benefit flowing to the general body of the citizens of Dublin.  The benefit under the section would be confined either to the person who was the original landlord of the premises or the occupier.  The original landlord of the premises will benefit if he lets these premises because he will be able to say to his prospective tenant: &ldquo;The valuation of your share of these premises will be to the order of £20, £30 or £40.&rdquo;  That is what he will be able to say if Section 2 of the Bill goes through.  If not, then when the tenancy is being negotiated the incoming tenant has to ask himself: &ldquo;What are these premises likely to be valued at if there is a revaluation even if I do not spend anything on them?&rdquo;  Of course, he knows at once there is likely to be a substantial increase in the valuation and that correspondingly the amount which he will pay to the landlord will be less.  So that the effect of the section, with regard to premises which are not reconstructed or are not new buildings, is to deprive the citizens and the local authority concerned of the benefits which would naturally flow to them under the existing law in order that the property owner or the occupier of the property may correspondingly benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still trying to deal with Deputy O'Higgins's speech. When he was introducing the Bill, he pointed to the fact that a rate collector can ask for a revaluation if he feels that a tenement is undervalued. That is true.  That is the existing law. The purpose of this Bill is to deprive the local authority or the rate collector of the right to ask for a revaluation. That is the purpose of Section 2.  Let Deputies ask themselves why it is that the law does lay on the rate collector the duty of asking for a revaluation on any premises which he feels are undervalued.  Is the object not quite clear?  Is it not to ensure that a ratepayer will pay what is reasonably and properly due from him, in justice, for the services which every local authority affords? That is the sole purpose of it.  If a rate collector feels that premises are undervalued, he then knows that the amount of rates which the occupier of these premises pays is not what he should pay, having regard to what everybody else is called upon to pay. That is why that power is given to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it only the rate collector can do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not merely the rate collector can do that.  If I am engaged in business in a street and I think that my valuation appears to be high by comparison with that of other premises, say, in the same street&mdash;I am quoting a case that might occur to one most readily&mdash;then I can ask for a revaluation of my own premises. So far so good.  That may operate to my ultimate benefit but, if it does not operate to my ultimate benefit, if, instead of securing a reduction, the <Col N="551" /> valuation goes up, then I know that as far as I am concerned I am paying more in rates than some of my competitors in the same street.  I can then ask the commissioners to revalue their premises, the purpose being to secure a fair adjustment of the burden as between myself and my competitors. If Section 2 of the Bill were passed, it would not be possible to do that unless it was clear and manifest that your competitor had had his premises enlarged or reconstructed. It may not in the normal course be necessary to ask to have premises revalued in these circumstances because the rate collector would have noticed the fact and would have asked that they should be revalued.</P>
      <P>Let us get down to the point of fundamental principle underlying revaluation.  The assumption underlying it is a very simple one.  I think it is one which most people will say, by and large, is a reasonable one, that is to say that a man's income and his ability to meet social charges, communal charges, charges imposed for the services which he enjoys in the community in which he lives, are reflected in the value of the premises which he occupies, either as a residence or for business purposes.  That is the basis of valuation.  Therefore the Commissioner of Valuation in valuing premises is compelled to have regard to the letting value, the rent which a willing tenant would pay to a willing landlord, certain charges having been met.  That is the sole basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a reasonable assumption that if a man is paying £150 or £200 for a residence he can assume a heavier share of the local burdens than the man who can only afford to live, say, in a house the annual value of which would be £30.  Similarly, if for the purpose of his business a man occupies premises the annual letting value of which is £1,000 or £2,000, is it not reasonable to assume that that business is in a better position to bear its share of the local rates than a business the owner of which can only afford to pay a rent of £100, and that the occupier of premises which are valued <Col N="552" /> at £2,000 avails of the local services to a much greater extent than the occupier of premises which are valued at, say, £100?</P>
    <P>By and large, that is the assumption which the valuation code works. That is why we have so many things related to the valuation of the premises which a man occupies, not merely the rates but, as has been pointed out by Deputy Morrissey, the licence duties of various kinds, income-tax under Schedule A, and the valuation element in the E.S.B.'s tariff.  All these things are related to one single supposition, viz., that a man's ability to pay, and a man's user of local services are related to the size and the value of the premises which he occupies.  If you abolish that principle &mdash;it has been the subject of a great deal of investigation&mdash;you cannot find any other which will be an adequate substitute for it, any other which will enable so many financial operations to be settled in a way which is simple and which, taking it by and large, is equitable as between one local tax-payer and another.  To destroy that principle, we have it now admitted by Deputy O'Higgins, is the primary purpose of Section 2 of this Bill.</P>

      <P>That has nothing to do with the matter.  In these cases, the premises are revalued and the valuation must be based on a fair letting value.  I do not want to go into the whole valuation code and all its refinements.  One would have thought that Deputy Norton, if he has not read the Bill, would at least have read the Long Title to the Bill.  In <Col N="556" /> the course of his speech, it began to dawn on me that he had not taken the trouble to read the Long Title of the Bill.  The reason I say that is because Deputy Norton began by bewailing the fact that the owners of dwelling-houses would not benefit under the Bill.  That is quite true.  No owner of a dwelling-house would benefit by any provision of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;unless the owner of the dwelling-house converted the dwelling-house into a business premises. Then, undoubtedly, he would, but if he continued to live in the house and used it as a residence he would not benefit at all because Section 3 of this Bill applies only to business premises, &ldquo;any building used for the purpose of any business enlarged or improved&rdquo;.  In these cases increased valuation shall not have effect for the period of seven years. Section 3 deliberately excludes dwelling-houses wholly and completely.</P>

      <P>If I were to concede to the owners and occupiers of business premises the same concession in regard to rates as has been given to the owners or occupiers of dwelling-houses&mdash;you get them if you are a tenant as well as the owner&mdash; why did not the Deputies whose names are associated with this Bill bring in a Bill which would deal <i>simpliciter</i> with this question of rates?

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is <Col N="558" /> because, as I have said before, the remission of rates is a smoke-screen to cover the other purposes behind this Bill.  Deputy Davin was saying that the owners of dwelling-houses would not benefit under the Bill.  Deputy Norton must be well aware of the fact that if a cinema is enlarged and improved it becomes more effective as a place for patrons.  If the cinema happens to be in Dublin it will be saved a very substantial amount in rates which otherwise would accrue due under the existing valuation code and at the expense of those owners of dwelling-houses about whom Deputy Norton is so greatly concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, having tumbled to what the situation was, said that we could amend it on Committee Stage, that we could give to the owner of a dwelling-house exactly the same concession that we extended to the owners of the cinema, a bank or a mansion which is converted from its original use as a dwelling-house. Owners of dwelling-houses could be given the same sort of concession. Could they?  If any member of the Labour Party is going to vote for the Second Reading of this Bill on the assumption that he will be able to amend it in order to give effect to Deputy Norton's proposal, I would suggest that he read the Long Title of the Bill.  The Bill is entitled an Act to amend the Valuation Acts so as to provide certain reliefs in respect of increased valuations resulting from improvements to business premises and to certain farm buildings and outhouses, and also to amend the law relating to revision of valuations generally.  Has Deputy Norton noted how narrowly that Long Title is drawn?  The owners &ldquo;in respect of increased valuations resulting from improvements to business premises&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Long Title is concerned, it is designed to rule <Col N="559" /> out, to exclude, from the benefits of this Bill the owners and occupiers of dwelling-houses, so that&mdash;let Deputy Norton not be deceived or Deputy Davin either&mdash;if they go into the Lobby in support of the Second Reading of this Bill they are going in to do as I have said, to benefit a few big people at the expense of smaller people.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins was hard put to find some justification for this Bill.  He tried to excuse its introduction on the grounds that when the Coalition Government&mdash;I am going to paraphrase Deputy O'Higgins's excuse because I would not like to burden the House by reading several passages from his speech relating to this matter&mdash;he tried to justify the introduction of this Bill in the form in which it had been introduced on the grounds that when the Coalition Government&mdash;the inter-Party Government, as he called it&mdash;introduced its proper food hygiene regulations in 1950, it did not appreciate what the consequences of them would be.  That, in fact, is what the Deputy said.  The Deputy here alleged that they did not know, when they introduced these regulations, what, as I have said, the consequences would be. They did not, in fact, know what they were doing.  That was not unique in the history of the Coalition Government. They did many things, the consequences of which they did not foresee.</P>
      <P>Let us see what the attitude of the Coalition Government was, in fact, to this question of an increase in the valuation of premises arising from the structural alterations which, in many cases, were found to be necessary to meet the requirements of the food hygiene regulations.  A question on that matter was addressed to my predecessor on the 6th December, 1950.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">

    <P>&ldquo;If he will take steps, if necessary by the introduction of proposals for legislation, to ensure that the poor law valuation of premises, which will <Col N="560" /> have to be altered to comply with the requirements of the food hygiene regulations, will not be increased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the question which was put to my predecessor on the 6th December, 1950, and my predecessor turned him down flat, regretting that he could not see his way to introduce proposals for the necessary legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, and this House has already accepted that principle because it gave a Second Reading to the Valuation Bill of 1938.  I regret, however, that the Deputy was not as wise then as he is to-day because the Deputy who is clamouring to-day for an amendment of the existing valuation law, in fact for a general revision of the general valuation of this country, was one of the Deputies who opposed the 1938 Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I warned Deputies then of what the consequences of any such ill-judged action would be.  Now, there is not a local authority in this State whose finances are such that it can raise the revenue it requires without imposing undue burdens on a vast number of citizens; which can raise the revenue it requires to enable it to meet the cost of the public services. That is due to one fact, that it is working on obsolete valuations.  If the Bill of 1938 had been passed by this House, and if the general valuation of premises which it envisaged had been undertaken, the local authorities would be in a much better position to give the services which the ratepayers are demanding of them, and to give them, I would say, without imposing any unique hardship on any element in the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am going to dispose of it if allowed to continue without interruption.  I was going to say that the general effect of this Bill, as I have already emphasised, in any area in which it could become substantially operated, would be to increase <Col N="562" /> the poundage rates and thereby increase the burden on the general body of ratepayers for the benefit, as I have said, of a privileged few.</P>
      <P>I come now to Section 4.  I want to emphasise this, that there is nothing in Section 4 that is not already fully covered by the existing law and practice. While the foundation for the existing practice is to be found in Section 14 of the Act of 1852, it has been interpreted for a great number of years in the light of two other statutes, in the light of the provisions of the Land Improvement Act of 1847 and the Land Improvement (Ireland) Act of 1866.</P>

Every Deputy knows that.  Every Deputy is aware that that principle could not be challenged in the courts and has not been challenged in the courts.  Therefore, Section 4 of this Bill, should it become an Act, is wholly unnecessary but it has been put in as a piece of window dressing to pretend to the farmers that this Bill was going to confer some real benefit on them.  It is going to do nothing of the sort.</P>
      <P>There is no farmer in this country, so far as I am aware&mdash;and I think if there were I should very quickly hear of it&mdash;whose buildings, if they are new buildings, have been rated.  They have been valued certainly but the valuations have not been entered into the valuation lists.  Therefore, the buildings have not fallen to be rated until a period of seven years has elapsed.</P>

      <P>According to this Bill: &ldquo;Where a person engaged in farming erects outhouses or farm buildings or enlarges or improves existing outhouses or farm buildings ...the following section shall apply&rdquo;.  What point is there in this when that position is already fully covered?  If farm buildings are erected or enlarged or if an outhouse is erected, enlarged or improved it will be valued but it will not be entered in the valuation lists for seven years.

No ratepayer has ever gone and said he was aggrieved by the practice of the Commissioners of Valuation for not entering in the valuation lists.  What is the purpose, therefore, of Section 4?  The purpose of Section 4, let me repeat, is merely a bait, a trick to delude the farming community of this country into the belief that this Bill, which has a far different purpose, is going to confer any substantial benefit on them.</P>

      <P>In the light of that position and in view of what I have already said as to what the general effect of this Bill would be if it were to become operative, those who are concerned about the conditions of the farmers should refuse to give a Second Reading to it.</P>

      <P>I have gone to the trouble of showing the defects in this Bill, and spent a great deal of time, fruitfully I hope, pointing out to Deputy Davin what the general effect of this Bill would be on the people and what the general reaction of this Bill would be on the section of the population with whom Deputy Davin is as sincerely concerned as I am. Therefore, I hope Deputy Davin will do what I intend to do.  I am going to vote against the Bill for the very sound reasons which I have given.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Briscoe pointed out this morning, this Bill will confer no really substantial benefit upon the general mass of the people.  It may confer benefits upon a certain section of the community.  One thing it will do, as the Bill is drafted at present, having regard to the valuation code generally, it will give a great deal of employment to the lawyers.  For instance, can Deputy Sweetman tell me how the courts are going to construe this new concept of suitability?</P>

      <P>I have not introduced anything.  My great regret is that the Bill of 1938 did not become law, but as it did not become law I introduced nothing.  Let the Deputy be aware of that.</P>

      <P>In relation to the question of suitability how are the courts going to interpret this Bill? What concept of suitability does <Col N="566" /> Deputy O'Higgins visualise them forming in relation to this matter?  I just cannot see that concept being generally applied.  It does not make sense. The only thing it will mean is that the courts will have to spend a great deal of their time, if this Bill becomes law, trying to interpret what the Legislature means by the term &ldquo;suitability.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister this question?  Did the Minister receive the deputation from Macra na Feirme which was to interview either himself or his colleague, the Minister for Local Government&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;because they would have given the Minister many instances which need to be covered under Section 4 where the practice is not as the Minister said?</P>
