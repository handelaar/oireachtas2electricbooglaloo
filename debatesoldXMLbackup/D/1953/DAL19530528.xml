      <P>During the Report Stage of the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1951, in reply to a query as to whether national teachers are to be exempted from the scheme I replied &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but I qualified that reply in answer to a further query (Volume 131, column 2051) by stating that I was in favour of covering certain classes including teachers for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes and I think I left no doubt as to the position during the debate on 3rd December, 1952, when I said I saw no sound reason for excluding national teachers for widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Modifications of Insurance) Regulations, 1953, modified the provisions of the Social Welfare Act in respect of certain classes of employment including pensionable employment as national teachers, where the rate of remuneration did not exceed £600 a year, by providing that such classes, covered for all purposes under the Act, would be insurable for widows' and orphans' pensions purposes only.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to apportion the rent of a house in the manner requested. The rent depends upon several factors in addition to capital expenditure and repayment terms.

The table also includes an apportionment of the weekly sum, calculated on the annuity basis, required to repay the capital expenditure on the terms mentioned by the Deputy.  The principal and interest content of these amounts vary over the period of the loan.</P>

    <P>NOTE: The particulars of employment are based on monthly returns furnished by the local authorities concerned showing the numbers employed on a specified date.  In respect of the two county councils the average has been obtained by dividing the sum of the monthly figures by 12.  In respect of the urban authorities the employment afforded on these schemes is of limited duration; for this reason the average employment figures given in the reply are related merely to the duration of the schemes in each case.</P>

Nevertheless a fee of 1/- only is being levied for customs charges under 10/-. The revised fees do not fully recompense the Department.  (2) The additional revenue, resulting from the increased fees, is estimated at £12,000 per annum.  (3) The 6d. delivery fee, on incoming non-dutiable parcels, which did not apply to those from Great Britain and Canada, was abolished in conjunction with this increase with a resultant annual loss of approximately £7,000.  The net additional revenue from these revisions is therefore estimated at £5,000 per annum.</P>

Imports included sweetened as well as unsweetened condensed milk.

    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the action which, as indicated by the Minister for Finance in his financial statement on 6th May, 1953, the Government propose to take in relation to the report of the Civil Service Arbitration Board presented to Dáil Éireann on the 18th February, 1953, namely, to give effect to the finding of the board subject to the modification that the increases shall operate with effect from 1st April, 1953. &mdash;(Minister for Finance (Mr. MacEntee).)</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments put down in the names of Deputy Norton and myself were put there with the express intention of giving this House an opportunity of voting in a positive way for a definite amendment.  On your ruling, Sir, these amendments could not be taken.  We had hoped to be able so to frame amendments that they would come within the scope of what we had intended but we found that, notwithstanding all the willing assistance which we got, there was no option but to show our disagreement with this motion by taking the line of voting against it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Peadar Cowan, speaking here yesterday, took Deputy Norton and Deputies from Fine Gael who had put down amendments, to task because of the fact that they had so failed.  He indicated that because of what he called the newspaper propaganda he was led to believe that an amendment would be so framed as to give the award in full and still come within the approval of the Chair.  It was due to the fact that he believed we could do it that, with his usual modesty, he took a back seat until he found that it was too late to put in the amendment he had in mind himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let Deputy Peadar Cowan and every other Deputy in this House realise clearly that the present motion before the House is a request from the Government for permission from this Dáil to alter an award made by the board which considered the Civil Service case. <Col N="204" /> It is a request by the Minister for Finance for agreement, and to give him permission, to reduce that award by deducting payments for 21 weeks from the award given.  There would be no need for this motion had the Government decided to accept the award in full but because they intend to reduce that award by 21 payments, we are here discussing this motion.  I suggest to Deputy Peadar Cowan and to any other Deputy who, like him, is asking what happens if this is refused, that he has a clear indication as to what he should do.  He must vote against this motion unless he wants to be lined up with the request that the motion should be carried.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to believe that Deputy Cowan was unable to receive from the interested associations and bodies concerned with this arbitration, any little bit of advice which would indicate to him how he should vote on this motion.</P>
    <P>I have with me here a letter from Deputy Cowan dated 28th March, 1953, addressed to an official of one of the organisations concerned with this award.  This is his letter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am in receipt of your letter of the 18th inst.  As you are probably aware, I have already spoken in the Dáil strongly recommending that the award be implemented in full.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Signed) Peader Cowan, T.D.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Funnily enough, on yesterday we found Deputy Cowan stating that he was going to vote for this motion and against the award being paid in full. Deputy Cowan gave as his reason the fact that he expected our amendment, that we had not been able to suit the Chair in that amendment and that because with his usual modesty he waited until he had seen it, he had hesitated to put down an amendment himself until it was too late.  I suggest that that reason of Deputy Cowan would be better termed not a reason, but an excuse for voting with the Government. The Government can always, if the House so decides, implement this award in full and if this motion be defeated the Government have the opportunity of saying: &ldquo;Well, the majority decides here.  We do not have to go to the country.  We will accept <Col N="205" /> the decision of the Deputies of this House.  We will give to the Civil Service the full award and we will have, as a consequence, to impose whatever taxation is necessary.  Be it on your own heads.&rdquo;  It is quite a reasonable, quite a simple thing for the Government so to decide.</P>
    <P>They have the other alternative if they wish.  If they are beaten, they can say: &ldquo;We will go to the country. We will let the people decide.&rdquo;  That is a matter for themselves but one thing is certain.  There are two other Parties concerned.  Deputy Norton, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, indicated that, not only were we giving lip service to the honouring of the Civil Service award, but that should he, as representative of the Labour Party, be in any future Government, he would make it part of his policy to see that the lip service he was giving now would then become the positive policy of that Government and that the award, even belatedly, would then be paid in full. Deputy McGilligan, I understand, on behalf of the Fine Gael Party gave a similar promise.  I think it is only reasonable that we should propose to vote against this motion because of the fact that it does not give the award in full and that we should also promise that should we, at any future time, form a Government, we would convert into positive action our promises of to-day.</P>
    <P>I think it is the duty of Deputies to give fair consideration and a fair decision on the question now before us as to whether or not the award should be given in full.  In giving that consideration, they might remember&mdash;and I suggest they should&mdash;that the Civil Service and the various people who come under that heading, have not the same rights as the ordinary organised worker outside these categories.  If you are a member of my union or any union affiliated to the T.U.C. or the C.I.U., and go before the Labour Court or some other form of arbitration seeking an award and find that your employers, having agreed to go before that court, refuse to implement the award, you have a weapon to bring to bear on them.  Workers outside have the greatest of all weapons, the right <Col N="206" /> to deny their services until the employer is convinced, through necessity, that it is in his own interest to pay their lawful dues.  That right to strike in an industrial dispute, call it what you like, is, in the national interest, denied to or taken from civil servants. Because of the fact that they have relinquished that right, I think we have an added burden on us, as Deputies, to give fair and reasonable consideration to their claims.  We are placed here to-day in the position of saying to the Minister whether or not we think that he, acting in the name of the Government, is about to give a fair decision.  We are appointed in the name of the people of the country and that burden is imposed upon us to come to a fair decision.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the reasons that influence me in coming to the decision I have come to.  No. 1 is the fact that arbitration was agreed to by both sides.  There were two parties to it, the Minister on behalf of the Government, and the organisation officials on behalf of the civil servants.  That was a bargain freely entered into and it naturally implied, once arbitration was decided upon and the board was appointed, that the award would be honoured.  I think that fair play and honour demand that the result of the arbitration, once agreed upon, should be accepted.  This very principle, as Deputy Norton proved yesterday, was accepted by the Minister with one reservation only&mdash;that only in exceptional circumstances would it happen that the award would not be implemented in full and that even then he would pay as much as he could and in the following year pay whatever back money, as it is known in trade union terms, was due.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that if the Minister is taking advantage of that clause, it is his duty to show the exceptional circumstances that exist to justify the decision he proposes to take.  I think it is his duty to convince the Dáil.  From what I have heard of his reasons, his only explanation is that they had not budgeted for the extra money which payment of the award in full would entail and that it would need certain extra taxation which the Government did not propose <Col N="207" /> to include in the Budget.  Deputy Norton and Deputy McGilligan disposed of that argument pretty quickly when they pointed out that there was £2,500,000 in the kitty and that a carry over of considerably less than that amount would suffice in normal circumstances.</P>
    <P>I might point out at this stage that the &ldquo;back money&rdquo; issue was of the Government's own creation.  The Government received the arbitration award on the 18th November.  Had the award been implemented immediately the question of back money would have covered only a little over two weeks, since the recommendation dated only from 1st November and the back money involved would have been a very trivial sum at that stage.  The payment of the award from the 18th November would, while amounting in the ultimate to the same figure, have been spread over the period in equivalent weekly, fortnightly or monthly increases and these increases could have been carried without any exceptional expenditure on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>I regret the decision of the Government to get out of implementing the award in full because I feel that action will have a bad effect on the country as a whole.  Up to this employers have accepted the decisions of the Labour Court because of their desire to hold the goodwill of their employees; they will now have the excuse: &ldquo;Why should we not try to get out of this; look at what the Government did in the case of the civil servants?&rdquo; We in the trade unions may have difficulties with our own members because of this decision. Trade union officials take their positions in a reasonable and responsible way and they endeavour to ensure that the Labour Court awards are accepted, because we feel that, having gone before a court which has been established and recognised by us, we are more or less in honour bound to accept its decisions. We may in future find ourselves faced with the position that our members may prove unreasonable and try to kick against an award and the employers in that case will be able to <Col N="208" /> say: &ldquo;Why should we not hold it up? Did not the Government do that when it suited them?  Why should we give retrospective pay?&rdquo; Both parties to the Labour Court agreed not to be bound legally by its decisions but to accept them in a spirit of honour and fair play and that spirit was gradually growing throughout the country.  I think this refusal to implement an arbitration award made by a fairly constituted arbitration board will do great harm.  This refusal on the part of the Government will knock the bottom out of the existing goodwill between the employer and the employee generally. Furthermore, I suggest it will cause distrust and suspicion in the minds of those who work for the Government. I am tired telling employers that a discontented worker is a bad worker and the Government may find, as employers elsewhere have found, that they will lose more than they will gain if they force this decision.</P>
    <P>Civil servants, are, after all, human beings.  The question has been asked as to whether the Labour Party can afford to support a move to give more money to highly paid civil servants, to the people in the soft jobs?  While this award may cover some highly paid civil servants, it also covers thousands upon thousands of ordinary working men and women&mdash;auxillary postmen, permanent postmen throughout the country, linesmen and telephone operators, clerks&mdash;and it will eventually bring within its scope the Army, the police force, and the employees of local authorities.  The county managers will find it necessary to secure sanction to-morrow for increases to their staffs equivalent to the increases granted by the Government to its employees.  Why should it be necessary, therefore, for me to offer any apology as a Labour Deputy for claiming that postmen in Waterford, the men working on the telephone lines, the girls behind the post office counters and all the other Government employees in lowly paid occupations should be given the same rights and the same pay, particularly in relation to back money, as the employees in other Government and semi-Government occupations such as the E.S.B., <Col N="209" /> C.I.E., Aer Lingus and so forth.  I do not suggest that the employees in C.I.E., the E.S.B., Aer Lingus, or in any other Government or semi-Government job have received too much.  I do suggest, however, that in all fairness the Government employees in Waterford City and County are as much entitled to retrospective payment as are any workers anywhere else in the country.  The wives and dependents of these workers, who have gone into debt in anticipation of the Government honouring this award, are entitled to demand of me as a representative of Waterford constituency that I must in honour support the implementation of the whole award.  This House is not called upon to decide whether higher paid civil servants or lower paid civil servants are entitled to the award. Once the award is made by the arbitration board we are bound to accept it.  I presume that body went into all the facts and figures to discover how much, if anything, should be given and how far back it should go.  It is not our function to say that we do not think the award is right.  It is not our function to say that we think it is wrong.  All we are required to do is to implement the award.  The Government motion proposes to cut the award by 21 weeks.  The Government accepted arbitration.  It is not for the Government now to refuse to implement the award of that arbitration merely because they do not like it. The present attitude rather suggests a policy of: &ldquo;Heads I win, tails you lose&rdquo; with the civil servants losing all the time.</P>
    <P>Arbitration was agreed upon and freely entered into by both sides. Because the present attitude of the Government sets a bad example to employers generally and to the nation as a whole, because workers are being deprived of their rights and because honour and fair play demand that we should accept a contract into which we freely entered, I propose to vote against the motion in its present form.</P>

      <P>I have very little to add to what has been said by the Opposition speakers on this motion.  It seems to me that there is a very simple <Col N="210" /> principle of justice involved in this matter and that the Government's attitude is a flagrant breach of their duties to the civil servants after the award made by the arbitration board last November.  There was an attempt in the House yesterday to misrepresent the attitude of the Fine Gael Party on this motion and I think it is necessary, in view of what was said yesterday, to reassert the reason why the Fine Gael Party is voting against this motion.</P>
      <P>We are voting against this motion because it does not implement the award of the arbitration board.  We believe that that award should be implemented in full.  Attempts were made to put down amendments to this motion in order to ensure that the Dáil would give expression to its opinion that the award should be implemented in full.  Those amendments were ruled out of order.  The only way, therefore, we can demonstrate to the country our opposition to the Government's attitude in this matter is by our votes in voting against this motion.  I want to make it quite clear that we are not voting, as was suggested yesterday, against the increase in the salaries which the Government are now proposing to bring in.  We are voting against the Government's attitude in not implementing in full the Civil Service arbitration award.</P>
      <P>As I have said, we believe there is a simple principle of justice involved. An arbitration board agreed to both by the Government and the staff side of the Civil Service was set up.  That board met in November of last year and heard the very strong arguments put up by the officials on behalf of the Government against the case put up by the staff side of the Civil Service. After considering the various arguments put up by both sides, the board made an award which was substantially less than was asked for by the staff side of the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it should be recorded that it was as early as July of last year that the demand for increased salaries and allowances was made by the Civil Service. In August of last year the general council failed to get agreement <Col N="211" /> and the matter was then referred to arbitration which was held in November of last year.  At the hearing of that arbitration board the staff side asked for retrospective payment to July, 1952, on the basis that the cost of living had increased by approximately 20 per cent. from the date of the previous award in July of the preceding year.  The arbitration board considered that argument and considered the arguments put up against the retrospective payment to July of last year and decided against it. Instead, they advocated an increase in pay dating from the 1st November or, in other words, a couple of days before the actual hearing before the arbitration board.</P>
    <P>That recommendation was not a retrospective recommendation.  The findings of the board were, in fact, before the Government on the 18th November of last year and, in spite of the claim by the staff side for payment from the 1st of July of last year, the proposed increases advocated by the award only dated from the 1st November of last year.  In those circumstances, I cannot see how the Government could fail to grant to the civil servants, if they were going to give the increase, the increase from the date as recommended by the arbitration board.  Instead of this, the Government utilised to the full the powers given to it in the agreement for conciliation and arbitration between the official side and the staff side and managed to stall any decision for the three months laid down in the conciliation agreement.</P>
    <P>The Government then in presenting its Budget states it is going to give the proposed increases but only from the 1st April.  It seems to me that it is a matter of simple justice.  If the Government decides that the cost of living had increased; if the Government decides that increased allowances and salaries should be given to State servants; if the Government decides that the increase should be given on the terms suggested by the arbitration board who had heard all the arguments for and against the increase, I think <Col N="212" /> the Government should also have given the award from the 1st November.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we are voting against this motion in order to demonstrate our conviction that the State servants are being badly treated by the Government and should get the award from the date recommended by the arbitration board.  I regard the Government, as has been suggested here already, as giving a very bad example to other employers in the State.  I think its attitude is typified in many ways by the scandalous way in which they are treating the retired State pensioners.  It seems to me that the sum of £62,000, which is the sum that the Minister stated it would cost the Exchequer to increase the State pensioners' pensions, is a negligible sum in view of the huge Budget that the country has to face this year.</P>
    <P>I think the refusal of the Government to increase the pensions is but another example of the niggardly manner in which they are approaching their duty as employers.  It seems to me to be quite demonstrable that it would be unnecessary to increase taxation in order to give the increased awards payable from the 1st November. As has been said in the Dáil, we are not giving increased awards to a vast majority of highly paid persons in easy circumstances.  We would be legislating here for the vast majority of poorly paid decent hardworking people who, by the deliberate action of the Government in increasing living costs, now find in many cases life almost unbearable.  We would be giving this increase to persons deserving of the increase.  We would be giving it to people who are trying to keep up a decent standard of living, hardworking people who have given in many cases many years of good service to this State.  I think that their claim should be honoured.  Their case in my opinion as I said at the outset is one based on the simple principle of justice which the Government has flouted by refusing to give the full arbitration award.</P>

      <P>In speaking on this question of the arbitration award, I do not intend to go back over the whole history of this claim <Col N="213" /> because it has been very fully dealt with, all the aspects of the matter having already been discussed.  But I would like to make it quite clear&mdash; I hope I will be able to do so in very few words&mdash;what exactly my views are, and how I feel personally in regard to this award and its proposed modification.</P>
      <P>I take the view that the Government have been forced to greatly increase taxation and to increase the cost of living all round.  Naturally, as a result of that there has been a greatly increased demand for wages.  When the Government were taking this action in which I supported them&mdash;I believe that the taxation which they have increased since they came into office was absolutely necessary and I do not believe that any subsequent Government which may follow them will find it possible to reduce that taxation&mdash;I understood that it was clearly accepted that workers and employers should negotiate an increase in wages to correspond with the increase in the cost of living.  Shortly after the cost of living increased, these negotiations commenced and we had them carried on throughout the country.  In private enterprise and in State-sponsored concerns, similar negotiations followed as a result of which wages and salaries were increased along the lines on which the award came.  I took the view that at no time was it ever accepted that there was intended to be anything in the nature of a limitation or a freeze on the wages or salaries of any particular section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of arbitration for the Civil Service has been accepted by the present Government, but in my view the Government must, naturally, be the final arbiter in so far as matters vitally affecting Government policy are concerned.  I do not agree with the delegation of Government responsibility in a lot of matters, as has been suggested by many members of the House.  I think that civil servants are in a very different position from other members of the community because they have not the same capacity to fight for wage and salary increases which those other members of the community have.  I believe, in those <Col N="214" /> circumstances, that they are fully entitled to arbitration.</P>
    <P>When this matter went to arbitration, we must bear in mind that the Government case, the case of the Department of Finance, was very ably made.  It was made about as well as it could possibly have been made.  The facts, as far as the Government were concerned with their responsibility to the community and the taxpayer, were clearly stated by the Department of Finance on behalf of the Government, so that we must accept it that when the arbitration took place the result of it bore in mind the difficulties which beset the Government in dealing with this question of civil servants' pay increase.</P>
    <P>The Government is the biggest employer in this country.  I think this is a matter of principle, and that it is very wrong that the Government, once they agree that a claim of this nature should go to arbitration, should not honour the full amount.  I think it is a very bad example for the rest of the community.  I do not see how we can expect private enterprise, State-sponsored concerns or anybody else to honour arbitration if the State itself is not prepared to honour arbitration. In other countries, where for example, devaluation in the currency takes place, it is accepted that the Government customarily adjusts payments in salaries to meet those circumstances.</P>
    <P>I, of course, think that the Government had a perfect right to postpone a decision on this.  I do not see why they should not have postponed a decision on the matter until the Budget, but I find it very hard to understand the protracted delay there was about this matter.  It seems to me it should have been possible, some time ago, to decide to what extent this claim should be dealt with.  At any rate, if the Government wish to leave the matter over they have a perfect right to do it, and they have done so. But, quite frankly, looking into the financial position as I can judge it at the moment, I do not see why the back money in this award should not be honoured, even if the Government honestly believed that it could not be met this year.  Surely it should be <Col N="215" /> possible to give some undertaking that it will be met in the future.</P>
    <P>I may say that, in a matter of principle like this, I as an Independent Deputy would prefer to vote for an increase in taxation in order to honour the award rather than modify it I would prefer to vote for, say, an increase in the price of petrol or an increase in the price of cigarettes even if we have to face it, rather than, once having agreed to negotiate an increase in salaries as a result of the cost of living which followed action that we had taken here&mdash;I would, as I say, prefer to increase taxes rather than not to pay this portion of the award. I want to make it clear that my attitude on this is not by any means a censure of the entire policy of the Government, but I do personally believe that the back money in this award should be met or that an undertaking should be given that it would be met in the future.  I, personally, feel as an Independent Deputy that I cannot support the motion not to pay that back money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is rather a pity that we should be engaged discussing this matter which is undoubtedly a very important matter from every aspect. I speak on this as one who has had a good deal of experience in cases that went to arbitration.  We have often been accused by industrialists in many parts of the country that we would not accept arbitration on many vital matters which were pending as a result of long disputes.  On a few occasions we did agree to arbitration. The arbitration resulted in a most unsatisfactory way for those whom I represented at the time.  Despite, however, the unsatisfactory result of the arbitration, so far as we were concerned, we loyally accepted the findings of the arbitration even though we were dead against them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is a serious matter for the Government&mdash;I do not mind what Government is in power&mdash;that that is the practice it is now sought to introduce as far as the Civil Service is concerned.  I would like to remind the House that there is a vital principle <Col N="216" /> involved here, apart from the question of arbitration.  There is the question of the justice of the claims of those who are looking for an increase in their salaries and wages.  Of 5,405 part-time civil servants, there are 4,675 receiving under £4 per week; there are 150 receiving between £4 and £6 per week, and 580 receiving over £6 per week. Of the 26,747 whole-time civil servants, 2,500 have under £4 a week; 8,500 have between £4 and £6 a week; 7,600 have between £6 and £8 a week and 2,800 have between £8 and £10 a week.  I have often had to represent workers and I have experience of this matter. The arbitration board awarded civil servants on £4 a week an increase of 8/9 per week.  I am speaking now quite impersonally about the whole matter. Imagine an increase of 8/9 a week to a man who is earning £4 a week at the present time, with the present purchasing value of £4.  Imagine also an increase of 11/- a week to a man earning £6 a week at present.  When we are speaking on this matter it is well to bear in mind that, within the past 13 months, an agreement was reached between the employers of this country and the trade unions that a minimum increase of 12/6 a week should be given to all workers in view of the rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat many of the arguments which have been advanced by other speakers in favour of payment of the award from the 1st November last and for that reason I suggest that the Government should end this matter by observing their obligations to the civil servants who are just as much entitled to justice as the industrial workers.  A sum of £900,000 back pay in respect of the period from 1st November last to 31st March last which was awarded by an impartial tribunal, is the cause of all this debate and, in fairness, the Government should abide by the award of the arbitration tribunal and honour it in full.  The House has heard the figures which I have quoted.  In view of the fact that there are so many lowly-paid civil servants who are finding it increasingly difficult to exist on their present salaries, the Minister should pay the back money in respect of the period in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently, among the farming community, there has been a good deal of criticism of the Government in relation to their giving this award to the civil servants.  In the journal of Macra na Feirme, the young farmers' organisation, there is a very sharp criticism of the Government for abandoning, as the article alleges, the stand which the Government had taken in regard to the payment of this arbitration award.  I think that the writer of that article seems to be under a misapprehension.  The Government did not take the stand that the award would not be met but they postponed coming to a decision until the Budget.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House proposes that this award shall be granted as and from the beginning of the financial year.  I think that, in so adjusting the salaries of officials, the Government are endeavouring to meet the situation arising from the increased cost of living.  There has been a good deal of condemnation of the Government by members of the Opposition in regard to the increased cost of living. Apparently those people who charge the Government with an increase of 20 per cent., 21 per cent. or 22 per cent. in the cost of living ignore the fact that the cost of living increased by 11 per cent. before the change of Government and that, since the change of Government, there has been an increase of approximately the same amount, that is, 11 per cent.  Nevertheless, it is an increase and it must be taken into account.  While many people who are not dependent on State salaries or incomes and who have to pay rates and taxes may resent this concession, I think it is justifiable.  The people who are voting against this motion are, apparently, trying to face both ways.  They are trying to prevent civil servants from getting this overdue increase and at the same time they are probably trying to pose as standing for it.</P>

      <P>I would not put Deputy Hickey into that category of persons. That kind of trickery is only operated by some of the slicker leading <Col N="218" /> members of the main Opposition Party. For example, Deputy McGilligan suggested that the defeat of this motion would imply the payment of the full award to civil servants.  I do not think that that suggestion could be sustained.  This motion must be passed in order to give the civil servants the award which the Government propose to give them.  Therefore, I see no reason to vote against the motion.</P>
      <P>I heartily approve of the manner in which Deputy Kyne, for example, met this question.  He said that he was prepared to vote for increased taxation in order to provide the necessary funds for the payment of the back money. Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll also adopted the same fair and honourable attitude.  It should be accepted by all fair-minded members of this House&mdash; although it is not accepted by the main Opposition Party &mdash; that the Government cannot increase expenditure without increasing taxation.  A question which arises in this connection is whether or not it would be of any great benefit to civil servants generally to pay the award as from the 1st November last and at the same time to increase taxation.  After all, it is inevitable that the burden of that increased taxation would fall upon the people who would be receiving the additional money.  I think that the view taken by the Government that taxation has reached its limit and ought not, under any circumstances, be increased is correct.  Inside the limits of the existing revenue, I think it is the duty of the Government, as far as possible, to meet the just demand of employees and I think that that is what is being done under this particular motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much mention has been made during the course of this debate to part-time civil servants.  Their position is difficult and, to a great extent, unenviable. Last week we heard a former Minister express his anxiety to get back into office in order to dismiss a number of those part-time civil servants.  That expression of vindictiveness on the part of the ex-Minister concerned is an indication to this House of the jeopardy in which those part-time civil servants stand and of the insecurity of their position.  Now that this <Col N="219" /> increase in salary is being given as awarded by the arbitration board, I hope an effort will be made to give further security to a larger number of civil servants, to put them into an established position so that they can feel secure and feel that they will not be hurled out of office because someone has allowed a song to be recited on Radio Éireann in regard to the battle of Baltinglass or a matter of that kind.</P>
    <P>It is time we ought to respect the employees of this State and treat them with due regard.  I do not agree personally with the general principle of arbitration as between the Government and civil servants.  Other machinery should be established for the adjustment of salaries and wages of State employees.  The Government's position in regard to their employees should be that of an arbitration board as between the taxpayer and the employees of the State, and no other body should intervene.  In the event of a fluctuation in the value of money or if there were increases or decreases in the cost of living, there should be an automatic adjustment of wages and salaries up or down according as the cost of living fluctuates.  I do not think it is right for any Government to delegate to a completely outside and independent body a function so important as this, which involves a very large amount of public expenditure and implies the imposition of a very considerable amount of taxation.</P>
    <P>I hope something of that nature will be done in the future and that the precedents which were set up by another Government, of delegating every awkward question to some outside body, will not be followed in the future; that instead, we will have a regular and ordered system of dealing not only with public finances but with employment in the State service and with the management and administration of the country generally.  If salaries are fixed for State employees on their appointment and if the value of money alters in the course of that employment, there ought to be machinery by which that salary is automatically adjusted in accordance with the rise or fall in the value of money.</P>

      <P>I consider that the speech from Deputy Cogan was completely dishonest in relation to the facts.  He mentioned that this motion proposes to give the terms of the award and date it from the 31st March and that if it were defeated to-day in the Dáil the civil servants would not be paid the award, because this motion was defeated.  Deputy Cogan went further to say that the Fine Gael Party would not honour the award&mdash;in spite of the fact that a clear statement was made by Deputy McGilligan that, in the event of the defeat of the Government on this issue and in the event of a change of Government, the civil servants would be given justice in this matter.  That is a clear statement on record.  Then we have Deputy Cogan coming in here trying to twist the position so far as the Opposition Parties are concerned.</P>
      <P>It was well known when the Budget of 1952 was introduced that it was going to create difficulties for all sections of the community.  At that time an effort was made to depress the wages of the workers by asking them not to seek increases, but it was natural that when the cost of living did rise we had the Tánaiste some time later saying that in the ordinary way these people by negotiation would balance the position by seeking increases in pay.  The civil servants are also people who must depend on their earnings from one month to another and they are entitled to compensation in relation to the rise in the cost of living.  We heard Deputy Cogan trying to weaken the claim by saying the cost of living had gone up only by about 11 per cent. in the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know very well that, apart from the steep rise in the cost of living since the Budget of 1952, the purchasing power of the £ has dropped approximately 1/6 during that time.  If we multiply that by £4 or £5 a week, we can add that loss on to the steep rise in the cost of living.  Deputy Cogan offered the argument that the taxation limit has been reached and that has been made clear by the Government and their attitude in relation to it is clear.  But I remember that, since the date on which the Taoiseach mentioned <Col N="221" /> that the taxation limit was reached, several increases in taxation have taken place.  Wireless licences were increased by 7/6 within a week of his statement.</P>

I do not believe it will be delivered here during the next 12 months.  I do not believe it can be delivered here; so that money will be there then to pay the arbitration award.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that the claim for this increase was established.  By putting their case before the arbitrator, the civil servants left themselves open either to win or lose.  It cannot be said they won their case very well but they succeeded in getting an award. Whether this motion is defeated here or not to-day, I believe we will probably have a change of Government and in that event we will be in a position to pay the award in full. There is no point in Deputy Cogan or anyone else saying that if this motion is defeated it means we are voting against an increase for civil servants.  It means that we are voting <Col N="222" /> against the principle of giving them only half of what they are entitled to and that we are voting for the principle of giving them their full rights.</P>

      <P>Just before the Minister speaks, I would like to make a few remarks.  Much has been said about the merits and demerits of this motion.  We must take into account two categories, those who will have to meet such an award and those who receive it.  Since the last Budget there has been a good deal of talk on the Government side, particularly by the Minister for Finance, about the grandiose schemes he has in mind.  At one moment he says he must cut down expenditure, that he must save, and he holds himself up as being the protector of the taxpayer.  At the same time, he has his two hands down to his elbows in the taxpayers' pockets.  The taxpayer is getting to know all this and to realise that the Minister's hands are in his pockets.  It is all very well to talk about throwing these huge sums of money around, but we must take into account that there are in this country quite a vast number of people who have to foot every bill and who have no means of increasing their own incomes.  Self-employed people form the vast majority of the people of the country&mdash;small farmers, small shopkeepers, tradesmen, hackney car men both in the city and down the country, men making a living with their lorries or tractors, men with small public-houses. There are 101 others I could mention who have been virtually put out of business.  The Minister told us yesterday that this award was the equivalent of a tax of 3d. per lb. on sugar.  In view of the peculiar statements which the Minister has accustomed himself to making of late, one does not know whether to believe him, but we have to accept his statement as being truthful.  If he tells us that this award means an additional taxation of 3d. on the lb. of sugar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are quite a number of people in this country who have no means of increasing their incomes and who have been virtually put out of business by the action of the Minister in increasing taxation.

Clann na Talmhan are opposing this motion, but I want to make it perfectly clear that we are opposing it for reasons which are the direct opposite of those put forward by other speakers on this side. I do not see the reason for the laughter and I will give way to the Minister if he will explain the reason for it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating the reasons why we are opposing the motion.  Before any Government can find money to give to one man, they must take it from another and we must take into account the question of justice to both sides, and not merely to one side.  I hope that is clear to Deputy Corish, who was long enough a Parliamentary Secretary to have got that into his head.  That is the reason we are opposing it.  If the Minister could bring in a motion which would improve the lot of the lower paid civil servants, we would feel like supporting it, but we are definitely opposed to the attitude of the present Government in making fat salaries fatter and we are voting against the motion for that reason.  I hope that is clear.  We must take into account the vast number of people who have no means of increasing their income.  We must take these into account.  I do not agree with the Minister having his hand in people's pockets so deep as that.</P>

      <P>The cost of living has increased for civil servants and all alike.  It is a deliberate policy which <Col N="226" /> the Minister has put forward.  It is not his own policy but a policy he is getting from sources behind the scenes. I believe the Fianna Fáil Party at the present time have not enough brains to put forward a vigorous constructive policy of their own.  Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish know that the Minister for Finance and his colleagues have followed the advice that was pumped into us or was tried to be pumped into us for three and a half years and rejected while we were the Government.  They are putting it forward as their policy.  The policy the people are getting at the present time is not a Fianna Fáil policy; it is a policy of people behind the scenes and they are dancing like puppets at the end of strings to the music of certain people whom the public do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion has taken an extraordinary form.  I have listened to speakers from all the Parties giving the views of their Parties in this House.  While I believe that the Government should have given the award back to November, as recommended to them, I cannot understand the attitude of certain political Parties in this House.  It has been stated here by all Parties that civil servants should be kept out of politics, that <Col N="227" /> politics should be kept away from the Civil Service.  Straightway all the political Parties proceeded to dump the Civil Service into the political arena and tried to make political capital out of their difficulties.</P>
      <P>There are parts of Deputy Blowick's statement with which I am in complete agreement.  One part of his statement was in connection with the lower paid civil servants.  I am all for justice with regard to that section of the civil servants.  I have very little sympathy for the higher paid officials.  I have taken this attitude before outside this House in a local authority.  I have tried on several occasions to impress on the county manager and others the need for increasing the salaries of the lower paid employees.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary thing about this motion is that the higher and lower civil servants are all lumped together and if we decide to object to the increase for the higher civil servants we automatically rule out the increase to those in the lower categories.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kyne stated here that if a dispute is brought before the Labour Court and the Labour Court makes a recommendation that a certain increase in wages be given, if the employers are not agreeable to give that increase, the worker can avail of the strike weapon in order to obtain his rights.  The Civil Service have no rights to strike action and, consequently, their claim should at all times receive very thorough, very careful and sympathetic examination from whatever Government is in power seeing that there is no alternative method by which the service can press their claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to take refuge behind any technical rules of this House with regard to voting but I do suggest that the Civil Service will not gain very much if the Government is beaten on this issue to-day.  We have had the opinions of the various members of the inter-Party Government here.  First of all, we had Deputy McGilligan on behalf of Fine Gael who stated that he would make it a matter of principle before he would take part in any other Government <Col N="228" /> that the Civil Service award would be implemented in full and that the back pay would be given.  I understood him to say that here yesterday. On the other hand, Deputy Blowick, who has a substantial Party in this House and can influence decisions with regard to the formation of a Government in no uncertain manner, stated here to-day that he is against giving this back pay to the Civil Service.  In other words, the Clann na Talmhan Party is against giving increases to the Civil Service.  That is a point of view and it was made clearly and in a straightforward manner by the Leader of the Party.</P>
    <P>How are the members of the inter-Party group to reconcile their differences of opinion so that the Civil Service will have a clear indication as to where they stand in case of an election within the next month?  I want to have that clear as an Independent.  I am not affected as a civil servant but I would like the civil servants to know where they stand.  If we have within the ranks of the Opposition at the moment anything but agreement on the propects of an increase in civil servants' salaries, how can anybody in this House decide what the future holds for them?</P>
    <P>I am interested in what may be a legal aspect.  A prominent member of the Opposition stated last night that he would not take part in any other Government unless this back pay, as it has been described, were given to the civil servants.  Supposing the Government fell on this issue&mdash;there is none of us so innocent as to think that if they fell they would not go to the country; I believe they would&mdash;and the Opposition got back into power, the particular individual who made that statement last night would be faced with the position that he has given a promise which would mean that the lower civil servants would get approximately £10 to £12 back pay to November and that the higher civil servants would be entitled to approximately £25 to £30 back pay.  I wonder how the electorate will accept that, if it is put before them in an election campaign: &ldquo;If you return such-and-such a Deputy as Minister he will give <Col N="229" /> you £30 back pay; you will get a present of £30 if such-and-such a Party are returned to office&rdquo;?  That is a form of political bribe.  I would like that matter to be examined.  If bribes are offered to the electorate, if they are offered a £30 bribe to give a vote to a certain individual or a certain Party, the Party concerned are in a very serious position.  I have always understood that, according to electoral law, bribes are prohibited and that the candidate or Party that would be guilty of seeking votes by bribes would lose the deposit and could not be returned to the House.  It sounded very much to me last night as though this was a form of bribe being offered to the civil servants: put us back and you will get £25 to £30.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not worrying about dance-hall proprietors.  I am talking about the people going before the electorate.  If there is a general election, that is an important point to remember.  In case any Deputy on the Opposition or the Government side may think I am afraid of a general election I can tell him that I am not.  But, if I have to face a general election, I want to do so on something that will be of the utmost importance to all sections of the community, whether they be farmers, labourers or civil servants.  Let there be a fundamental issue where employment and work will be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that, with all the talk about back pay for civil servants, there has not been one word about an increase in the allowance for the unemployed, and their numbers are not decreasing.  A lot of people in this House are living in cuckoo-land at the moment, trying to make political capital out of certain difficulties of sections of the community. If the Opposition are serious about pinning this Government to an issue, why do they not pin them on a fundamental issue such as unemployment and emigration?  Then we will have something clear to go before the people, something on which we can <Col N="230" /> ask them whether they are for this type of policy or for that type of policy. The issues are not clear at all to the people if they are asked at the present time to decide whether or not civil servants should get back pay to November.  That is something in which the people down the country, believe it or not, have very little interest.</P>
    <P>Apart from all that, I think it is a serious thing for any Government which goes to the trouble of setting up an arbitration board, if a recommendation is made to them to pay a certain amount, that unless exceptional circumstances arise the recommendation should be honoured.  I personally cannot see any great or grave reason why the Government could not honour the recommendation and give the award back to November.  I should like to add my voice to the group that have already spoken asking, even at this late stage, that the Government should reconsider the decision and pay this back money.  I do not, however, propose to vote against the motion for the reason that I have little confidence that the civil servants will get any better treatment at the hands of any other group.</P>
    <P>It has been clearly pointed out to-day in the speech of Deputy Blowick that he and his Party have given serious consideration to this matter and that they believe that no increases should be given to civil servants at the present time and that he and his Party are totally opposed to giving the back money to the civil servants.  That means that the unfortunate group who are seeking the back pay do not know where they stand now, because there is no united Opposition there to which they can turn and plead their case.  I believe that, in the circumstances, it would be much wiser to press on the Government the desirability of accepting the award as suggested rather than putting this matter to a vote of the House and leaving the general public more mixed up than they are at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with Deputy Blowick in the remarks he made with regard to this motion. We can claim that we have created a <Col N="231" /> stir inasmuch as we have made clear our view in regard to this matter. Coming from a rural constituency, I can say that the phrase &ldquo;Civil Service&rdquo; is given a completely different interpretation in the rural districts from what is given to it here.  Very few people down the country appreciate or understand that a postman comes under that description or an ordinary soldier in the Army or a policeman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish and others may raise a question as to whether these men should be considered and how far their meagre allowance goes to meet the present cost of living.  We have always sponsored in this House the claims and the rights of the rural postman who has to push his bicycle through country villages and boreens and who is earning his living hard.  The policeman also is performing an important duty and the ordinary rank and file in the Army are discharging their duties.  Our objection is to the &ldquo;brass-hats,&rdquo; whether in the Army or the police force or the Post Office or any other Department of State because, when an award is made on a percentage basis, while the ordinary rank and file get only a few miserable shillings weekly of an increase others will draw up to £100 a year as a result of that award.  Our objection is to that.  It is for that reason that we could not in justice agree with the motion and that we are going to oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Kyne making a very able contribution as a Labour representative and to Fine Gael speakers making their able contributions. But, as ordinary men, which I assume they are, I wonder why they cannot draw a distinction and make a case which would be more proper to the circumstances.  The Minister and the Government should know that there is a hue and cry against increased expenditure; that there is a feeling abroad that people in certain positions are not entitled to any further increase.  If you refer them to <Col N="232" /> the increased cost of living, they will tell you very quickly that the salaries which these officials enjoy are in excess of what they are entitled to and that that excess is quite sufficient to meet the increased cost of living for the past two years.  There is a lot of sense in that.</P>
    <P>A lot of people employed by the State have salaries which are beyond what the community can afford to pay. If the community could afford it, I would not begrudge £50,000 to any man, but we must cut our cloth according to measure and take into consideration the many thousands of people in this country who are ekeing out a bare existence on small economic holdings somewhere in Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Kerry, Clare or elsewhere. When I, as a rural Deputy, take into consideration how hard it is for these people to exist, I could not justify supporting a motion which would mean increases for men who are living in comfortable circumstances.  That is my objection to the whole thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan speaks about the differences that exist between Clann na Talmhan on the one hand and Fine Gael and Labour on the other hand.  If Deputy McQuillan looks through the records of the House over the past ten or 11 years, since I had the honour of being a representative here, he will appreciate that although these three Parties have their differences in regard to policy, they were able to put aside certain differences and form a good Government for three years from 1948 to 1951; and Deputy McQuillan himself helped the formation of that Government. Notwithstanding the views I am expressing this evening and notwithstanding the difference between my views and those which will perhaps be expressed by Deputy Dillon or Deputy General MacEoin or any other Deputy on the Labour or Fine Gael Benches, I have no doubt if we had an election to-morrow morning, the Opposition, if they got the opportunity, would be able to form a Government and prepare a programme on which they could work. That is not beyond the wit of man nor is it beyond the wit of the main Opposition Parties here.</P>

I see the point of view of the Labour Deputies and I appreciate the difficulties of Deputies from cities like Cork and Dublin in relation to a motion of this kind, but it would be well that they would recognise this fact.  Although our Party has, time and again, been labelled as being conservative and sectional, having one outlook and one interest, that is not so.  My outlook is neither sectional nor conservative.  I am prepared to consider the whole community of workers and the paying capacity of the community.  I am prepared to mete justice out to them.  It is because I think this motion on the Order Paper, for which the approval of this House is sought, is not going to do that, that I oppose it.  I am opposing it not for the reasons expressed by some of the Deputies on this side of the House, but for the reasons expressed by the Leader of our Party, Deputy Blowick.</P>

      <P>I would like to appeal to the Government at this late stage to honour the bond that was entered into and to accept the award. The fact that an arbitration board was set up means goodwill on both sides to secure a reasonable decision upon a dispute.  For a long time nearly every person in this House has advocated arbitration to settle disputes upon all types of matters.  We will even go further and say that in the international field arbitration could settle some of the outstanding problems that are disturbing the world to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a Government agrees to the appointment of an arbitrator and the establishment of an arbitration board, as this commission was, it does, on its face, make people believe that the decision of the arbitrator would be <Col N="234" /> accepted.  The Government were satisfied with the arbitrator.  I want to stress the point that the State servants in this case are not only the people working in Government offices, but the Army, the Civic Guards, teachers, postmen, and so on, and this matter affects every single one of them.</P>
    <P>The Government apparently in opposing any increase did not make the case that there was no increase in the cost of living or that the civil servants were not entitled to that increase.  The only case they made was that owing to the financial stringency that then existed, the Government could not pay. The chief officer of the Department of Finance gave evidence that the finances of the State were at a low ebb, that revenue was not coming in or coming up to expectations.  There was no case that they were not entitled to it; the case that was made was that the Government could not see their way to meet it.  They made the case that they could not meet it in the year.  You could understand that although I for one do not accept it because, as was very fully and properly pointed out by Deputy McGilligan, the former Minister for Finance, there were ample funds, and there are ample funds, available to meet this award from November. There is the carry-over of £2,800,000, from which the Government proposes to take £400,00&mdash;correctly, I say&mdash;for the purchase of warlike stores.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it is just as good a phrase as any because when you buy a rifle it is not to stir your tea with it.  When the Minister makes an interjection like that it shows how flippant he is towards any suggestions made.  I am trying to <Col N="235" /> help everybody in this particular matter.  I suggest that the Minister and the Government would have nothing to be ashamed of in reversing the decision taken and giving effect to the award.  There is nothing wrong with the Government changing its mind as a result of argument.  If argument is no use then we have failed as a deliberative assembly and it means that there is no point in arguing, because no matter what you say, if the Government have made up their minds nothing will change it.</P>
      <P>Take the purchase of the Constellations that was proposed.  There was £600,000 taken up out of the reserve that was left, and the Tánaiste said deliberately that it would not cost the taxpayer one penny because the money was there to buy these Constellations. Similarly to honour this arbitration award does not cost the taxpayer one penny to-day because out of this carry-over they could pay the £900,000 involved, if it is that much, and still have over £500,000 in reserve.  The former Minister for Finance last night was quite positive that had we remained in office that would be the amount of the carry-over we would have, a sum of £500,000, and that that is enough.</P>
      <P>I want to stress that I think the Government is not doing a good day's work when they dishonour and reject the arbitrator's award.  They set up this arbitration and it was reasonable to believe when the arbitrator had come to a decision, the Government would give effect to it and that that would be the headline which the Government would set, not only to employers and to employees but to other countries&mdash;that where matters in dispute are referred to arbitration, the arbitrator's decision would be honoured and taken as final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the old Sinn Féin days one of the fundamental principles of Sinn Féin policy was that all disputes should be settled by arbitration.  That principle has been given effect to, so far as the Civil Service is concerned, by setting up an arbitration board and to a certain extent also in the case of the Labour Court, only that in that case <Col N="236" /> it is not full arbitration but it is the nearest thing to it.  When the arbitrator makes his report&mdash;and nobody can say that in this case he was favourable to one side more than to the other because it was a reasonable award&mdash;I cannot see why the Government would not accept it.  I would appeal to them even at this late stage to reverse their decision and to give effect to it.  By doing so they will show courage in handling the problem and in coming to the conclusion that, whatever the difficulties were that made them decide prior to this that they would not honour it, having heard the arguments for and against the award they would now decide to honour their bond.  In that way they will be setting a good headline and will create a feeling of confidence that any system of arbitration set up in future will give the result that everybody expects from arbitration.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into the failure of some cases of arbitration in the past under Government auspices.  It is a significant fact that where land was acquired under Emergency Powers Orders and a dispute arose as to the compensation to be paid, when an arbitrator decided the price, that was final and binding on all sides.  That being the case why should that principle not be allowed to continue to operate?</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion that this Parliament in open forum can never be guilty of bribery, when members of it declare in public that if in the future they have responsibility they are prepared to take certain steps on the faith of a public declaration of policy which has been well accepted over the years. This Government came into office on a 17-point programme.  The fact is that not only did they not honour them but that they ran away from some of them. Be all that as it may, I still appeal to the Government to reconsider the matter and to honour this award which affects many lowly-paid civil servants, the Army&mdash;I am specially interested in it from that point of view&mdash;and the Guards.  I am also interested in it from their point of view.  I believe the honouring of this award from November will give us a satisfied Civil Service, a satisfied Army, a satisfied police force and a satisfied body of <Col N="237" /> teachers.  Is it not worth it?  The money involved is of no account compared with the security of having a satisfied, energetic and able Civil Service, Army and police force doing the nation's work as we want them to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Forcible feeding is, I gather, an unpleasant experience and I think it cannot be commended on humanitarian grounds.  It seems to me that we should ask you, Sir, to convey to the Leader of the Clann na Talmhan Party our sincere sympathy for the maltreatment which he appears to have received at the hands of his colleagues. The reason I make the suggestion is that Deputy Blowick's statement in the House to-day in regard to this motion was in direct contradiction to the statement which he made here in this House so recently as the 7th May last, in regard to this question of the arbitration award.  To-day Deputy Blowick told us that he was going to vote against the motion which the Government has put on the Order Paper on the grounds that he thought that nothing whatever should be paid to the Civil Service in present circumstances. That was not what Deputy Blowick said on the 7th May.  I propose to quote from Volume 138, column 1394, in which the Deputy is reported as having stated in relation to this matter:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With regard to the Government's announcement of its intention to do something about the Civil Service award, my opinion is that the Government have done serious damage to the morale of the whole Civil Service by their action in this matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then he went on, as reported later in the same column, to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Civil Service claimed they had a grievance and the Government claimed they had not and the case went to the arbitration board, before which both sides fought their case through their representatives.  Evidently the final award was not in keeping with the Government's wishes and the next thing the Government do is to say: &lsquo;It does not <Col N="238" /> matter two hoots what the award is&mdash; to the devil with it.  When it was not in our favour we are going to disregard it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on later, as reported in column 1395, to remark:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They were left so long in the balance that a great number of them feel that they have been badly cheated and meanly treated by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, Deputy Blowick's quarrel with the Government is that it is not cheating the Civil Service sufficiently badly and not treating them sufficiently meanly.  For that reason, the Deputy and his Party propose to vote against the motion.  There is one thing at any rate that would appear in the light of these circumstances: even if the division on this motion should be followed by a general election, we shall not have a Coalition Government to succeed us because Deputy McGilligan, speaking on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, and Deputy Norton, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, pledged the honour of themselves and their Party, whatever that honour may be worth and whatever Deputy Blowick may do, that they would not help to constitute any Government which would merely give effect to this award but would not go further and make payment of the award operative as from the 1st November last.  On the other hand, I understand from Deputy Blowick that he will not enter into any Government that does propose to give effect to the award.  As I say, the country is now in the happy situation that the people can face the next general election with a certain amount of equanimity knowing there will not be a Coalition Government to oust a responsible Government from these benches and knowing that henceforth there will not be the same sort of collective irresponsibility in Government that characterised the administration of the Coalition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested we are not treating the public servants sufficiently generously.  In <Col N="239" /> that regard we have to bear in mind what it will cost the taxpayer to give effect to the proposed motion.  Let me emphasise again that if it were not for the desire of the Government to concede in the fullest measure possible consistent with its responsibilities to the taxpayer the demand of the public servants to have their position in relation to the cost of living adjusted we should be able in this year to reduce the price of beer by one penny per pint, the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes by one penny and to take 6d. in the £ off income-tax.  That is what giving effect to the Government's proposal in this instance means. Apparently that is not sufficient for the members of the Fine Gael Party, whether they represent a rural or an urban constituency, or for the members of the Labour Party, whether they represent certain Civil Service unions or whether they represent remote rural constituencies in, say, County Cork, because they want us to go further and, on top of this £2,400,000, they want us to give an additional £1,000,000 to the public servants.  That is what they want us to do and they have gone so far in regard to this matter as to say in effect that nothing else in this country counts except the general satisfaction of the personnel of the public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In most independent States, in those communities where men wish to live as free men and to preserve the rights and liberties they have inherited or secured for themselves, the question of national defence is in the very forefront of public concern.  It is the first thing to which nations which are worthy of the freedom they enjoy are prepared to devote the public resources. What have we heard in the course of this debate?  We have heard the ex-Taoiseach, a gentleman who perhaps aspires to be once again head of a Government in this country, claim here that before there should be any question of buying a single gun, a single piece of defensive equipment or a single warlike store for the defence of this country the demands of the Civil Service should be met.  I suggest that that raises a very big issue, as I have <Col N="240" /> said.  When one hears a statement like that coming from the Leader of the Opposition, a former Taoiseach, an aspiring head&mdash;not a prospective head &mdash;of another Government, one might well be filled with alarm as to the future of this country.  One can now understand why it was that in the year 1949, in the very year when they were firing off salvos of guns down in the Customs House and purporting to declare this Republic a republic for the second time, they only spent £64,000 on the wherewithal to defend this Republic they were so loudly proclaiming; and that procedure was repeated in the year 1950. Now, it is not much of a republic that is only worth £64,000 a year, but that was the sort of attitude, that was the frame of mind and that was the spirit in which our predecessors approached their responsibilities in regard to national defence and that is the spirit apparently which animates them still in regard to national defence.

We have had to make good to the extent to which it was possible with our resources mortgaged up to the hilt by all the commitments the inter-Party Government left behind them the shortages in defensive equipment.  We have tried to make good the deficiencies we found in our national defence.  We have not been able to overtake the arrears.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan, speaking last night, said that he was going to speak on behalf of the 63,000 State personnel.  I do not for a moment suggest that the interest of those who serve the State loyally and well should not receive fair consideration and just consideration at the hands of the Government.  When we took office in 1932 we were faced with a very difficult choice.  I think we made a wise choice.  We took the men who served under our predecessors and gave them the same liberty and fair dealing as we would have wished our predecessors had given to us and to those who supported us when we were in opposition.  They may have supported <Col N="242" /> our opponents, but that did not make any difference to us; whether for or against us, they were all one. We have defended them from the criticisms of our own friends, from the misrepresentations that were directed against them.  We have always endeavoured to be fair to the public servants.</P>
      <P>In addition, however, to these 63,000 public servants for whom Deputy McGilligan spoke, there are at least 2,750,000 other people living in this country and it is with them, I suggest, that Dáil Éireann is primarily concerned. It is with due regard to the just claims of the public servants, on the one hand, to be dealt with fairly by the State and, on the other hand, to the ability and the readiness of the taxpayers to meet the burden of the public services that we have got to try to do justice as between the two sections.</P>
      <P>I submit that the motion and the decision which the Government has taken in regard to this matter is one which is fair and just in all the circumstances. We have said that until our economic condition improves, until there has been an increase in production which will enable the State to carry a heavier burden, the limit of taxation has been reached.  We have accepted that but within that overriding figure we are prepared to do justice, as I said, to the servants of the State but we are not prepared, as I said last night, to borrow and we are not prepared, in the present circumstances, to increase the rates of taxation in order to provide any more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that from many points of view, particularly from the point of view of the public servants, a very unfortunate and misguided line has been taken by the main Opposition Parties in this House, by the Fine Gael Party and by the Labour Party  because they have endeavoured to maintain the thesis that the interest of the public servants in the State must be paramount.  They have, therefore, tried to create a cleavage between the servants of the State on the one hand <Col N="243" /> and the people on the other.  They have tried to create a conflict of interest between the State servants on the one hand and the people on the other, the people who have to pay and who are taxed in order to pay the public servants.</P>
      <P>A great deal has been said about the increase in the cost of living.  I think that, when that point was raised by Deputy Norton, he ought to have remembered that if heavy taxation had to be imposed in the Budget for 1952, at least £2,500,000 or £3,000,000 of that taxation was necessitated by the fact that the findings of the 1951 arbitration had been given full effect to and that, therefore, if there had been an increase in the cost of living arising either out of the additional taxation which has been imposed or by the economies which were forced on the Government these were in some measure consequent upon the fact that the remuneration of the Civil Service and those who were remunerated out of Government funds had been increased.</P>
      <P>There is at least this difference between the public servants and the ordinary employees.  The ordinary employee does not live on taxation but the public servant does.  He lives on the casses and taxes which are levied on the producing elements in the community in order to maintain the public services.  Therefore, a very clear line can be drawn between the public servant and the ordinary private individual and taxpayer.  When discussing these matters, in justice to the ordinary individual who is taxed in order to find the salaries of the public servants we must not overlook that fact.  We cannot have it both ways&mdash;the sort of vicious circle that Deputy Norton wants us to follow&mdash;increase taxation in order to pay increased remuneration to public servants and therefore, public servants could come along and put in a further demand.</P>

That is a circumstance of their employment over which they have no control but it is a circumstance that we, representing the taxpayers of this country in this House, cannot overlook.  That is what we are here for.  We are not here, as Deputy McGilligan boasted, to represent 63,000 public servants.  Deputy McGilligan has not 63,000 public servants in the constituency which he represents in Dublin&mdash;not by any means.  Nor has Deputy Hickey, Deputy Corish nor Deputy Kyne.  Not at all.  They have there the rank and file of the workers, the employers and the people who are trying to make a living in this country and carrying the whole burden of the State personnel. The primary responsibility of Dáil Éireann is not to this section or that section of the people who are remunerated out of the Exchequer but to the taxpayers who have to contribute, whether they like it or not to maintain this structure.</P>

That element of unrest and uneasiness was echoed in this House by the speech which the Leader of the Clann na Talmhan Party made and also the speech in which, having endured forcible feeding at the hands of the colleagues of his own Party, he was compelled to eat and swallow his utterances on the debate on the general resolution for which he was responsible on the 7th May.</P>

It <Col N="246" /> would be well for us, while our hearts are overflowing with sympathy for the public servants, to remember the taxpayers' point of view in relation to this matter.

      <P>Let us be quite clear, because there is no use in approaching this problem in blinkers.  We had better face the facts.  I am perfectly certain that on this issue, whatever other issues the Coalition Parties might like to go to the country on, they do not want to go to it on this.</P>

      <P>Tell us about the principle of arbitration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish has asked me to refer to the principle of arbitration.  I think that quite the most cogent and perceptive statement that could be made on that matter was made by Deputy Cowan last night when he said that he had grave doubts as to whether the concession of arbitration procedure in the case of the Civil Service was constitutional or not. As a matter of fact, he is not the only one who has doubts on that matter. Our predecessors, even when they were framing the arbitration scheme which they gave later to the Civil Service <Col N="247" /> behind the backs of the electorate, had grave doubts, too, and had made it quite clear, in the negotiations with the Civil Service, that the Government could not slough off its responsibility and that Dáil Éireann would have to be the final arbiter, and that, of course, the Government, as bound under the Constitution, would have to take the responsibility of recommending to Dáil Éireann the course which should be taken in regard to any particular arbitration award.</P>
      <P>In the present scheme, Article 20 fully safeguards the constitutional position in regard to arbitration.  It does not place, and it was never intended to place, the arbitrator in the seat of responsibility which properly belongs to the Government alone. When this matter was examined, at the instance of the Government, in 1932 by a commission, this question of the constitutional position was fully gone into.  It was pointed out that the Constitution provided particular safeguards in regard to the expenditure of public money and it stated that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is a widely recognised requirement of sound public finance that the legislature in dealing with matters of public expenditure and taxation should operate under special safeguards designed to ensure a peculiar degree of responsibility in the handling of these fundamental matters.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then it went on to discuss the implications of arbitration, and it said this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;However elaborate might be the evidence submitted to an arbitration tribunal on all important aspects of the issue raised before it, it could not from its experience of casual and limited references gain that comparehensive appreciation of the administrative organisation and its problems which is possible for Ministers, having daily and intimate contact with them, to have.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It continued to say that this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...applies with still greater force to the sphere of fiscal and financial policy with which establishment matters must be correlated but upon <Col N="248" /> which it is scarcely conceivable that an arbitration tribunal could venture to hear detailed evidence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on, it said this in relation to the award of the arbitrator:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The full ultimate effect from the budgetary point of view of depriving the Executive Council of real discretion in regard to the pay of the Civil Service needs special notice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I ask Deputies to mark the words &ldquo;depriving the Government of real discretion in regard to the pay of the Civil Service needs special notice&rdquo;.  Is not that what is being pleaded for here, that the Government should be deprived of real discretion in regard to the pay of the Civil Service?  What is involved in the motion is this, that the Government is prepared to exercise its discretion and to act according to its constitutional responsibility in this matter.  Those who are saying that we are doing something shameful, something dishonourable in amending the arbitration award so as to make it conform to our view of what is in the public interest, are wanting us to throw discretion to the winds and to remove financial control from this House and vest it in an arbitration board which has no constitutional and no statutory functions.</P>
    <P>This commission to which I have referred went on to say this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It does not need any elaborate argument to indicate that if the Executive Council were to lose its present discretion for determining the pay of State employees its power to regulate the Budget might almost be rendered a nullity and it would be forced into the untenable position of having to raise taxation to an extent that would be largely outside its own control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is now the policy of the Fine Gael Party and of the Labour Party, that the people of this country should be taxed not in accordance with what the Government thinks is reasonable, not in accordance with what the Parliament of the country thinks is reasonable, but in accordance with what an arbitrator, sitting outside this <Col N="249" /> Dáil with none of the responsibilities to the people that we have to carry, thinks reasonable and just.  That is why I say that quite the most cogent criticism that we have heard in the course of this debate in regard to this whole issue was that which was made by Deputy Cowan when he doubted as to whether the concession of arbitration was in accordance with the Constitution.</P>

      <P>You can have an election if you want it.  I hope that you are not whistling to keep up your spirits.  Deputy McGilligan raised quite a number of other points.  I do not propose to go into them except to say this, that there was none of them valid, but he did expose to Dáil Éireann his manner of handling the finances of this country over a number of years.  It was the purpose of successive Ministers for Finance to build up what was known as a substantial carry-over&mdash;just the same way as a flourishing business likes to have an adequate cash balance always in hands to meet the exigencies of business demands.  Sound companies always have a substantial carry-over. It was my desire during the whole period of the economic war and it was the desire of my successors to have a substantial cash balance in hands to meet any unforeseen emergency or contingency and to obviate the need for the Exchequer to borrow money at the beginning of the financial year, during the lean period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan said he had a covetous eye on the cash balances in the hands of the Revenue Commissioners which were not surrendered to the Exchequer at the close of business on the 31st March of each financial year and that he had proposed gradually to whittle them down.  That is a very fair indication of the manner in <Col N="250" /> which the public finances of this country were managed during the three years of the Coalition.  There was not any reserve that we had built up, there was not any reserve that we were holding in hands for an unforeseen contingency that had not been dissipated by the time we resumed office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The reserve was there.  It was higher when Deputy McGilligan left office than it was when he took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It was no more and no less.  In any event, what sort of contingency was this carry-over held against?  The answer is that it was held against precisely the same sort of contingency as that for which we are going to utilise it this year&mdash;the contingency that we cannot increase taxation, that we do not want to have any unnecessary borrowing but that there is a vital national service that requires to be financed and the vital national service to which we propose to devote £500,000 of the carry-over is national defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be entirely wrong that we should allow these moneys which are held, as I said, as a reserve against a national emergency to be frittered away and dissipated in defraying expenditure which normally ought to be met out of taxation&mdash; current expenditure upon the salaries and remuneration of civil servants and other public officers.  No person in this House except, I think, Deputy Kyne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll has suggested that we should find that additional £1,000,000&mdash;that the Opposition is clamouring for&mdash;out of taxation. On the contrary, they have all been complaining that taxation is too high. How are we at the same time to be able to increase expenditure and reduce taxation, as Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Dr. ffrench O'Carroll have asked?  Everybody knows that you cannot do that.  It is entirely dishonest to try and lead the people to believe that, if we were to give effect to what the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party spokesmen are demanding, we could do it in accordance with any sort of sound public finance without increased taxation.  You are asking that we should find another £1,000,000 <Col N="251" /> out of the taxpayers' pockets for the 63,000 persons for whom, apparently, Deputy McGilligan and the Fine Gael Party now speak.  We, on the contrary, are prepared to do justice to the 63,000 people, but we also want to ensure that the interests of the taxpayers will be fully safeguarded.  We have taken our stand on the basis that taxation cannot be increased in present circumstances, that we must keep <Col N="252" /> expenditure down.  Because of that, and because we are not going to borrow to meet the cost of the public services unless they are voted capital services.  For these reasons, this motion represents the utmost to which the Government is prepared to go and the utmost that the Government in fairness to all sections of the community should be asked to do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith) Patrick Smith">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>A few points were made during the discussion of this Bill to which, I suppose, irrespective of the conviction in the minds of those who made them, I should reply.  Some Deputies, in addressing themselves to these proposals, saw nothing the matter with extending the life of local bodies from three to five years, were it not for the fact that members of local bodies had a contract with the electorate, that the contract was for a period of three years, and it was unfair to the councillors themselves and to the electorate that the period should be extended.  Councillors who held office in 1923, when the elections were postponed for a period of two years, had a contract, too, and the Bills similar to that now before the House which were introduced on the ten occasions cited by me yesterday, affected, when they became law, the then councils in the same way as the proposals we are now considering.</P>
      <P>It cannot be seriously contended that anyone ever believed, especially anyone who was a member of a local body, that a period of three years was a reasonable period or that elections should be held at intervals of three years.  Deputies who agreed with that maintained that, while the law is as it is, it is unfair, at the end of the three-year period, to come forward with these proposals.  The only occasion on which this House attempted to rectify that position was the occasion of the passage of the Local Government Act of 1947, introduced by the present Minister for Finance, a measure which contained a proposal to extend the life of county councils to five years and, in certain circumstances, to six years. That Bill passed through all its stages here and went to the Seanad.  Two amendments were proposed in the Seanad and, in the meantime, an election intervened.  That was an occasion when the Minister for Local Government recognised something which had been admitted in actual practice all down the years, that the period was far too short.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noticed here last night&mdash;there is no reason why I should complain about it, and I am not in fact complaining about it&mdash;that most of the Deputies from the other side who contributed by way of criticism of the proposal were people who were not themselves members of local bodies.  Some who are serving members did offer some criticism and opposition, but, in the main, the criticism came from people who were not elected members and who had during their lives very little experience of and little contact, if any, with local bodies.  The request in this regard has been made to me by the municipal bodies and, over a period of years, by the General Council of <Col N="255" /> County Councils, and during the discussion here on a Bill introduced by one of my predecessors in this office, the late Mr. Murphy, to extend the life of the then county councils from 1948 to 1950 and making provision for holding elections in Kerry and in Dublin, Deputy O'Higgins, who had nothing in the way of praise to say of this measure, appealed to the then Minister to accede to the request being made to extend the life of councils beyond the period of three years which he said he regarded as entirely too short.  On a previous occasion, Deputy Donnellan, speaking in the debate on the Vote for Local Government, at column 1104, Volume 106 of the Dáil Debates, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I wish to refer to another matter.  I intended to put down a question but then I decided to wait for the Estimate.  I refer to the election of local bodies which is, I think, under the Minister's jurisdiction. I cannot understand why local elections are held once every three years.  I cannot see any sense or reason in it.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously that for the future the life of local bodies should be at least five years.  At the moment, under the managerial system, they have a very little control.  It is only nonsense to run these elections once every three years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could go on citing all sorts of arguments which have been advanced by every type of interest and class of organisation over an extended period in favour of something which, as I say, has been generally accepted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy dealt with the desirability of having contests, especially at a time when rates were soaring, but if one examines the position with regard to rates and compares what has happened in that regard with what has happened in regard to national taxation, one finds that the increase in rates falls very far short of the increase not only in national taxation but in many other directions.  Having regard to the enormous extension of the services, one would have to conclude that it was surprising that the <Col N="256" /> increase in rates should amount to only 140 per cent. as against 216 per cent. in the case of national taxation.  I agree that the matter of the rates and the size of the rates is a very important one, but the cost of an election, apart altogether from the cost to the individuals taking part in an election, the cost to the ratepayers who will have to provide the necessary machinery for the conduct of an election, runs to something in the neighbourhood of £100,000.  Apart from the need to make a little bit of political capital out of an issue of this kind&mdash;and I have no objection in the world to that&mdash;I cannot see that any reasonable man with experience of local bodies would raise his voice against these proposals.</P>
    <P>It is all right, of course, to taunt Deputies and the Government with the fear to face the electorate.  I do not want to pursue that line.  Some of us on both sides of the House have been here a long time and, as far as this Party is concerned, I do not think there is anything in our political history that would convey to the country, to the people at home or abroad that, even in times far worse and far more difficult than the present time, we were in any way hesitant to face the electorate.  I will not bother now to cite the occasions.</P>

      <P>When any important issue arose, as a Party, we were never found shivering in our tents, fearing to face the electorate and defend ourselves. I have no objection to members of the Opposition seizing an opportunity of this nature to do a little bit of propaganda work.  Our history as a Party is too well known for that to cause us any concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have talked about the introduction of political matters, the manner is which the elections are conducted and the way in which the business of councils is carried on.  I do not see why objections should be raised to the fact that political Parties contest elections officially.  As an individual I have no desire and never had any desire to see local elections conducted <Col N="257" /> on a political basis because I know how the work of local bodies is done and, as other members of the House have stated, whether you are elected on a political ticket or otherwise, when you become a member of a council you have to face up to the problems of that authority and it is very, very rarely that questions of a political nature arise.  I agree that when the selection of a mayor, lord mayor or chairman of a council arises or on some other few occasions, the question may undoubtedly arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, yes.  What is the difference?  What harm is there in it? It is in the general interests of the country that political Parties should take an interest in these matters because if candidates are chosen by responsible political Parties these Parties will try to get the best type of candidate and they are more likely to get such individuals if the political Party and the political machine behind them is strong.  Naturally, no individual wants to throw himself at the public, not knowing how he will be taken or what support he will secure. In the daily and other papers leader writers bend themselves to the task of criticising vehemently the idea of political contests for election to local bodies.  Even though I am not in the least fond of it, if there were some other suitable way of doing the job, I could certainly justify it and show that, far from bringing about the results these writers visualise, it has in fact the opposite effect, that political Parties will try to get the most responsible people to stand for <Col N="258" /> them and that that is all to the good ultimately in the performance of the work of these councils.</P>
      <P>I did not mention the fact that I was contemplating introducing proposals&mdash; they are not very formidable&mdash;in relation to the managerial system.  I did not want to mention that because, in 1948-49 when one of my predecessors introduced a Bill to postpone the election one of the reasons given was that it was the intention then to introduce the Bill, which never reached the Statute Book, any more than the Bill of 1947 reached the Statute Book.  Now that I have reached the stage of concluding the Second Reading debate I can say that it is my intention as soon as possible to introduce certain proposals, some of which were contained in that Bill and some of which are ideas of my own.  I cannot say when these proposals will be submitted to the House but they will be brought in here as quickly as I can do so.</P>
      <P>If I had been replying to this debate last night, when one's blood was in the right shape after hearing all the&mdash;well, I will not use the term I would perhaps apply to it under other circumstances&mdash; I would have been in much better from. Now that I have thought the matter over in my mind and being anxious to get this measure as quickly as I can and realising that this is really a Second Reading Bill&mdash;it is not a Bill that is likely to be amended; you either take it or reject it&mdash;and having cooled down quite a lot since last night, I have decided not to ruffle any skins.  I will just leave it at that and hope the House will respond to my feeble effort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The main <Col N="262" /> purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to my budgetary proposals for the coming financial year of which the Dáil has already approved by adopting the Financial Resolutions which I submitted to the House.  The Bill, in addition, covers a number of minor matters to which I will refer.</P>
      <P>Section 1, of course, is the ordinary charging section relating to income-tax and surtax.  Section 2 increases the rate of relief in respect of a premium on an insurance policy taken out after the 21st May, 1953, with any insurance company or friendly society registered, managed and controlled in the State. The rate of relief in this case will be up to two-thirds of the standard rate of income-tax instead of the former maximum of half the standard rate.</P>
      <P>Section 3 will operate to authorise the granting of a measure of relief in respect of the foreign income of certain persons, who, while formerly resident outside Ireland, have settled down in this country.  The proposed relief is confined to foreign income where in any case affected, the total tax, both here and abroad, on the foreign income is shown to be greater than the tax which would have been payable on it had the taxpayer being solely resident in the country of origin of the income.</P>
      <P>Section 4 gives effect to the new scale of entertainments duty in lieu of the scale now in operation under subsection (3), Section 10, of the Finance Act, 1948.  As I mentioned in my Budget speech, the existing scale is anomalous at several stages of its gradation.  The new scale, while removing these anomalies, avoids increasing the duty on any current admission charges and, in fact, affords some relief at the lower levels.  It may happen, however, that the existing duty under the section may be increased at some points beyond the level of the highest admission charges at present in force and to cover this purely theoretical possibility of an increased in the charge, I propose, in order to comply with the financial procedure of the House, to move an additional Financial Resolution before the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the exemption <Col N="263" /> from entertainments duty of amateur exhibitions of basket ball and cycle roller racing promoted by their respective controlling bodies or by clubs affiliated thereto.  Section 6 provides for the repayment of one-half of the entertainments duty paid in respect of entertainments which are wholly cinematographic performances and which, while not qualifying for existing exemption in respect of entertainments which are wholly of an educational character, can be said to be educational in the sense that they encourage or facilitate the study of languages.  It provides for relief where at least one-third of the entertainment consists of Irish language films or where one-half consists of films in, for example, a continental language.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that where under the existing law exemption from entertainments duty in a rural area ceases to operate by reason of a change in population, such exemption shall not cease abruptly upon the publication of a new census but shall be continued for two years after such publication.  The section also provides that as regards the 1951 Census the period of two years shall commence as from the 1st September, 1953.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a further period the continuance of certain exemptions from corporation profits tax hitherto afforded to certain public utility concerns (such as railways), to building societies and to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Section 9 provides for the postponement of payment of income-tax on foreign income where the taxpayer is unable, because of currency restrictions in the country in which the income arises, to remit the income to this country.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is merely a constructional section and is self-explanatory.  Section 11 is a section which corresponds to Financial Resolution No. 2 and is designed to combat an evasion of stamp duty by means of the exchange of land of unequal value, the difference in value being paid over in cash. Under the existing law, as I explained in my Budget statement, a transaction of this kind is not a conveyance on sale and consequently the increased <Col N="264" /> rates of stamp duty imposed some years ago may be escaped.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for a refund of stamp duty in certain cases where persons have paid stamp duty on conveyance or leases at the 25 per cent. rate and have subsequently ascertained that as they were Irish citizens at the time of executing the instrument they need have paid only at the lower rate in force for Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is an annual section which provides for the adjustment for the remaining 29 years, by reference to actual expenditure, the provisional annuity for 30 years fixed last year on the basis of the estimate for voted capital services fixed under Section 22 of the Finance Act, 1950, and further fixes provisionally the new annuity, also for 30 years in respect of the estimated expenditure on such services in 1954.  Section 14 implements the undertaking given in connection with the Fifth National Loan and which arranged that the stock of the loan would be accepted at its face value with due allowance for accrued interest in lieu of cash in the payment of death duties subject to certain conditions.  Section 15 is one which should gratify Deputy Sweetman because it provides that the 30th September will be the latest date for the presentation to the Dáil of the finance accounts instead of the 30th June as heretofore.  Section 16 is the customary section placing all taxes and duties under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  Section 17 deals with the Short Title.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very technical, formal and even cold introductory statement by the Minister, something like the hopping of the clods on a coffin after the mourners have gone and public sorrow has been eliminated. We are now apparently expected to discuss such formal matters as certain slight duty concessions, certain concessions to the people who brought the last loan with a State rate of 5 per cent. guaranteed to them, and these other minor concessions contained in the legislation known as the Finance Bill. I suppose the Minister would like to feel that all the horrible things that the <Col N="265" /> Budget carries have been passed over with the Financial Resolutions and that we can now enter on a formal debate of the provisions of this Bill and, having done so, divorce the Finance Bill from the Budget.  I do not intend to allow such a consideration to take place.  In the week-end before the Budget was introduced a Dublin newspaper produced an article under the heading &ldquo;National Terror&rdquo; and underneath they published the Minister's photograph.  It was a wise forecast but, if the article were to be rewritten now, it would probably be headed &ldquo;National Calamity&rdquo;.  It was written only in anticipation then.</P>
      <P>We now know that the particular type of economic suicide that had been carried on and forced on the community last year is to be continued and extended in all its severity for a further year.  I suppose the Minister, like all his colleagues, feels that one should put aside all thoughts of emigration and one should refrain in the coming year from accepting the flow of people out of the country as an indication of the failure of the Government to provide at home for our young men and women those opportunities of earning a livelihood which they might reasonably expect under a proper economic system.</P>
      <P>I have a cutting here from an article which appeared at a time when hopes were brighter and hearts were lighter with regard to the anxieties of the Government, particularly with regard to emigration, and when the present Taoiseach spoke in America of his anxiety on seeing the Irish people leaving their native country.  He is reported as having said that the fact which should give those interested in the future of Ireland most concern was the undiminished flood of emigration from the country.  He continued:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Within the memory of persons still living the population of Ireland has been cut down from 8,250,000 to 4,250,000.  In the 18 years, 1911-1929, 650,000 emigrants left our shores&mdash;more than the entire population of one of our four provinces and of the City of Cork combined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Out of every 100 persons born in <Col N="266" /> Ireland who were alive in 1926, 43 were living abroad.... Those who leave are almost exclusively young men and women in the prime of life and at the period of their maximum economic productivity.  No nation could face the continuance of such a drain on its vitality and hope to prosper.  Ireland's emigration has been caused by the economic policy forced upon us during the latter half of the 19th century.  The rulers of Britain set out to make their country the greatest manufacturing and trading nation of the world.  The part they designed for Ireland in their scheme was to be purveyor of cheap, fresh food for the British workers, who were being transported from the land to the mines, factory and the merchant ship.  They took care that Irish manufactures should be discouraged and handicapped both because they coveted the Irish market for British manufacturers and because they wanted the Irish people to have no alternative industry to the rearing of herds that ministered to British needs.</P>
    <P>The result is that to-day pastoral farming is Ireland's main industry, and pastoral farming requires and can maintain relatively few people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That judgement having been passed, he went on brightly to the future:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To end emigration we must end its cause.  The policy designed for the Irish people by England and in England's interests must be set aside.  Ireland must no longer be left almost entirely dependent on the raising of herds for British markets. The various needs of the home market must be supplied, as far as practicable, by home industries.</P>
    <P>The Irish Free State area alone imports each year about 170,000,000 dollars worth of goods that could be produced at home.  When we have organised ourselves to produce those goods in our own country the dearth of work which is the cause of emigration will cease.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was a simple plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give the reference in my own time.  The article goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ireland is to-day a land where mothers rear their children for export, but her economic backwardness has one advantage.  It simplifies the problem of industrial reorganisation and gives our people an unique opportunity to become pioneers on the path of social progress.  In no other country, perhaps, could the benefits of improved machinery and modern efficiency in production be so readily made available in the homes of the people.</P>
      <P>It is not for its own sake merely that Irish Republicans are striving for political liberty.  Political liberty is necessary to secure the freedom from outside interference on the stability on which economic reconstruction depends.  The ultimate aim is to give the Irish citizen&mdash;the worker and his family&mdash;the opportunity for the fullest and best line of which he is capable and which the organised resources of the nation can afford.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think &ldquo;line&rdquo; there should read &ldquo;life&rdquo;.  This appeared in a paper called <i>The Sun</i> and it is copyrighted by the United Press.  It was apparently an article written by the present Taoiseach.  The date is the 17th March, 1930 when, as I said, hopes were very bright.  The simplicity of the plan to end emigration must have been appealing to those who were so simple as to accept it.  That was 1930.  We are now in 1953, and in the year 1953 a clergyman, addressing a meeting of the Waterford branch of the Irish Union of Distributive Workers and Clerks, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The declining Irish birth rate&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;and this is 23 years afterwards with the plan, of course, in full operation in the meantime&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;one of the principal causes of which was unemployment, was particularly <Col N="268" /> alarming and as a result the Irish were becoming a vanishing race.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reverend gentleman went on to say that the Irish race had been declining for the last 100 years and, if the trend continued, in another century it would be reduced to be a handful of crocks, neurotics and so on.  The simplicity of the plan apparently did not work out or is it the case still, as it was alleged to be the case in 1930, that the Government had a plan before them which no other country had and it was only obtuseness or else political malice on their part that prevented them taking this plan down, operating it and so remedying unemployment and emigration?</P>
    <P>In the month of April in this year the census report made its appearance. It was published in the <i>Trade Journal</i> and the report shows that 78,000 farm workers have left their employment on the farms; that 78,000 is made up of labourers and the members of the farmers' families helping on the land. Seventy-eight thousand have left the land, some to England and some to look for occupation in the cities and the towns.  The next day the figures released by the Central Statistics Office caused a headline in one of the papers that the chief disclosure of the census report was that there are fewer young people in the country.  A local paper in the month of May in this year carried what it described as the alarming news that 600 people were signing on at Ballyshannon labour exchange and the figures were given to show the contrast with the previous signing on. In a Sunday paper on February 8th of this year a journalist wrote:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have seen the most depressing sight in my 24 years in journalism. It was a line of women and girls about 60 yards long, three or four deep, stretching across the roadway from the labour exchange in Victoria Street off the South Circular Road in Dublin.  There were about 400 women and girls in the queue and dotted along it were a number of prams.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The article goes into further details, but that is the opening phrase.</P>
    <P>Last year there was taken from the pockets of the taxpayers in <Col N="269" /> this country a sum of money that was represented as a saving on subsidies.  The gross figure was almost £7,000,000.  With the compensatory social benefits given back the saving from a budgetary point of view was about £4,000,000.  It was prophesied with regard to that saving that, if the workers operated their industrial power, there would merely be transferred from the taxpayer to the purchaser of goods on the industrial side the full effect as far as the industrial worker was concerned of removing these aids to the cheapness of food and, as we know, that is what has happened over the year.  It was also pointed out that local authorities would have to meet new claims from their employees and when these new claims were met, as it was expected they would have to be met, what was demanded from the ratepayer must necessarily increase.  A district justice in the last six weeks, on defaulting ratepayers being brought before him, said it had become perfectly plain in the past six months that the people who were not paying their rates were not defaulting in the strict sense of the word.  Summonses involving almost £2,000 were brought by the Dublin Corporation in respect of rates and he enumerated the classes of people which, he said, were amongst those coming before him; everybody was unable to pay and he indicated that, if he had the power&mdash;which of course he has not&mdash;to make it possible for them to pay their rates in instalments he would make such an order.</P>
    <P>The Wicklow County Manager has said that social services there are increasing in scale and in cost and the rates in Wicklow are being pushed up by the cost of the social services which they compulsorily must provide. I think that is the experience all round; the increases in rates are not to any great extent due to local expenses voluntarily incurred but are in the main necessary to meet the increases as far as wages and salaries of personnel are concerned, increases forced upon the local authority on humanitarian grounds as a result of the removal of the subsidies last year or the diminution in the aids to them. The Dublin County Council has met <Col N="270" /> and has had to increase its rate by something over 2/- in the £.  In the city the increase is almost double that. In Cork the increase is 5/6.  In all places an analysis will show that the greater part of this increase is caused by the alleged saving, from the taxpayers' point of view, of these many millions last year; I refer to what was described as the saving on the subsidies.</P>
    <P>This year we are supposed to be happy because the Ministers are constantly taking to the Fianna Fáil clubs to lecture one another across the county border as if they had not time or opportunity to speak to each other in counsel or at their Party meetings in Dublin.  They lecture each other on the fact that taxation has reached the extreme limit.  The Minister for Lands goes to Kilkenny and he says that back here to Dublin.  The Tánaiste goes to insurance dinners and says it back to the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Finance goes to some banquet and tells that for the edification of the Taoiseach, and the Taoiseach addresses all his Ministers and the whole country and the burden of the song is: &ldquo;We cannot let taxation go to any higher point,&rdquo; as if anybody in the country was raising taxation except the people who are complaining that it has gone to the limit.</P>

      <P>The Government said we could not have taxation openly imposed and so we resorted to what was described by the Taoiseach on the 19th May of this year as &ldquo;hidden taxation.&rdquo; The present Taoiseach, speaking on 19th May in his own constituency, said that the Coalition were adepts in the art of hidden taxation. He said that when they wanted money they got it by hook or by crook in a stealthy way but that Fianna Fáil came openly to the people and asked for it. As example for hidden taxation, the Taoiseach mentioned the petrol tax, higher bus fares, dearer postage stamps, higher contributions to unemployment and national health amongst other things.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Coalition, said Mr. de Valera, had increased the price of petrol.  They thought that the ordinary man did not mind that, and that he only saw a person driving along in a motor-car, whom they thought deserved no sympathy.  They conveniently forgot that a tax on petrol was a tax on everything transported by lorry.  Under other forms of hidden taxation they had increased bus fares in Dublin and had increased the price of postage.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They conveniently forgot that the tax on petrol was a tax on everything transportable by lorry.  Other forms of hidden taxation have increased bus fares in Dublin and also the price of postage.  That is a remarkable forecast which, I suppose, some of his governmental associates, who look after the paper clippings, took out and kept until the emergencies of the last 18 months arose and then decided they would neglect the sermonising part and operate the practical part of it. We are to have no new but hidden taxation this year.  First of all, the subsidies which were to bring in almost <Col N="272" /> £4,000,000 last year only operated for eight months.  This year they will operate for the whole 12 months.  Presumably there is a nest egg of £2,000,000 which means that this year the people will have their food with the subsidy added for the whole 12 months instead of only for the eight months as was the case last year.</P>
    <P>As an instalment of stability, the price of sugar has been raised.  I took it from the example given by the Minister yesterday that ½d. on sugar brings in about £500,000.  I know that the increase is not going to bring any money to the Exchequer.  It is going to be a burden on the community the same as if it was an extra ½d. imposed on the price of sugar by the Government. There is in issue an extra ½d. The Minister may give the figures now or have them forced out of him by way of parliamentary question.  The Minister knows what that extra ½d. means&mdash;it is in the region of £500,000.</P>
    <P>A profit is also being made out of the sale of New Zealand butter.  My calculation is that about £900,000 extra will come from the increased charges in the postal service.  There are other hidden items, motor-car parts and other items.  The only figure mentioned in the Budget is a bulk figure of £2,000,000 which is to be raised by duties of the customs type.  If that were an extra £2,000,000 derived from taxes at the old rate it would not be too bad, but if it means that the flow of goods, deliberately stopped last year, is to be increased and that these extra goods will this year bear the duties they escaped last year then, of course, it does mean that an extra £2,000,000 of taxes is to be taken from the people of the community.</P>
    <P>In any event, there are millions and millions lying in the shadow of the Budget that was to make no new impositions on the community.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we have this new ludicrous situation.  The Minister for Agriculture, according to the papers of the 19th of this month, issued a warning that it was now an offence to sell Irish creamery butter in the Dublin City area, in Dún Laoghaire and the urban district of Bray.  One is used to the appearance of Guards in the district court with medical attendants <Col N="273" /> to prove that people are driving motor-cars who are under the influence of drink around the City and County of Dublin.  Are these men going to be taken off that which is a most important task and made run round seeing whether they can get any evidence that people are consuming Irish butter which they have bought?</P>

      <P>It is policy because of the fact that the Minister for Finance has to get some little rake-off from the sale of New Zealand butter in this area.  That is the point I am making.  It does seem ridiculous that in this agricultural country with a fairly good numerical strength in milch cattle the situation has been reached where it is an offence&mdash;a definite offence, something having the stain of criminality about it&mdash;to sell Irish creamery butter in Dublin County and City and the urban district of Bray.</P>
      <P>The Minister this year is apparently to pursue his tactics of borrowing at an extravagant rate introduced last year in the National Loan and followed then by the loans for C.I.E., Dublin Corporation and Cork Corporation.  The Minister's colleagues used to ask me what would be the total of repayment in connection with the various loans issued in our time.  Will the Minister make that calculation now?  Will the Minister make the division into the interest sums that will be paid over the pendency of any of those loans and the amount that will have to be paid when the capital will have been recovered by the owners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of the period of office of the Government a stage has been reached where they are anxious to forget the old standards which used to be regarded as the proper ones for the stability of the community, unemployment, emigration, high prices and the high cost of living.  The purchasing power of the £ becomes of importance in any of these calculations.  There is one way in which that was standardised <Col N="274" /> up to 1947, that was in relation to an official cost of living index figure.</P>
    <P>In the year 1947 some remarks were made in the Seanad.  One of the members of the Government at that time said it was unfair to compare English prices with ours because our index figure was a real figure and a more realistic figure.  It included things which the English figure left out.  It was insinuated that the English figure had been built up deliberately, leaving out certain items because, otherwise, the cost of living figure by which the value of the £ was valued would give such a horrid spectacle.  Ours was so much better as it included such things as drink and tobacco.  By August of 1947 the happy thought hit the members of the Government of that time that tobacco and all forms of liquor could be taxed but lest the horrid fact might strike the Irish people through the decrease in the value of the £ and the consequent increase in the cost of living figure, they were removed from the index calculation.  It was agreed that a new figure would be brought in dealing with &ldquo;essential items&rdquo; and by the end of the year we had brought our figure down to the debased level on which the British figure was calculated. Even taking it on the essential items figure, the calculation made here in the Dáil was that the 1939 £ was worth at the moment 8/-.  Measured by the old index figure, it would be worth somewhere in the region of 6/-. The 1914 £ had by 1951 been reduced to about 5/-; if one were to apply the old index figure it had gone below the 5/- mark.</P>
    <P>That is part of the victory that Fianna Fáil had set about&mdash;the complete stoppage of emigration, having such conditions that those who had emigrated would swarm back to the country, that unemployment would be such a rarity here and employment so good that there would be jobs to spare for all, including those brought back. Life was to be bounding, taxes were to have been reduced, farming was to have been encouraged by definite grants and in every way, including, of course, an increase in the purchasing value of the £, there was to be a high <Col N="275" /> living standard.  All these were to have been obtained by the Government.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been in Government in this country since 1932 with the exception of three years.  In these three exceptional years, and in every month of them in between, the calculation is that 1,000 more people were put into insurable occupation.  In these three years, a record number of houses were erected by the local authorities, and a record number of men were employed building these houses.  In these three years, while all that was being done, and while taxes were being reduced, pensions for the aged were raised and the means test modified. Pensions for the blind and for widows and orphans were also improved.  The expansion on the industrial side showed great activity.  Rural electrification progressed at a rate which had not been thought of before but which has diminished since.  The land reclamation scheme that we thought of was begun, and the bright prospects in that regard were added to enormously by the income derived from the land and from the productivity of the land.  We provided capital for agricultural development, and capital for schemes that we said were both economically and socially desirable but which were derided as putting the nation in pawn, and which have since been accepted and continued with a certain amount of inefficiency in the handling of them.</P>
    <P>Last year we warned that the Minister was trying to do artificially, and at great cost to the community, what we thought would naturally come about, and that was an improvement in our international trading situation. We said that it was easy to forecast that the terms of trade would improve. We knew that result was going to follow, and follow quickly, from the increased development of the land, and that exportable goods from the land would reach a point which would make any anxieties which might arise from a too serious consideration of the international situation of no importance.</P>
    <P>In the first quarter's trading of this year all the forecasts we made have <Col N="276" /> been borne out.  The figures of imports and exports for the first three months of the year are on record.  The <i>Independent</i>, in an editorial on May 27th, calls attention to the fact that &ldquo;there are certain aspects of these returns which are of more than statistical interest&rdquo;.  It says that &ldquo;the fall in the value of imports has owed a lot to a fall in their price&rdquo;.  It goes on to say: &ldquo;This trend is, of course, in conformity with the general trend of world prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That trend was observed by everybody except the Minister for Finance, long before it had developed to the point that the <i>Independent</i> could write that it had been observed for some time past.  The <i>Independent</i> stated that the tendency which was there was welcome and said that &ldquo;it should contribute still more powerfully towards rescuing the balance of payments from the disequilibrium which was created by the outbreak of the Korean War and the world-wide rush to buy up stocks of goods&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have come across a phrase used by the present Minister for Finance.  It is a very old quotation.  It is dated 14th December, but the year is not given. It is clearly of the vintage period of about 1928, 1929 or 1930.  One of the things promised by him was that Irish investments in Britain were going to be looked after, and that in particular the banks at home were going to get some attention from the Minister when Fianna Fáil got into power.  The Minister was speaking at Tallaght and said that they would see:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that the savings of the Irish people were used to develop Irish industry and that the bank rate, instead of being 6 per cent. was 2 or 2½ per cent., and even if the shareholders had to suffer a little the new Government would ensure that the Irish people benefited by having Irish savings invested in Irish industries&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now, we have slipped from our 3½ per cent. to 5 per cent.  When I called the Minister's attention to the fact that even Jamaica could get 20 times the money it wanted at £3.7 per cent., and that Northern Ireland could get almost 20 times what it wanted at less than that at which we borrowed here, and <Col N="277" /> could get a vast over-subscription, it did not draw any explanation from the Minister but rather a certain amount of sneering at Jamaica.  While the Minister is open to criticism himself, Jamaica despite all the calumny that he poured upon it was able to get nearly 20 times the amount of money it was looking for at £3.7 per cent. That is all the more reason why he should be ashamed of having reduced the credit of this country to the point it now stands at.</P>
    <P>This year great borrowings are to take place again.  The Minister is so happy about the situation he developed last year that he will probably give a little bit more to the moneylenders, or take it out of the community by raising the interest rate for housebuilding and on other loans for any type of development.  He is going to make the community suffer in the interests of the people who were promised a little suffering about the 1930 period.  That suffering is going to be put upon them for the benefit of Irish people who invest their savings in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>This year the Minister is giving aid to the cinema people to some slight degree.  The Minister's statement also contains mention of some additional aid to the I.R.A. this year, and, although it is not mentioned, the Minister is continuing the aid to the Ballroom Proprietors' Association. That was introduced by the letter that they sent to the present Tánaiste, and the reply they got from him about the generous subscriptions which they asked their members to make to the funds of the Party.</P>

      <P>I have not heard any of these quotations.  It is my turn at the moment.  That one may cause a shudder of apprehension to the Minister, but I am not sure it is the worst quotation that I could bring against him.  The aid to the Ballroom Proprietors' Association is being continued by the Minister.  The I.R.A. are being helped.  It is a sad commentary for anybody who looks at the provision that is being made this year in regard to the I.R.A. when he considers that if some of these men had been wiser in their time they would have been materially better off if they had joined the Irish Ballroom Proprietors' Association instead of joining the I.R.A.  The members of the Irish Ballroom Proprietors' Association benefited much more than the Old I.R.A., according to the provision which is made for them this year in the Budget.</P>
      <P>This year, the Minister confessed in his Budget speech that the tax on spirits failed last year.  According to his own statement he looked last year to get an extra £1,020,000 on a new tax on spirits.  The confession this year was that he was £1,500,000 short.  That means that the Minister got £480,000 less than he did in the previous year, when the new tax was not imposed. It is quite clear from the returns that have been made that production on the distilling side is down.  Employment is definitely down.  Unemployment has been caused over the year.  As an advantage, we have lost not merely the £1,020,000 which the new tax was to bring in, but £480,000 that used normally arrive.  We are losing £480,000 to establish conditions in which production declines and unemployment grows.  If that is regarded as one of the standards by which last year's and this year's Budget are to be judged, then it is a poor standard.  We are keeping on that tax of last year which has been demonstrated to have failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A newspaper report recently called <Col N="279" /> attention to some of the results of last year's Budget.  The date of this quotation is the 23rd of this month of this year.  A commentary had been made about advice that was coming from doctors circulating in the poorer quarters in Dublin.  What they said was questioned.  The doctors themselves were questioned.  The report of what they said is given in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A number of Dublin doctors said yesterday that the majority of mothers and babies in the poorer areas of Dublin were not getting enough nourishment and many of them were suffering from chronic illnesses as a result.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report says that the doctors then referred to statements made by one of the doctors at the annual meeting of the Coombe Hospital Linen Guild and they said that the ailments which that doctor found among patients of the hospital were pretty common in all the poorer areas of the city.  The group of doctors said that infant mortality was a problem which could fall under any of the following three heads: medical, social education or mental ability.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>People have been forced to live at a certain standard&mdash; a standard which was imposed by last year's Budget and which is being continued by this year's Budget.  The report from which I was quoting says that one doctor said that poverty was one of the greatest contributors to ill-health.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If there was no poverty there would be very little medicine needed.  It was true that about 50 per cent. of the mothers in the poorer class areas of Dublin were suffering from a deficiency of iron in the blood and this was due to what could be described as poverty&mdash; living largely on bread and tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were three to five times as many premature babies among the <Col N="280" /> poor people than there were among the more well-to-do classes.  If this could be remedied it would reduce the infant mortality rate considerably.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That newspaper article is headed &ldquo;Causes of Infant Mortality.&rdquo;  The reasons are judged to be poverty and ill-nourishment because people are forced to live largely on bread and tea. These are the people who, in last year's Budget statement, were referred to as being too well off.</P>

      <P>Last year the complaint was that the people were too well off.  The cut in the subsidies occurred because people's incomes had risen more than the increase in the cost of living.  A year afterwards, a number of Dublin doctors can be brought to pronounce that people are suffering from chronic illnesses, which are common in all the poorer areas of this city, and that that is due to poverty and to living largely on tea and bread.  I wonder if that is clear enough for Deputy Carter?  The report did say that it could be caused either by poverty or ignorance but that they then opted that it was caused by poverty.</P>
      <P>I said recently that what happened last year was a good example of what could happen when people drifted into this paradise known as the &ldquo;welfare State&rdquo;.  The author of the welfare State is supposed to be Lord Beveridge in England.  He recently complained that that has taken a turn of a type which he did not anticipate and one which is quite distasteful to him.  He is reported as saying:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The term &lsquo;welfare State&rsquo; was unfortunate in that it suggested to many people that responsibility for <Col N="282" /> welfare of individuals and families rested with the Government.  The right view was that men must depend for welfare on themselves; the aim of the Beveridge report was to secure for everyone an income both when working and out of work sufficient to provide the bare necessities of life for the worker and his dependents, leaving the spending of this income as the responsibility of the individual.  It also left him to secure by his own efforts income above the minimum.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then said that that plan of securing for everyone an income both when working and out of work sufficient to provide the bare necessities of life for the worker and his dependents and of leaving it to him to secure by his own efforts income above the minimum had been frustrated as a result of the decrease in the value of the £.  Our pound has decreased and decreased rapidly in the last year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better get the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who is probably about six lessons ahead of him in economics, to go back one or two and talk about devaluation and what was devalued and how it affected things here.</P>
      <P>Then we have the welfare society which we have decided to promote here.  Most Reverend Dr. Gregg of Armagh, addressing the Protestant Synod at Armagh on 8th October last year, said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The welfare State concerns itself with the welfare of the bodies of its citizens, it meets their bodily needs from the cradle to the grave and in doing so much to protect them it weakens their sense of self-reliance and initiative.  The human beings who are the beneficiaries of this system of planned materialism become lost behind the workings of this almost inhuman machine.  For <Col N="283" /> all its apparent benevolence, the engine which carries them tends at the same time to crush them.  It is not concerned with the citizen as a man, as a child of God and a pilgrim of Eternity.  It is concerned with maintaining his bodily health and with insuring him against the material results of accident or ill-health &mdash; undoubtely a wonderful piece of insurance against the unknown future, but a system which has to deal with individuals by the 10,000 makes them little better than ciphers.</P>
    <P>Where everything is done for men, the system robs them of the spirit of enterprise and of forethought with which they were born.  They belong to the crowd and life in the crowd saps their independence and their personal sense of moral responsibility.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, notwithstanding what Most Reverend Dr. Gregg may say, the <i>Irish Times</i> has a different concept. It has told us that in most of these welfare services certain Christian principles must inevitably suffer and we are proceeding along that line.  How far we will get I do not know, but I know how far certain people want us to get.</P>
    <P>Whether the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was at the time speaking for a Government in which he was then only a Parliamentary Secretary, I do not know, but he said in Cork, as reported on the 3rd December, 1946:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Paternalistic care of a community by a Civil Service acting on instructions from a Government elected by the people could alone preserve the fundamental freedoms and sanctity of human existence.&rdquo;</P>

The success of that policy was put to the test in an election which sent here Alderman Tom Byrne as a Deputy.  I have here a cutting&mdash;I hope Deputy Carter will get this&mdash;of the 14th November, 1952, which showed the final result of the poll on that day in North-West Dublin.  The original vote which was taken out of the ballot box was: Alderman Byrne, 13,078; Senator Clarkin, whose Party I need not identify, 6,629, and the O'Rahilly, 1,693.  That was the best test the subsidies of last year's Budget got.  One of the results has been the indecent haste with which the Government have run in with a Bill to postpone the local elections.</P>

Four or five people here had to be preserved from the electorate.</P>

      <P>The subsidies were not cut then, and the people were promised these things, that they would keep the subsidies and increase them. No doubt the Deputy will have to explain the cutting of them.  It is quite clear that this shuddering over this House, that is evident in that group and its satellites, comes from fear. That fear is based on last year's Budget, which is continued by this year's Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any Deputies have read the stories by P.G. Wodehouse, they must know the efforts that his most futile character&mdash;even more futile than some of the Deputies here&mdash;made to get work.  He was the great Bertie Wooster, and there was an occasion on which Bertie got work and it did not develop too well&mdash;like the way Fianna Fáil did not develop too well last year. He was sent for by his boss&mdash;like Fianna Fáil being sent for by the electorate. As he went into the room he realised, he said, that the sack was floating in the air; almost, he said, you could feel the beating of its wings.  That is the sensation that is round this House for the last year and a half, the wings of defeat are flapping.  It was that that drove the Minister for Local Government to-day to postpone the local elections, to save that community a little bit longer from the exposure that would have taken place all over the country if the local elections had been held and which would certainly have been shown in the two constituencies where <Col N="286" /> they have not been able to postpone an electoral appeal.</P>
    <P>This Budget continues last year's severity.  Last year's severity was unnecessary, and we said that was so. The out-turn of the year shows that what we said was right.  The international situation, which was not terrifying to anyone who could look it in the face and realise the causes of it, has righted itself.  This country has benefited not by anything that the Fianna Fáil Government has done but by the ordinary turn of things in the world outside.  As far as anything was done here at home, it was done from a wrong idea, and it was done inefficiently.</P>
    <P>The handling of those circumstances and the results of them have been something that everybody here wants to forget about.  The Minister has not dared, in all his orations about the Finance Bill, to talk about what used to be paraded before the House as one of the great standards, the test, the thing on which people banked, saying they will be a success if things go one way and they must confess failure if they go another.  This test is whether we can keep our people at home and, having kept them at home, keep them not at the employment exchange but at work, and at work which would in the end make for greater productivity, for the production of goods that our community wants and for the production of goods which we could trade for the goods across the frontier that the community here desires to maintain the standard of living&mdash;which has two or three years ago and which has been on the decline since and is probably at its lowest ebb since this community became a State.</P>

      <P>Most of us who have watched the progress of the Government in recent months realise very well that the very thought of an election causes them as much panic as a gadfly does to a herd of cattle.  That is because of the effects of the policy enshrined in the Bill we are now discussing. This is as disastrous a financial policy as has ever been initiated in any country.  We can see now very, very clearly, some 18 months after it was first announced and went <Col N="287" /> into operation, the effects in serious unemployment and very serious poverty and hardship amongst the people.  Apparently no amount of evidence adduced here by Deputies can compel the Government to alter their views in the slightest.  One would think that, in a democratic country like this, the appalling effects of the past 12 months would have induced the Government this year to alleviate in some measure the dreadful burden of taxation on the people and in some positive way to restore the confidence necessary for a return of prosperity. Unfortunately, that has not taken place and we are discussing a dreary document, pock-marked with unemployment, hardship and poverty, which is the Finance Bill of 1953.  It will be Fianna Fáil's last Finance Bill.  It will be their last contribution to the destruction and hardship they have caused in this country, because, as Deputy McGilligan has stated very clearly, the coming defeat is very near.</P>
      <P>There are many aspects of the Government's financial policy that one could discuss on the Second Reading of this Bill, but I do not think it would avail me or any other Deputy much in regard to bringing about any change of policy on the part of this Government.  It seems clear that they have committed themselves to a very disastrous policy and are now so committed that they cannot change.  There are, however, one or two particular matters which I should like to raise, in the hope&mdash;it may be very optimistic &mdash;that some evidence of sanity can be restored to the ministerial section of the Department of Finance.  I should like to deal in particular with the continuance in this Bill and the policy enshrined in it of the taxation imposed on whiskey and spirits last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to discuss and to deal with matters which I think should be included in the Finance Bill, 1953.  That is in accordance with the Standing Orders in relation to the Second Reading of the Bill and I think I am entitled to do it.  I think this Finance Bill should contain a substantial relief in respect of the existing taxation on spirits and whiskey, and I do not think that any suggestion of that kind could require much discussion here, because we have seen in the past 12 months the very disastrous results of the spirits tax imposed by the Budget of 1952.  It is very easy and may be <Col N="289" /> very popular from time to time for Finance Ministers, for certain purposes, to imagine themselves as new apostles of temperance and to set about taxing those who consume whiskey and imposing very heavy taxation on those who consume spirits.  Certainly, the Minister enjoyed that role last year and he was doing something harmful to one of the oldest industries we have, the Irish whiskey industry, an industry which should be helped by every decent Deputy and every decent Government in this country.</P>
      <P>Without regard to his duty as an Irish Minister for Finance, the present Minister last year embarked on a policy designed to kill the Irish whiskey trade and I hope to be able to convince the House that in the past 12 months the Minister's policy has very nearly succeeded. We should not forget that this Irish industry gave the name &ldquo;whiskey&rdquo; to the English language and gave a world-famed drink to the people.  I do not think it is a thing we should be in the slightest ashamed of and I do not think it comes well from any Government that any member of it should set out deliberately to destroy such an industry.  Last year, the Fianna Fáil Government increased the duty on spirits from 137/- to 176/- per proof gallon, an increase of 39/- per proof gallon, or 6d. per glass.  They did that at a time when the whiskey trade was just beginning to surmount the difficulties created by the war and emergency conditions here and at a time when legitimately the country could look forward to the development of a very important export trade in whiskey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the export trade affected by the duty here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, and I hope to be able to show that.  They did it, as I say, at a time when legitimately we could expect the development of an important export trade, including a very important dollar-earning trade. When that tax was imposed, Deputies on this side, and, I think, Deputy Cowan also, urged the Minister to reconsider what he was doing.  We suggested to the Minister that the mere fact that up to that whiskey had borne <Col N="290" /> the tax of 137/- per proof gallon was no indication that a further increase would yield further revenue and would not harm the industry.  The Minister would not listen to that and he based his Budget of last year on the expectation that this new spirits levy would bring in an increase in revenue of £1,020,000.</P>
      <P>One can understand the Minister for Finance, last year, believing that an increase in taxation of 39/- per proof gallon would bring in a further £1,000,000.  One can even excuse his obstinacy and his failure to listen to the arguments made on this side of the House.  One can pull a veil over all that took place in the Budget of 1952. The year has passed.  The taxes have been imposed and now, more than 12 months later, we look at the result of that taxation.  What is the result?  In the last financial year the whiskey tax, instead of yielding over £1,000,000 more, yielded almost £400,000 less than in the financial year prior to the Budget of 1952 and the Minister's estimation was out by £1,500,000.  Surely that very sharp decrease in revenue should cause any responsible member of a Government to halt, consider and reflect whether the tax he had imposed was a just and a fair one or whether it should be changed or altered in some degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did neither of those things.  Apparently, he regards the maintenance of the whiskey tax as in some way associated with the prestige of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In this respect, apparently, he is so small that he cannot afford to admit that he was wrong in his Budget of 1952 and he comes into this House refusing to alleviate the tax on spirits in any respect. As a defence for that he says that he would have got the revenue he expected were it not for the fact&mdash;I am quoting the Minister&mdash;that the produce of the spirits duty last year was adversely affected by the fact that consumption had been met in part by using up stocks in hand rather than by withdrawing stocks from bond.  That is the Minister's defence, his reason for not reducing the spirits tax this year: that those engaged in the distribution and the retail trade had such large <Col N="291" /> stocks in hand that consumption in the last financial year was out of stock in hand rather than out of withdrawals from bond.  That statement of the Minister must have seemed a very lame one to Deputies.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister and the House of what took place before this tax was imposed in the Budget of 1952.  Prior to the Budget of 1952 every publican in this country was on a strict monthly ration of whiskey.  He got his supplies as a ration per month and his ration was designed to meet the whiskey trade he was doing.  It is correct to say that the trade had recovered from the shortages of the war and that consumption had increased, but there was maintained by the different distillers supplying publicans and those engaged in the trade a monthly quota or ration.  The existence of that quota or ration made it extremely difficult for any publican to carry a large stock of whiskey on his premises and, in fact, very, very few publicans did carry a large stock.</P>
    <P>Before the Budget was introduced last spring, the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, at the direction of the Minister for Finance, sealed the bond houses and prevented, for some considerable time before the Budget, any withdrawal from bond.  Accordingly, when the Budget was announced and the tax fell on whiskey there could have been no stockpiling, if I may use the expression, and the trade had to meet the new tax with only the remnants of the previous monthly quota.</P>
    <P>Under those circumstances it appears extraordinary for the Minister to say that in the last 12 months the trade has been using up stocks they could never have had and have, therefore, not been withdrawing whiskey from bond.  Would not it be far better, and indeed perhaps a shrewder thing for him to do, for the Minister to come to this House and admit that the tax was perhaps a little too severe, that he over-stepped himself and that he did what a Minister for Finance should never do, that by his taxation he brought about a reduction in revenue?</P>
    <P>In addition, it was, perhaps, unhappy for the Minister as Minister for Finance <Col N="292" /> that the Budget of 1952 in relation to the tax I am discussing came into effect at a time of the year when most people, perhaps, refrain from the consumption of alcoholic liquor.  It does not require much imagination to understand what took place last year.  Most whiskey drinkers decided to drink whiskey no longer and to take instead beer or stout.  Many of those who formerly took beer or stout put up the pin and drank lemonade.  Accordingly, the revenue returns show for the last 12 months an increase in the beer revenue and a reduction in the spirit trade.  If there had been a tax on minerals, I am quite certain the tax would have yielded a colossal sum. Would it not be far wiser for the Minister to face these facts and realise that that is what has taken place?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is anxious to be serious.  Even at this late stage, I want to try to emphasise to the Minister and to the House some of the effects we will experience in the coming months in relation to the continuance of the spirits tax.  In my constituency, in Deputy MacEoin's constituency, in this city, and in the South of Ireland there are important distilleries.  They have been there for a great number of years. Some of them are amongst the oldest in the world.  As an industry they have had to face difficult times in the past and they surmounted them.  The Irish whiskey trade has always been a very constant and substantial trade. Even during the war the home distilleries were able to keep going and, were it not for war difficulties, there would have been no reduction in the business done by the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last financial year for the first time for a great number of years there was a marked reduction in consumption. Consequently, there has been less business done.  The stage is now <Col N="293" /> being reached where there is considerable danger in the next three weeks that two old-established distilleries will close down.  I wonder does the Minister realise that.  Does he take into consideration the effects of a continuance of this tax?  It may be easy to sneer at the whiskey trade; it may be easy to get a few cheap slaps on the back for doing it.  But the whiskey trade is an important one in this country.  In the Midlands, there is not a farmer growing cereals who does not realise that if Locke's disappear, if Daly's of Tullamore disappear, if Williams's of Tullamore, and John Power's and Jameson's disappear there would be no sense in growing barley or in producing more from the land of this country. The whiskey trade has a very important bearing on agriculture.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the Midlands some of the greatest consumers of the much praised sod of turf are the local distilleries. From time to time in this House we hear pious speeches made about encouraging the turf industry.  Turf has a ready market in any midland distillery and the possibility of two of these distilleries closing down has caused something approaching panic amongst the hand-won turf producers from Tullamore to Rhode.  I mention the possible effect on the barley growers and on the turf producers merely as an illustration of what may happen if the whiskey trade continues to suffer as it has suffered in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of unemployment. For a great number of years there has been considerable employment given in the different distilleries throughout the country.  That employment is available in the distilleries in the actual distillation of the spirit itself.  In addition, the wholesale and retail trades maintain a considerable volume of employment.  The danger now is, and the Minister has had information with regard to this in the last three or four weeks, that considerable unemployment will take place in the trade and in associated trades. That is another regrettable fact.</P>

      <P>Naturally, they will not buy a crop of barley and distil whiskey unless they have some assurance that there will be sale for it. I think it was Deputy Cowan who queried the possible effect of the tax on the export trade.  That is the third matter I want to deal with.  It does appear to me to be quite a simple thing to understand that if you want to export whiskey you must make whiskey, and the appalling situation now existing in this country is that there is less whiskey being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>It is very easy to say things are criminal.  The people in the industry are entitled to expect a policy which will not punish them and put them out of business, and that is what is happening in the whiskey trade.  There are two distilleries in danger of going out of business.  If they do so, whatever contribution they make to the production of Irish whiskey will be gone.  Accordingly we will kill our export trade before it is properly started.</P>

      <P>The possible effect of such a tax was pointed out to the Minister and to the Government.  One of the people who pointed out that possible effect was Deputy Cowan.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Then let us be clear on that.  Deputy Cowan was one of the people the Minister had last year giving the warnings.  The warnings given last year have been justified. There has been less whiskey consumed in the last year.  The people engaged in the whiskey trade are engaged in a business the same as any farmer, any newspaper proprietor or any professional man.  They are in business for as long as it pays them to be in it.  It is nonsense to suggest that the very moment they say: &ldquo;This is not paying us any longer; we are going to pull out of this business,&rdquo; they are to be regarded as national saboteurs.  That is the all-time low in contributions in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whiskey trade has not paid the whiskey firms in the last 12 months. <Col N="297" /> Two of those firms were operating very much on the margin; they were just able to keep going.  One of them, not very far from the city, was barely able to keep going with old and antiquated plant.  The balance has now been tipped and that particular industry is facing the decision being forced upon it to go out of business.</P>
    <P>I point that out to the Minister so that if it takes place he cannot say: &ldquo;No one told me about it.&rdquo;  He has had considerable warning last year. Throughout the year his own departmental advisers, I am certain, must have warned him as to the story told by the revenue figures.  I am telling him now on the information available to me that shortly, unless this tax is in some way alleviated, two old Irish industries will disappear.  There will be less production of whiskey and more unemployment and to that extent the difficulties facing the country will have been enlarged.</P>
    <P>In the large financial policy adopted by the Government and in the variety of taxes they have imposed, this spirit tax may not appear to be a very major item.  From time to time in the past Ministers for Finance and other Ministers on both sides of the House have made very grievous mistakes. Having made the mistakes and having recognised their mistakes, they have taken some steps to redress the situation. I appeal to the Minister not to allow political considerations to prevent his recognising the mistake which was made in regard to the spirit tax in the Budget of 1952.  If he reduces the tax he need not fear that there will be any jeers at him from this side of the House.  On the contrary, I think many people will say that at least he was man enough to see his error and, like the repentant sinner, he will come back to the fold.</P>
    <P>The situation is serious and it would be a great mistake if some effort was not made on the Second Reading of this Bill to point to the effects this taxation is having on this important industry and to the subsidiary effects it is having on the agricultural industry and on the production of turf.  I hope the Minister will, on the Committee Stage <Col N="298" /> of the Bill, consider reducing in some way the effect of the tax.  A sum of 39/- per proof gallon was a very large chunk of taxation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks that what we have said last year and what we are saying now is too extreme or wrong, would he not at east adopt the middle course and reduce that 39/- per gallon tax by half and see the effect it will have in the next financial year?  If he does that I am certain that he will derive a yield in revenue from the whiskey trade that will surprise him, and if the Government is there sufficiently long he will be able to come in and give tax reliefs to every section of the community.  He will even be able to pay the civil servants an adequate sum.  He can do that by adopting this middle course, and I do suggest that the circumstances of the industry, the events of the last 12 months and the possible repercussions in the near future all dictate a reduction in this tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the knowledge I have in regard to the Cork Distillery Company, I am inclined to agree with what Deputy O'Higgins has just said in regard to distilleries.  I am sure the Minister himself has received the report from that firm in regard to the damaging effect of that tax.  However, I will go further than that, because I am inclined to think that Irish distilleries are not playing their part in producing sufficient whiskey for export from this country.  It is a terrible state of affairs that a country like Scotland can draw in a revenue of over £32,000,000 on the export of whiskey to America, whereas this country could not draw in even £500,000 last year on the export of whiskey to America.  I am satisfied&mdash;and I am not afraid to say it&mdash;that they are not doing their job in the national interest. We are a barley growing country, and I cannot see why more whiskey is not produced notwithstanding the heavy tax imposition.  I am suggesting that these people are drawing sufficient profit to suit their family interests and are not concerned with the national interests in this respect.  I am saying that for very good reasons. <Col N="299" /> I would suggest to the Minister to give them every facility so that they could not have any reason to complain about undue taxation in future.</P>
      <P>Apart from other questions that we have been discussing here, I am satisfied that it would be necessary for us to face the problems that confront us in an entirely new way, a way entirely different from that in which we have been facing them up to the present. Let us first of all get our sense of human values right.  These have been distorted by a soulless industrialism with money values made supreme, and which gives undue rewards to a few speculators and middlemen out of all proportion to the services which they render to the community and deprives producers and essential workers of a just reward for their labour.</P>
      <P>I should like to see a real effort to face the problems that confront us rather than that we should expend our energies running around in circles, forgetting the essential problems that require attention.  I notice in the Book of Estimates that we are paying the Bank of Ireland £30,000 a year for looking after Government stocks. We paid them up to this year £32,500. The payment is reduced by £2,500 this year, but because interest rates have increased they are really getting a far better compensation than heretofore. However, we still have to pay the Bank of Ireland £30,000 a year to look after Government stocks.  Is it too much to ask why our Central Bank is not capable of looking after Government stocks?  Why are they not asked and why is it they are not doing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to this point again and I am going to repeat it until I get an answer from the Minister or from a higher authority than the Minister.  The Minister has made the statement deliberately and it appeared in print, that this country lost in one 12 months £120,000,000 because of the devaluation of the £ sterling.  Deputy Dillon last March 12 months made a somewhat similar statement by saying that we had lost within the previous 48 hours more money than would balance the Budget because we were linked with sterling.  Is it not time <Col N="300" /> that this House and the Minister should sit down and calmly ask why that should continue?  Is it not time that we should no longer be tied up with the £ sterling if that is the situation?  I am asking the Minister now for the last time is that a fact? That statement was made in an article in the <i>Sunday Press</i> under the heading of &ldquo;Diddlum Dandy&rdquo; written by Deputy Seán MacEntee, Minister for Finance, from 1932 to 1938.  That was a deliberate statement by a responsible Minister of the Government and I want to know is it true?  If it is true, the sooner we stop all the speech making in this House and get down to dealing with essential problems the sooner the country is going to get somewhere.</P>
    <P>I remember reading a speech made, I think, by the Minister for Lands last year in which he said that the solvency of the sterling area and the stability of sterling were questions of the utmost importance to this country. Our sterling investments, he said, were the basis of our national credit and it was through our sterling resources that our trade was financed, even outside the sterling area.  The same week Deputy Cosgrave, as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 18th February, 1952, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is essential in the economic interests of the country that any contribution this country has ever to make which will result in assisting the sterling area should be made. Far too much nonsense has been talked about sterling in recent years. Any suggestion that we should sever the connection with sterling cannot be seriously entertained.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am suggesting to every member in this House that until we get down to a consideration of that problem we are talking nonsense in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan expressed the view last week that the difference between me and him was that he knew what he wanted and I did not.  I am suggesting now to Deputy Cowan, to the Minister for Finance and to every other Minister, that a pre-requisite to doing anything effective in this country is to secure first of all control of our finances and credit in this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Until we do that, we are just talking nonsense and wasting the time of everybody.  Let us examine this question: What opportunity had any of the people of this country ever of considering seriously the question of the link with the £ sterling?  I am old enough to remember the conditions which prevailed when this State was established and the little opportunity that was given to those who were really capable of rendering assistance in dealing with our financial problems in a right manner.  I want to put this to the Minister and to Deputy Cowan. If this Dáil calmly and responsibly decided that on and from a given date we would treat the British £ as we would treat the money of any other country, let the Minister or anybody else tell the House what disturbance it would create in our economic situation and in the proper conduct of the affairs of this country.</P>
      <P>I yield to no man, no matter who the Minister for Finance may be, in my sense of responsibility in dealing with the affairs of this country.  I have sufficient knowledge of financial matters to realise that we are just playing like a lot of children in debating these questions while control of our credit and finances remains outside this country.  The sooner we stop all this nonsensical talk and these efforts to score debating points, the sooner we shall get somewhere so far as the people are concerned.  Deputy Major de Valera seemed terribly disturbed to know what the views of the Labour Party were in regard to income-tax. He wanted to know whether we wished to increase income-tax or to decrease it.</P>

      <P>I want to say that so <Col N="302" /> long as there are 5,300 persons in this State in receipt between them of an annual income totalling £17,601,000 I will be slow to suggest that income-tax should be decreased.  I want to see a graduated tax so that the increase will be put on the shoulders of the people who can bear it.  I want to tell the Deputy also that if he gets the Revenue Commissioners report, he will find how the wealth of the country is distributed.  Sixty-nine persons out of every 100 who died in 1951 over 21 years of age&mdash;of the 33,000 that passed out&mdash;did not possess anything in excess of £100 each.  That means that less than 3 per cent. of the people own 64 per cent. of the wealth of the country leaving the other 97 per cent. with only 34 per cent. of the wealth of the country.  Knowing that, I fail to understand why some people get excited and ask what does the Labour Party want to do with income-tax.</P>

      <P>I will not waste the time of the House by quoting the Minister's statement relevant to the banks in 1949 and 1950 when he appealed to those institutions to stand firm against the inter-Party Government and what that Government was trying to do; he hoped they would stand firm.  What is the position of the banks in the country?  For the 15 years ending in 1940 the net profits of the ten banks operating here amounted to £22,406,000 on a paid-up capital of less than £9,000,000.  In that period of 15 years they received more than double their paid-up capital in net profits and these are the institutions to which the Minister for Finance appealed to stand firm against the action of the inter-Party Government when that Government was trying to run the country as it should be run.</P>

Yet, when the Minister for Finance was in opposition in 1949 and 1950 he appealed to the banks to stand firm and not to allow themselves to be dominated by the inter-Party Government when that Government was trying to run the country in the way in which it should be run.

His statements are on record.  I ask him now is it a fact that we lost £120,000,000 in one year because of the devaluation of the £?  If that is so, as responsible representative, we should sit down and calmly decide what is to be done.  We had a debate here to-day as to whether we should pay up to £800,000 or £900,000 to our State servants.  We had a vote on that issue.

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated some time ago in the House, when the Central Bank Bill was going through, that it was experimental and if we found it was not working satisfactorily we could bring in another Bill here. I am suggesting that the time is long overdue to bring about that change and let our Central Bank have some authority in this country.  In advocating that, I feel I am on some good grounds.  Nobody should have control of our money and our credit except the Government elected by the votes of the people.  I challenge any person, either inside or outside this House, to say we are wrong in demanding that.  Why should we hand over the credit and currency of our country to a group of individuals who are responsible to nobody except themselves?  My patience is exhausted listening to futile speeches while we are ignoring that important factor.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan can talk about the political independence of this country. That is all tommy rot because we have political independence but we are not using it.  There is no good in telling a man he has the right to vote if he has not the price of a loaf of bread, a house to live in or a job to work at.

I very often hear talk about welfare states.  We have 80,000 unemployed in this State.  What kind of a welfare state is that?  I could cite the case of a woman whose husband left the country and went to England where he died.  She got a pension from the British Government.  That man's wife and children remained here.  They are now getting 27/6 a week from this State and because of that her pension has been reduced by £1.</P>

It works for about 20 or 30 per cent. of our people.  The balance of our people is in a most unenviable condition.  Until the people of this country can have some semblance of a decent standard of life, there is no use talking about the welfare State or anything else.</P>
      <P>I believe that this country, if properly organised and developed, could give a standard of life to its 3,000,000 people equal to that of any country in the world.  I am suggesting that there are up to 85,000 or 87,000 unemployed who are denied the right to work.  Our people are clamouring for the goods they could produce.  They are not allowed to produce the goods. Why?  Their labour is not wanted. Their labour is not wanted because there are too many goods.  What is the use of having goods if the people are not able to buy them?  What is the use of talking about the standard of living with butter at 4/2 per lb. and where a man gets 18/- to keep himself and his children?  A man with stamps gets 24/- a week.  Fianna Fáil have no less regard for these people than I have.  We should be ashamed of ourselves to think that we compel any man to live on 18/- per week.  That man has no more choice in so far as working is concerned than the baby born yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just one or two matters I want to bring to the attention of the Minister.  First, I want to appeal to the Minister to give every help he can possibly give to the development of the distilling industry in this country.  There may be certain difficulties.  The Government and the Minister have been developing other industries in this country.  A number of them are small subsidiary firms, British or foreign, who come in here for the purpose of exploiting the people who have to buy their commodities.  I am principally concerned with the raw materials for agriculture that have to be purchased from those firms who have the protection of the Government. They have not the raw materials here and they are not genuinely interested in producing a natural product that could be produced in this country.  The farming community, who produce the real wealth of the country, are compelled to pay for their raw materials and requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the distilling industry, we have the labour content, the tradition, the technique and the raw materials in the form of barley.  All the barley that is required can be grown here.  In fact, considerably more than is being taken at the moment can be made available for the distilling industry.  On the other hand, there is a wide export market for the product of the distilling industry.  The Minister and the Government may have difficulties.  There may be something in what Deputy <Col N="311" /> Hickey has said that you have certain family firms which are satisfied with the profits they are making at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister and the Government should take it on themselves to contact these firms and point out to them that, in the national interest, something more is expected from them.  I think it is a ridiculous thing that, in an agricultural country such as this where all the barley needed is available for the distilling industry, it should be exporting only £500,000 worth of whiskey, whereas the Scottish distillers are exporting £30,000,000 worth.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to refer to is the reference in the Minister's Budget statement to the fact that he is providing £200,000 this year for the National University.  I should like to ask him: did he put a pistol to the head of the National University and say: &ldquo;Before you get this £200,000 from the general taxpayer this year you have, in Dublin, to throw out the agricultural faculty and you have to throw out the dairy science faculty from the University College, Cork?&rdquo; It is an extraordinary thing that, in this agricultural country, in the year 1953, we should have a governing body in University College, Cork, agreeing, in principle, to throwing out the dairy science faculty out of the university, and that we should have a governing body in University College, Dublin, agreeing to throw out the agricultural faculty out of that university, while at the same time the Minister in his Budget statement asks for an extra £200,000 from the taxpayer for the National University.  I should like to have some information from the Minister on these points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In to-day's <i>Cork Examiner</i> a letter appears from Deputy Alderman Seán MacCarthy, who is a member of the governing body of Cork University.  He says that the location of all the institutes is to remain as they are.  Is the Minister giving £200,000 to the National University, and is the governing <Col N="312" /> body of University College, Cork, prepared to have half of its premises under a semi-State bureaucratic body? Deputy MacCarthy's letter to-day says definitely and categorically that there will be no change in the location of any of the present departments that will come under this semi-bureaucratic agricultural institute.  I would like to know from the Minister whether the President of University College, Cork, has told him that he is prepared to have within the college building an institute that has nothing to do with the university.  I think it is a very retrograde step to remove agricultural facilities, agricultural education and agricultural technical advisers from an autonomous independent body.  All over the world the tendency is that these technicians should be independent and free from Civil Service control. I hope that the Minister is not giving this £200,000 to the National University as a bribe to compensate it for the ejection of the faculties of dairy science and agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to the plea that was made by Deputy O'Higgins on behalf of the distilling industries in the Midlands.  I submit that Deputy O'Higgins has made a reasoned case on their behalf. It is true to say that they fulfil a very important part in the economic life of the Midlands in the purchase of barley, in the employment they provide and in the utilisation of local hand-won turf.  The load of taxation imposed on them is very great.  It is well to remember that the Government were not unmindful of the needs of other industries when they were hard pressed.  In last year's Budget, they gave a remission to certain tobacco manufacturers for the purpose of keeping some small factories in production. The Minister will not be doing anything unusual if he does something to help these three important distilleries. My only interest in them is from the industrial end and in the employment they give.  There are no votes in this.  I certainly do not want to see them broken up.  A long time ago, at considerable risk, these industries were protected.  I would not like to see anything happen to them at this <Col N="313" /> stage when they are playing an important part in our export trade.</P>
      <P>On Section 2 of the Bill, I do not know how it comes about that the Minister did not feel it necessary to mention the proposal in this section in his Budget speech.  I think that reveals an extraordinary situation.  I am not going to argue that the proposal contained in the section is not desirable, but I would like to know what exactly is the advantage which these companies are going to derive under the section. It is true that the people who will now take out insurance policies with these companies will get substantial relief if they are income-tax payers.  I think that was important enough for the Minister to mention it to the House when he was making his Budget statement and not to have it thrown at us in the way that it was.  I presume the intention is to assist these insurance companies.</P>
      <P>In view of the assistance which the Minister proposes to give to these companies, I suggest that protection and assistance should be given to distilleries in the Midlands, such as Locke's and Williams', which are in grave danger of extinction.</P>
      <P>I want to add my voice to that of Deputy O'Higgins in appealing to the Minister to reconsider this particular matter.  The case is made that by reducing the tax the revenue will increase. I believe that that case is well-founded and is perfectly sound. Therefore, instead of doing damage to the revenue&mdash;which, of course, the Minister is very anxious to maintain&mdash; it would improve it considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all anxious to bring this matter to a conclusion and for that reason my intervention will be very brief.  I was interested in Deputy O'Higgins's remark with regard to the position of distilleries. I may say that I am not interested in distilleries for the purpose of what they produce but I am interested in the fact that the barley growers in my constituency of South Roscommon were informed last year that for this year their contract to the breweries and distilleries would be reduced by 50 per cent.  That has caused <Col N="314" /> consternation among the barley growers in that area.</P>
      <P>I can quite appreciate Deputy Cowan's scepticism with regard to Deputy O'Higgins's remarks about a reduction in the production of stuff that will not be used until about seven years' time.  It is understandable, just the same, that if the brewers or distillers conclude that this high tax on liquor will become a permanent feature of our economy there will be a gradual reduction in the production of whiskey.  I think it was natural enough for the distilleries to come to that conclusion and it is possible that they decided to produce less.  I believe that it was merely business acumen that suggested it.  Whatever the reason, the fact remains that a great number of people in my constituency who made a livelihood from the growing of barley were very adversely affected by the decision of the distilleries and breweries with regard to the production of barley.  That will operate so long as the present tax remains on whiskey.</P>
      <P>I am not thinking merely of the number of people employed in distilleries. I am thinking also of the number of people employed in the distributing trade.  It is well known that in every licensed premises throughout the country the effect of the general reduction in the consumption of whiskey and liquor has been felt.  Business in different towns in the West of Ireland has been so adversely affected that the people there have begun to despair. They are going out of business.  I could name a town in my constituency where there has been utter despondency for the past 12 months, particularly in the licensed trade, as a result of the reduction in the consumption of spirits.  That can only be accounted for by the Budget last year, the effects of which will be continued this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there would be nothing dishonourable on the part of the Minister or the Government, if they were satisfied that a certain course or a certain policy was working against the national interest, in altering course.  I remember saying to the Tánaiste last year that I would not blame any Minister or any Government for embarking on a <Col N="315" /> certain policy and trying to see how it would operate but that if, as a result of experience a Minister or a Government found that the policy being pursued was detrimental to the national interest then the honourable thing to do would be to say: &ldquo;We have been deceived.  We have embarked on a wrong course and we are now determined to remedy the situation&rdquo;.  I do not think anybody in this House or any Government which we have had in this country would suggest that they could not make a mistake.  It is human to make mistakes but it is inhuman to continue on a course when you find it to be wrong.</P>
    <P>I am rather amazed by the statement made by Deputy Lehane.  I am not sure if it is correct but, if it is, then the Government should take immediate and serious notice of it.  This is an agricultural country and it would be a serious threat to our economic life if the Faculty of Agriculture or that of Dairy Science were banned in our universities. I am sure the Minister will deal with Deputy Lehane's statement when he is replying to this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the suggestion that has been made from all sides of the House that something ought to be done to improve the distilling industry.  I understand that an arrangement has been arrived at to give the Minister sufficient time to reply to the points that have been made and, consequently, I will deliberately limit myself to that particular aspect although there are points in the debate in which I am very much personally interested and on which I should have liked to say something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why, because of the imposition of a particular tax last year, distilleries should have reduced their purchase of barley and should have reduced their production. Obviously, the market for our distilleries is not in this country if we can get it outside.  If our market is to be in this country then there will have to be increased consumption of whiskey&mdash; and if there is to be increased consumption of whiskey then Deputy <Col N="316" /> Hickey and a number of other people who do not bother about whiskey will have to drink it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot advocate that.  In my view, we must get an export market for our whiskey, which is a magnificent product.  I understand that, for quite a long period, a lot of our whiskey went into Scotch whiskey and was sold as Scotch whiskey in America and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  In England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>In England, and in the States.  It was processed and sold there as Scotch whiskey.  I think there is a big market open to this country in relation to the production of Irish whiskey because it is first-class for export. To do that we would require the co-operation of the Government, of business and particularly of the distilleries.</P>
      <P>One of the problems that small distilleries run into is the fact that there is competition even in the business itself.  In the lifetime of Deputies here, distilleries have gone out of business. Certain brands of whiskey are popular for a time and other brands are not so popular.  Locke's distillery, Kilbeggan, has been mentioned.  I may say that whenever I got 20-year-old Locke's liqueur whiskey I thought there was nothing to beat it.</P>
      <P>I would support the suggestion that everything that could be done to increase the production of whiskey should be done, because, undoubtedly, it creates a market for our agricultural produce.</P>
      <P>We are not putting it on the right level if we say it is due to an increase of 6d. in the tax on a glass of whiskey. I put the point to Deputy O'Higgins: &ldquo;Does this increased duty or tax affect our exports?&rdquo; and he said it did, but he came back then and said that the only way in which it did was that our distilleries were producing less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything possible to increase our market for whiskey should be done.  It is only in that way we will be able to <Col N="317" /> maintain employment in the distilleries and maintain employment on the land producing the barley that we need for its production.</P>

      <P>So far as the Irish distilling industry is concerned, the Government is as anxious to assist it as it is to assist any other industry; but we cannot overlook the fact that a responsibility rests on the pot-stillers to do something for themselves. They have had a long cycle of prosperity.  In 1938 clearances of homemade spirits from bond were of the order of 660,000 gallons.  That figure increased gradually over the years, until it was almost 1,000,000 gallons&mdash; 993,000 gallons&mdash;in the year 1951.  With the exception of 1941 and 1942, there has been a continuous expansion in that industry.  That must in the ordinary way have meant very considerably enhanced profits to those who were engaged in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the home market has fallen away, for reasons about which there will always be some dispute, I think that the people who have done very well out of the industry over the past ten or 11 years ought to utilise some of the profits which they have secured in breaking into other markets.  Perhaps the fact that the home market has so substantially declined will act as a spur to induce them to try to develop an export trade. It may take a long time to do that, but after all, it is their business primarily.  If they do not do it, their profits will declie and their industry will decline: if they do it, on the other hand, their profits will increase and their businesses will prosper accordingly. Let us not put on the Government the responsibility which rests primarily on these privately-owned distilleries.  I have a feeling that if we were to propose to take them over to-morrow and run them as nationalised concerns we would hear a great deal less about the depressed condition of the industry.</P>

      <P>There is no reason for Deputy Dillon to grow fanatical about this.  He can keep cool, as I am trying to keep cool, in face of intense provocation from him&mdash;and allow the people to know the facts.  We have been told about the extensive export industry which the Scotch distillers have built up over the years.  The case in Scotland&mdash;in Great Britain&mdash;is that that industry labours under substantially heavier taxes than the Irish industry, but that does not prevent the Scotch distillers from going out and securing markets and it does not prevent people from buying Irish whiskey and palming it off as Scotch whiskey. If it were not for the fact that some people are anxious to get an easy market, I do not think that condition of affairs would prevail.  In a case like this, if we want to develop an industry we must let those who are engaged in it know that we are not going to feather-bed them, any more than we have been doing over a great number of years.</P>

      <P>I would like to come to the question which was raised by Deputy Lehane, about the £200,000 grant which is included in this year's Estimates for the National University. It is a building grant, given completely without condition.  In fact, it is given in these circumstances, that, while our predecessors undertook certain commitments in regard to University College, Dublin, we have been called upon to fulfil them.  Some of the commitments were incurred without the matter being even referred to us, and there was, in connection with the grant to University College, Dublin, absolutely no discussion regarding the position of the faculty of dairy science in University College, Cork, or the faculty of agriculture in University College, Dublin.  We had no discussions with the university&mdash;at least, I had no discussions&mdash;in relation to any one of these matters, and the only thing is that we are providing this sum of £200,000 to enable University College, Dublin, to fulfil commitments which it has entered into to purchase certain lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those, I think, are the main matters of specific interest which were raised in the course of the debate.  I do not propose to detain the House very long, but I should like to refer to the opening speech for the Opposition which was delivered by Deputy McGilligan. It was a rather curious performance for Deputy McGilligan.  He reminded me of a little boy with a scrapbook.  He came in with various snippets and cuttings from newspapers which he read out and, without any of his usual flair, tried to be sarcastic, cutting and sneering with reference to some of them.  He referred in particular to an article which appeared in an American newspaper called <i>The Sun</i> on St. Patrick's Day of 1930.  This was an article written by Mr. de Valera or purporting to be an interview given by Mr. de Valera.  The Deputy as most people <Col N="322" /> may have noticed, was very chary about giving any references.  Even when the Chair asked him to give the reference, as is the usual custom, he behaved, I suggest, with the utmost discourtesy to the Chair.  He said that he would give the reference if he liked or that, if he did not like, he would give it subsequently to the official reporter.</P>
    <P>However, as I said, he did try to make a case that Mr. de Valera had pointed to the conditions which existed in the Irish Free State as it was in the year 1931 and endeavoured to suggest that conditions since then had grievously deteriorated, particularly during the 16 years the Fianna Fáil Government held office from 1932 until 1948.  I have gone to the trouble of getting certain very significant vital statistics showing conditions as they were in 1931 and as they were in 1947. I think it would be worth while if they appeared on the records of the House, so that people will realise what the Fianna Fáil Government did do during the 16 year period it was in office.  In 1931, the births per 1,000 of population were 19.3 and, in 1947, they were 23.21.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this Estimate a few days ago I said there were a few points to which I wished to draw the Minister's attention. One point I should like to stress, as I did 12 months ago, is that it is unfair and unjust to ex-Army men who are in receipt of pensions, that if they are lucky enough to secure employment, even of a temporary nature, with a local authority it interferes with their pension rights.  Many ex-Army men are employed in industrial concerns such as Bord na Móna, very often at very good salaries, and yet their pensions are not interfered with.  I believe it would be a proper course to have this matter investigated to see if it is possible for these men, who may be lucky enough to get a job even as a porter or in some temporary employment with a local authority, not to have their pensions interfered with.</P>
      <P>Mention has been made of the present strength of the Army.  I should like to know if we could be given any indication as to the number of young men who joined the Army some two years ago and whose period of service is nearly completed who intend to remain in the Army or how many of them intend to leave it.  That is an important matter in view of the point being stressed about the total strength necessary for the Army and the amount of equipment necessary for that strength.  From the information available to me I believe, as I stated 12 months ago, that the recruiting drive in the 1946-47 period was not a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated recently, in reply to a parliamentary question, that within the 12 months ended 31st December last over £12,000 had been expended on the advertising campaign for the Army and the Navy, and I should like to know what reason there is for saying that the present recruiting drive will be a success.  Every section of this House, at all times, made it clear that they never opposed any publicity that might be given in connection with any such recruiting drive. However, we can come to some fair conclusion or decision in connection with the possible strength of the Army within the next 12 months if we can get an indication as to the number of men who are prepared to continue in service <Col N="329" /> when their two-year period is practically finished.</P>
    <P>Deputy Major de Valera, Deputy MacBride and many other members expressed their views in connection with the strength of the Army which they would consider sufficient for this country.  Perhaps this is a question on which we may hold different views.  As Deputy Major de Valera asked what our opinion might be, I will say that, first of all, we should base it on common sense.  Facing the problem from a common-sense point of view, I believe that even a smaller Army than that visualised by the present Minister and the present Administration would be sufficient, provided that Army were well paid and well treated.</P>
    <P>Our experience from the past, particularly in the 1940 to 1945 period, justifies the point expressed by many outside this House, that the training that was given to members of the L.D.F., as it was known at the time, undoubtedly depended on the availability of good instructors from the Army.  I know from many men who were regular soldiers in the Army down in the South that if the members of the L.D.F. were brought up to a high standard of efficiency at that time, it was undoubtedly due to the training given to them by such highly qualified instructors as we had in the Army.</P>
    <P>If we are to continue a policy of having such highly-skilled instructors we must, first of all, consider their conditions and their prospects in the Army and how far this country can go to give them in the years to come that feeling of satisfaction and security. The larger the Army we have the less hope we have of giving a real feeling of security and satisfaction to them. While this is a matter on which, perhaps, every member here may hold somewhat different views, it is one on which it is only right that we should express our views.</P>
    <P>There is one viewpoint which has been stressed by Deputy MacBride in particular, and with which I do not altogether agree.  That view has very often been expressed inside this House and outside.  He mentioned the desirability of a period of training for six <Col N="330" /> or 12 months for all young men.  I believe it was a mistake in the past to discontinue the system whereby physical training was obtained, not through an army but in our national schools. There was no question, in such a training, of military weapons being used, and if we are not prepared to go so far as to force on growing youths training through military service, where munitions, rifles, etc., are employed, that system of physical training would be very beneficial if given to those boys in the national schools.  We would not then have to consider the continuance of such service in the Army.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, if we are going to continue a policy whereby it is necessary to spend a large amount of money year after year on such military training, the procuring of weapons of war and all other items concerned with it, we must realise that the over-all picture in this country cannot give us the hope of a continuation of that policy, due to the fact that, as stated clearly by the present Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, under-production exists in this country.  We know it is not feasible to stop the emigration of young men in order to put them into the Army.  Even during the emergency there was a leakage of man-power from the Army into other countries.  I do not wish to labour that point any further except to say again that that physical training, if it had been given in the schools, would have helped the policy in connection with the views expressed by Deputy MacBride.</P>
    <P>If we go back in our minds to an earlier period we will recall that there was a course adopted many years ago by an Administration in this country of sending officers of the Army to American colleges for training and specialised courses, which was a very good idea.  However, I believe that the present system whereby we send half a dozen recruits from our Irish Navy to the English Navy for such specialised courses is not correct.  If the American authorities are so advanced from an Army viewpoint they are also advanced to the same extent as far as the Navy is concerned.  I want to make it clear that I am not trying to belittle <Col N="331" /> the ships we have for our Navy.  We are a small nation, and we will have to build up as we go.</P>
    <P>However, if we study this from another angle I see the danger that when young Irishmen who give service to this nation in the Irish Navy, are sent over for specialised courses in the British Navy, and see all the equipment, all the modern warfare and shipping facilities they have in Britain, they may begin to suffer from an inferiority complex where there own country is concerned. The ultimate tragedy will be that these young men will develop a desire to leave the Irish Navy and transfer to the British Navy.  If we are to send these young men for specialised courses, it might be much wiser from the point of view of the welfare of the country and of the young men themselves to send them where we sent the Army officers.</P>
    <P>There is one final point I wish to mention.  I spoke last week of various viewpoints in regard to the Navy.  I believe it is a tragedy, that while history shows the great record of Irishmen in regard to naval achievements&mdash; in the American Navy, in the South American Navy, in the English Navy, in the Australian Navy and even in the Japanese Navy&mdash;by implication we are asked to admit that the control of our Navy in certain key positions&mdash;I do not mean from the ministerial point of view&mdash;must be entrusted to natives of other countries.  Surely considering the long seafaring tradition behind the Irish people, it is a sad commentary that we must go outside our own country to get commanders to help us to build up an Irish Navy?  We realise the necessity of building up a Navy for purposes other than warfare&mdash;for the protection, for instance, of our fishing industry&mdash;but I venture to suggest that the sooner we recognise that there are young men in this country capable of filling the leading positions in our Navy instead of bringing in foreigners, the better it will be for the people of the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to a number of speeches last week on <Col N="332" /> this Estimate and bearing in mind a number of other pronouncements in previous weeks in regard to the Budget, I am beginning to wonder whether we are not becoming rather muddled in our attitude towards the question of defence.  I thought it was definitely decided upon and agreed to by all Parties that we should have a fairly strong Army in this country, well trained and well equipped, but speeches made on the Budget and other more recent statements made here in this House, lead me to believe that certain Parties or individuals in the House have deviated to some considerable extent from that objective.  One Labour speaker said that we should reduce expenditure on the Army and that we did not require an army of the strength we have.  Another speaker yesterday said that the money which was about to be spent on warlike stores should be devoted to another purpose.  These two comments, and others which have been made here, lead me to believe that there are those in opposition who, first of all, maintain that our Army is too big and secondly, maintain that we are spending too much on defensive equipment, or warlike stores as they wish to call them.  I think that attitude towards the very important question of the defence of our State is altogether wrong.</P>
      <P>Another speaker from the Opposition went further to say that tinkers should be compulsorily drafted into the Army. I think that such statements getting publicity will do this country no good, either at home or in foreign lands.  If the impression were created that our Army is only a fit place for tinkers, I think our own young manhood would be very loth indeed to enter that Army when they find that the public representatives hold those opinions and are anxious to air them in connection with our Army personnel.  I, on the other hand, wish to suggest to the Minister that he should have in the Army the pick of our young men, well-trained physically, well-educated, boys who are capable not alone of becoming good soldiers but who are capable of learning a trade or acquiring a knowledge of advanced subjects while serving with the forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> I also assert that they should be well paid.  I know that a great improvement has taken place in the pay, conditions of service, in the uniform worn and I hope in defensive equipment.  That is as it should be and the other suggestions to which I refer should be authoritatively denied by the Leaders of the Parties or withdrawn by the members themselves who have made these statements.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the improvements that have taken place in the standing Army in regard to Army dress.  Now I think that an improvement of the dress and uniform of the F.C.A. should if possible be effected, that a more attractive uniform and especially more attractive headgear should be provided, first of all, to give a better appearance to the personnel of the F.C.A., to give them a more soldierly appearance and also as an inducement to other young men to come into that force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would like to assure the Minister that I am not raising this matter in any contentious spirit.  I do, however, consider the issue involved of some considerable importance not merely in relation to the teachers, who form the subject matter of the question, but also in regard to the general relationship between the Government and the Opposition in this House.  Unfortunately relations between the Government of the day and the Opposition are somewhat difficult at the best of times.</P>
      <P>I understood that if the Minister gave an assurance in the course of a discussion on a Bill that certain matters would be dealt with in a certain way that assurance was capable of implicit acceptance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be a pity if that position were now to be departed from and I am sure that the Minister himself appreciates that such a departure would render the difficult relationship that already exists in this House still more difficult in the future if members could not accept an assurance given by a Minister in respect of an amendment tabled to a Bill.</P>
      <P>In this particular case I had tabled a number of amendments to the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill.  That Bill was recommitted on the 21st May in order to have some of these amendments considered.  I do not think it is necessary to read the amendments in question; suffice to say that they were intended to ensure that certain categories which were already covered or which did not require to be covered because of circumstances governing their particular cases would be excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  Among the categories I had in mind were the teachers.  At column 2042 of the Official Report of 21st May, 1952, I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I think the matter is one which affects teachers in particular.  The majority of them do not want to be included in the provisions of the Bill inasmuch as the benefits they would pay would be completely disproportionate to the advantages they would receive by reason of the fact that they already have security of tenure, are paid during sickness and have a pension scheme of their own.  I appeal to the Minister to accept a provision of the nature suggested.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton spoke immediately after and referred to earlier references that had been made to this question on the consideration, I think, of Section 12 of the Bill on the Committee Stage and added:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I asked the Minister to have that discussion with the Finance people and let us know what the position was so that the matter could then be reviewed in the light of the Minister's promise, not only to have the matter looked into but to remedy the position.  In fact his statement in that debate constitutes an assurance that these classes would be excluded. Would the Minister now <Col N="335" /> say what the position is in that respect?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister replied and, in replying, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The intention is to exclude certain classes&mdash;civil servants, local authority employees, national and secondary teachers and certain members of the Defence Forces.  I shall deal with these classes first.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to deal with these different categories separately, but he did not deal with the teachers separately and at column 2044 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only point that presents any difficulty is in the case of widows' and orphans' pensions in relation to established civil servants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He made it quite clear there that the only difficulty lay in regard to widows' and orphans' pensions in relation to established civil servants.  He was dealing with each class separately.  He then dealt with certain general provisions I had proposed by way of amendment, and at column 2046 he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would ask Deputy MacBride, therefore, to leave things as they are on the assurance that I would like to see schemes of this kind, and if they are put up there will be agreement as far as I am concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A certain discussion then took place between the Minister, Deputy Norton and Deputy Hickey and again, to make assurance doubly sure, at column 2049 &mdash;there had been a certain amount of questioning backwards and forwards across the floor of the House&mdash;I asked the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;National teachers are definitely to be exempted from the scheme?</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan: Yes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was no qualification, no hesitation and no doubt about it.  At column 2050, I then pointed out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister has met the position fairly ....  I will, therefore, withdraw and ask the Minister to consider providing for that position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I finished by saying that I would withdraw my amendment and ask the Minister to consider providing for <Col N="336" /> that position; in other words, to bring in an amendment which would exempt members of trade unions where they so required to be exempted.</P>
    <P>On the reading of that debate, I think there can be no doubt that the Minister has given a clear-cut assurance that the teachers would be excluded from the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  In reply to my question to-day the Minister said that at column 2051, I think, he stated that he was in favour of covering certain classes, including teachers, for widows' and orphans' pensions.  I do not think that meaning can be wrenched from what was said in that particular column.  Most of the column in question is taken up by some comments made by Deputy Norton.  Deputy Norton was anxious to ensure at that stage that certain categories, including teachers, would be entitled to coverage if they so desired, but the Minister had already given me an assurance, on foot of which I had withdrawn the amendment I had tabled, that he did not propose to include the teachers.  I think that whatever considerations and whatever misunderstanding the Minister may have been under at the time, it is quite clear that he apparently did not seem to have appreciated the position, or he may have met with some difficulties in the Department of Finance subsequently. None of these considerations should permit the Minister now to go back on what was a clear undertaking to a Deputy of this House who had tabled a motion and who, on foot of that undertaking given by the Minister, withdrew the amendment.  The workings of this House ought not to be made more difficult than they are.  I would feel, in future, that I could never accept an undertaking from the Minister or any other member of the Government.  God knows, relations are difficult enough as it is.  I would urge upon the Minister, if for no other consideration than that one, to carry out the undertaking which was given.</P>
    <P>The matter, I think, cannot be of very much importance to the Minister, and I think it hardly bears examination. There are 10,700 teachers, 7,000 of whom are women.  As the House <Col N="337" /> knows, women teachers, as soon as they get married, have to leave and cease to be teachers.  The marriage ban operates against them.  Therefore, as teachers they can never become widows and, therefore, never have orphans.  They are excluded.  As far as the married man is concerned, the average age for marriage among the teachers is 30, and most teachers of that age are in receipt of £600.  Therefore, the vast majority of them cannot benefit either.  The single man does not benefit unless he gets married, and when he gets married his income limit puts him out of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In effect, the resulting position is that 90 per cent. of the teachers will be paying a contribution of 9d. per week which will be deducted from their salaries and they will have no hope of ever being entitled to any benefit.  In effect, this amounts to a tax on their salaries, a tax from which they get no return.  It would be a complete fraud to describe that as insurance. They can never succeed in benefiting under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the course of the last few days the widow of a teacher who was contributing to the scheme wrote to the Department of Social Welfare to ascertain whether she would be entitled to a pension after making contributions for three years.  She got a letter back saying that the Minister regretted that she would not be entitled to benefit under the scheme even at the end of three years because she was a widow before she entered the scheme, so that even a widow will not benefit under the scheme.  The thing is completely fantastic, and I do not think the Minister can have seriously considered the position.</P>
    <P>I think these are considerations which of themselves should force the Minister to exempt the teachers from the provisions of this scheme which is, in effect, only a form of taxation imposed on them.  There is no question of being able to get any benefit from this.  It is quite possible, if the Minister wants to make provision to enable teachers to voluntarily opt to subscribe to the scheme they might do so but I think it certainly should be left to the discretion of the teachers themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> To a certain extent, this matter raises one of the many anomalies which is bound to arise from any attempt at comprehensive social security. Certainly, I think we should have sufficient give and take in a matter of this kind and withdraw when we discover an anomaly of this nature arising.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made myself clear.  I hope the Minister realises that the women teachers who have been compulsorily insured for widowhood and for their orphans can never benefit under the scheme.  As soon as they get married they are turfed out and the vast majority of the men teachers are in receipt of salaries that exceed the income ceiling of £600 and are, therefore, out of the scheme too.  The unmarried men teachers are out of the scheme because they cannot have widows or orphans while they are unmarried.  As soon as they marry, their income rises above the level of the scheme.  This is purely a piece of taxation on their salaries in respect of which they get no benefit.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I may say that I have grave doubts as to whether a scheme of this nature is constitutional and whether we are entitled to levy, under the guise of insurance, a tax on the people which is not imposed by this Parliament in the ordinary way.  I certainly think that the teachers would be well advised to take legal advice on the matter and I do not think the Minister should encourage that.  I can see many difficulties arising from a case of that nature.  I want to say it is quite clear that the Minister gave an undertaking that teachers would be excluded from the provisions of the scheme.  If the Minister does not honour that undertaking, I, for one, will certainly find myself unable to accept in future a ministerial undertaking given across the floor of the House.</P>

The I.N.T.O., having found those snags existed, drew up a scheme of their own which would benefit their members.  It is quite true&mdash;and the figure is conservative&mdash;that 90 per cent. of the teachers&mdash;male and female&mdash;will <Col N="339" /> not benefit from the insurance paid and I think the Minister would be very well advised to go into all the snags.  I would suggest that he should not make it applicable at all but if he does apply the scheme he must amend it very much indeed.</P>

      <P>I must, I suppose, assume that Deputy MacBride is speaking honestly when accusing me of being inconsistent. I would advise Deputy MacBride to go back over this again.  The Deputy's amendment was for total exemption of certain classes, for, as he put it in the amendment, people who are covered against unemployment, sickness and retirement.  His whole argument was for total exemption.</P>
      <P>There is not very much time to go into this in detail.  I admitted, more than once in the House, that I did mention that the teachers were out and may have given Deputy MacBride a wrong impression.  In this discussion Deputy MacBride has called attention to the references in column 2049 of the 21st May, 1952.  Now, it is quite clear that we were talking there about total and partial exemption.  It is evident that Deputy Norton was quite clear that we were talking about these two things. In the next column Deputy Norton said: &ldquo;I am sorry that the matter is so complicated&rdquo;, and at column 2051, he continued to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;What I am anxious to ascertain is will the civil servant, the teacher or the Army officer whose pay is £501 per annum who is not in the present scheme, but who would be in the new scheme were it not for the fact that the Minister is going to exclude him, will he be entitled to coverage for widows' and orphans' pension purposes?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the whole difference between Deputy MacBride, Deputy Norton and myself.  It is quite evident that Deputy Norton understood what was being done.  If Deputy MacBride claims that he did not, well then, he did not understand the discussion, because I said in reply to Deputy Norton &ldquo;I think he would be included&rdquo;. <Col N="340" /> Deputy Norton then intervened again and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He is under £600 and ought to get coverage.  The Minister will, I take it, accept it that these new entrants will have that entitlement and will be covered for widows' and orphans' pension purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I replied to Deputy Norton and said: &ldquo;I am in favour of it.&rdquo;  In the next line in the Official Report it is recorded: &ldquo;Amendment No. 28, by leave, withdrawn&rdquo;.  That is the position.  I said that I was in favour of those people coming in for widows' and orphans' pension purposes, and Deputy MacBride withdrew his amendment.  If Deputy MacBride was under any misunderstanding on the point that I was in favour of bringing them in for widows' and orphans' pension purposes he cannot accuse me of bad faith.</P>
    <P>Again, this particular clause came up for discussion on the Report Stage on the 3rd December, 1952.  Speaking at column 495, I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;While I think I may have misled Deputy MacBride in discussing civil servants and local authority officials, I think I did make it plain that I wanted to cover them where necessary.  I did inadvertently say that national teachers were out, but I think that my general proposition should have covered national teachers at the time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I went on to say that national teachers were in for widows' and orphans' pension purposes.  Later, the Order was laid on the Table so that Deputy MacBride had an opportunity of raising the matter if he saw fit to do so. As he did not do so, I think it is not fair that he should be going around making accusations that he got an undertaking, especially when he withdrew his amendment after I had stated that I was in favour of bringing in the teachers for widows' and orphans' pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton had put it to me as to whether I was covering them for widows' and orphans' pension purposes. I said I was in favour of that, and the next thing that happened was that the amendment was withdrawn. <Col N="341" /> Could there be anything plainer than that, especially to a lawyer?  If that happened with one of the less well-informed Deputies, with, say, a backbencher, one could understand about a mistake, but Deputy MacBride makes no mistake of that kind.  He certainly knows very well that there was no such thing as a breach of faith.</P>
    <P>Taking the question on its merits, the only way you can deal with any State social insurance scheme is to take everybody in under the classes that are covered.  As regards the social insurance scheme that we were bringing in at that time, the aim was to cover everyone who was working under a contract of service, all manual workers and non-manual workers up to the figure laid down.  You cannot exclude certain people simply because they are not likely to benefit.  If you were to do that, then in the end you would be left only with those who were more likely to benefit, and in that case, as anyone can see, you were not going to have a very good scheme.  The benefits would be low and the contributions high, and the scheme would not be very good for anyone.</P>
    <P>The object under social insurance schemes in every country is to bring as many people as possible into the net.  Those who are lucky enough not to have to make claims are, in fact, paying for those who are unfortunate enough to have to make claims.  I think it must be obvious that you cannot exempt certain classes simply because they are not likely to claim widows' pensions or to exempt other classes because they are not likely to <Col N="342" /> claim other benefits.  What we do is this: where particular classes, such as civil servants, teachers and others, have sickness and unemployment schemes of their own, they are exempt, but if they have not a widows' and orphans' pension scheme then they are brought in under that particular part of our scheme.</P>

      <P>It is argued that women teachers cannot benefit because they must retire when they get married. They can go on paying under a voluntary scheme when they get married. I think any civil servant or teacher who, for example, marries an uninsured person would be very foolish not to continue the voluntary contribution because it is a very cheap form of insurance against widowhood.  A woman teacher who marries should certainly adopt it.  There are widows actually in industry, and there are also teachers, who are paying contributions to the widows' pension.  If they were to get married again, and to become a widow again, the thing would apply. That is the only way it could apply. If each Deputy were to come along and ask me to exempt certain classes that he may be under an obligation to, or may be partial to, then, of course, we would gradually exempt all the good risks and have nothing left but the bad risks.  If that were to happen, our scheme would become useless.</P>
