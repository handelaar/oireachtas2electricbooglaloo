    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before Section 9 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every institution receiving moneys from a health authority shall be subject to inspection by persons appointed for the purpose by the health authority.  &mdash;(Deputies Noel C. Browne, Peadar Cowan.)</P>

      <P>It is some satisfaction to know that the Minister does not approve of this particular amendment. In the course of the arguments last night for the amendment, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan made some statements which I think should not have been made.  However, this is a free Parliament and I presume that no matter how much a thing may be in bad taste Deputies have the right to make assertions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with that, I would like to point out that this amendment is <Col N="1076" /> rather peculiarly worded.  It asks for an inspection of the voluntary hospitals and the appointment of an inspector because tens of thousands of pounds have been pumped into the voluntary hospitals by the State.  Up to the present, of course, the thousands of pounds pumped into the voluntary hospitals were pumped in by private subscribers and then at a later stage by the Hospitals' Trust Fund.  The Hospitals' Sweepstake Bill was put through this House to assist the voluntary hospitals because the voluntary hospitals were then rendering, have since continued to render, and will go on rendering valuable service in the interests of suffering humanity whether run by a religious order or, as Deputy Dr. Browne said last night, by the Society of Friends or any other religious or charitable organisation.</P>
    <P>Surely this House is not going to take the line that we should probe into and investigate the activities of the voluntary hospitals because we give some assistance by way of Vote or otherwise when everybody knows that their activities are of the highest order.  It is an extraordinary situation that Deputies in this House would make the suggestion that there was something underhand.  Mind you, Red China made an allegation that the good nuns who reared and assisted orphan children murdered them.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, a charge of that type has been made by people in Red China.  That charge, of course, was not made here.  But the inspection, the innuendo of it, the hint that there is something to be investigated and that it is only a short time until we will have it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know thoroughly well that they are every bit as good Catholics as I am but I submit that grave scandal could be given and grave damage could be done by certain public action.  I do not know Deputy Cowan's reason for saying in this House that I am a Knight of Columbanus.  I do not know what the innuendo is.

      <P>On a point of order.  May I draw the attention of the Chair to the fact that last night I bordered on suggesting that Deputy Cowan was adopting a privileged position in this House and acting as a kind of a clap to invite confusion and disturbance on the Government ranks in order to disturb and confuse discussion here?  I would ask if Deputy Cowan is going to be allowed to butt in every second minute on an alleged <Col N="1078" /> point of order in order to disturb the trend of a very serious discussion on a very important matter?</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne both made the assertion last night on this section that the reason they want inspection is that in certain hospitals no person can be appointed unless he is a Knight of Columbanus or that the Knights of Columbanus make the appointments and that in other hospitals the Masonic Order make the appointments.  I challenged that in a gentle way at the time.  Deputy Cowan did not then raise a point of order on that assertion by Deputy Dr. Browne.  Later on, Deputy Cowan himself informed the House that I was a member of that order.  That is nobody's business.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan told the House last night that I was a member of that order.  I do not deny that I am a member and, I told him, a very unworthy member.  I wish I were better.  I am an unworthy Catholic as well.  But I do not see that that should be made a charge in this House&mdash;and that is what Deputy Cowan attempted to do here last night.  He attempted to hold a Deputy of this House up to ridicule, up to public odium, and asserted that he was a member of an organisation that <Col N="1079" /> was equivalent to and that could be put on a par with the Masonic Order.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I said Deputies made the assertion.  If the Deputy will be as ready to keep his ears open as he is with his tongue we will get some result.  That assertion was made. The grounds put forward for this amendment are that appointments are made in certain hospitals by the Masonic Order and in other hospitals by the Knights of Columbanus.  I say that that is untrue as far as the Knights of Columbanus are concerned. The Knights of Columbanus never interfere in any appointment.  It is contrary to the rules and to the regulations of the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will pass from it but I want to controvert the grounds that were put forward for this amendment. The justification that was given for this amendment by Deputy Dr. Browne was that appointments were made to certain hospitals by the Knights of Columbanus and to other hospitals by the Masonic Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may discuss it in association with the amendment but in connection with himself I think we had better pass from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Except to make this one comment.  I do not know anything about the Masonic Order or as to what they do but I know a certain amount about the other people and it is untrue to say that they made appointments to any body.  I want that categorically stated and beyond question.  Therefore, the grounds on which Deputy Dr. Browne moved this amendment are incorrect, to say the least of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us come back again to the matter of inspection.  I am glad the Minister has refused to accept <Col N="1080" /> the amendment.  It is one of the things that I approve of, in all the things he is doing that I disapprove of.  If I may say so in passing, this whole Bill is not being amended by us but we are exposing it for what it is.  We want to get full discussion here upon it and we intend to get that, as far as we can.  I am glad that the Minister does not make it worse by accepting an amendment such as this.  Whatever the spirit behind it&mdash;whether it is just pure provocativeness or cussedness&mdash;I believe that neither of the Deputies mean what they are saying.  I am glad that the Minister has taken the line that he will not accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say that the amendment is very simple.  It provides that where a local authority provides money for a hospital, that hospital will be subject to inspection. That is a very simple amendment and I think it is an important amendment. Of course, as usual, Deputy MacEoin likes to drag religion&mdash;and his religion. particularly&mdash;into the very simplest amendment before this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin says he is a knight. Presumably he was a knight when he was a Minister.  That is a matter for Deputy MacEoin's own conscience.  I am not concerned with knights, freemasons or anybody else.  What I am concerned with is simply that there should be a right of inspection of any hospital, no matter by whom it is run, if it is receiving public funds, and particularly substantial funds from the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I interrupted Deputy MacEoin to ask what he would say if he went into a hospital and had the wrong foot cut off.  That has happened in a hospital and it is only right that there should be some inspection in that regard. Every Deputy receives complaints from time to time from patients about the way they have been treated in hospitals, but when we bring the matter to the notice of the Minister, at the request of a constituent, we are told by the Minister that he has no function in the matter, that it is a voluntary hospital, that it can do what it likes and that he cannot do anything about <Col N="1081" /> it.  It is all very well for Deputy MacEoin to throw the cloak of religion over him, to refer to Red China and what has happened over there.  Those are very good Sadleir and Keogh tactics and he is welcome to them; but there could be hospitals that would not be run by religious orders and in which practices to which Deputy MacEoin might object could be carried on.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is not accepting the amendment and I understand that it would probably be wrong to accept it on this Bill.  I think it would be necessary for the Minister to have some discussion with the voluntary hospitals, but I am perfectly certain that the voluntary hospitals would be glad to submit to the form of inspection referred to here.  If our people are treated badly in the hospitals, if they go in to have the right foot cut off they do not want the left foot cut off, and there are 101 other things that can happen in a hospital. I have come across instances where the nurses in a hospital were scandalously and disgracefully treated&mdash; treated as sub-human beings and the Minister or the local authority can do nothing about it.  That was the only purpose of the amendment and it was only on these grounds that I spoke to the amendment.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's position with regard to it&mdash;it may require considerable discussion with the voluntary hospitals&mdash;but I am perfectly certain that the voluntary hospitals would be delighted to have an inspection by the local authorities.  Who are the local authority?  The local authority is constituted of the people elected by the citizens of the country to it.  There are many Deputies here who are members of the Dublin Corporation and we have members of the Dublin Corporation as governors and members of the boards of nearly every hospital in Dublin.  Nobody says that their membership of these boards in any way interferes with the proper running of the hospital.  In fact, it has a completely opposite effect&mdash;it assists the more efficient organisation and running of the hospitals.</P>
    <P>If we could get down to dealing with <Col N="1082" /> this Bill in a practical way, if we could get away from this line taken up by Deputy MacEoin and other members of the Fine Gael Front Bench of seeking to prove themselves better Christians, better Irishmen and better Catholics than the rest of us, we will get somewhere.  If this Sadleir and Keogh line is to be persisted in on every section it will be a long time before the Bill becomes law, and in that way the public will be deprived of the benefits provided for them in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is another attempt to place the voluntary institutions under State control.  I think it is quite fair to say that, because Deputy Dr. Browne stated, when referring to the Bill at the beginning, that they had their toe in the door and that they wished to push it further open.  Let us refer briefly to the voluntary hospitals.  The voluntary hospitals were founded originally by voluntary subscription and they have carried on on the basis of these voluntary subscriptions and have done good medical and teaching work over a great number of years.  As voluntary institutions, they are not subject at the moment to direct inspection, other than that involved in any powers that lie in the State in that regard, but, thanks to the action of the Fianna Fáil Party, they are subject to a certain amount of financial control.</P>
      <P>The Hospitals' Sweepstakes were originally founded by the voluntary hospitals, and the money was used for the purpose of financing these hospitals. Somewhere around 1934, the Fianna Fáil Government introduced legislation by which, to put it bluntly, they collared that money from the voluntary hospitals.  That is the money the voluntary hospitals are getting from the Government about which Deputy Cowan talked last night.  These are the simple facts.  The voluntary hospitals founded the Hospitals' Sweepstakes as a means of raising money to finance themselves, and the money was collared by the Government. That does not satisfy Deputy Browne and Deputy Cowan&mdash;they want to be able to get inside these hospitals and to inspect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> Let us review briefly the financial position of these hospitals in relation to the cost per bed of maintaining a patient.  We have St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park, a T.B. hospital, run as a State or rate-aided institution, and we have St. Kevin's Hospital in Dublin also.  It costs in these hospitals £15 per bed per week.  If they cannot keep within that sum, they need not do so, because, if they are unable to manage within that amount, all they have to do is raise the rates.  Do Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan suggest that the rates should be raised further for the maintenance of these hospitals?  I was under the impression that the rates were sufficiently high in Dublin already, and, I might add, in the country areas as well.</P>
    <P>A voluntary hospital is run in a different way.  It is a private institution. The authorities of these hospitals have to arrange beforehand what it is going to cost them to run that hospital. In other words, they have to meet their commitments, because they have not got the entire resources of the State to fall back on or power to raise the rates to finance their institution. It may interest Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan to know that the cost per bed in a voluntary hospital is £9 a week.  Where does the difference come in?  Why does it cost a rate-aided or State controlled hospital £6 per week more to keep a patient than it costs a voluntary hospital?  Administration costs is the answer and that is what the whole argument boils down to.  Is it better to have voluntary hospitals under private or State control?</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes that every institution receiving money from a health authority shall be subject to inspection by persons appointed for the purpose by the health authority.  That means a gradual encroachment on the private rights of the voluntary hospital. I am very glad the Minister has refused this amendment.  I do not think he could do anything else.  I do not agree with the Minister's attitude with regard to many matters in this Health Bill&mdash;I am at variance with him on most points&mdash;but at least <Col N="1084" /> he is taking a step in the right direction in refusing this.  If he were to accept it it would represent a gradual encroachment. That is what Deputy Dr. Browne wants.  Is that not a fact? He wants State control of everything appertaining to medical treatment in this country.  I think I have made a pretty fair case of the Deputy's attitude. If your State hospitals are costing £15 per week per patient and your voluntary hospitals are costing £9 per week per hospital, is it not reasonable to assume, if Deputy Dr. Browne gets his way and enforces full and complete State control of everything appertaining to hospitals and medicine in this country, in the final analysis the people of Ireland are going to pay for it?  Are we satisfied, even though they will have to pay more for it, that they will get a better service?  I am not satisfied that they will.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan's argument appeared to be that if you went into a voluntary hospital there was a risk of having the wrong leg cut off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know &mdash;perhaps his colleague, Deputy Dr. Browne, could tell us&mdash;how that is to be prevented by Government inspectors. Of course, it is fatuous nonsense. When Deputies come in here and introduce an amendment, let them have decent arguments to support their case. I have some respect for Deputy Dr. Browne in that he is quite frank.  He says he wants complete State control of everything.  Deputy Cowan comes in and argues that we must have this examination of hospitals because there are numerous complaints of people having the wrong leg cut off.  I know he is only making a hypothetical case there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>He said there were complaints.  The question is, are we going to permit the State to control everything?  Is there sufficient justification for interfering in any way with the voluntary hospitals?  The voluntary hospitals have to deal with specialised medicine; they have to deal with cases that nobody else in this country can deal with.  While I am on this subject let me say that the doctors in the voluntary hospitals in Cork, in Dublin, in Limerick and in Belfast work long hours every day for which they do not get paid.  That is the system which the voluntary hospitals have built up over the years in this country.</P>
      <P>I have stated before in this House and I would like to state it again categorically and emphatically, that I have never known a case of anybody being refused treatment in a voluntary hospital because he was not able to pay for it.  That statement has been verified by a colleague of mine on the Fianna Fáil Benches, Deputy Dr. Maguire, who made a similar statement. That is the system that prevails in the voluntary hospitals as they exist to-day.  I do not see anything wrong with that system.  I do not think these hospitals require any inspection. They are able to run their concerns economically and well and on sound Christian principles.  They do not require any State interference whatsoever.  I feel the Minister was right to refuse the amendment, and I am glad he did so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>One would be more impressed by the arguments that have been used here if those arguments were consistent.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde last night tried to reach general conclusions from two particular instances when he referred to a case where cortisone could not be administered, and a case where streptomycin could not be administered in the early days when those drugs were being introduced to this country because a certain measure of control was exercised at that time over the institutions that were to use it.  It is the general position that requires to be examined.  First and foremost, we have the public institutions where the funds come completely from public sources, either from the rates or from the State.  Then we have what may be considered semi-private voluntary hospitals where a corporation or a county council or both make a contribution, where there are subscriptions from people who, through the years, have been interested in those hospitals and where the amounts that are required are made up subsequently from the Hospitals' Trust Fund.</P>
      <P>In both of these cases you have representatives who are appointed by the people on the boards of management and generally they have visiting committees of their own.  They look after the interests of the hospitals generally, and when the public authorities are appointing representatives they do not confine themselves strictly to those who have been elected on the county councils or corporations; sometimes they appoint the members, say, of trade unions who would be interested&mdash; people outside public administration. Therefore, there is an admixture of control which is for the good of the hospital.  When changes are made in the public representation you have new ideas coming along and the position is not static by any means.  It changes according to the various views of those who may from time to time be elected on these boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the purely voluntary hospitals run by communities or by organisations of various kinds, surely these hospitals are also open to examination because patients are admitted and their friends occasionally <Col N="1087" /> come to see them.  People move through these hospitals day after day in the normal way.  A point has been made here about not being able to bring complaints to the Minister. Generally speaking, if people come to public representatives with any complaints, those public representatives take them up directly with the governors of the hospitals or with the community concerned and the matter is usually adjusted locally without any great inconvenience to anybody.</P>
    <P>Things have been read into amendments here that perhaps interference is meant when interference is not intended.  As one who has been on these hospitals and has contact with the purely voluntary hospitals from time to time, I must pay a tribute to the work that is being done in them. Very few complaints ever come from them and, generally speaking, the hospitals are open to inspection, because you cannot have a better inspection than the inspection of public opinion.  You will always have that public opinion while the doors of the hospital are open to the patients and to their relatives and friends.</P>

      <P>I cannot allow certain things to pass because they might be taken as the truth if I did.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde, in speaking of the Hospitals' Trust Fund, gave the impression that the Fianna Fáil Government collared all these funds for the local authority hospitals although they were meant for the voluntary hospitals.  The Fianna Fáil Government was in power in 1933 when the amending Act was passed.  I had occasion to look through the record of the discussion on that legislation quite recently because the same charge was made by others as was made by Deputy Dr. Esmonde.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read through all the discussion in the Dáil and the Seanad and there was not a single dissentient voice raised against that Bill or the principle of the Bill.  The Bill amended the previous Act that was passed in 1931 so as to enable the Minister for Local Government to devote a certain part of the funds to local authority hospitals. <Col N="1088" /> Not a single voice, as I say, was raised against it so that this type of political propaganda to try and saddle a charge like that on Fianna Fáil, to say the least of it is unfair because every Party agreed to it.  No Party objected in the slightest, when that was being done.  The Bill gave complete discretion to the Minister. It did not name any percentage one way or the other; it gave complete discretion to the Minister.  What was the result?  The Minister since that time, 1933, had complete discretion in the distribution of the fund.  Deputies know that there was a programme mapped out by my predecessor in 1948. That programme is now in process of being completed and it is hoped to see it completed in a few years' time.  When that programme is completed in three or four years' time, the voluntary hospitals will have received 75 per cent. of all the money that came from the sweepstakes into the hands of the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Health.  I made that statement in public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

      <P>I am not talking of the tax.  I say that of the portion that was given to the Minister to distribute, 75 per cent.  went to the voluntary hospitals and 25 per cent.  to the local authority hospitals.  The tax is taken from both if you like but that is a different matter.  I want to say that I have made that statement three or four times in public in recent months. I do not expect that it will keep Deputy Dr. Esmonde or other members of Fine Gael from repeating the charges which they have made in this regard.  They will make the statement again, I am sure, that Fianna Fáil <Col N="1089" /> collared all this money and starved the voluntary hospitals.  That is not true. At the moment there is one voluntary hospital being completed in Dublin costing £1,000,000.  There are two others planned costing £1,500,000 each and yet another costing about another £1,000,000.  These are four items I have mentioned costing approximately £6,000,000.  Anyway, including those, on the completion of the programme, 75 per cent. of all the sweepstake funds that came into the hands of the Minister will have gone into the voluntary hospitals and 25 per cent. to the local authority hospitals.  During all those years there was either a Fianna Fáil Minister or Deputy Dr. Browne who is now disowned, I believe, by the Coalition Government.  Therefore the Coalition Government or the remnants of the Coalition Government who are present here cannot claim that the Coalition Government had any influence in making up that 75 per cent. It was done by a Fianna Fáil Government and afterwards by Deputy Dr. Browne although we were accused of collaring these funds from the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have noticed in recent times that Deputy Dr. Esmonde and the Irish Medical Association get their information from some common source. Whether Deputy Dr. Esmonde is taking his information from the Irish Medical Association, or they are taking their information from him, I do not know, but the information comes, as I say, from some common source.  The statement that a bed in St. Mary's costs £15 and in St. Kevin's something about the same is absolutely fantastic. It is untrue.  The average cost of a bed in St. Mary's is £7 and the average cost in St. Kevin's is somewhat less. Deputy Dr. Esmonde says that the cost is £15.  Where he got his information I do not know.  Whether he got it from the Irish Medical Association I do not know either, but, wherever he got it, it is not a very reliable source.  I got the cost of a bed in various institutions not long ago, both for voluntary hospitals and local authority hospitals and you could not make the case in general terms that one was more costly than the other.  I <Col N="1090" /> think that of all the figures, one voluntary hospital has the highest, if you take the whole country, and I think a local authority hospital has the lowest. I am glad to say, and I am sure Deputy Dr. Esmonde and Deputy Corish will be glad to know, that that is a local authority hospital in County Wexford.  It is the lowest in the country, lower than any voluntary hospital. That is the position but, taking them altogether, you could not make the case that one is costing more than another.  There is no use in making the case, first of all, that the money is being collared for the local authority hospitals and, secondly, that the voluntary hospitals are cheaper to run than the local authority hospitals.  There is no great difference between them.</P>
    <P>It is true that some voluntary hospitals are extremely economically run from every point of view, and, of course, as I have already said, from the medical point of view they are very well run too.  It is true also, as Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Cowan said, that the amount of voluntary subscriptions coming into these voluntary hospitals is extremely small.  I met the association and they said that the reason was that when they go to a person looking for a subscription that person says: &ldquo;Oh, see all the money you are getting from the Hospitals' Sweepstakes.&rdquo; They said that attitude was responsible for drying up voluntary subscriptions.  The amount of voluntary subscriptions received by the hospitals now, as compared with what they get from local authorities who are paying for their patients and, secondly, from the sweepstakes money in the payment of deficits, is extremely small.</P>
    <P>That does not say that we should not encourage the voluntary hospitals to carry on because, first of all, they are run on different lines.  We have a comparison of one with the other. There is a different system and there is voluntary effort there.  There are the members of the board, the medical staffs, the other staffs and so on, but when I come to the next amendment there may be a change in that.  There is that voluntary effort there.  I have always said since I became Minister <Col N="1091" /> for Health that I shall do everything in my power to encourage voluntary effort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think arising out of this question of the voluntary hospitals, their position in the life of the community and the spirit they represent, it would be well to examine the position generally.  The amendment put down by Deputy Dr. Browne rather suggested that it was the beginning of an approach to the control of the management of voluntary hospitals and the mention of what was done in regard to C.I.E. contains the suggestion probably that a statutory board might control the voluntary hospitals.  Now, our reaction is entirely against that and there are certain aspects of the work of our institutions that are well worth examining and traditions that are well worth studying.  Anybody who has been connected with any of the institutions in this State over the last 30 years must have been struck by the reaction he found amongst responsible visitors coming here in an inquiring frame of mind, teachers, doctors, politicans of different kinds and men interested in various aspects of social organisation. Anyone, as I say, connected with these institutions must have been gratified by the reaction he found on the part of these people to the atmosphere and the manner in which our institutions are carried on.</P>
      <P>These responsible people coming here in an inquiring frame of mind have found in our schools, in our hospitals and in our institutions something that they lack in their own countries.  That is the one outstanding impression one gets of the reaction of people visiting our institutions here. They find pervading the work and the very atmosphere of these institutions, be they schools, hospitals or establishments for the care of the poor, an appreciation springing from a Christian philosophy translated into the daily work of these institutions, a sense of man's dignity, a sense of his destiny and an understanding of how to do the work to the best advantage spiritually and materially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> I have met that myself and I regard it as one of the most hopeful indications we have and one of the most inspiring and gratifying and when we come to deal with the voluntary hospitals I do not differentiate in any desire to safeguard the voluntary hospitals as against State institutions.  I do not differentiate as between what are described as Catholic hospitals and Protestant hospitals.  I ask the House now to consider two of our principal voluntary hospitals, the Mater Misericordia and St. Vincent's.  They happen to be Catholic hospitals.  When one goes back to the traditions from which they sprung what does one find?  One is driven back to the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century, to a period of intellectual resurgence, of an appreciation of the carrying on of national work and the moulding of our people's efforts towards a proper understanding of the need for the care of the diseased, the poor and the afflicted.  All that formed a definite rhythm in our national life.  I suggest to Deputies that they will find in the rise of religious orders, such as the Sisters of Mercy, the Sisters of Charity, the Christian Brothers and the Presentation Brothers, in the work of Catherine Macauley, Mary Aikenhead, Nano Nagle and Ignatius Rice the intellectual resurgence to which I have referred typified by the definite rhythm in our national life which succeeded in maintaining our people as a nation and gave them institutions through which they were able to express themselves, maintain themselves, develop their sense of nationhood in a voluntary way until we find ourselves to-day, as a result of their efforts, with complete control of our own country.</P>
    <P>I mention these two hospitals because they are outstanding examples of voluntary hospitals.  The roots from which they grew were fostered by the mutual co-operation and work of Catholic and Protestant alike.  Mary Aikenhead, the founder of the Irish Sisters of Charity, had a Protestant father and a Catholic mother. Catherine Macauley, the founder of the Sisters of Mercy, was reared in a Protestant atmosphere, married a Protestant and for part of her life was <Col N="1093" /> herself a Protestant.  Anybody who knows anything of the development of the Christian Brothers, the Presentation Brothers, the Irish Sisters of Charity or the Sisters of Mercy knows that these are national institutions founded by the willing and voluntary co-operation of both Catholics and Protestants.</P>
    <P>Now I want to see the spirit of the voluntary hospitals as exemplified by these two hospitals fostered.  To permit State interference in the way suggested by Deputy Dr. Browne or Deputy Cowan would be to give control contra our national traditions. It would be tantamount to going against our national traditions and would inevitably injure the potentialities of our people for making this country what we think it should be.</P>
    <P>We have gone through a very difficult period of 30 years.  Many problems have been left unattended.  Many artificial influences have pervaded our people, creating difficulties of one kind or another, whether between Party and Party or between Catholic and Protestant, and these influences have been fostered by people for their own particular secular aims of one kind or another.  I ask Deputies to consider the roots from which our voluntary hospitals have grown and to look back for a moment over the national rhythm of which the work of the lay people and the foundation of the religious orders to which I have referred at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century all formed a part.  James F. Kenney, Keeper of the National Archives in Canada, has published a volume which is available in the Library entitled <i>Sources for the Early History of Ireland.</i>  In an introduction he epitomises Irish history in such a way as to bring out the background of thought, and the sequence of his writings shows that after the Viking invasion there was an uprising in the country characterised by the amalgamation of secular and religious learning.  At page 10 he indicates that there were two dominating movements at that particular time; that the churches that survived the Viking storm in the 11th and 12th centuries <Col N="1094" /> experienced important religious secular developments.  That development was both religious and nationalist in character.  At page 12 he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The ultimate effect, however, seems to have been rather stimulating: the national revival which developed out of two centuries of alternate disaster and triumph showed itself in a rejuvenated literature and scholarship.  Noteworthy features of this intellectual renaissance were that amalgamation of secular and religious interests to which reference has just been made.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It is suggested here that the State should control our voluntary hospitals, to the extent perhaps of setting up statutory bodies, and I want to point to the sources from which these hospitals sprung. They came from the educational work of the Catherine Macauleys, the Mary Aikenheads, the Nano Nagles and the Ignatius Rices at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, a period when democracy was getting its first chance of asserting itself. It had attempted to assert itself in arms in 1798.  Following on that we had an intellectual resurgence.</P>

After the Normans, it could be said, on page 17, that &ldquo;the triumph of Irish civilisation was greater than that of Irish arms.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want, respectfully, to suggest that when the voluntary hospitals, Catholic or Protestant, are being attacked and when an incipient attack is being developed against them here in an Irish Parliament, it behoves us, in the interests of our national future, of our people's strength, and of our being so secured in our minds as to what we are doing that we will be prepared for an emergency in the future, to take a short glance at what it was that helped to raise our people after dark days in the past&mdash;that helped them and prepared them to get through the very difficult days which they were faced with.</P>
      <P>We are concerned to-day with the intellectual, the spiritual and the material development and strength of our people.  When this is the only forum that is left to us to examine the details of a Bill of this kind, we can afford, in this forum, to convince ourselves that we have in what is left in our voluntary hospitals, as we have in what is in our schools to-day&mdash;the dominating control of our schools by the religious bodies, free and unimpeded for every religion in the country &mdash;that in our hospitals as in our schools we have the seeds, the legacy and the traditions that helped to raise our people after the debacle of 1798, that helped to give our people education and that helped to give them strength.  Our medical schools, which affect life and health, are as vital to the education of our people, to their spirit of independence, their spiritual welfare and their material strength, as what they learn either in our primary or secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1096" /> I just want to show that there was that intellectual uprising after the Viking wave had passed so that it could be said that &ldquo;Irish civilisation was stronger than Irish arms&rdquo;.  After the Elizabethan crushing out, it is worth recording this from Kenney's book:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Upon its having been observed by certain parties of the true order of St. Francis that the holiness and righteousness of their mother and nurse, Ireland, had perceptibly diminished, through not having the lives, wonders and miracles of her saints disseminated within her, nor yet made known in other kingdoms, the counsel they adopted was to send from them into Ireland a poor Friar Minor of their own, the Observantine Order, Micheál Ó Cléirigh (a chronicler by descent and education), in order to collect into one place all the books of authority in which he could discover anything that related to the sanctity of her saints, with their pedigrees and genealogies.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>From the movement that was started after the Elizabethan crushing-out, we came along until we got the Mother Mary Aikenheads and the Catherine Macauleys who, with the co-operation of their Protestant neighbours and Protestant relatives, and in many cases their Protestant parents, laid the foundations of what we must characterise as the secular, the religious and intellectual development which took place at that time, and made it possible for our people to exist, to establish schools and provide for the treatment of the sick.  All that helped to keep our people in the position in which they had the strength of a nation.  It was these voluntary institutions which strengthened our people's fibre for the future.  They strengthened not only our people's national fibre but their educational fibre as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say that, before any of the influences from the receding tide of futility, disagreement and disorder which are the result of the unhappy <Col N="1097" /> experiences since 1914&mdash;before the remnants of that time are allowed either to muddy our discussions or dictate our actions or policy&mdash;we ought to look at our traditions and our institutions.  We ought to determine whether our voluntary local institutions and State organisations in the past were the ones that saved and strengthened our people when the central institutions broke down and that, when we have been enabled by Providence to set up our own Parliament here and our own central institutions, we ought not now, through our central institution, trample down the small local voluntary bodies through which the real calm and constructive spirit of our people breathed. Therefore, when we are discussing and deciding that the State is not going to put its heavy hand on our voluntary hospitals, or on any of our voluntary institutions, it is worth while looking at what it is advisable for us not to do.  It is advisable for us not to do this because this State would not be here to-day if it were not for the spirit which breathed itself into our people through the education, the hospitals and the charitable institutions that were founded in these days and arose out of the debacle of 1798.</P>
    <P>That is my answer to those who say that they want to squander and to spend money building up stone edifices of one kind or another and think that the State, because it is paying for the maintenance of these stone edifices into which the hospitals' funds are being put, can take over the spirit that lies behind the foundation of those institutions&mdash;the spirit of those who founded those hospitals and charitable institutions and which have since been carried on in that spirit.  Let me say to them that we have got something here that other people have not got. Let us hold on to what other people have not got, because it is the thing which enabled us as a nation to live after one crushing defeat and another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Mulcahy has been wasting the time of the House by his long contribution.  I do not think many could understand what he was talking about.  His idea was to delay the passage of the legislation. I do not propose to press the amendment this morning or later, but I intend to press the intention behind it as long as I am here in the Dáil&mdash;for five or ten years or whatever it may be.  I would say to Deputy Esmonde that I was very careful to choose my words meticulously in moving the amendment, pointing out that I did not want to upset in any radical way the existing voluntary system.  In reply to Deputy Mulcahy, I was particularly careful to say that I did not intend that there should be established statutory boards on the lines of C.I.E. or the G.N.R.  I mentioned them merely to show that it is the accepted practice when you are giving a lot of money to a company to see that the representatives of the people have some say in the spending of it and know where it goes.  That is perfectly reasonable if we accept our responsibilities as Deputies in a democratic Parliament.</P>
      <P>As to the extension of State control, I did not suggest we should have State control of the voluntary hospitals.  I suggested that we should have an increase in the democratic control.  I was very pleased to hear Deputy McGrath say it exists in the City of Cork, where many Deputies, either as members of local this House or as members of local authorities, have right of access to these boards.  The City of Cork seems to be in advance of us here in Dublin in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any of the orders who run hospitals in Cork or any of the doctors there are in any way encroached upon by the State&mdash;I have had no complaints to that effect&mdash;by virtue of these public representatives being on the boards of those institutions. I honestly do not think the average voluntary board in Dublin&mdash;lay board, at any rate&mdash;would resent very much the inclusion of a public representative, a nominee of the Minister, whether he is a Deputy or a county councillor, possibly because he is an <Col N="1099" /> expert in some particular aspect of public administration.  One very prominent member of a voluntary board recently suggested that it would be a good idea if the Government did send along someone to see how the work was done and what work was done.  I do not wish to press it on this occasion.  I was anxious that a certain view should be made known, I had the right to express my views and did not expect everyone to agree with them enthusiastically.  They were reviewed on their merits and I was prepared to hear reasonable arguments made against the case I put up.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied most effectively, I thought, to the suggestion that the sweepstake moneys have been misappropriated. This charge has been made elsewhere against myself as well as the Fianna Fáil Government.  I think that the refutation, to the effect that 75 per cent. of the money spent has gone to the voluntary hospitals rather than to the State hospitals, was an adequate one.  In relation to the stamp money, 25 per cent., I might say I objected to that going to the Department of Finance.  Formerly, when I was Minister, I suggested that it was unfair.  I may be wrong in that, but that was my view.  I felt that it should go to the hospitals&mdash;whether voluntary or State did not matter, as it was the sick people we are trying to cure that I was primarily interested in. That suggestion was turned down by Deputy McGilligan as Minister for Finance and in consequence the money continued to flow to the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred to the cost of sickness.  I am afraid we all differ on the force of that particular argument and on what sickness costs.  Personally, I do not know of a limit that I would put, either for myself, for my own family, as a Deputy, as a public representative, or as a Minister, to the money that I would make available or wish was made available to any citizen of the State, rich or poor, adult or child, for the restoration of his health or the saving of his life.  I concede to Deputy Esmonde that money should <Col N="1100" /> not be misused or misspent, that maladministration should be reduced to the minimum; but it is not a good argument to place on one side the hospitals that spend much money and on the other side those that do not spend so much.  The Minister replied even more effectively by showing, as was my own experience, that the most expensively run hospital in Dublin is a voluntary one.  I do not know whether the cheapest is a State hospital, but the Minister says it is and I accept that.  I would not be terribly impressed by the expenditure argument in relation to health costs.</P>
    <P>I was asked if I would be in favour of raising the rates to increase the expenditure in St. Kevin's or St. Mary's. If it were necessary in order to improve the health of people or to save life, I would be quite prepared to stand over the raising of the rates or an increase in taxation.  My attitude to these matters is that the community is responsible to the weaker sections, the poor, the aged and the sick; that from the community purse funds should be made available to the extent required, no matter how heavy that burden may be, and that we should readily accept that burden, reducing to the minimum the unnecessary expenditure and administrative costs. The community is responsible for health services for the aged and so on and the dominating practice should be that whatever resources the community has will be redistributed so as to give every boy and girl, every young man and woman, exactly the same opportunities in this aspect of the social life of the community.</P>
    <P>I repeat that I would not wish to interfere with the truly magnificent work which religious orders have done for so long in voluntary and State hospitals, particularly, as I said last night, in our very ill-equipped county homes, where they do probably the best work.  My main point is that I would like representatives of the public to be on these boards.</P>
    <P>At the moment, certainly in the non-community or the non-religious hospitals, the tradition of appointment on these boards has led to the appointment, <Col N="1101" /> in the City of Dublin at any rate, of people who belong to a particular section of society.  I have no objection whatever to these people being members of boards or governors of boards of hospitals but I do not see why we also, the public representatives, the public patients in the ward, the patient in the public bed in the hospital, should not have right of access in so far as he may want to make a formal complaint and see that something is done about a particular matter.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Health there were occasions when I was written to to inquire about matters where people were dissatisfied, whether it was in regard to service, bad food, bad treatment, ill manners&mdash;whatever it may be.  I am not suggesting that these complaints were very frequent. I am merely suggesting that these complaints were there and, although as Deputy Cowan pointed out last night, I, as a representative of the people for the time being, was paying a lot of money for the running of these hospitals, I had absolutely no functions whatever, I had no right of inquiry beyond the right of a private citizen. Many of the voluntary hospitals to whom I wrote at that time making inquiries replied in a most courteous and a most helpful way.  Some of them saw fit to point out in an abrupt way that I had no functions in the matter and that there was nothing I could do in relation to a particular incident that occurred.</P>
    <P>However, we will have an opportunity again of raising this matter, I hope, on another occasion.  Gradually I think we will be able to persuade people that we are not seeking anything which is outrageous or revolutionary and that we are not asking to have any really fundamental change in the organisation and running of these institutions, that we are merely asking that there should be a greater degree of democratic control&mdash;democratic in the real sense of the word.</P>
    <P>I can understand Deputy Mulcahy's attitude.  He has grown up and lived with these institutions and has become particularly attached to them, I have <Col N="1102" /> no doubt, over the years, but he must accept that our generation are now gradually beginning to impose ourselves and to be anxious to impose our will and our wish on the form which our society will take.  He must also understand that no society can remain static or fossilised or ossified&mdash;such a society would be a dead society&mdash;and that anything that these institutions, for which we have all great regard and great respect, can do in order to increase their efficiency&mdash;efficiency can be the only consideration that must weigh with us&mdash;and to increase their value to our patients, the people for whom we are paying, the sick people for whom we are providing these services, and to give better service to our people is just fine as long as it does not conflict with any of the fundamentals, the natural law or the moral law.</P>
    <P>A point has been made by Deputy MacCarthy and Deputy McGrath.  I do not wish Deputy MacCarthy to feel that I am bringing him into my rather more advanced views, possibly, than his, but he did mention the fact that these practices are accepted in the City of Cork.  In consequence I do not think there can be any suggestion that they are as advanced or as dangerous as Deputy Mulcahy seems to imply.</P>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Dr. Esmonde was serious when he suggested that Deputy Cowan thought the inspector could protect the patient from getting a wrong operation. Deputy Cowan's suggestion was that, if there was an operation carried out which the patient thought was a wrong operation, the inspector would have the right of inquiry and the question could be pursued to the patient's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The points which I wish to raise in relation to it, I hope to raise again on as many occasions as present themselves. Eventually I hope to be able to persuade the House that I am not proposing anything which is unduly revolutionary or which will conflict with the best interests of these fine institutions but something which will merely increase their efficiency and thereby <Col N="1103" /> increase the already high prestige in which they stand with the citizens.</P>

      <P>I do not presume to have any knowledge of how the hospitals in Cork are operated or how the boards are appointed or manned, but I do not think that Deputy Dr. Browne can use the position that exists in Cork to support what he is trying to do.  Whatever has been entered into in Cork, I think I would be right in saying that it has been entered into on a purely voluntary basis, the result of voluntary agreement between those who are responsible for operating the hospitals in Cork.  In other words, whatever the position is there at the moment, however the boards may be constituted, it was not as a result of any dictation or direction or anything in the law that imposed it on them.</P>

      <P>That is a completely different matter.  I am thankful for the information.  It proves the point I set out to make that Deputy Dr. Browne was trying to use a situation to support his views that has no relation whatever to what he is trying to do and what he would like to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne said that he was very scrupulous in his use of language <Col N="1104" /> in moving and supporting and speaking to this amendment.  He undoubtedly was.  He was so scrupulous that his speeches were completely different, of course, from his intentions&mdash;completely different.  The Deputy spoke for quite a time on this, covered quite a number of points but he only came down to the real reasons at the conclusion of his speech.  He showed us that this desire of his is based on the fact that he found he could not interfere in the running of a voluntary hospital during the time he was Minister and that he could not dictate to them as to how the voluntary hospitals should be run. He has admitted that he tried to do so and was rather peremptorily&mdash;or his interference in the matter was&mdash;rejected. I think we got the Deputy's mind towards the end of the speech when he told us of his belief in his right to impose his will on society.  That is where he and those who think like him differ from the rest of us, but, according to the Deputy, we are getting old in our ways as well as in years and becoming almost fossilised.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be unfair to say that the type of speech which Deputy Dr. Browne has just delivered, coolly and calmly giving his real mind, is the type of speech that was made some years ago in Germany and in Italy.  The system is wrong; it must be changed.  Under the present system certain people have not the right to impose their wills on certain organisations or on society.  But Deputy Dr. Browne thinks he ought to have the right to impose his will on certain organisations and societies in this country.  I do not believe for a moment that either side of this House will agree with that.  Perhaps it is just as well that the Deputy this morning coldly and calmly announced in such clear language his real mind on these matters.</P>
    <P>The Deputy does not believe in the voluntary hospitals.  The Deputy believes that the Minister should have a right to impose his will on the voluntary hospitals.  The Deputy says that when he became Minister he found he could not do it.  He tried to do it, and he resented it when he would not be allowed to do it.  He said that he found <Col N="1105" /> as Minister that he was paying over money to these hospitals.  Might I remind the Deputy that his predecessors for nearly 20 years were in a similar position, that the present Government for a period of 16 years were handling the Hospital Sweepstakes money and during that 16 years I do not think any Minister for Health, or Minister for Local Government and Public Health as it was before, ever sought, in Deputy Dr. Browne's words, to impose his will on any of the voluntary hospitals, and I do not think any Fianna Fáil Minister would ever try to do it?  I was very glad to see that the Minister made it quite clear that he was not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear on this matter.  The Hospitals' Sweepstakes were originated and run in this country for the voluntary hospitals.  The first Bill dealing with the sweepstakes was passed in this House for that purpose.  Subsequently changes were made, changes that, in my opinion, were not for the better and were unfair.  With one statement which Deputy Dr. Browne made I find myself in absolute agreement, that it was wrong for the State to take out of the Hospitals' Trust Fund very large sums of money over a long period in the form of stamp duty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment was put down because Deputy Dr. Browne says that when voluntory hospitals are in receipt of State money the State or the local authority should have some say in the running of them.  The Deputy spoke for some time and gave his views clearly and fully on this question of the 25 per cent. stamp duty.  All I am saying is that I find myself in entire agreement with the Deputy on that matter.  I am not in <Col N="1106" /> a position to question his statement as to what he is supposed to have put up to Deputy McGilligan on this matter when he was Minister for Finance.  All I can say is that I never heard it put up by Deputy Dr. Browne or anyone else.  I am not saying that the Deputy did not put that to Deputy McGilligan, but I do not know anything about it.</P>
      <P>None of us, not even Deputy Dr. Browne, can have other than a very limited personal knowledge of how the voluntary hospitals are operating.  But, so far as I can gather from people in this city and in the country who had occasion to avail of the services of these hospitals, I think that on the whole they have been very satisfied with them.  We know quite well that, whether it is a voluntary or a local authority hospital, there will always be patients and the relatives of patients who will make complaints, well-founded or otherwise.  Any Deputy who has served even for six months on a local authority knows that that is quite true. But I have always heard that our voluntary hospitals, both from the point of view of their committees of management and from the point of view of their staffs, are at least as good, and some of them are supposed to be better, than those in other countries.</P>
      <P>There is no use in Deputy Dr. Browne saying that he does not want to cast any reflection on the hospitals or on those responsible for their management and for the medical and surgical services given when in fact he does.  The Deputy's statement was very disturbing.  It must cause concern on all sides of the House.  The Deputy showed his real mind on the matter, and that is his right, according to himself, to impose his will and his power.  That is something which will cause a bit of a shock.  It may be because we are old-fashioned, but I do not think we are as old-fashioned as all that.</P>

      <P>It is not a question of Deputy Dr. Browne's will, but the will of the people, the democratic right of the people.  The first thing I should like to comment upon is the association between these voluntary hospitals and the Local Appointments Commission. From now on large sums of money will be made available to these voluntary hospitals by the taxpayers and the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>I think it is a serious thing if the general public realised that they are now going to pay large sums into these hospitals while at the same time there is no guarantee whatever that the sons and daughters of the taxpayers who become professional men and women, in other words, doctors, will have a chance of appointment to these voluntary institutions.  There is no doubt whatever that in many of these institutions the appointments to the medical staff are made in a manner which must cause grave doubts in the minds of the public as to whether the best candidates are appointed.</P>

      <P>The opportunity of appointment to the staff of a voluntary hospital is not available to the sons and daughters of the taxpayers of this country.  In the Local Appointments Commission there is an equal chance for every doctor who goes before it and the best horse jumps the ditch. In the voluntary hospitals I know perfectly well that influence can be <Col N="1108" /> used and that the question of the best qualified doctor does not always meet with the approval of those who make the appointment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the first point I wanted to make.  I want to make a second point in connection with these voluntary hospitals.  I do not for one moment suggest that these voluntary hospitals are not giving good service.  I would be the last to suggest that our religious communities, who run many of these institutions, do not do excellent work but that is not the point at issue.  In no other sphere where State money is allocated does the State give up the right to ensure that that money is utilised to the best advantage of the community as a whole. Where any State institution or any semi-State body is given money by the House for some particular important purpose this House has a right, every 12 months, to discuss the manner in which that money was spent and to offer criticism in respect of the manner in which it was spent.  Wherever public money is given, we, as the representatives of those who pay, should at least have the right to ensure that the highest possible standard of efficiency is available in these voluntary hospitals and there is no higher standard than that in our local authority hospitals.  I am speaking now as one who knows the local authority hospitals in my own constituency and I can say without any doubt that if every other hospital in the country was as good we would have little criticism in respect of that type of hospital to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cannot be suggested that the Deputies in this House are trying to act as dictators so far as the voluntary hospitals are concerned.  I could not <Col N="1109" /> for one moment accept that the board in these voluntary hospitals had a terrible dislike to public men.  At the present time there are many public men on these boards, not in their capacity as public representatives but they are on the board.  I cannot see why members of local authorities and the members of Dáil Éireann, who are members of local authorities, should not have the right, on behalf of the taxpayer, to inspect these institutions from time to time and satisfy themselves that the money given by the public is put to the best possible use.</P>

      <P>I do not hear any outcry from the defenders of the Faith on the opposite side of the House about that.  I think they have an opportunity of giving expression to their views now.</P>

      <P>From a personal viewpoint, I do not see anything drastic about this amendment.  I think it is very desirable.  I cannot see how it will interfere in any way with the working of a voluntary hospital if there is a system of inspection.  We have that system in regard to the local authority hospitals and it gives very good results.  I think we should have it in the voluntary hospitals just as well.</P>
      <P>Much has been made about complaints coming from time to time from voluntary hospitals but if you had some system of inspection it would be easier for the people on the visiting committee to see whether complaints were well founded or not.  Taking this amendment at its face value, I say it is exceptionally commendable.  I am speaking as a member of a visiting committee and I cannot see why the Minister should refuse to accept it. From what Deputy McGrath stated and from what other Deputies sitting behind him stated, they appeared to be in favour of it.  I cannot see why they could not enforce their opinion on the Minister.</P>
      <P>I do not understand Deputy Morrissey's objection to this measure, that the State would be imposing its will on the voluntary hospitals.  I think it is not intended that this amendment should be in any way as drastic as that but that it would give to patients and relatives of theirs an assurance that either the State or the local authority would appoint some properly qualified persons who would at regular intervals visit these hospitals and see that everything was going well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every hospital in the State has a visiting committee and that visiting committee undoubtedly performs very useful work.  In the first place, the members, who are usually members of the local authority, go round to see the conditions obtaining so far as bedding, food, clothing, and the general health of the patient are concerned.  They <Col N="1111" /> have an opportunity of conversing with the patients and of finding out if they have any complaints.  In the same way, district hospitals throughout the country are generally visited to find out the conditions obtaining in the hospitals.</P>
    <P>While the voluntary hospitals are giving great service, I do not see how the management board of any voluntary hospital could object to a visiting committee, let it be a person appointed by the Department or a number of persons or let it be some person appointed by a local authority.  I think it would be most desirable, because any complaints that would be made to public representatives of patients in these hospitals as regards the conduct of any particular member of the staff, or otherwise, could more easily be dealt with if there were a visiting committee to ascertain whether or not the complaint was justifiable.  I think it would be an advantage to the voluntary hospitals themselves because such a committee would provide a better chance of having the work being done in these hospitals publicised as well as the undoubted benefits which many of these voluntary hospitals are conferring on the people.</P>
    <P>I think there is nothing objectionable in this amendment.  It is seldom that I have occasion to agree with the former Minister for Health.  However, he has had three years' experience as Minister for Health and he must have had experience of hospitals.  He mentioned that he received complaints&mdash; some of which, probably, are unjustifiable&mdash;but that, even in his capacity as head of the Department of Health in this State, he had no function to enable him to inquire whether or not the complaints were justifiable.  That is a deplorable state of affairs.  Coming from a former Minister, I accept the statement as being true.  If a complaint is made to the Minister for Health in the morning by a patient in a voluntary hospital or by a relative of that patient the Minister has no function to ascertain whether or not the complaint is justifiable.  Surely, in this year of 1953, such a position should not exist.  Voluntary hospitals or any <Col N="1112" /> other hospitals for the maintenance of which public money is being contributed should definitely have some type of visiting committee which will visit them periodically and see how they are being operated.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGrath raises the question whether, in a voluntary hospital which is controlled, say, by a Protestant committee&mdash;a Protestant hospital as distinct from a Catholic hospital&mdash;the hospital authorities should be overruled and powers should be taken to see that in the matter of appointments, Catholic doctors would get preference as against Protestant doctors.</P>

      <P>I marvel that Deputy Dr. Browne, on the one hand, can pay a tribute to the prestige of our voluntary hospitals, while on the other hand, Deputy Cowan, whose name is also down to the amendment, can talk about the necessity for supervision in order to avoid having the wrong leg cut off.  I marvel also that Deputy Dr. Browne, who is in touch with the general run of hospitals and institutions throughout the country, can cast aspersions on the voluntary hospitals when comparing them with local hospitals. I am very glad to hear that the local hospital in Roscommon is of the highest possible standard&mdash;so much so that Deputy McQuillan is prepared to recommend it.  Anybody with practical experience will appreciate the position <Col N="1114" /> in which we found this country 30 years ago when we took it in hands and the good-will and effcrt that went to improve our local institutions and hospitals throughout the country and how slow and difficult the progress has been.</P>
      <P>I suggest that those who have the responsibility of assisting local authorities to bring their institutions into a proper order have plenty on hands without abusing the spirit in which our most successful and our teaching hospitals were founded and are being run.  The position to-day is that their dispensary doors are crowded out&mdash;in Dublin City, at any rate&mdash;by people who normally ought to be dealt with by dispensaries run under the local authority.  Why are they so overcrowded? Is it because the people are met in these dispensaries with bad manners?  Is it because they are met by nurses who are underpaid?  Is it because they are given treatment which is not up to the best standard of treatment that they can get?</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne says that this is just a beginning and Deputy McQuillan thinks that this amendment is not sufficiently embracing.  It is not. However, you will never be able to get anything that would be embracing enough to curb the spirit of our Irish national voluntary institutions whether they be in regard to medicine, education, or any other field of activity.  Our strength lies there.  The tradition of our people lies there.  The fact that they have been messed up in the way they have been messed up since 1913 is no reason why their minds will not rise above the difficulties and disorganisation that exist in many directions at present.  If Deputy Dr. Browne, like a new mind appearing on the scene, feels that there is a lot of confusion and inefficiency and graft and preference of all kinds, it is perhaps good that the young minds in Ireland can feel something of that but, gradually, they will come to realise the kind of problem they are dealing with here and the traditional way in which it has to be dealt with.  However, they will not, in their youthful excitement, haste or enthusiasm, tear up the roots of our strength here.</P>

      <P>Very well.  The effect of this amendment is to make it absolutely sure that a local authority, in making an agreement with a voluntary hospital or other institution to take their patients, will include payment for the staff.  I am advised that the section as it stands does that, but representatives of the Irish Medical Association who are members of the Health Council have pressed this point very much, and I do not want to be accused by some of the members opposite, as I suppose they would like to accuse me, of interfering further with the voluntary hospitals in the way of encouraging that their staff should be paid.  I had no intention of interfering with them in that way; it was the members of the Irish Medical Association who are members of the Health Council who <Col N="1116" /> insisted on this amendment being put in, to make it doubly sure that, when local authorities are making agreements with the voluntary hospitals, the hospitals may insist that they will pay also for treatment so as to enable them to pay their staffs for looking after these patients.</P>
      <P>That, I admit, is going to introduce quite a new principle.  The voluntary hospitals, as we know and as has been pointed out here already, are now getting very few subscriptions from the public.  They are being maintained practically entirely, first, by payments from local authorities for the patients being sent to them and, secondly, by payments from the Hospitals' Trust Fund by way of deficits.  If there is added now the requirement that the staffs in these hospitals be paid, I am sure that some members will wonder what will be the voluntary content of these hospitals; but I am not taking responsibility for that, or at least I am not taking responsibility for being the originator of this idea.</P>
      <P>The idea was pushed very strongly on me by the Irish Medical Association who are anxious that nothing in the Act should prevent their being paid.  I do not think it is proposed by them that they should be paid now or in the very near future, but they want the Bill framed in such a way that, when they make their agreements with the voluntary hospitals for payment, the voluntary hospitals cannot claim inability to do it under the Health Bill.  That is why these amendments are put in.</P>
      <P>The amendment being inserted mentions institutional services and we had a great deal of discussion here yesterday on the meaning of institutional services, but at any rate it includes diagnosis and treatment.  The amendment, I am assured by my legal advisers, gives the necessary power to enable voluntary hospitals to pay their staffs, and, in making their arrangements with the local authorities, to get a sufficient amount from them for that purpose.  The journal of the Irish Medical Association in an editorial comment on this amendment said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provision had been made for the maintenance or treatment of any <Col N="1117" /> patient referred by a health authority to a voluntary hospital. Under the Minister's amendment No. 5, maintenance and treatment becomes the giving of institutional services.  The amendment, however, carries no hope that the staffs of the voluntary hospitals will be paid for the services given.  There is no change.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In case Deputies might have any doubt, that shows that the Irish Medical Association are anxious that the staffs in the voluntary hospitals should be paid.  The editorial comment in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> expresses the fear that I have not covered it properly in this amendment, but I can assure the Irish Medical Association and the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> that the position is now quite clear legally, if the amendment is adopted, and the voluntary hospitals will be in a position, in making arrangements with the local authorities, to insist on payments being made in such a way as to enable them to pay their staffs.</P>
    <P>I thought it better that the members of the Dáil should be perfectly aware of what is being done in this amendment, that they should know that we are departing to some extent from the voluntary nature of these hospitals, but if we are, I am asking the Dáil to agree to this at the request of the Irish Medical Association, and if the Irish Medical Association feels that it will be difficult or impossible to get staffs to work in voluntary hospitals in future without payment, the position has to be faced.</P>

      <P>Are we to take it that in relation to the honorary physicians and surgeons who, Deputy O'Higgins told us, were giving their time free in the voluntary hospitals, the Irish Medical Association, the association representing a section of the doctors at any rate, is anxious to have provision made to enable these doctors in future to be paid by the voluntary hospitals? The voluntary hospitals at the moment deal with many local authority patients and I cannot understand this proposal, in view of the attacks made on me <Col N="1118" /> in Cork by doctors who said they never charged a penny in the public wards of these hospitals.  Some said they were there for 30 years and had never charged.  Am I to take it now that the Irish Medical Association want to make sure that there will be provision to enable the voluntary hospitals to pay these doctors in future and that these doctors will not in future be appointed on an honorary basis but on some kind of salary or fee per head basis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to have any confusion about this.  I should mention that everybody realises that the staff, other than the medical staff, are always paid in voluntary hospitals. Some of the medical staffs, such as specialists who give their full time, are also sometimes paid in these hospitals. With regard to existing staffs, any of the senior staffs with whom I have discussed this matter are very definite that they are not going to accept payment, but they are thinking more of the future and they say it may be impossible to get junior staffs to continue&mdash;that is their opinion&mdash;unless some payment is made to them.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister a question?  It is my recollection of the National Health Council meeting&mdash;if I may discuss it&mdash;and of my own negotiations with the Medical Association, that they were anxious to have the higher staff paid for work carried out on institutional services, diagnosis, advice and treatment, by radiologists, surgeons, physicians and so on, the whole way through.  Does this amendment empower the Minister to fix a range of fees or to come to some arrangement on some sessional or salary basis for all the medical staff, <Col N="1120" /> the visiting voluntary physicians and the junior staffs who are not paid at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is not the idea. As a result of this amendment&mdash;I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that I had the power already but they were not satisfied; anyway the power will be given now&mdash;if the local authority pays, at the present time, let us say, £5 12s. per week per patient, and the voluntary hospitals were to say: &ldquo;We must get something for our staffs as well.&rdquo;  Suppose they increase that by 10/-; then it is for the voluntary hospitals to make their own arrangements with their staffs.  As far as this is concerned it only means that the local authority is to pay the hospital for both maintenance and treatment.  The hospital will then be in a position to put so much aside for maintenance and so much for treatment but they will make their own arrangements with their own staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make it quite clear that I am in complete agreement in regard to the payment for work by the visiting physicians, surgeons and so on?  I think that the present position is completely wrong and it should be rectified.  I do not think it is a great evil but it is much more reasonable that the physician or surgeon who gives his time should be paid for that time.  He has spent many years perfecting his particular speciality, whatever it may be, and has deprived himself of many things he would have liked at particular times in his life in order to become highly qualified.  He should be paid and well paid.  That was my attitude as Minister in fixing salary scales whenever the occasion arose.  I would hate it to be thought that I expected the medical profession to work for nothing.  The question of payment of the medical staff of the hospital is a most important one and I wish it could be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does seem to me by this amendment&mdash;I hope it is true&mdash;that the Medical Association as a trade union, may come to the Minister and say: &ldquo;We have received the authority of our voluntary boards to negotiate with you in relation to fixing of fees for institutional services&rdquo;&mdash;for diagnosis, <Col N="1121" /> laboratory work, investigations of all kinds, for advice, consultations, and for any time they may spend on work in the hospital on treatment relating to operations and diagnostic procedures of different kinds.  It would be reasonable for the Minister to come to a satisfactory arrangement agreeable to both himself and the Medical Association for payment for each of these different procedures involved in the provision of institutional facilities in connection with our health services for which we are now trying to lay the foundations in this Bill.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister is it so, that by virtue of this amendment&mdash;and I would say again, I hope so&mdash;the Medical Association, if they receive the authority of the separate or collective boards of the voluntary hospitals, can come forward to the Minister and say: &ldquo;We have received this authority, first of all, to negotiate on the amount of money that will be paid for the institutional care or maintenance of our patients, and, secondly, for the institutional services which will be made available to you by the members of our union, of our association&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Can they negotiate in the ordinary way as worker and employer for the best possible conditions they can get for their members?  It may appear a little bit odd to find me advocating the case of the Medical Association but I do feel in this particular instance they have a perfect right to go and negotiate and get the best possible bargain they can for their members, if it is now decided that the community will seek to avail of the expert advice, treatment and diagnostic facilities which will be put at their disposal and which we hope will be put at their disposal by the various voluntary general hospitals in the different cities.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy McGrath and, to a certain extent, the Minister, are anxious to emphasise that whatever is going to be done will be done by virtue of this amendment.  They are going out of their way to hang this right around the necks of the Medical Association.  I do not intend to argue the merits one way or the other but I <Col N="1122" /> want to remind Deputy Dr. Browne and the House that the Minister himself in moving this amendment said that he is advised that it was not necessary, because anything this amendment purports to do is already covered in the section.  He said he only introduced the amendment, although it really made no difference&mdash;it did not do anything or enable him to do anything that the section itself did not enable him to do&mdash;in order to remove any doubts that might be in the minds of the Medical Association or anybody else.  It was not his own amendment.  It was an amendment that was forced on him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey is quite right.  What happened was this.  Before Deputy Dr. Browne became a member of the Health Council, there was a session of the Health Council at which amendments were suggested. I should say that, roughly speaking, nearly every meeting dealt with this point that the voluntary hospitals should have power to pay their staffs. I argued that they have that power already.  They argued that they had not.  The Medical Association complained afterwards that they had come to me and that I had given them no satisfaction.  I said several times during the discussion that I was not against the hospitals paying their staffs but what I was arguing was that the power was there already.  They misunderstood me; they never grasped the point.  They always said the Minister would not agree to do that.  Therefore I had to do my best to make it plain that I am not against the principle of the hospitals paying their staffs.  It is made perfectly plain now that the power is there.  Coming to the point raised by Deputy Dr. Browne, I do not come into the matter of fixing <Col N="1123" /> the salaries, as Deputies know.  I have no function in any discussion between the voluntary hospitals and their staffs but it may happen that when the staffs apply to the voluntary hospitals to have their salaries fixed the voluntary hospitals may say: &ldquo;We shall have to go to the Minister to see if he will make up the amount in meeting the deficit or in the payments made for patients by local authorities.&rdquo;  If the Irish Medical Association come to me on that issue, all I can say is that I approve of the principle but that there should be some reservation with regard to the amount.</P>

      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Notwithstanding any enactment contained in any other Act of the Oireachtas the determination of any charge or charges to be made for any service provided under this Act shall be a reserved function in accordance with the provisions of the County Management Act, 1940.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Right through this Bill discretion is given to county managers and city managers to make certain charges for maintenance and for certain types of treatment.  The manager is not specifically mentioned but inasmuch as there is no clause to say that the making of such charges shall be a reserved function we thought it was necessary that this amendment should be moved.  I think a case can be made for giving this power to the elected representatives of the people and that the discretion as to what charge or <Col N="1124" /> charges might be made should not be left entirely to one man.  I am sure that if most managers were given this power they would not abuse it but there is the possibility that if one particular individual has the right to determine what particular charge should be made, or whether any charge should be made at all, such power might be open to wide abuse.  I submit further that the public representatives would, in the majority of cases, be in a better position to say whether a particular family or a particular patient could afford to pay a certain charge or not.  Because the matter is not specifically mentioned in the Bill and because the local authority in all cases means the county manager, I believe that this amendment is necessary to give the power of fixing charges to the elected representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that the Deputy is right in saying that all these charges are at present in the hands of the county managers.  The fixing of individual charges is definitely, but if the Deputy is speaking about the contract between the local authorities and the hospitals taking patients in Dublin, I do not know that that is a function of the county manager.  However, I suggest it should be regulated by the County Managers Act and there is a Bill coming forward which will deal with that point.  I do not mind at all except in regard to one point.  I would certainly insist that the fixing of individual charges should be in the hands of the county managers. This amendment says &ldquo;under this Act&rdquo;; it does not say &ldquo;under this section&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Under this Act&rdquo; means that the charges made to individuals who come into a county hospital must be determined at a certain figure, whether £2 2s. per week or some other figure.  I do not think it would be advisable that the county council should discuss whether a man should pay or not.  I think it should be left to one individual; that it should be inquired into and discussed confidentially. I do not think that any patient would like to have his case discussed publicly by the county council. In the Bill which was before the House, but which was not proceeded with, <Col N="1125" /> dealing with county managers' functions, etc., the Coalition Government agreed that the question of individual health charges should remain with the county managers.  That is all I am asking for.  I do not think this is the appropriate place for an amendment of this kind.  It could more appropriately be dealt with in the County Managers Bill when it comes before the House.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following sub-section:</P>
      <P>(1)  Where a health institution is discontinued under sub-section (1) or an Order under sub-section (2) of Section 11 of the Principal Act and&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  a person who held an office under a health authority in the discontinued institution is offered a similar office in another health institution managed by that health authority or by a joint board some of whose members are appointed by that health authority, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a person who held an office under a joint board in the discontinued institution is offered a similar office in another health institution managed by that joint board or by one of the health authorities who appointed the members of that joint board,</P>
      <P>the office held by the person in the discontinued institution shall, for the purposes of any enactment relating to superannuation, be deemed not to have been abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Section 10 stands it provides for the transfer of officers from a discontinued health institution to another health institution of the same authority or to a joint board whose members are appointed by the authority, but it does not cover the converse case where the health institution of a joint board is discontinued and it is desired that the staff be taken over by one of the constituent health authorities.  The purpose <Col N="1126" /> of the amendment is to make the converse apply.  There will probably in certain cases be a handing over of an institution by a joint board to a board that is at present one of the constituents of this joint board and it is to cover that particular point that the amendment is introduced.</P>

I do not know whether that is a matter that, even on appeal, the Minister would or could take into consideration.  As we know, it is the sort of case that frequently occurs in the transfer of <Col N="1127" /> officers, particularly officers of the State.</P>
      <P>I am trying to visualise the case of an officer, a married man with a family of school-going age, who is employed in an institution or near a centre where very good educational facilities are available for his family.  If he is transferred, as he can be under the section or under the amendment, to another institution remote from first-class educational facilities that will undoubtedly constitute a definite hardship on that officer and, in particular, on his children because they will be deprived of the educational facilities available in that officer's former position, so to speak; either that, or alternatively, equally good educational facilities can only be provided by him at very considerably increased cost.  I mention that as a type of case that not merely can happen but has happened quite frequently in so far as officers of the State are concerned.</P>

      <P>I support the points made by Deputy Morrissey.  Is it possible under this section for a medical officer or an officer in an institution to be transferred from a very good post in the City of Dublin to some post in a remote or backward area?  Can that occur?  I would appeal to the Minister to give the individual concerned an opportunity of appealing against such transfer.  I have in mind the case of the transfer of an officer from a station &mdash;I use the word &ldquo;station&rdquo; because that is what the office is called.  Some opportunity should be given for appealing against such a transfer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely difficult, as I said, to put in reservations that such officers would not be transferred more than ten miles, or something like that.  Take, for instance, Mallow sanatorium. That will be closed eventually and all the patients will be transferred to the regional sanatorium at Sarsfield Court: Generally speaking, no nurse will have a grievance as a result of that transfer.  The door-man or the hall porter, on the other hand, will have a grievance if any effort is made to transfer him because he will have a wife and family living in the vicinity <Col N="1128" /> of his present employment.  However, the institution in question will be used for some other purpose and I am sure a job will be found for him.</P>
      <P>There might be difficulty if a full-time surgeon with school-going children was transferred to an area where the same educational facilities would not be available to him for his children as they enjoyed before that transfer took place.  As Deputy Morrissey pointed out, we would, I admit, have some difficulty there.  I suppose we will have to deal with such cases as best we can by compensating the officer by sending his children to school, or something like that.</P>
      <P>Another example would be if Crooksling closed down and the patients there were transferred to the regional sanatorium here.  The same difficulties would arise.  Deputies will appreciate that it is very hard to the legislate for individual cases.  On the whole the fairest thing is to do what it says can be done in Section 10: if any particular officer thinks he has a grievance under this section he can appeal to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it is not merely difficult but sometimes impossible to provide for every case that may arise.  I think the Minister appreciates that it is possible, and even probable, that cases of hardship will arise.  The Minister says it may be possible to allow some measure of compensation for the loss of valuable facilities or amenities.  I noticed that the Minister, when talking about transfers, talked about a transfer within a particular region or county. Is it not possible to have a transfer from an institution in Dublin to an institution in Mayo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not adverted to that.  Take Galway now: there may <Col N="1129" /> be an officer working in an institution there with a school-going family.  He has secondary schools and a university available for his children.  The saving in board and lodgings, so far as the cost of the university is concerned, is enormous.  If he is transferred to another institution 50 miles away that may impose a very heavy burden on him in trying to continue the education he had started to give his children.  If he has a daughter in her second year at the university, such a transfer will be tantamount to a reduction in his salary of perhaps a couple of hundred pounds a year.</P>
      <P>I know that, even on appeal, it will be very difficult for the Minister to take all these things into consideration. What I am trying to urge and, if you like, put on record here, is that where a man's position is considerably worsened from the point of view of facilities and amenities&mdash;under the section he must be offered a similar post to the one he occupies&mdash;something should be done.  Putting additional expenses on him might be tantamount to reducing his salary by anything up to £200 per year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to have a look at Sections 10 and 11 of the 1947 Act.  Sub-section (2) of Section 10 of that Act provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister, after having caused a local inquiry to be held into the desirability of so doing, may by Order direct a health authority to:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  provide and maintain at a specified place an institution of a specified character and size, or</P>
      <P>(b)  restore, enlarge or otherwise alter in a specified manner any institution maintained by them pursuant to this section;</P>
      <P>and such health authority shall comply with such Order.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is with regard to maintaining, providing, enlarging or restoring any institution following a local inquiry. The Minister, in that case, may make an Order which shall be complied with by the health authority.  That is Section 10.  Now, sub-section (2) of Section 11 says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister, after having caused a local inquiry to be held in relation to the desirability of so doing may by Order direct a health authority to discontinue, as from a specified date, a health institution maintained by them or any department of such an institution.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section further provides that the health authority shall comply with every Order made in relation to them under the section.  The Minister is proposing to take power to discontinue an institution which has been established or a service which has been made available in an area and which forms <Col N="1131" /> part of the local life.  He is taking power, without holding a local inquiry and, if necessary, over the heads of the local authority in the matter, to close a dispensary, a clinic, a health centre, a first-aid station or any similar institution. I suggest that he is taking too drastic a power for the shutting down of a service that has already been established, and that he should not do that without holding a local inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The power to hold the inquiry is there, but I think myself it is ridiculous that we should have to go through all the formality of the holding of a local inquiry when dealing with small matters such as a dispensary, clinic, a health centre, first-aid station, or any similar institution. The purpose of the section is to remove the necessity for the holding of an inquiry in relation to matters of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point about it is that the closing of a dispensary in one case may not be a matter of very great importance, while in another case it might be of considerable importance, particularly to the people living in the area where it was proposed to close it down.  If we are going to err at all, I would prefer that we should do so on the lines that we have been doing up to the present.  It is with considerable hesitation that I venture to talk about clinics.  I understand, however, that nowadays, and to a greater extent in the future, these clinics are likely to become very important centres, much more so than the dispensaries.</P>
      <P>One is, naturally, always a bit nervous when one finds a proposal in a Bill to discontinue a service such as a dispensary or a health centre.  The words in the section &ldquo;or any similar institution&rdquo; may be capable of a very wide interpretation indeed.  I cannot speak with any authority on that, but I do submit that the Minister would need to make a stronger case than he has so far made for this section before asking the House to pass it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies are, no doubt, aware that a big effort has been made <Col N="1132" /> in the Department during the last few years, in fact since the Department was set up, to get local authorities to improve existing dispensaries or build new ones.  Local authorities have made a very good response in that direction, in recent months particularly since a grant was offered for the purpose by the Department of Health. There will undoubtedly be cases where local authorities will be very slow to carry out a direction, and so it may be necessary in the end for the Minister to make an Order, and say that they must either close the existing dispensary or build a new one.  It is only in the case of dispensaries where I think it may be necessary to do that.</P>
      <P>A first-aid station is a smaller thing than a dispensary.  A health centre would also be smaller.  I cannot promise what it may develop into, but at present it is not of any great importance.  I agree with Deputy Morrissey that clinics are much more important places than dispensaries. The county clinics that we are putting up at present will cost perhaps 20 times as much as a dispensary.  The words &ldquo;or any similar institution&rdquo; is the phrase which, I think, is usually found in a section of this kind.  Dispensaries, as I say, are the only things I have in mind.  The others are mentioned in the section because work of a more or less similar kind is carried on in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all anxious that the very many unsuitable&mdash;to use a charitable word&mdash;dispensary buildings should be destroyed and replaced at the earliest possible moment.  The only point the Minister has made in support of this amendment is that where a local authority is not taking steps to demolish unsuitable buildings which are being used as dispensaries and to replace them, he should have power to do that himself.  With all respect, I think that is the old story of the steam hammer and the fly.  The Minister does not need such wide powers as this section would give.  He has other and more effective ways of getting the local authority to carry out their obvious duty as quickly as possible to replace the many disgraceful dispensary buildings and provide <Col N="1133" /> proper well-equipped buildings in their place.  This section is far too wide to give the Minister what he wants to secure in this instance.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider it.</P>

It is a proposal to make certain that the two essential services are included in the rights of a group whom this Bill was primarily intended to cover.

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The regulations to be made under sub-section (1) of this section shall require that as far as practicable the general practitioner service to be provided under this section may be obtained by any person entitled to such <Col N="1134" /> service from any doctor of his choice who is a participant in a prescribed scheme and who is willing to accept such person as a patient.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister indicated in his Second Reading speech that he was prepared to accept this amendment or introduce a similar one.  Even at present there is a big demand for choice of doctor.  Under the present system the person who gets this particular service must go to one particular doctor.  I know very many cases of poor people who have the service of a dispensary doctor available to them but because they have not confidence in that particular man they go to another who is not a dispensary doctor and have to pay him a fee. They are also required to pay for medicines, pills or appliances.  Every one of us knows that is the case in our own constituencies and home towns.  I humbly submit to the Minister that the people catered for under Section 13 should also have a choice of medical practitioner.  I do not know if the Minister stated specifically in his Second Reading speech that he would accept this particular amendment but I would try to impress on him now the necessity to give that choice of practitioner to those people in the lower income group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not have been very specific but what I had in mind was amendment No. 22, choice of doctor in the case of maternity.  The Deputy's amendment would mean that the ordinary dispensary patient would have a choice of doctor.  That would be departing entirely from the dispensary system.  I do not think we can face that.  It is a thing that might come some time and it would be only right it should, but it is going to be a very big matter when it comes.  First of all, it would be very hard to give the choice in the ordinary dispensary district.  In the country districts there is usually only one doctor and the lower income group, as we call them now, will go to that doctor.  Acceptance of this amendment would not be of very much use to them, though it may give them some choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> It is not that that troubles me so much.  Whenever we face this issue&mdash; we may have to, some time&mdash;we will have a very big job on hands in dealing with the existing dispensary doctors. They will naturally claim compensation, they will claim to be continued as they are till the end of their days or almost so.  In addition, other doctors must come in, as you cannot give a choice otherwise.  The system will become suddenly a very much more costly one.  That would be a big problem in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>If this amendment were accepted, we would have virtually the panel system they had in Great Britain, where a person could go to any doctor he wished and someone would have to pay that doctor for his services, whether through the local authority or otherwise.  It is not contemplated at all in the present legislation that that should be done.  The furthest we are going in that direction is choice of doctor in the case of maternity.  It is the first step, if you like, but it is an easier one to take, at the moment, administratively.</P>
    <P>While saying to the Deputy that I must ask the Dáil to reject the amendment, it is not because I am against it in principle.  I would like very much to accept it if I were able, and I think it will come in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Our intention was partly to go that further step the Minister suggests will likely come.  With regard to the point that that would be a big step, could we get an assurance or is there anything the Minister can say? It is not so much the fee charged by the doctor who is the choice of the patient&mdash;he may be prepared to pay that fee&mdash;but it is the cost of the medicines prescribed.  That is the snag. Very often an ordinary working fellow in a particular income group will manage to pick the doctor his wife, son or daughter has confidence in.  We all realise that confidence in a physician is an important thing.  He will get the money to pay him.  However, when that doctor prescribes certain treatment, could there be any assurance from the Minister that the cost of the treatment would be met in <Col N="1136" /> the same way as if that treatment were prescribed by a dispensary doctor?  At the present time the local authority or health authority has no power to compensate for that.  Is there anything the Minister could say?  Does he think there is a case being made for him to suggest that he would include a section to deal with them?  If we got that assurance we would be prepared to say that he has met us reasonably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate last night I made specific reference to the secondary programme and I do not think it is necessary to go back on what I said.  It might be better to take a more positive attitude towards it.  I do believe that some of the <Col N="1137" /> things of which I complained last night have been to some extent corrected, but I think that correction has not gone far enough.  For instance, looking at the practical equipment that secondary education is supposed to give the child to face life, looking at some of the subjects involved from that point of view, I think we are really trying to do a bit too much and that we have got confused between the idea of general education, broad education &mdash;the ideal that perhaps we would all like to put before us&mdash;and the one imposed on us by life, that is, the practical fitting of the child for life.  As I tried to point out, the net result was a certain confusion, a certain lack of clinching with the problem and a certain inefficiency.</P>
      <P>Take the mathematical curriculum, for instance.  Look at it soberly.  If you leave aside the child who is going to specialise, say, in engineering, some of the physical sciences, whether applied or pure, including mathematics and those who are going to take an academic career in that subject, apart from the very limited number there, what does the average person need in mathematical knowledge even to-day? &mdash;mainly, a sound fundamental knowledge of arithmetic and the ordinary arithmetical operations.  He needs to be able to reckon; he needs a simple but direct practical knowledge of weights and measures, mensuration, and a facility with ordinary figures. It is doubtful even whether he needs to go so far as to be acquainted with the use of a logarithm.</P>
      <P>Let any of us ask the question: How many of us have wanted in ordinary life, apart from some specialised problem, to apply what has been taught to us in school in that particular line? We will find that it practically never turns up, even for an accountant.  The mathematics needed for business are still very simple.  What is needed is accuracy, facility and speed, which can only come from concentration and time given to these basic techniques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am taking logarithms as an example, as being perhaps the first stage where you just go beyond the limit. In order to exercise ourselves in these, <Col N="1138" /> we got extravagant and very unreal problems in compound interest but we never meet them in ordinary life.  The ordinary person does not meet them in ordinary life.  Nowadays, perhaps, as well as the categories I mentioned, the economist wants some equipment of that nature and some statistical equipment but he again is very much a specialist.</P>
    <P>So that, I would advocate in regard to the mathematical courses, particularly in the secondary schools&mdash;and I would say the same in principle for the primary schools&mdash;that the emphasis should be on the basic arithmetical techniques: adding, subtracting, dividing, reckoning money, simple mensuration, and so forth, and that more time should be given to developing a facility and a sureness in these techniques than we have been giving and which used to be given under the older system.</P>
    <P>So too with geometry.  In regard to geometry, again, an elementary knowledge is all that is needed.  Let us look back.  The First Book of Euclid or some definite system like Euclid has the advantage of being a definite logical system.  There is a training in logic there which is valuable in the secondary school anyway and I would not minimise it but that training is all the more valuable if one concentrates on the earlier portions of it and makes sure that that is assimilated and that the methods are assimilated in the simpler cases.</P>
    <P>Moving from that to practical results, what do we need afterwards?  I have tried to think of where practical knowledge is needed.  A few elementary properties, one in particular, the relation of the long side of a right-angle triangle to the other two sides, is probably a very important relation and one which will turn up but I think it is about the only one.  If a person can reckon the long side of the triangle by getting the squares of the other two and take out the square root, it is as much as he wants of geometrical knowledge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that is sometimes magnified into something more than it is.  If one looks at it intuitively, it is nearly easier on a symmetrical basis which, with all our formalism we are far too apt to ignore. While we have been immersed in a lot of vague formula, with the child rushing too fast, we fail to develop that intuitive appreciation of a practical problem that is one of the most important trainings for life you can give the child.  But that is an aside.</P>
      <P>In regard to the secondary course then, you can apply the same type of remarks to trigonometry.  An elementary knowledge and direct application of elementary trigonometrical tables is probably useful training, very closely related to the elementary geometry but I, for one, do not see the sense of then pushing that subject to the region of being something in the line of a mathematical puzzle.  Take the examination papers and the manipulation of all sorts of combinations of the various elementary trigonometrical combinations to give you all sorts of odd combinations which you arrive at by nice little formal manipulations on paper, some requiring certain ingenuity.  I think that is pressed a bit too far and, especially, I think I can say from some little experience, that the number of times that these queer puzzles ever come up for practical application, even if you are a specialist, is small.  Again, the ones you need for use, even as a specialist, are the relatively simple ones, such as the functions of the sum of two angles, or something like that, but some of the queer things we were so familiar with on examination papers and that you got in the specialist text books, may be all right for the specialist as training for him but, to my mind, it is taking up valuable time in a secondary curriculum and doing damage, in so far as that time is being filched from time that could be more properly applied to basic techniques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could dismiss a lot of the stuff we do about the calculus and analytical geometry and such things introduced into the senior secondary programme. Personally, I think that a good elementary knowledge of graphs would <Col N="1140" /> involve all the concepts that would be needed and give that intuitive approach that I think is much more valuable than a lot of formalism with d's scattered all over the place.</P>
    <P>The net point boils down to this, that it would be better to restrict the field and insist on thoroughness and a detailed practical application of the knowledge involved so that it will become part of the child himself and so feel a confidence in the matter.  One great danger about roaming over the field and a partial introduction to concepts is that you create a certain unsureness in the child.  To the not-so-intelligent child the thing becomes a mystery.  The intelligent child is not able to get at the whole basis of the thing and it becomes a problem with which he is never satisfied.  In either case you create a certain unsureness, a certain fear, if you like, a certain uncertainty, and you do psychological damage.  In the case, for instance, of say integration, to the non-intelligent child the thing becomes a mystery, and the intelligent child who is interested, immediately comes up against problems and sees certain things that require to be proved, because questions here arise which are by no means self-evident when you examine them, and which could not possibly be covered in a secondary course.</P>
    <P>Take the very simple case of showing that it does not matter how you divide the interval of the independent variable when evaluating a definite integral. That is well beyond what could be tackled in the elementary course.  That problem will strike the intelligent child.  The whole approach tends to stimulate doubt.  A simple practical use of graphs and so forth, coupled with a kind of accidental use of calculus ideals in connection with it would be a better and safer approach than we have been taking.</P>
    <P>An example of the thing, about which I can talk from practical experience, is that in the Army it was necessary to teach people how to read maps. My own personal experience was that the official textbooks opened out with descriptions of co-ordinates, locating a point in the map as against a point <Col N="1141" /> in the ground, and an approach of that nature, which of course is the specialist approach, with a reference to scales, etc.  I found that once you tried that with the ordinary soldiers the map was a mystery to them and some of them would never learn to read the map properly because you frightened the wits out of them when they started. I tried an experiment myself.  I got a crowd of soldiers.  Many of them had no education worth while.</P>
    <P>I first started to draw sketches of the posts which they were in, rough freehand sketches, and gave them an idea of drawing the ground and making freehand sketches without bothering about scales or distances, and gradually from that brought them to the actual maps and took them out on the ground and never bothered about measurements or distances, until they got to associate the lines on the maps with roads and features and so forth.  It became a very easy thing then to put to them the problem: &ldquo;You are going to tell me over the telephone if I am in an office in Dublin, exactly where you are by that map&rdquo;.  They were introduced to the idea of measuring distance scales and co-ordinates through simple practical problems.  With that type of approach I found that almost illiterate men could be expert map readers in the matter of a month.</P>
    <P>There is something of the same kind of idea in the back of my mind when I criticise the approach to some of these mathematical matters.  I urge on the Minister that he should restrict the field and insist on straightforward thoroughness and attention to detail. I think we would be doing at the same time two good jobs.  We would be equipping the child so that he would not have the fear of figures which has often troubled people in taking jobs, especially for doing clerical work.  It is a good equipment for the average child and corrects the other weakness in our national character which has developed&mdash;I am going so far as to say that our educational system has contributed to that particular weakness to which I have referred&mdash;a certain inattention to detail and a deficiency in sustained application.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1142" /> Before I leave that perhaps I had better refer to the position of the specialist.  I can anticipate somebody saying: &ldquo;That is all very well, but some people want to go further.&rdquo; I can answer by recalling a certain physics professor who would, at the beginning of a first term in University College, ask who had done physics before and who had not.  He preferred the people who had not.  It is better if you are going to go on to have that basic technique.  You are then able to take up the threads and go on whether you want to be an engineer, a chemist, a specialist in pure mathematics or an economist.  You can meet the case of the economist by giving some supplementary course in specialist mathematics. That will be infinitely easier if the basic techniques have been perfected. Those of us who have gone through the secondary school and then have specialised in some subjects of that nature have always found that lack of efficiency was due to a weakness in that basic technique.</P>
    <P>I have urged that point on previous occasions and I think I have urged it sufficiently now and will move on to another subject.  Again I must confess I have not been keeping very closely in touch with the details for some time past but I am sure my remarks apply to the situation as I knew it myself.  I believe there has been some correction but has there been sufficient correction? Take the case of Latin. Here, again, the specialists run riot in their insistence on perfect classical form and classical Latin.  Such things can be very fine and elegant and beautiful, like the higher structures of mathematics or any other subject, but they cannot be grasped unless you have the basis first.  Again, I have often thought that there should be concentration upon the basic techniques and more insistence upon the elementary appreciation of the fact that fundamentally it is a language, and that the first requisite in the language is to understand it and be able to express oneself in it.  If you are learning from scratch you have to start and be content with elementary expression and understanding.</P>

      <P>On the question of Irish, the emphasis there should, to my mind, be again upon simplicity and the spoken language.  My comments on the other subjects that arise would not be quite so trenchant as on the others I have selected and which seem to me to be the cardinal points except, of course, the vernacular English. There, again, there is a need for accuracy of thought.  If you are going to send a child loose over the field <Col N="1144" /> pitching him at everything in turn without having the time to insist that he will use grammar properly, write concise sentences, express himself properly, say what he means to say and write legibly, you are not fitting him for life.</P>
      <P>Many of us in my time went through the whole gamut of English literature. You philosophically analysed Shakespeare. I often felt that if poor old &ldquo;Will&rdquo; came back and listened to some of the punditry that goes on about him he would scratch his head and say: &ldquo;Good Lord!  was I not a great fellow and did not know about it?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The simple directness, the wonderful power and the true psychology of his works are lost in a lot of the pedantic analysis that goes on.  I confess that is a matter of personal prejudice.  With that and the verbal extravagances of Thompson and Shelley and many of the rest of them we did not know where we were. Nobody bothered to say: Look here, go and look at that.  Describe what you saw accurately.  Write down accurately in simple words what you think about that.  Write a letter about something accurately to somebody else.  These are all the primary things and first essentials of equipment but all that was forgotten and ignored in this floating around the place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The training that can come from concentration to detail was sacrificed for this airy fairy roaming around the place.  Both from the point of view of character and equipment, I can see that to be important.  After all our thinking&mdash;and I am not going into a discussion on that&mdash;for effectiveness is very much tied up with our powers of expression.  If we are made to be accurate, concrete and definite in our expression, our thinking will become less woolly and our ability to face facts and problems is increased.  Therefore, in regard to the teaching in our schools, secondary and primary, of the vernacular language I think the emphasis should be upon accuracy, sound expression, accurate grammatical <Col N="1145" /> expression, proper use of words and the expression of a succession of thoughts in logical order.</P>

      <P>I would not go that far.  I do not want to reduce anything to a drill.  That is another matter.  In a simple way you want to encourage initiative and power of expression but I am talking about the technique that is to be employed in order to have that done.  I could, perhaps, go on and expand but the net thing in all these subjects is to have regard to the point of view of equipping the children.  I would appeal for more attention to detail.  That in turn would have its reaction on the national character, particularly in regard to the points on which I have expressed myself as seeing it deficient.  Also, in that way people can develop more easily a love of industry.</P>
      <P>Amongst all the other drawbacks of that approach I have criticised is that in failing to get the child to apply himself for sufficient time to detail at a particular point we were failing to inculcate in him the habit of work.  The fussiness, coupled with a certain mystery in learning the subjects he encountered, tended to engender in him a certain amount of escapism from the whole thing.  That is my point to the Minister in that respect.  More attention should be paid to detail and, perhaps, more prescription because, of course, you have got to face it from the practical point of view.  No matter what we may say about cramming or examinations we had better face life as it is, human nature as it is and facts as they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The child, like the rest of us, will only work under a certain amount of compulsion of some sort or another, and you only apply that from of compulsion in the long run, especially for the older children in the secondary schools, through the compulsion of their having to account for the knowledge they have acquired.  No matter what you say about the examination system there is no alternative.  If you are <Col N="1146" /> going to have examinations let them be examinations.  If they are going to be effective they must be definite and they can only be definite if there is a definite system.  That seems to indicate a certain fairly definite prescription for all the subjects.  I am not dismissing the view points that have been expressed in the other way.  Some correction of the old system was probably necessary.  My point is that, certainly in 1925, the pendulum swung too far.</P>
    <P>In all this, there comes up a practical problem in regard to our approach to education.  The Minister and his Department are responsible for the control of education in this country.  I am afraid, and I say it without malice and with great sympathy, that our tendency in determining the courses in any particular subject has been to fall back on the specialist &mdash;who is the wrong man for that purpose. The specialist in mathematics, for instance, will see only his own line; similarly with regard to the specialist in Latin, and so forth.  What you want is a broad over-all view.  If you are going to pick the specialist, you should pick him to fix the curriculum in a subject in which he is not a specialist.  Though he may have very high qualifications, and so on, in specialised subjects, the specialist is&mdash; without adding undue force to the word&mdash;a menace from the point of view of general education.  I am not so sure that the specialist in education itself has not become another type of menace.  You can over-formulise in that.  I wonder, coupled with all that, if the Department has in the past listened sufficiently to the teachers who are doing the practical work. Have the Department left enough to the teachers, who have the practical problem?  I realise the need for control, the need for uniformity and the need for direction. However, when all is said and done, where you could get interested teachers who are setting themselves the task of doing their best for the children under their charge and who have got the best results, it is the teachers who come up against the practical problems and the local problems <Col N="1147" /> and the individual problems.  I sometimes feel that we have not taken the teachers enough into the problem of how best to put over education&mdash; and I am afraid we have not taken the unfortunate parents into account at all.</P>
    <P>What does a parent want for a child?  In the first place, the average parent wants a sound character education. The parents realise that there must be an ideal to which that character must be referred and that, of course, means a sound religious education and a sound basis there. After that, he wants a character that will cling to what is right and reject what is wrong irrespective of all other considerations, and who will have the industry to apply himself and make himself a useful citizen.  But, after he has all that, he wants practical equipment for life and he is not very much concerned whether his son or daughter got a nodding acquaintance with the fact that an old josser called Horace existed or that certain mathematicians evolved a new way of calculating certain general results.  He is not at all interested in that.  What he is interested in is that the child will have the basic equipment for facing life no matter what field he goes into, and that approach can be reinforced from the character point of view.  I may be wrong but I have a feeling that many parents would express themselves as I have expressed myself in this debate, so that I can finish by inviting the Minister&mdash;if I may&mdash;to let us know how far there has been a correction of that over-swing of the pendulum that occurred at the time to which I refer, how far there is need for further correction and how far we need to have our approach to this problem of the education of the ordinary citizen reconsidered.  I think that a survey of that nature might, perhaps, lead us to action which might have beneficial repercussions, not only for the individual citizen but for the national character as a whole.</P>
    <P>There are some other matters which I have in mind but as they are matters on which representations could be made in the ordinary way I do not think I should delay the House by <Col N="1148" /> expatiating on them now.  However, in all this, the teachers themselves are the most important force in perhaps one of the greatest social factors in this State.  Much of our nationality, traditions and outlook were saved and preserved by teachers in the past. They can do more, perhaps, than any one other individual section to build up and maintain the national morale. They are in key positions and their importance to the community must be rated accordingly, but they will respond to their responsibilities only so far as they are, so to speak, invited to do so and the responsibility is placed on them.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the teachers of this country grasping the fundamentals of things, taking upon themselves the great task of preserving the individuality of this nation, of preserving its outlook and of preserving all that is good in our traditions and outlook on life.  I should like to see them build up a strong character in our citizens and give a lead generally in a direction that would build up our national morale and through that approach, enable us to build up the type of nation in this country that we have all, on various occasions, said we want to see and professed to desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The few points I want to put before the Minister on this particular Vote will be of a much more prosaic nature than those put forward by the last speaker in the matter of secondary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point to which I wish to draw the Minister's attention is one which I raised in this House last year on this Vote and which I also raised on a number of occasions by way of parliamentary questions and that is the matter of the closing of schools in the Gaeltacht area.  I fully appreciate the Minister's difficulties there.  When the average falls, the Minister finds himself up against the pretty hard problem of what to do.  There must be, within the Department, some fence or some regulation whereby, when the average falls to a certain figure, something must be done about the school in which it happens.  Obviously it is uneconomic to pay a teacher or teachers to hold on <Col N="1149" /> a school where the number of children falls below a certain point.  The point which I made this time last year is that, particularly in the Gaeltacht areas, the school is very often away from the church or from the local community but is, nevertheless, a kind of centre.  It is a village centre, so to speak.  It is bad enough that the average number of children attending a school should fall below 15, thus causing the closing of the school, but I think it helps to put the last nail in the coffin-lid of the population of the area in which it happens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good job there is somebody left.  I want the Minister to do something about reopening some of the schools that have been closed, and not to close any other schools in areas where the child population is <Col N="1150" /> falling.  We hear a lot of talk about trying to preserve the Gaeltacht.  There is every indication, all down through the years since we got native government, that the most we are doing to preserve the Gaeltacht is pouring out a lot of empty talk, lip-service, in this House.  If we were serious, or if the problem had been tackled in the proper way, the shrinkage of the Gaeltacht would not have occurred in the way it has under home government.</P>
      <P>One of the features of national school education away back in the British times was the inclusion in school readers of a certain amount of information with regard to agriculture. This feature gave valuable basic information to the children.  They may not have appreciated it at the time they were learning it, but, later on, when the responsibility of managing a holding or a farm came to them, the things they then read and learned came back to them and proved of immense benefit to them.  It seems strange that in this agricultural country there is not a single word about agriculture in any of the school readers prescribed since the State was formed.  That is a very serious want, indicating a lack of interest in our principal industry, and the Minister should set about remedying the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He spoke at the opening of the debate about giving a half-day when the teacher could provide information about any particular subject he wished to deal with.  That is all very well, but, without doing that at all, we could revert to the system operated under our oppressors, by which some little knowledge of agriculture was given in the schools, without taking from or impinging upon the general educational programme.  Vocational schools are doing very well for trades and professions. They are of immense benefit, but they cannot do anything for agriculture in the way I suggest.  It is a particular calling in itself, and, while a vocational school might be able to assist to some extent, it will never be able to do for agriculture what it can do for trades.  I suggest that the Minister should have a talk with the higher officials of the Department and devise some means of providing some little <Col N="1151" /> amount of agricultural education in these school books.  Lessons on agriculture, particularly in country schools, would be most interesting, and, while not being out of place, would be of immense benefit to the children later.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the Minister's notice the position with regard to children who are mentally backward, who are retarded and who may suffer from some physical defect.  It is high time that the State did something for these children.  The ordinary national teacher cannot give the necessary attention to that type of child and so I am afraid that there is only one phrase by which to describe their position&mdash;neglected by the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking of the education of these children and the suggestion I make is that in each county there should be at least one school where these children could be educated.  The health aspect also arises and I can deal with that on another occasion.  Parents in many cases are unable to meet the financial commitment involved in educating or looking after these children properly, and there should be some special school in each county for the education and bringing forward of such children. We all know that, in the national school in the country district or country town, the teachers have quite a big problem in educating ordinary children, but the type of child I refer to is a problem in himself, a child who requires practically whole-time attention. I think I am correct in saying also that such children require a different type of handling and education from that given to the normal healthy average child, and I go so far as to say that there should be at least one school in each county for the education of these children.  The number of children involved might not be more than one or two in each parish and there might be national schools where none of these children attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> I for one do not blame the teachers if they cannot give the wholehearted attention they would like to give to the very few children of this type who may be attending the school.  It is there the Minister could come to the rescue of the children and of the teachers by having a special school set apart for them until they reach the age of 12 or 14 years.  They should be taken over completely, provided the parents agree.  If the parents have the means of doing what is necessary for these children, well and good.  I am not advocating any kind of compulsory system, but a system whereby the State would give assistance which would be availed of by the parents and the children.</P>
    <P>In this regard, no words of mine could express the high opinion I have of the work of the voluntary institutions in the city who care for such children as these, who give them a trade and so on.  The Deaf and Dumb Institute in Cabra is one such institution I have in mind.  Unfortunately, there are not enough of such schools to cater for this particular type and I feel that if these children could get a better type of education, an education more suited to them in relation to the ailment or physical or mental disability from which they suffer, it would go a long way to prevent them being badly treated in later life and would leave them more independent. Unfortunately in many cases these children grow up and, as a result of lack of education or of learning a trade, do not get the care or attention we should like to see them getting.</P>
    <P>With regard to the teaching of Irish, I have not changed my views since the debate of last year that compulsory Irish is the wrong way to try to re-establish the language.  I have never yet heard a Deputy say that the Irish language should not be revived.  We are all agreed on one thing, that we would like to see Irish spoken as much as possible and we would like to see it as the spoken language of the nation. However, we are going the wrong way about it.  The present system of compulsory Irish should be completely gone into and changed.  Let us all admit that it has not given the results we expected.  For that reason, it does not <Col N="1153" /> matter who started it, which Party or which Government started it.  If a thing is tried and is found not to be giving the results expected, there is no shame or disgrace or political loss of face in examining the situation and saying: &ldquo;It has been tried and it has not been up to our expectations; we will try some other scheme&rdquo;.  It is my opinion that the teaching of Irish compulsorily is resulting in a serious lack of ordinary education in the child.  I am afraid some children leaving the national schools have just a vague knowledge of Irish on the one hand and no knowledge at all of other subjects which would be useful.  They might be able to tell you in Irish that six multiplied by six make 36 but they do not understand that six multiplied by half a dozen means three dozen. They do not grasp it and that is one of the big handicaps coming against children who are forcibly fed with Irish during their national school period.</P>
    <P>In the West of Ireland at least we cannot overlook the fact that the only possible means most of our boys and girls have of obtaining a livelihood is by emigrating.  They find when they go to England, America, and other foreign countries that Irish is of no use.  It is a dead loss, as the saying goes.  The next thing they find is that by comparison the other side of their education has been neglected; they are not as well educated as their fathers and mothers were before the days of compulsory Irish, and they feel that loss very greatly.</P>
    <P>I may be taking the Minister now into a type of problem with which he is not familiar because, perhaps, he did not grow up with that particular type of problem as I did.  Nevertheless, let me say that in Connaught and on the western seaboard, that is a very real-life problem.  It is a very serious matter if we are to waste the best years of those children's lives in the national schools teaching them Irish because we would like to see the Irish language reinstated, when it results in their having neither Irish nor any other type of education.  That is not casting any reflection on the teachers.  They are doing what they are compelled to do.  It results from the policy emanating from this House and the <Col N="1154" /> time has come when all that should be completely overhauled.  I am afraid that we in this House are causing a certain amount of injustice and injury to the youngsters leaving school.  While I do not by any means say that nothing should be done for the re-establishment of the Irish language, I do suggest that our present methods are wrong and should be reviewed at once.</P>
    <P>Emigration is doing immense damage in the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht areas and until we find a satisfactory means of keeping our young people at home, it is useless talking about trying to preserve the Gaeltacht.  The Gaeltacht is the last stronghold of pure Irish.  There are some that will not like to hear me say that.  There are some that are so narrow-minded that they are not prepared to acknowledge that.  The only pure Irish is to be found in the Gaeltacht areas where it has been spoken down through the years.  The intense pressure since Elizabethan times in trying to have English as the spoken language never got a grip there.</P>
    <P>It is sad to have to say that since we established our native Government the Gaeltacht started to shrink, and has shrunk with alarming rapidity.  I am afraid we are doing nothing about it. The Minister for Education should definitely take up that matter with some of his colleagues in the Government, if we are to stop the Gaeltacht from shrinking, if we are to kill that fungus disease and prevent it from destroying the remnants of our native speakers. The disease I am speaking of is the steadily-growing and steadily-penetrating idea that to be called a native Irish speaker is a kind of slur on that person.  There is only one way to stop that and that is to give full employment to our youth in Gaeltacht areas and induce them by every possible means to stay at home.  We cannot ask them to stay at home for the purpose of saving the language, and to live on potatoes and salt.  If a genuine effort is to be made the Minister should take up with his colleagues the question of giving as much employment as possible.</P>

      <P>The preservation of the Irish language in the Gaeltacht is a matter for the Minister for Education. He cannot go down to the Gaeltacht with a stick or with guns to compel the people to speak Irish or to stay in the country, but he has at his disposal in the Cabinet his colleagues in whose hands lie the giving of employment, the starting of industries and other useful works.  To go further into that would be definitely irrelevant, and I do not propose to do so.  Nevertheless, I want to bring it home to the Minister for Education that it is the only way he will accomplish what I know he would like to accomplish, the preservation of the Irish speakers still left in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I wish to make a point which I should have included in my opening remarks in regard to schools in the Gaeltacht.  In the Gaeltacht some of our schools are a positive disgrace. The burst of school building which started during the reign of the inter-Party Government has, I am glad to say, been carried on by the present Government but at big expense. Nevertheless, it is grand to see in many areas new schools, some of the finest in Europe, being built to replace the old hovels.  But in the Gaeltacht I see many of the old schools not being attended to and they are liable to fall down.  To the people in the Gaeltacht that is another indication that we love talking about them, we love saying grand things but we do damn all when it comes down to brass tacks.  Most of these schools should be replaced by new ones.  A few of them are structurally sound and major improvements would make them all right.  However, some of them are a positive disgrace. When foreigners and tourists travel through the country and see these things we call schools, they must have a very poor opinion of our idea of developing the country and trying to help our population in those areas.</P>

      <P>I was not in the House last night to hear Deputy Major de Valera speaking on this Estimate, but I was here to-day from 1.30 p.m. when he was speaking, and I want to endorse everything he said.  I am in complete agreement with him.  Repetition <Col N="1156" /> is one of the things which takes up far too much time in the House. Therefore, I do not intend to repeat the various arguments put forward by him, but I strongly recommend them to the Minister and his officials.  There is a great deal to be said for the arguments put forward by Deputy Major de Valera on this Estimate.</P>
      <P>We have had approximately 30 years of freedom in this country.  Some few years after obtaining our freedom, we decided on a new system for reviving the Irish language&mdash;a system which in my opinion was completely foreign to our nature.  That was the system of compulsion.  There is an old but true saying that you may lead the Irish people but you will never drive them. That is what we are trying to do and unfortunately what we are continuing to do.  I should like to see some Minister for Education review the entire principle on which we are trying to revive the Irish language.  If we want an example, or a comparison, we have only to look across that artificial Border at our brethren in the Six Counties.  I repeat that more Irish is spoken in the City of Belfast than in the City of Dublin.  Why?  Because there is no compulsion amongst the nationally-minded people of the Six Counties to learn Irish.  At least 50 per cent. of the nationalists of the six Counties can speak Irish fluently.  The reason they can do that is because they go down year after year, in their school-going years, to the Donegal Gaeltacht, and there voluntarily acquire the language of the people. While they are there there is no compulsion on them to attend school. There is no compulsion to learn the reading and the writing of the language. Goodness knows we know that the compulsion is the other way about while they are attending the primary schools in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They do not become Irish scholars but they become Irish speakers, which is much more important in my opinion than the acquisition of this written knowledge of the language.  We know that more is being done by Comhaltas Uladh for the revival of the Irish language than has been done by the Department of Education during the <Col N="1157" /> past 30 years.  The giving of scholarships to students to go down and acquire Irish by the Modh Díreach and to get their ear attuned to the language is much more beneficial than four, five or six years of compulsory Irish in a school to students, pupils and scholars who are waiting for the day when they will leave school and when they can cease to speak the language which they have grown to abhor on account of this compulsion.</P>
    <P>To show how far and to what extremes we are carrying this compulsion, I was told the other day by a learned ecclesiastic that quite recently he was being shown through one of our domestic schools in the City of Dublin. He saw there youths of approximately 14 years of age who will become eventually chefs, being taught cooking.  What were they being taught when this eminent ecclesiastic passed through the school?  They were being taught the Irish for luxurious desserts, luxurious cakes, sweets and pastries.  They were being taught to use words to describe dishes which an Irish speaker never had the privilege of seeing, never mind of tasting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will taste them some day.  I am referring to the Irish speaker, for whom I have a considerable amount of thought and consideration but who, unfortunately, will never have the opportunity of seeing the dishes never mind of tasting them. That, in my opinion, was a waste of the child's time, valuable time in which he could be learning how to make these dishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I further am personally aware, as Deputy Blowick has said, that the Gaeltacht is dwindling day by day.  We heard Deputy Vivion de Valera criticise the snobbery by which bog Latin is respected in this country.  I agree with Deputy de Valera that bog Irish&mdash; and when I say bog Irish, I mean the Irish that springs from the bogs, the hills and the glens of Ireland; I think it was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who asked what it meant&mdash;should be the fountain head <Col N="1158" /> and the source from which we should procure the survival and the revival of the Irish language, the language that oozes from the bogs, not the language that oozes from Marlborough Street. If we want to make the people of this country readers and writers of Irish, by all means let Marlborough Street be the fountain head but if we want to make them Irish speakers, let the bogs, the hills and the dales of the west, south and north-west be the fountain head.  I think it is agreed that the original idea behind this compulsory Irish was not to make scholars out of the Irish people, out of the working class, labourers and migrants.  The idea was to make them Irish speakers and after 25 or 30 years of this compulsory Irish, I say to the Minister or to any member of the House, let him enter a bus in Dublin and listen to the language spoken by the people travelling in the bus.  Will he hear .5 per cent. of these people speaking Irish? Let him travel in the trains, let him go to our Gaelic football matches or to any social gatherings in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Will he hear .5 per cent. of the participants in these functions speaking the Irish language?  Definitely no.  But go up to such a gathering across the Border; go up to a Gaelic football match in the Six Counties; go up to any of the national social functions in the Six Counties and, strange as it may seem, where there is no compulsion, one will hear Irish spoken and spoken by at least 50 per cent. of the audience, spectators or participants in these functions.  The Minister should in consultation with the Government and with all the Parties here seriously consider amending our present methods for the revival and survival of the Irish language.  If we do not do that, Irish as a spoken language will be as dead 50 years from now as classical Greek and Latin are to-day.</P>
    <P>I come now to scholarships in the Gaeltacht.  The idea at the back of all that may have been a very good one.  We give scholarships to clever students in the Gaeltacht to secondary schools and universities, but, so surely as we do, we drive another Irish speaker out of the Gaeltacht.  A <Col N="1159" /> student receives a Gaelic scholarship. He goes to a secondary school, eventually reaches the university and studies for one of the professions. Immediately he qualifies he either emigrates or takes up a position in the city.  Some condition should be attached to these scholarships whereby the recipients of them would go back to live in either the Breac-Ghaeltacht or the Gaeltacht, thereby ensuring our sending back to that man's native health a professional man competent to speak Irish in the local dialect.  In that way we would do some good towards keeping the language alive.</P>
    <P>I join with Deputy Blowick in appealing to the Minister to do something in relation to the building of schools in the Gaeltacht.  I know the Minister is most sympathetic.  I have had occasion to approach him and he has received my complaints most sympathetically.  I have in mind, however, one particular complaint. There is a school in the heart of the Rosses, Belcruit, which has no water supply.  The public water supply passes within six yards of the schoolhouse door.  I told the Minister it would be a good thing to have a water supply laid on, not for the purpose of sanitation, but in order to make water available for human consumption.  I have been told on good authority that it would cost exactly £22 10s. to lay that water on.  I got a most sympathetic hearing from the Minister.  He told me he would have the matter investigated.  The matter was investigated and the investigation consisted of four different inspectors calling to the school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They would cost more than £22 10s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly would but I am not going into that.  Some of those inspectors came from the Board of Works and some from the Department of Education.  I am not blaming the Minister.  I am blaming the system and the Department.  At the end of 12 months I again wrote to the Minister and reminded him of his undertaking to have the matter investigated. <Col N="1160" /> I got a personal letter from the Minister saying he would have the matter looked into.  What was the net result?  I received a letter from the Department informing me they had been advised by the Board of Works that a new schoolhouse would be required in that area and the expenditure of £22 on a pipe line to supply water to the existing school would not be justified pending the erection of the new school.  As we know it takes approximately a minimum of ten years to have a school built.  We must, therefore, wait for ten years before the children in this school will be able to get a drink of fresh water.  That kind of red tape should be dispensed with. We should cut the cackle, as the Americans say, and get on with the job.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a better liaision between the Board of Works and the Department of Education.  Indeed, I would like to see an engineering staff attached to the Department of Education which, when told by the Minister or his advisers that a certain job must be done, would go out and do the job. We would not then have to go through all these various channels and wait for this slow-moving body to come to a decision and wait even longer for that body to put its decision into effect.</P>
      <P>A great deal can be done to improve the position in relation to the building of schools in the Gaeltacht.  A great deal can be done to improve the Irish textbooks used in the schools.  Scholarships should be awarded to writers in Irish to encourage them to write textbooks for use in the schools.  There is no reason why these textbooks should not be written in the appropriate dialects. If subjects are taught through the medium of Irish in the Donegal Gaeltacht, then the textbooks should be written in the Donegal dialect. That applies to Connemara, Ring and Kerry.  The Minister should consider encouraging prospective authors to write textbooks in the dialects suitable to the particular schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to continue the good work started by his predecessor in relation to vocational education. I said once, and I repeat it now, <Col N="1161" /> that the university is the curse of this country.  The salvation of the country will be found in the vocational schools. I would like to see such schools in every parish.  Along the seaboard areas the principal subjects taught should be marine engineering, navigation and such other branches of seamanship.  I know a start is being made in that direction in Killybegs, but I would like to see in every school along the Irish seaboard navigation and marine engineering taught.</P>
    <P>There is no use in our asking the children in the migrant areas to attend schools in which marine engineering is taught, or any other vocational classes, unless we are prepared to give them some remuneration, by way of scholarships or otherwise, to encourage them to remain there during the time they are acquiring the knowledge which will be imparted to them in class.  We, who come from the congested districts in the Gaeltacht, know that immediately the children reach school-leaving age they are off to the potato fields in England and Scotland.  Therefore, if we want them to remain at home attending the vocational schools we must compensate them in some way for the financial loss they will suffer by remaining at home during these particular seasons.  I think that the number of scholarships from the Gaeltacht to the university could be cut, and that many more scholarships could be granted to pupils attending the vocational schools.  I believe that the money which is being spent on secondary and university education could very well be diverted to more beneficial channels in our vocational schools.</P>
    <P>I shall finish on the point on which I opened my speech.  The primary object of education in this country for the past quarter of a century has been the revival and the survival of the Irish language.  For God's sake let us get together, admit failure and try something else to preserve the badge of our nationality&mdash;our language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose in the contribution which I intend to make on this Estimate, to refer to that particular aspect of it which relates <Col N="1162" /> to vocational education.  As a representative on a vocational committee, I want to say at the outset that we are particularly concerned with the difficulties we are up against in the provision of adequate facilities for vocational education in Donegal.  It is one of the counties which, due to financial reasons, did not get going as early as others.  The position at the moment is that we have not anything like adequate facilities.  We have not the number of schools required and so placed as to be even within reach by transport of all the pupils who would like to avail of such facilities. Therefore, I am afraid we will have to appeal to the Minister and to the Department to get better facilities by way of an increased contribution.  The contribution which we are getting from the Department is not sufficient.  We believe it should be based not on a valuation but on a population basis. We are prepared to put up arguments in support of that point of view.</P>
      <P>We believe that the areas in which valuations are high are those in which good facilities already exist in regard to secondary education.  They are the areas where there are fewer people who cannot afford a secondary education. They are mainly the areas where the population is not at a great disadvantage if they have not adequate facilities for vocational and continuation education.  As the previous speaker, my colleague, has pointed out, we in Donegal unfortunately have areas where the pupils after leaving the primary school cannot hope to continue their education in any other way except by self effort.  I do not think it is fair that we should have such a position in 1953&mdash;that we should have children growing up in the Gaeltacht without any hope of being able to continue their education after leaving the primary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee, of which I am a member, has tried, as far as it is possible for it, by a scheme of its own to provide travelling scholarships.  The pupils who qualify for these small scholarships are thereby enabled to meet the abnormal travelling expenses which they must incur in order to reach the technical school that is nearest to them.  But that is not sufficient <Col N="1163" /> to meet the problem in Donegal. We have areas where transport is not even within striking distance of any technical school.  We have a gigantic programme for the building of a number of technical schools.  If these could be provided they would go a long way towards solving our problem.</P>
    <P>There is the other point.  The contribution which we are given, generous as it may seem, is not by any means adequate to enable us to carry out our programme.  Consequently, the operation of that programme has to be drastically curtailed.  We can only proceed with a small portion of it.  We have made repeated appeals to the Department and to the Minister for more generous subventions from the Central Fund.  I have before me a few figures which would seem to indicate the unfairness of the present system under which contributions are made to the different counties.  Let me take the South Riding of Tipperary, which has a population of 76,000.  The contribution that it received from the Department towards the provision of vocational education during the year 1952-53 was £22,873, whereas Donegal, with a population of 142,000, as against the 76,000 in the South Riding of Tipperary, gets a contribution of £17,871. In other words, with more than double the population we get less than half the contribution.</P>
    <P>We believe that is unfair, and that the contribution should be based on the figures of population rather than on valuations.  We are, as I say, prepared to support that point of view by various arguments.  As I have said, the counties with the higher valuations are usually the wealthier counties where parents are in a much better position to provide a secondary education for their children.  They are also the counties which are better provided with secondary schools.  In a county such as ours, with congested areas and low valuations, you have a great many more of the poorer type of parents who cannot afford to give their children a secondary education, nor are there as great facilities in it, in the way of secondary schools, as there are in the wealthier counties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> I would appeal to the Minister seriously to consider adjusting the present scheme so as to enable counties like Donegal to proceed with its rather comprehensive programme of school building which as he himself will admit &mdash;indeed any person who glances at the situation will admit it&mdash;is absolutely essential if we are to meet the requirements of the county in so far as technical education is concerned.</P>
    <P>The number of technical schools which we have in Donegal at the moment have proved to be of a very high standard.  They are highly successful and are doing very good work. The few of them that we have here and there tend to expose to the other areas, that are without such schools, how essential it is that we should have more facilities of that type for our children.</P>
    <P>My primary concern in intervening in this debate was to make this appeal again to the Minister.  We have appealed to him by means of deputations in the past to consider giving a more generous contribution towards bringing our programme to completion in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies in relation to the primary schools throughout the country.  I think it is right that we should congratulate the Minister on making a serious effort towards improving more of our primary schools and in getting rid of the many unsuitable school buildings that we have.  Despite all that he has done, there is still a great leeway to be made up.  There is a long way yet to go if we are to catch up on the programme which would be necessary to completely eliminate all the unsuitable school buildings that there are in the country.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>The decision to ask the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to hold a two years' course of training for persons seeking a qualification for appointment to health inspector posts was arrived at after careful consideration of all the relevant factors.  This initial course is necessarily experimental, and in the light of the experience obtained as a result of it, I intend to consider the feasibility of enabling other vocational education committees who possess the necessary facilities to conduct similar courses of training subsequently, should sufficient vacant health inspector posts exist or be in prospect to absorb the number of students likely to qualify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying before questions, the intention behind the amendment was that the cost of the treatment or of the medicines prescribed by the doctor would be paid, if authority were given to local councils to pay for them for that particular section of the community that would avail of them.  That would meet our requirements. I was about to give an instance to the Minister.  It is the case of a young lad employed in a factory, who is on workman's compensation.  By attending the factory doctor, as he does under the ordinary system of workman's compensation, he gets a prescription of a certain type and each week he has to pay between 5/- and 7/6, according to the dose of injection prescribed.  If he were attending the dispensary doctor the drug would be given to him by the dispensary doctor and he would have that money in his <Col N="1173" /> pocket.  That is not particularly the case I am making but the point is similar.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting that in a district where a working man, for some reason or other, because he has confidence in a local doctor, is agreeable to pay the doctor's fee the doctor could give him a chit for medicine, in the same way as he would receive it if he attended the dispensary doctor, even if the medicine was supplied from stock held by the dispensary doctor.  If the Minister could see his way to include some provision in this Bill to authorise local authorities to deal with matters in that way, we would be happy.</P>
      <P>The Minister has expressed his wish to co-operate and his belief that it is a good thing.  I think the main Opposition Party will agree that the principle is good.  Whether the technical difficulties are insurmountable or not, I do not know, but I think the amendment is worthy of discussion and, if necessary, a suitable alteration could be made in the Bill to meet it.</P>

      <P>This question will probably arise in other directions but, having regard to the form in which it is raised by Deputy Kyne, perhaps it would be just as well to glance at what exactly is involved.  Deputy Kyne has given one particular instance showing what the situation is.  There are other cases, particularly where a person is living near an urban district, where more than one doctor even in the public service is available.  The question arises of the value from a health and medical point of view of a person being able to choose among those around him the person with whom he has greatest affinity and the greatest personal understanding.  This is probably as suitable an occasion as any to glance at the report of the inquiry into the health needs of the <Col N="1174" /> nation by President Truman's Presidential Commission of the 18th December, 1952.</P>
      <P>In connection with the general question of health, ranging over a very wide field, very strong and very definite emphasis is placed upon the patient-doctor relationship.  The report is available.  I quote from the official text from the introduction, published in the United States News and World Report of the 26th December, 1952.  At page 78, we find this paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In considering the rôles of the individual and various elements of Government in securing health services, one must, of course, not lose sight of a most precious relationship for health.  Throughout the whole history of civilised man the relationship between patient and physician has been a special thing.  In days when scientific knowledge was scanty, this relationship yielded about all the benefits the patient received.  Even to-day, all the complex arrangements that exist to provide medical care have not replaced it.  The patient's confidence in his physician underlies most successful care.  But now the physician needs more than knowledge of human nature and love of mankind.  To be effective in the modern sense he must have the help that the modern hospital supplies, the assistance of trained helpers and adequate facilities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Very strong emphasis is laid there on the basic requirement, that there shall be confidence and an understanding between the patient and the physician.</P>
      <P>The commission formulated ten principles and perhaps it is just as well to read them now, to show the particular context in which emphasis is still placed upon the physician-patient relationship:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From such considerations the commission has formulated these principles to be used as a guide in approaching our health problem.  We believe that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Access to the means for the attainment and preservation of health is a basic human right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> 2.  Effort of the individual himself is a vitally important factor in attaining and maintaining health.</P>
    <P>3.  The physician-patient relationship is so fundamental to health that everyone should have a personal physician.</P>
    <P>4.  The physician should have access to proper facilities and equipment, affiliation on some basis with a hospital, and the help of trained personnel in order to fulfil his part in providing comprehensive health services.</P>
    <P>5.  Comprehensive health service includes the positive promotion of health, the prevention of disease, the diagnosis and treatment of disease, the rehabilitation of the disabled&mdash; all supported by constantly improving education of personnel and a continuous programme of research.</P>
    <P>6.  Comprehensive health service is the concern of society and is best ensured when all elements of society participate in providing it.</P>
    <P>7.  Responsibility for health is a joint one, with the individual citizen and local, State, Federal Governments each having major contributions to make toward its fuller realisation.</P>
    <P>8.  The American people desire and deserve comprehensive health service of the highest quality and that in our dynamic expanding economy the means can be found to provide it.</P>
    <P>9.  The same high quality of health service should be available to all people equally.</P>
    <P>10.  A health programme must take into account the progress and experience of the past, the realities of the present, and must be flexible enough to cope with future changes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In a very realistic and practical approach to health, over a very wide-flung community, with varying problems and, no doubt, different methods of organising themselves, they place in the forefront the effort of the individual himself, first, and the importance of the physician-patient relationship. <Col N="1176" /> The effort of the person himself is very largely involved in confidence in the person to whom he is going for medical attention.  So that, where there is the possibility of a personal choice in certain districts and particularly where the circumstances in which the man is working, his natural circumstances, provide him with medical attention from a particular physician in whom he has confidence and with whom he is in touch and with whom he has a tradition of dealing, if that person would be normally entitled to go to the dispensary doctor and to get free medical service through the dispensary organisation, I do not think it disturbs the elements of even the simplest form of administration that such a person, although not calling on the local authority for the services of the dispensary doctor, would, nevertheless, be entitled to make part of his claim, that is, the claim for the cost of medicine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with the choice of doctor.  Surely it is envisaged in this Health Bill in a later section that a patient should have a choice of doctor in regard to maternity service.  If the Minister proposes to offer a choice of doctor in maternity cases surely he would have to offer a choice of doctor in other cases.  The Minister seems to think that it would not be possible to give a choice of doctor.  In that I largely agree with him but, if it is suggested in a later section or amendment that a choice of doctor can be given in maternity cases, there must be some scheme at the back of the Minister's mind or that of his officials whereby a choice of doctor can be brought in. Would the Minister make us wiser with regard to that scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are certain areas in the country, particularly in country towns where there may be three or four private practitioners and there could be a choice of doctor in that case.  That would apply also in the case of Dublin and other cities.  If the over-all idea of the scheme is to have a free choice of doctor, surely there must be something to show how there can be that free choice of doctor.  If not, has the Minister any idea how it will be <Col N="1177" /> implemented?  I should like him to make us clear on that point.  In a country district there will be only the dispensary doctor.  I agree that if you bring in another doctor you remove to a large extent the livelihood of the doctor already resident in the district. In the maternity section it is stated that there is to be a choice of doctor. If that is to apply to other classes of patients, how does the Minister intend to fit that into the Bill?  Would he clarify that point?</P>

      <P>I spoke on this section before we adjourned and I mentioned that it would be extremely difficult to give a choice of doctor, even if we adopted the amendment.  It might also have the effect, if a doctor had not a retaining salary as a dispensary doctor, that he might not stay in the district at all.  We will have to do something to see that doctors will be kept in sparsely populated areas.  There would, of course, be a choice of doctor in towns and villages where the population is fairly dense.  The same thing will apply to a great extent in regard to maternity cases.  In the case of maternity, however, the woman concerned may be able to arrange to transfer her domicile at a certain time if she wants to attend a doctor in the nearest town or village.  There is at least a better chance, although I know it is limited, of being able to avail herself of a choice of doctor in that case than in cases of ordinary diseases which arise in dispensary practice.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I have not made myself as clear as I should.  The Minister spoke of a woman being able to go to another district.  That would arise in a maternity case where the woman would be attending a doctor as a private patient.  But I am talking about people who would normally be unable to pay a doctor at all.  They would be attending a dispensary doctor and get free attention.  What I am asking is, if they chose another doctor and are prepared to pay that private doctor whatever fee they can afford, could not regulations be introduced to give the local authority permission to pay for the medicine which may be prescribed by that private <Col N="1178" /> doctor, or could it not be so arranged that the private doctor would have the right to give them a note so that they can get the medicine from the dispensary doctor?  Surely that is not too much to ask.  It would only apply to this particular group of people, and I know it would be appreciated throughout the country.  It would only apply in particular areas.  In many country areas there is only one doctor, but where an urban area is within five or six miles from them people often choose to go there for a doctor.  They scrape up enough money to pay the doctor's fee and, in addition, they have to pay for the medicine because that doctor cannot prescribe State medicine for them.  I feel that some provision should be made for treatment in that way by some of these private doctors.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that what Deputy Kyne is seeking to do is very desirable.  He has made it clear that, in so far as it can be made apply at all, it can only apply in a limited sense and to a limited number.  All this goes to show that, so far as a great part of the country is concerned, so far as the majority of the citizens are concerned, it is just nonsense to be talking about a choice of doctor.  It just cannot be done in existing circumstances. While I am in agreement with what Deputy Kyne is trying to do, there are practical difficulties.  Let us assume that some persons living three miles from a town require the services of a physician and do not want to go to the local dispensary doctor.  They go to a private doctor in the town.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy will find, if he wants to widen it like that, that he will have more obstacles to jump.  I think that he will probably find obstacles put in his way by the local health authority.  The health authority, as far as I know, for the operation of the greater part of this Bill will be the county manager, and I think the Deputy will find difficulties there.  While I fully appreciate and agree with what Deputy Kyne wants to do, the fact of the matter is that either in respect to the ordinary services or to maternity services we are not in a position or likely to be in a position so far as the greater part of the country is concerned to give the choice of a second doctor.  We have to face that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now, of course, down to the really important part of this Bill in my opinion, Part III.  Sub-section (2) of Section 13, which deals with the making available of the various services, sets out, if you like, as a means test the persons to whom the service should be made available.  Am I right in assuming that the determination under sub-section (2) of Section 13 will be by the county manager?  So far as I can read the sub-section it will be by the county manager, who is, for the purpose of this sub-section, the health authority. I do not want anybody to misunderstand me.  I am putting the matter mildly when I say &ldquo;misunderstand&rdquo;. I do not want anybody to twist that into a reflection or an attack on any particular county manager or county managers because it is not.  I want to be clear on the matter.  Are we giving the entire power under this sub-section to the health authority which in this case and for the purpose of this section is the county manager?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The county manager is certainly the person who decides in this case, not the local authority.  That <Col N="1180" /> is the present position.  If a person applies for dispensary treatment at the moment and if there is any objection on behalf of the warden or the doctor to whom he applies for a ticket the county manager decides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, it is because of that that I am so opposed to this Bill.  In this case it is not going to be determined by the local authority as we understand the local authority.  It is not going to be determined by the medical officer of health for the county or by any doctor in the county.  It is going to be determined by a layman As I said, I think it is a great weakness in this Bill, to put it mildly, that what is purely a question of medicine or surgery is to be determined almost entirely by a layman who may otherwise be an extremely able and efficient man.  May I say&mdash;and this is true in relation to things other than this Health Bill&mdash;that we are tending too much towards handing over professional services into the administrative hands of laymen and putting to one side altogether the professional people who ought to be more competent to decide and who ought to be in a better position to assess whether a person should or should not get this treatment? I think the doctor or the medical officer for health for a particular county would know much more about the person's requirements.  They would certainly be in a position to know more about the person's economic position, his family conditions and his capacity to pay so as to decide whether he should, in fact, be brought within this section or whether he was a person outside the scope of this section and not, therefore, entitled to the treatment or services set out under it.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this is one of the most important matters dealt with in this Bill.  I would like to assure the Minister that in expressing fears on this matter I am speaking entirely for myself.  They are fears that I genuinely hold and I would be glad if my mind could be freed of that concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy has taken the section up properly.  The only thing the county manager decides is whether a person can pay or not. <Col N="1181" /> It is the medical officer who decides whether he should get the treatment or not.  Then, if he goes to the dispensary doctor or to his own doctor who advises him on the treatment he is to get, the man himself will then say: &ldquo;I am entitled to free treatment&rdquo;. In most cases there is not dispute.  The doctor sends him to the county hospital and the man gets his treatment.  That may be challenged in some cases and then the only question the county manager decides is whether he should pay or not.  He has nothing to do with the particular treatment.</P>

      <P>I would like to support Deputy Morrissey's view on this from this angle that the House generally is agreed that the managers should be divested of some of the powers they have at the present time. The power which is now being vested in the county manager is a power of function which belonged to the wardens.  At the present time it is the warden who is usually a public representative or some well-known man in a town, who determines whether or not a patient should get a certain type of treatment and whether a doctor should be made available to attend to that person at the dispensary or at the person's house.  That, I submit, has been the function of the public representatives through the wardens and it is a function which is now being vested in the county manager.</P>

      <P>The Minister has put us in a difficult position.  He has asked us to accept his interpretation of the law, but he will not accept our interpretation.  I think the Minister indicated that the provisions of this Bill were already covered by powers he had, but when we examine the powers we find they are not in any way analogous.  Section 13, according to the Minister's statement, now gives the county manager complete authority, without the right of appeal of any kind and without any leading up, to decide the individual people in a county area, together with his family, who will be entitled to a free service, a general medical practitioner service, surgical services, ophthalmic services, dental treatment and medical, surgical or dental appliances.  The power is there for the giving of free medical service over the whole gamut of services to persons and their families and the county manager is the person who is going to decide whether a person, or persons, belong to that class or not.  There is no appeal provided in any way for that.  I do not know whether it is the intention that the doctors will be completely free to deal with any people that come their way, or that they will be the people to refer the case to a county manager if they have any doubt.  The county manager is the sole and final authority.  It is an extraordinary position to put a person in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, of course, that it is the doctors who will prescribe the treatment which the person should get under sub-section (2).  It is entirely in the power of the county manager to say who is entitled to treatment under Section 13.  Therefore, whether the doctor prescribes or not, the person does not get the treatment. The power is being given solely <Col N="1183" /> into the hands of the county manager and the county manager alone to determine.  I think that is a power which should not be given to a layman. It is not, I suggest, an answer for the Minister to say: &ldquo;That is the law already.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If it is, and I do not question what the Minister said&mdash;I understand it is&mdash; I object to it and the sooner that is changed the better.  I grant you that there must be some person who will have some say in the financial obligations that may be imposed on the local authority but that a county manager, as a layman, should have the right to determine whether a person should or should not get a treatment or a service prescribed for him under this section by a doctor is, in my opinion, giving far too much power into the hands of any layman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18, sub-section (2) of the Public Assistance Act, 1939, defines a poor person.  That Act set out to give free treatment to poor persons.  Sub-section (2) of Section 18 of that Act reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A poor person who is unable to provide by his own industry or other lawful means the medical, surgical or dental treatment, or medicines, or medical, surgical or dental appliances necessary for himself or any persons whom he is liable under this Act to maintain shall be eligible for medical assistance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The only difference is that we have put in ophthalmic here as well.  Therefore, we are doing exactly what has been done since 1939 and that is stating what people are entitled to free treatment. Naturally, somebody must determine that.  In the past, the county manager has had the last word on the matter. It is quite true that the county manager is very seldom appealed to. In many cases the warden issues the tickets or the home assistance officer usually sends the people to hospital. Only where a dispute arises does the county manager come in.  To come back to that point, the county manager has no right whatever to decide whether a person wants treatment or not.</P>
    </Speaker>

I know that it is easy to condemn the county manager and to talk about the democracy of the county councils, and so forth.

      <P>It must be done in a confidential way.  Therefore, a person must decide, or three persons if you like.  It is not a question for the county surgeon to decide.  He has his own work to do and, anyhow, he has not the staff to investigate.  It is not a matter for the county medical officer either in my opinion.  I think that the right person is the county manager who has his staff of home assistance officers, and so forth, to give him the report that he needs.  I suppose, in fact, he will rely entirely on the home assistance officer's report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not casting any reflection on anybody but the type of person to whom this service should be made available is specifically set out here and nobody but the county manager can determine whether that person is or is not one who, by his own industry or other lawful means, is unable to provide the medical, surgical, ophthalmic or dental treatment necessary for himself or his dependents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the other aspect&mdash;which is the more important one&mdash;the county manager himself is being put into rather a difficult position.  He is the guardian of the funds of the local authority.  He is the person who is charged with the collection and the <Col N="1185" /> dispensing of these funds.  He is the person who is expected to keep the rates as low as possible.  I am not saying that a county manager would allow even that consideration to influence him against allowing treatment to be given to a person who had been certified as a person in need of it, but that feeling will always be at the back of his mind to some extent or another: there is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>I must confess that it causes me a certain amount of uneasiness that, in a matter that is purely surgical or medical, a layman is to have almost the entire say.  If the county manager, acting in the best of good faith, decides that a particular person or patient does not come within this category&mdash;and makes that decision in absolute good faith&mdash;he may, in effect, be depriving that person of the treatment because that person may not be in a position to pay the charges that would be laid down for him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points of view with regard to the question of the administrative side of medical work.  I want to put the opposite point of view to that which Deputy Morrissey has put forward.  I can understand that, naturally, a doctor is worried and has genuine fears on the question of whether or not he will be directed by people who do not know what they are talking about. Another point, however, which must be considered is that if you are going to weigh down the ordinary doctor in a hospital or a dispensary with a lot of administrative duties he will not be very pleased either.  Remember that a doctor is a man who is trained in medicine, surgery and allied subjects. His interests and work and vocation in life lie in those channels.  For a doctor to be faced with administrative problems for which he has no aptitude or training it can, in certain circumstances, be a very unwelcome responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my experience, talking to district medical officers, what they resent most of all at present in the dispensary medical service is that they have so much administrative work to do. Again, on the Dublin Board of Assistance, I have put forward the idea <Col N="1186" /> that we should be able to get some clerical assistance for the dispensary doctors.  The average dispensary doctor has so many forms to fill in and so much clerical work to do that he must necessarily spend a certain amount of time at that work&mdash;time which he would otherwise be able to give to medical work.  I am not suggesting that he omits his medical work but I am suggesting that it will be a burden if you give a medical officer of health all these duties to perform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, as far as the administrative side is concerned, we have to recognise that you have got to separate clinical work and administrative work.  In hospitals which have nothing to do with State services they are training people and looking for administrators&mdash;men who will take the administrative work from the shoulders of the doctor and leave him free to do his clinical work.  I do not see anything wrong in letting a county manager make the decision on the administrative side provided the doctor is left free to do his medical work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the point Deputy Morrissey was making at all.  The point he is anxious about is that if a patient requiring treatment is recommended for treatment and if the county manager considers that, by reason of his financial circumstances, he is not entitled to free treatment, the patient will get that treatment.  It is not suggested for a moment that the doctor should be responsible for the administrative end at all.  The point is that if a doctor sends a patient for treatment&mdash;this will arise in rural districts more than towns&mdash;and if the county manager decides that that person does not come within the section, he is not entitled to free treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey wants to ensure <Col N="1187" /> that the man or woman will get the treatment.  That is the only matter in respect of which he wants a guarantee from the Minister.  If a doctor sends a patient for treatment, that patient may be a border-line case&mdash;he may or may not be able to pay&mdash;and the county manager may say that the patient cannot have the free treatment.  How is the Minister going to get around that? It is not suggested that doctors should be administrators because they have enough to do already.  The best way for the Minister to deal with it would be to call the medical officer of health, who has his assistants, into consultation and, if the case is urgent, to ensure that it will be dealt with.  You will not then have a position in which an urgent case is sent with a recommendation for treatment to the county manager and sent back, because, according to the regulations, he is not entitled to treatment, and for all we know may die.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Morrissey's point is that we should reject some later sections of the Bill and see that a free, no means test, universal and general health service is brought into operation. Deputy Esmonde must understand that a manager would not dare to reject a person for treatment, unless he was acting within the law which we are drafting here.  Surely he must be bound by these laws and regulations made under them and would not take it upon himself to reject a doctor's proposition in relation to treatment, except on legally binding grounds that we are attempting to draw up here.  In pursuance of that general attitude, I suggest that we bind him to the least possible extent and allow him, generally speaking, to tell a doctor: &ldquo;Whenever you have a sick patient, a patient who wants an operation, send him to the local surgeon or physician and we will pay for the service&rdquo;.  I am in complete agreement with Deputy Dr. Esmonde there and also with Deputy Morrissey, if I understand him aright.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened very attentively to Deputy Morrissey's proposition and I understand his difficulty with regard to interference <Col N="1188" /> by lay administrators in the medical control of a case.  I would deprecate that in the strongest possible terms.  I admit it is a possible danger, a danger about which we have to be particularly careful, but I think it is up to the medical profession, if a clear case is made to show that there is an encroachment, to guard against such encroachment.  So far, I do not think the case has been made.</P>
    <P>With regard to administration, Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll's point is an excellent one.  A doctor is trained in his particular profession&mdash;he has a medical outlook, a surgical outlook or a highly specialised training&mdash;and he knows very little and wants to know very little of the purely administrative side of health services.  I should like to know who does Deputy Mulcahy propose should make the final decision, if not the managers, on the advice, of course, of the medical adviser, the dispensary doctor, the medical officer of health or the county surgeon?  First of all, the manager cannot controvert, on anything except grounds which are really binding, the decision of the doctor and the patient will then get whatever service he is entitled to.</P>
    <P>That is what we are discussing now &mdash;the services which we are going to allow our people to become entitled to under the Bill.  I should like the scope to be as wide as Deputy Esmonde suggests it should be.  Where a doctor says that a patient needs a particular treatment&mdash;surgical treatment, medical treatment or treatment with certain medicines&mdash;and feels that he ought to have it, the manager is bound to take a decision and the patient then goes to hospital.  It is quite obvious that in relation to this question of the county manager, more than the doctor is concerned and bound by administrative control.  The engineer, the architect and various professional employees of a local authority are bound by the country manager's decision in various ways and the average professional man would much prefer to stick to his profession, about which he is reasonably well acquainted and in which he is reasonably well trained, than try to cope with balance sheets, tax returns, costs and prices of drugs and medicines, <Col N="1189" /> tenders and the thousand and one other things which the unfortunate manager has to deal with in trying to co-ordinate the different services of the average local authority.</P>

      <P>I feel that we ought to prepare an agenda for dealing with this section because we can come on to the matters of which Deputy Dr. Browne has spoken later.  We are dealing with the power to decide that a particular person and his family are entitled to this service and the sole power of deciding these things is put in the hands of one person, with no appeal whatever, that person being an official who, in the words of Deputy Dr. Browne, has a thousand and one things to attend to.  The White Paper issued by the Minister originally indicates what the problem here is.  It says in paragraph (2) under the heading &ldquo;Public Assistance Act, 1939&rdquo;:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;So far as numbers are concerned, by far the most important of these enactments is the Public Assistance Act of 1939 which replaces in consolidated form the earlier legislation which dealt with medical services for the poor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later on, it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is estimated that this service is availed of by about one-third of the population.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of a class which the White Paper tells us numbers one-third of the population, we are putting it into the power of the manager in any county to say that such a person is inside or outside that class.  When you take a population of about 3,000,000 and draw an imaginary line cutting 1,000,000 of the population off from the other 2,000,000, and then put into the power of one man, a particular type of official in each county, the sole power of saying on what side of that line a particular person or his family is, it emphasises our general approach to the Bill, that we are not saying and cannot say what ought to be done to settle that problem, but asking the Minister to give us some kind of idea of his mind on what the process is of people having it decided on what side <Col N="1190" /> of the line they are.  This apparently is the white ticket section. Would the Minister let us know what is the process of obtaining a white ticket?  If we could get a picture of what the process is of getting a white ticket then we could go further on with the other matters.</P>
    <P>Another point arises.  We are concerned with the cost of the proposals that are down here under each one of these sections.  The Minister has indicated that the total cost to the local authorities when this scheme is put into operation will be £900,000.  I would like to draw his attention to an article on this Bill in the March quarter of <i>Studies,</i> on page 3 of which an attempt is made to examine the cost.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The only yard-stick of comparison which we have is the British cost. There it costs about £2 5s. per head to give everyone much the same &lsquo;general practitioner services&rsquo; (including pharmaceutical, dental and ophthalmic) as are outlined in the new Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That being so the free services of this nature for 1,000,000 people, one-third of the population, would cost about £2,250,000.  That is for general practitioner service alone, leaving out entirely the provision of free institutional services or specialised services, which I take it, are also included in this.  The article in <i>Studies</i> goes on to say: &ldquo;The British cost per head of free institutional and specialist services is over £6.  Hence our cost would be about £6,000,000.&rdquo; Therefore, taking the British figure just as a baseline, including general services and institutional services you would have to add £2,250,000 to £6,000,000 that is, £8,250,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister will understand that putting the situation in that way brings us up against the question: does he accept the figure in his own White Paper that one-third of the population will be entitled to use the services?  Can he tell us what the cost will be?  If he still sticks to his £9,000,000 for the local authority and £9,000,000 for the State, can he reconcile <Col N="1191" /> in any way by any reference or comparison to the services given the extraordinary discrepancy between his estimate of the cost here and the actual cost of what is provided along the same lines in Great Britain? Can he also tell us the procedure to be adopted by the county manager in deciding who is going to be a white ticket case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to understand the mentality of some people. Deputy Mulcahy stands up and paints a picture of a county manager having to decide between one-third of the population and the other two-thirds as if it were going to be a full-time job for the county manager and he would not have time to do anything else.  He has been doing that for the last ten years and if you ask any county manager he will say that he decided about four cases in the year and that is about all that will come to him.</P>
      <P>Is it not obvious to any sane man&mdash; perhaps it is too much to expect sanity from the people opposite&mdash;that in regard to 99.9 per cent. of the people involved there will be no question about them?  As a matter of fact, a lot of people who do not claim free service would be entitled to it but they decide that they will not take it and do not apply for it.  There are very few above the income limit who would be entitled to it and there are very few appeals to the county manager.  I would like to know from the Deputies opposite what would they suggest.  The way Deputy Mulcahy is talking you would imagine you would want seven high court judges in every county.  Do they suggest we should set up a special commission in every county?</P>
      <P>Surely it is common sense that when a thing has gone on smoothly and efficiently for ten, 12 or 20 years it is satisfactory?  Why should we change it if it is going on smoothly and why should we not repeat the very same words that are in the Act of 1939 and why should we spend hours in discussing it when we put in the same words?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy also speaks about the cost.  I was asked by a certain <Col N="1192" /> Deputy the other day what benefit would such and such a class get.  I said they could not get any benefit because they are getting free treatment already. Deputy Mulcahy quoted figures from <i>Studies</i> in regard to the lower income group.  They are getting free treatment already.  I expect that treatment will be improved, so that, to that extent, there will be a slightly extra cost.  But our present services are costing us £10,000,000 between what the local authorities and the central authority spend.  I do not know what portion will go to the lower income group.  It may be the figure <i>Studies</i> has mentioned, £6,000,000, but it is there already and all that will be added is the cost of improving the services that are there.  I do not know exactly what that will be but the estimate I gave of the total cost of this particular Bill was made out on as firm a basis as we could get and it works out somewhere around £1,000,000 on the local authorities and £1,000,000 on the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is merely for the purpose of clarification that we on this side of the House rise on this matter.  I do not think the position is given correctly by the Minister when he says things will continue as they are, because at the present time the different cases are decided as they arise either by the warden or the home assistance officers but now when this Bill comes into operation a certain number of people will be put into a category under Section 13 and will be given a certain type of card.</P>

      <P>They will have that card for a period and they will be deemed to be in that class for a period of 12 months.  There will be thousands of borderline cases, and personally I would like to know what methods there will be to decide whether or not those few thousands of <Col N="1193" /> borderline cases will get the white card, or will be put into another category. A definite decision will have to be made at the beginning of a period. I say the position is that the individual cases are treated by the different officials as they come up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point. May I say, by the way, I do not think there was any necessity for the Minister, after such a long, peaceful and, I think, useful discussion, to start off on a discordant note?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy gave us the impression we were going to decide 1,000,000 cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a long time here, and let us go on.  I think we have been doing fairly useful work on this.  It is all right for the Minister to say this has been in operation and certain things have not happened in the last ten years.  It is not what has happened or has not happened we are legislating for here. What we must concern ourselves with if we are to take an intelligent interest in what we are doing is what is going to happen under the law we are making here and now.  We are making law for the future.  Let me assume for the moment that the Minister is right, that there never will be any abuse of this by any one manager in the country.  Even then we should not make it possible for it to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, neither Deputy Dr. Browne nor Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll tried to deal with the matter at all.  They just skated around it. Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll talked as if I had suggested that the whole of the clerical and administrative work should be thrown on the shoulders of the dispensary doctor.  Of course I did not suggest that.  Let me put a simple case to Deputies from the country who know country conditions.  I can conceive a remote area in my own county, or in many other counties which I know of, where a local doctor, knowing fully the conditions of a patient, might prescribe and decide that that patient is a person who comes within Section 13. It is the local dispensary doctor, if he is any length of time in the area who knows most of the families there, who <Col N="1194" /> knows not only their health record but who has a fair idea of their financial position and income and who recommends. I do not say that the county manager would, but under this the county manager could say that that person is a person to whom Section 13 does not apply.  I want to suggest to the Minister that the doctor, say in a remote mountain area, is in a much better position to know what is the financial position of a particular patient in that district than the county manager living away in the county town.  What machinery is the county manager going to use to ascertain whether the means of a person are such as to bring him within or put him outside this particular section?  Do not forget the elaborate and costly machinery that we employ to determine whether a person is entitled to an old age pension, a widow's pension or a blind pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that we should turn the doctor more or less into a relieving officer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not turning the doctor into any such thing but I shall go as far as saying that if I have no alternative as between the doctor and the layman away from a knowledge of the patient's home conditions and income, not to speak of a knowledge of his medical condition, I am prepared to take the doctor's certificate in the same way as a health insurance certificate, as evidence that that particular patient is to come under Section 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you think that the county manager could not do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that the county manager is not in a position to do it.  The Deputy with respect is thinking very largely of city conditions. I am thinking of country conditions. I am thinking of a patient living 35, 40 or 50 miles away from the manager's office.  I am thinking of somebody living on the side of a mountain in Kerry, Galway or Tipperary.  With the exception of the local assistance officer or the local doctor, who else is in a position from local personal <Col N="1195" /> knowledge to say whether the person has the means or can afford to make payment or if he is to be put outside the category we are dealing with here? How is the county manager going to ascertain that?  Is the patient to be brought in 30 or 40 miles to the county offices there to be interrogated by the county manager or by somebody on the county manager's behalf or is the county manager to select some road overseer, some official or employee of the local authority to go into that person's house and carry out a means test there?  I am trying to look at the practical difficulties.  I am not saying for a moment this is going to happen in thousands of cases but I am saying that we cannot afford to have it happen perhaps in a dozen cases or 100 cases.</P>
      <P>I want to put this point in reply to what the Minister said about the existing law and the existing practice in regard to people who are entitled at the moment to services and treatment. The Minister knows as well as I do that, as a result of all the talk and the publicity there has been in this country for the last eight or ten years about all the new medical services and treatments that are being provided and that were never provided for before, the great bulk of our people believe that automatically they are going to become entitled to many benefits if and when this Bill becomes law and is brought into operation. Unquestionably you will have people applying for treatment and for services under this Bill when it becomes law who did not formerly apply even though the Minister says there is nothing in this that is not in the Principal Act itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put this point again to Deputies.  I must say I am rather surprised that medical Deputies here, with personal knowledge and experience of dealing with patients and their conditions, can take up the line that a layman is the proper person to decide an issue like this.  I do not think so.  I never thought so, and the fact that it was so for the last ten years does not make it any dearer to me personally. Realise the difficulties.  I am not saying that this would make it much <Col N="1196" /> sweeter to me, but suppose you had some system under which the manager after consultation with the medical officer, whether he is the county medical officer, the dispensary doctor or whoever he may be who is dealing with the case and who knew all the circumstances of the patient could decide, would that not be a more acceptable arrangement?</P>
    <P>May I put another point?  A good deal may depend on the disease or the type of disease from which the patient is suffering.  A good deal may depend on the doctor's view as to how long that patient is going to be incapacitated. The county manager might decide, and rightly decide, that a patient who is going to be incapacitated for four weeks is a person who would be able to pay his contribution for a period of four weeks, but it might be utterly impossible for that patient to pay his contribution if he was going to be incapacitated for 12 weeks or 20 weeks.  Surely that is something that will have to be accepted and admitted. I think the Minister will agree with me that that might make a difference, and surely it is only a medical man, not a layman, who can determine whether a man's incapacity is going to be completely cured within three weeks, six weeks or ten weeks.  That cannot be determined by a layman.</P>
    <P>I would like to convince the Minister, if I can, that this is a very serious and important matter, one of the most important with which we have to deal here.  I want Deputies, if they will, to consider the last point I put about the duration of the illness.  That in itself could determine, either partially or wholly, whether a person is a person who should or could contribute or whether he should come fully within the scope of Section 13.  The whole trouble is that the Minister's intentions are all right.  What we ourselves believe is all right.  If that was all we had to worry about our worries would be trifling but we cannot assume that we will have the same Dáil, the same Government, the same Ministers or the same county managers, or the same system of county managers, in relation to their powers or their appointment or in relation to those to whom the <Col N="1197" /> county manager will ultimately be responsible.  We are not legislating here what is supposed to be an important Bill merely to run for the lifetime of this Dáil, or the lifetime of the next Dáil, or the lifetime of this Government or of our present county managers.  We are enacting something, that, once it passes outside this House, passes completely out of our control and the interpretation, administration and enforcement of it will lie in hands other than ours.  We will be powerless to do anything except to amend the law by another Bill.  I think there is a case here for a much fuller examination by the Minister, a case for the protection of certain citizens.  I am not concerned whether the number is 50, 500 or 5,000. When it is a question of health and when it may be a question of life, or death, I think that absolute power in the hands of a layman is something we should not give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Morrissey, and I listened very carefully to the case he made, has to a certain extent proved the case against himself because he has pointed out that between the Social Welfare Act and this Health Bill a vast amount of investigation will have to take place. He has referred to the investigation officers and the staff required to carry out all these means tests provisions. He then tries to make the case that the doctors should be asked to do some part of this work.  I do not know how much of it actually he is trying to put on to the doctors.  Obviously, he is suggesting the doctors should do some of it.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were looking for a job as medical officer for health under a local authority and I was told that, in addition to doing the medical work and taking responsibility for that, I would have to answer all these queries as to whether a person came within one category or another, whether or not a person was entitled to hospital maintenance, and 101 other items I would not touch the job under any circumstances.  I cannot understand <Col N="1198" /> how any doctor could do his work thoroughly if he has to carry all these responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I want to put one point to the Deputy.  Take the voluntary hospitals; they have actually created a diploma and are appointing almoners to these institutions to take from the hospital staff a good deal of administrative work.  I might add that in the voluntary hospitals they have no complicated Acts to administer.  Apart from the fact that they have only a fraction of the amount of administration that there is in a State or semi-State service, they have actually taken steps in all these hospitals to appoint these special officers.  If one goes to a voluntary hospital and asks a doctor to decide whether a patient should get this or that benefit one will be told to ask the almoner.  I do not see how a medical officer can be expected to do his work properly if he is wrapped up in a cocoon of medical regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

I want to know who will decide the question of institutional service, if in a particular case institutional service is required.  Here we have a most sweeping provision which, according to the Minister's figures, will provide treatment for one-third of the population free of charge in every aspect of either medical or surgical requirements.  We want a little more information on this. The Minister tells us it is all in the power of the county manager.  That is not an answer.  If it is all in the power ultimately of the county manager, then we ought to be given some kind of picture of the machinery through which the county manager will handle this matter and the cost.</P>

      <P>What are you doing?  I submit that Deputy Kyne has more or less put his finger on the case, that it is the relieving officer who will give the red card or the white card, and if the relieving officer is to give the white card have you not still the pauper system?  When the relieving officer comes to any person is it not a reflection on that person there and then?  I am not objecting to it so much on that ground as on this one, that this is a complete new Fianna Fáil development to make one-third of the population of this country mendicants of the Fianna Fáil Government.  As a matter of fact, at the moment, a number of people cannot get what they are entitled to for housing, drainage, land reclamation or whatever it may be without going to a Deputy.  I will admit it may be any Deputy &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan or Independent. The point is that they have to go to a Deputy to get what they are entitled to.</P>
      <P>The big idea here is to make the people of this country mendicants of the Fianna Fáil Government.  This card system is now going to be a brand new development of that.  Before I can get treatment, or before Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll or anybody else can get a ticket, they will have to go to whom?  I am afraid to a Fianna Fáil club, in the first instance; secondly, to a Fianna Fáil county councillor, and thirdly, if they do not get it from either, they will have to go to a Fianna Fáil or a Fine Gael or an Independent or some other Deputy in order to get what the Minister says they are entitled to in law.  How will Deputy Kyne's constituents in Waterford know how they are to get their white card?</P>

      <P>The Deputy was not here when I was speaking.  I have said that this is a repeat section of Section 33 in the 1939 Act.  That is all that is in it. Of course we may have had Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy Morrissey and now <Col N="1202" /> Deputy MacEoin coming in on the relay.  I suppose they all thought it fit to come in and obstruct on this.  The obstruction has gone on for over an hour, asking me questions.  We have in this exactly the same words as have been there since 1939.  There is no change whatever.  It is a repeat section.

In other words, that the warden, the relieving officer and the red ticket will continue to operate.  Is that the position?</P>

I cannot say how the county manager will operate it, but his is the last word.  If I, as Minister, am given powers to do a number of things Deputies know very well that I do not do them myself.

That is always his way of getting out when he wants to change his own position.  I am not changing the law.  I cannot change the law or interfere with the operation of the law.  All I can say is that I am not changing the law.  If the law is not changed, I must operate it as it is and the county manager must operate it as it is.  However, if the county manager wishes to have four or five investigation officers <Col N="1206" /> instead of eight, I cannot interfere with that.  The method of operation may change.  Even without this Act, if we bring in a white card instead of a red ticket it does not make any difference to the person concerned.</P>

But I was suggesting &mdash; and Deputies may ridicule it if they wish &mdash; that for the convenience of the people, not to remove pauperism, but for the convenience of the people in the lower-income group, instead of asking them to go to the warden in the middle of the night for a red ticket to bring in the doctor or to go again two nights later for another patient, the local authority might facilitate people by giving them a card which would entitle them to this treatment for a year. In other words, instead of the red ticket for every visit they will get a card for 12 months which will save them the trouble of going for the red ticket, not to remove pauperism, not a Fianna Fáil device for removing pauperism, just a device to make it convenient for the people in the lower-income <Col N="1209" /> group, to save them the trouble of going in the middle of the night to get a red ticket.  If they do not apply for the white card they will have to go for the red ticket.  I suppose that a lot will neglect to get the white card and they will have to go for the red ticket.  In order that the jibe may not be thrown across the House again that I am replacing the red ticket by a white card, we will make it a red card so that there will be no change in colour.</P>

      <P>In subsection (4) the local authority is given power to make a charge on certain people who can afford to pay the charge in a hospital, up to £2 2s. per week.  That was considered to be inconvenient, as a person might be in the hospital for only two or three days. It has been thought better to make it 6/- per day, in order to calculate it for the number of days a person is in hospital.</P>

    <P>In sub-section (4), page 6, line 13, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; down to the end <Col N="1210" /> of the sub-section and substitute &ldquo;the health authority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment is self explanatory. It is the intention of the Deputies who put down the amendment to give the power to the local authority rather than to have the power in the hands of a Minister or an official.  We presume that, according to the usual line, this will be imposed by the Minister but we feel that we must express our view by putting in amendments.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that as far as sub-section (3) is concerned, giving free hospital service, we are not concerned with that just at the moment.  We are dealing with sub-section (4) where a charge is made to a person who can pay.  What the sub-section says is that regulations will be laid down for the guidance of local authorities, which local authorities must follow, of course.  These regulations will be made by the Minister for Health and consented to by the Minister for Finance and then they will be there to guide the local authorities. I do not know that every local authority will interpret the regulations exactly on the same basis but you would have to have a fair amount of uniformity and, therefore, it would be better that the regulations on these matters should be made centrally.  That is really the big reason for that.</P>

      <P>Of course, even under this sub-section (4), conditions in relation to persons could differ very much from one county to another.  The numbers of persons who would come within that category in some of our very poor counties would be very few. In some of what are regarded as average counties or better off or wealthier off counties, there might be a considerable number.  The additional charge to be paid by persons in this particular and rather limited category might be reasonable enough in one place but no so reasonable in another. I agree with Deputy Kyne.  We will have to appreciate that once the regulations are made in Dublin by the Minister and the Minister for Finance there is no discretion at all; the regulations, of course, must be enforced all round.  There could not possibly be any discretion.</P>

      <P>In determining the yearly means, the means of the son or daughter may be taken into account, as the section says, when the son or daughter is resident with such person.  It would be fairer to put in &ldquo;normally resident&rdquo; because it would follow that if the section remains as it is and if the investigation officer called to investigate and found that the son or daughter was resident, he would be bound to take the income into account although they might be there for only a few days and perhaps normally resident somewhere else.  This is in favour of the person rather than the local authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not this seeking to put a double burden on certain citizens?  I am not saying that it is not eminently right that a son or daughter should contribute towards the cost of treatment for their parents but is not it in fact making the son or daughter responsible, not merely for the payment in respect of whatever treatment they themselves may require or get but also, in effect, for payment for the treatment of another person? I am distinguishing at the moment between father, mother, son and daughter and treating them for the purpose of the point I am making as citizens, all equal before this particular piece of legislation.  Are not we, in effect, imposing a legal double liability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  The family is taken as a unit.  There may be a father, mother, son and daughter living together.  The father may be earning £6 or £7 a week.  The son and daughter may be earning £3 each.  I cannot exactly say what they are at the moment but there are certain deductions made and, if the total then exceeds the £600 mentioned here, any one of them would be liable for payment for treatment.  I think it is a fair provision.  I do not know that the figures given would be exactly accepted by everybody but the principle is fair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me to this point: From every decent point of view there should not be a necessity for legal compulsion but, human nature being what it is, there are sons and daughters who, instead of being an asset to their parents, are a direct liability, and the fact that they are earning £3, £5, £6 or £7 a week does not necessarily mean that there is any increase to the family income and, because the father or the mother, who may be the patient, has the name of having a son and daughter earning a sum of money and that is added to the pool, it brings them over the £600 mark.  It is that type of case which I had in mind when I was saying that you may not allow for that type of case or that type of hardship in regulations which are made by the Minister and the Minister for Finance and which cannot be departed from, even in the slightest degree, once they are <Col N="1213" /> made, by the local authority, no matter how full the knowledge before the local authority may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that Section 14 is the section that proposes to deal generally with institutional and specialist services in relation to the middle classes.  The Minister has told us that Section 13 does not add anything to the services we have at present.  It simply implies an improvement in the services that exist for the classes receiving them.  Section 14, above anything else in the Bill, is supposed to give something to the middle class who are suffering very much from the cost of institutional and specialist services.  The Minister should give us an account of his general approach to that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a change in regard to the cost arising from amendments and so on.  But this Bill, as it stood for Second Reading, was estimated to cost about £900,000 to the Exchequer and £900,000 to the local authorities.  With the amendments that are going in, I am afraid that will be increased somewhat.  It is very hard to say at the moment what the cost will be, because it will depend on many circumstances and things which are very difficult to calculate just now.  I think we may take it anyway that the best estimate we can give as to the cost is £2,000,000, with £1,000,000 on the local authorities and £1,000,000 on the Exchequer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The position generally is that the medical services, particularly institutional services and specialist services, have gone beyond the range of many people and I understand the principle is accepted as the basis of this Bill that every section of the community is entitled to be within range, at any rate, of getting the best medical and surgical services that are available and that, in so far as is possible, poverty or lack of means will not <Col N="1215" /> stand between a patient and the getting of them.  The Minister has taken the lower income group and stated the position with regard to them.  In accordance with the present scheme of things there is to be some improvement with regard to the free medical and surgical services which they have been getting.  When we come to the middle-class, he proposes to give assistance of a particular kind to what he calls the middle income group.  He has defined that group in Section 14 and indicated what is proposed with regard to them.  I think the Minister should justify the limits that he has put to the middle income group and give us an appreciation of the difficulties under which they are labouring at present and how the proposals in this section will help to remove the burden of some of these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that in starting with this Section 14 we are, so to speak, breaking new ground.  Up to the present, in the Minister's own words, we were dealing with provisions which were just repeating the services already available to limited classes of people in the country.  We are now starting a series of sections in which we are breaking entirely new ground and purporting to make available to an entirely new class of people services under this Bill.  I agree that it might be desirable if the Minister would explain a little more fully the reasons for that and, in particular, the reasons which actuated him in fixing the level or the ceiling, so to speak, for the people who are to get the benefit under the series of sections we are now entering upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that actuated me personally more than anything else in drawing up the new health services was the need for hospital treatment for a certain class above the lower-income group, namely, the middle-income group.  In the middle-income group you have, in my opinion, people who can well afford to pay an ordinary family doctor's fees, but the disastrous thing in their case is some sickness in the family which requires <Col N="1216" /> long hospital treatment, especially if that should occur fairly soon again with another member of the family.  I know of some very distressful cases of people in the middle-income group who had to get hospital treatment and pay all the costs.</P>
      <P>In determining the category, I suppose we were largely influenced by the legislation already there.  First of all, as outlined here, there are the people who are insured under the Social Welfare Act and who are already entitled to sickness and medical benefits.  It is always easier to carry on with what you have than to try to make any changes, because if you change and make it worse there will be a great deal of trouble about it.  In that particular class you have all those working for an employer, every manual worker is in the insured class and non-manual workers up to £600 a year.  It seems logical, therefore, that we should take those earning up to £600 amongst the self-employed as well as those who are employed.  That is category (b).</P>
      <P>Then (c) deals with the farming class. I put up the proposition to the Government, and it was agreed to, that we should try if at all possible to avoid inquiring into the means of persons when making this series of classes. There is no doubt about the persons in the insured class, but as far as farmers are concerned, instead of investigating their means, it was decided to put down a certain valuation.  At the time we were preparing the scheme we thought £50 valuation was fair as compared with the other incomes that were mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that in doing that we succeeded in a way in getting a very big portion of the population where there would be no necessity to investigate means.  If a person is an insured person, that ends the matter.  If he is a farmer of under £50 valuation that ends the matter and there is no further investigation.  The only place where there is a necessity for investigation is in the case of the self employed person who is not a farmer, not insured and who claims his income is less than £600 per year.  There was no way out of that as far as I could see.  We had to put some limit there and it is the same limit that is already there for <Col N="1217" /> the insured person.  You always have the hard case and category (d) covers that.  The farmer who is not under £50 valuation and the person whose income is not below £600 may at the same time claim that it would be inflicting extreme hardship on him if he had to pay the hospital bill, especially if he had to pay the bill over a long period.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy McEoin who mentioned that it made a difference how long the person was in hospital, that if he was in hospital for a short period he might be able to pay but if he were in hospital over a long period it would be extremely difficult for him to meet the bill.  Category (d) is put in to meet the case of the person who is not qualified, has a bigger income than will qualify him but who at the same time, as a result of a long term of illness or two long terms of illness, should therefore, get help from the local authority.</P>
    <P>I think that is a rough outline of why the limits were put that have been put.  Many people have written to me and the type of letter I get from the city says it is unfair to class the £600 per year person in the city as highly as the farmer with over £50 valution in the country.  From the country I get a letter saying it is unfair to class the farmer of over £50 valuation as highly as the person with the £600 per year in the city.  It is not easy to get agreement all round.  We have, therefore, to do whatever we think is fair in the circumstances.  The cost under this section is about half the total cost.  If the cost were about £2,000,000, roughly half of it would come under this section.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister state if these services are in the public ward?  Is there any allowance in this part of the Act for treatment in a <Col N="1218" /> nursing home?  Could he further state if this treatment will be in the local hospital in the area of the county in which the actual illness takes place or does this portion of the Act allow for the transfer, if necessary, of people to larger centres to the voluntary hospitals? Will they be included in this treatment as well?  Will there be in some cases any allowance for people with an income of over £600 per year? Would the Minister clarify that a little bit?  If payment is to be made, what will be the general principles governing that payment per week? How much is it intended to charge? Perhaps, the Minister would give us information on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that anybody in the House will take issue with the Minister on what he has said regarding the necessity of providing for that particular type of person it is intended to provide for in this section. I do not think anybody will dispute what he has said with regard to cases of extreme hardship which have occurred and which have placed a very heavy burden on families which they were not able to get rid of, perhaps, over a long number of years.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to say, however, that we have not got from the Minister very much information as to how this section is to be operated or when the services under it will be provided.  I think it is admitted that our present resources, either in beds, buildings or personnel, are not sufficient to enable us to give the services that are set out here in addition to the services set out in Section 13 and for the people who are covered by Section 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me back again to what the Minister said and to the point I raised originally about the regulations being made by the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  The Minister said&mdash;I think rightly&mdash;that there would be exceptional cases and that he was making an attempt under category (d) of sub-section (2) to ensure that in very exceptional cases, which are not covered by any of the other categories mentioned in Section 14, provision should be made there.  The strange thing to me about it is that it is just <Col N="1219" /> in relation to paragraph (d), which is to provide for exceptional cases, that the regulations are to be made by the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>How the Minister and the Minister for Finance can draft regulations which will have general application for the whole country to meet very exceptional cases that are not already covered under any of the other three sub-heads is something I do not understand. Frankly, I cannot see how it will be possible for the Minister and the Minister for Finance to draft the various regulations applicable to the whole country and to every health authority in this country regarding the provision of institutional and other treatment for very exceptional cases&mdash; cases other than those regarding the people with £600 per year and so on. I presume there is some reason, good or otherwise, for bringing the Minister in specifically in relation to category (d).  Personally, I should be very glad to hear what the reasons are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This section does interest me and I would like to find out something with regard to it from the Minister.  Up to recently there was in operation here, apparently not in accordance with the law, a form of family insurance under which persons in the middle income group could insure against the accident of a serious operation requiring hospital treatment over a period of time.  Under that insurance scheme a choice of specialists and of institutional treatment was made available.  That insurance was recently prohibited by the responsible authorities here.  Accordingly, it is not possible in this country at the moment to insure a member of the family against a serious illness.  What is offered instead is the provision contained in this section.  I should like to know from the Minister how, in fact, that will operate.  Will there be a choice of specialists?  Will it be possible for persons who come in under the section to be treated by specialists of their choice.  Will there be, in addition, a choice of institution &mdash; or is it the policy behind the section that, for instance, in my constituency of Leix-Offaly the persons who benefit must go <Col N="1220" /> to the county hospitals and must avail of such specialist services as may be there available?  I should like to know from the Minister whether, in fact, this section will meet the case that, up to recently, was being met by a form of family insurance.</P>
      <P>If all that is intended here is that institutional and specialist services will be granted free in the county hospital to those who come within the categories mentioned, I do not think it is adequate.  In most county hospitals&mdash; certainly in the county hospitals of my constituency &mdash; many of the persons within the group set out in sub-section (2) of this section did, in fact, receive specialist and institutional treatment free because of cases subsequently made by them in relation to the accounts sought to be recovered.  I think it is important to know whether there would be any method under which a choice of specialist or institution could be made available to the people intended to be benefited.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) (c) of this Section 14 states:&ldquo;..., the rateable valuation of the farm or farms (including the buildings thereon) being £50 or less.&rdquo; I should like to know if sub-paragraph (d) of that sub-section would operate in a case where, say, the Land Commission divided an estate and on one of the holdings on that estate was an outoffice.  Sometimes such buildings have an extraordinarily high valuation and yet it is a farm within the meaning of the Act and an agricultural holding.  I am wondering if sub-paragraph (d) covers a case where, for instance, there might be a valuation of £20 on buildings and £30 on land.  Would sub-paragraph (d) allow, on the examination of that person's means, that the valuation is under £50?  All over the country there are ramshackle old buildings which have very high valuations and yet they are not altered.  In the case of ordinary farm buildings, the valuation is never more than £5 or £10, but in a number of these cases &mdash; and especially where the Land Commission have divided holdings &mdash; you may have a farm with buildings far out of proportion to the land.  I suggest deletion of <Col N="1221" /> the expression &ldquo;including the buildings thereon&rdquo; in sub-paragraph (1) of the subsection.</P>

      <P>I think there is a certain difficulty in regard to this point.  Take, for instance, a person with a £50 valuation and a person with a £50 5s. valuation.  The person with the £50 5s. valuation might be worse off than the person with the £50 valuation.</P>
      <P>There is an education and an encouragement for increased agricultural production and yet if anybody extends his farm buildings the valuation goes up.  I think that sub-section (2) (c) will have the effect of restricting agricultural production in the future.  I wonder if it would be possible for the Minister to have some sort of sliding scale or a grading scale.  It is peculiar that a person with £50 valuation can get the benefits, and that a person with a £50 5s. valuation cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally, I am delighted to hear what Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Lehane have just said.  It is wonderful.  In other words, what they are suggesting is that the limits of the Bill, as far as they are concerned, are too restrictive.  That is what I anticipated a long time ago &mdash;that once we got this Bill into operation attempts would be made from all sides to extend its benefits and that, in a very short time, it would be a free for all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lehane pointed out that a person with a £50 1s. valuation might be a more deserving case than a man with a £50 valuation and the same thing applies to the £600.  A man with £601 may be a more deserving case than the man with £600.  I think, therefore, as a result of these two speeches that we have just heard, that everything is most hopeful.</P>
      <P>When this Bill becomes law, no matter what the restrictions are, from every local authority and from every public representative, whether he be a member of the Dáil or of a local authority, there will be a clamour for extension of the benefits to other classes &mdash; and then we shall get the Health Bill that we should have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> This is a most welcome development as far as this debate is concerned.  I am delighted that Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Lehane have made that point.  I think that the majority of Deputies in this House would like to extend the classes and extend the benefits and, in fact, to make it a completely free-for-all scheme.  But, of course, we had objections in this House to a free-for-all scheme.  However, the moment we get down to the practical realities of the sections and the sub-sections we have the very reasonable comment from Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Lehane that the restriction in regard to £50 valuation may impose a hardship on some particular farmers and that a farmer with £51 valuation would not be entitled to benefit under this scheme while a farmer with a £50 valuation would.</P>
    <P>The points made by Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Lehane are a most welcome development, and it has come so quickly after the introduction of the Bill that it certainly delights the cockles of my heart.</P>

      <P>With regard to the choice of hospital &mdash; and that will include the choice of going to a private home&mdash; that will be discussed when we come to amendment No. 45 on Section 24. On that section there is an amendment which sets out and deals very fully with that whole question of a choice of hospital, but it will only apply to those who are prepared to contribute two guineas a week themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will.  If a person says he would like a choice, it works the reverse way.  Let me give an example.  At present the local authorities are paying £5 12s. per week to voluntary hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is in respect of insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For a bed in a voluntary hospital.  A local authority pays that sum in respect of any person they send <Col N="1223" /> to a voluntary hospital and £2 2s. is taken from that, which gives £3 10s. So long as that £5 12s. remains, in fact what happens is that a person is told by his doctor that he wants hospital treatment and he discusses where he will go.  The doctor explains the scheme and the patient decides he would like to choose his own hospital. He tells the local authority: &ldquo;My doctor says I need hospital treatment and I want to choose my own hospital.&rdquo; In that case, the local authority says: &ldquo;We will pay £3 10s. per week and you can look after yourself.&rdquo; He chooses his own hospital, pays his own doctor and so on.  He gets a subvention and that subvention will be the amount the local authority are paying at the time to the voluntary hospital for a week, less £2 2s.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an agreed amount to be paid by the local authorities to the voluntary hospital for a patient for a week.  Some years ago, that was £2 2s., but recently it has gone up to £5 12s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  The amount may vary up or down, but, whatever it is, it will be that amount less the £2 2s.  That amount, less £2 2s., is the subvention which the local authority will pay where the person chooses his own hospital.  That is really what amendment No. 45 amounts to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Esmonde's question, there is a limit of two weeks in the case of a maternity home and of six weeks in the case of a private home, but that again can be extended if a good case is made.  I was asked also when Section 14 would come into operation and the answer is as soon as we get the local authorities to operate the section.  On that question of operation, when we feel that some of the local authorities are ready to go ahead, an Order will be made bringing the section into operation and then they will get some time to come into <Col N="1224" /> line before compulsion is applied to the remainder.</P>
    <P>The point has been made, as Deputy Morrissey made it &mdash; and a cogent point, indeed, it is &mdash; that we have not got enough hospitals.  We have not, and the strange thing is that wherever we have added beds, they are immediately filled, and we find we want more.  There are, however, a number of hospitals in course of construction at the moment and these should make a difference, but I am afraid that if we were to keep a scheme like this back until we have sufficient hospital accommodation, it would be years before we would reach that position.  In any case, I do not see an awful lot in the argument from the point of view that if people want hospital treatment, it is to be presumed that they are getting it.  This scheme should not make any difference, so far as that is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are not getting it, it shows the great need for the Bill. I should not say that there is a very big number in that category, the category of people in need of treatment who are not getting it at the moment.  What is happening is that people are going for treatment they can ill afford and which involves great hardship on them from the point of view of paying for it, or perhaps they are skimping it a little, postponing the evil day, or leaving before they should leave, but I do not think there are many people really in need of hospital treatment who are not getting it.  Deputy O'Higgins said that there was an insurance scheme here which was declared illegal.  That is true, but I am told that the Insurance Corporation <Col N="1225" /> of Ireland has a scheme of this kind and it would be well if it were known because I had a few letters myself from people saying that they would like to insure in regard to health if they were not eligible under the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has, yes.  Deputy MacEoin put a question with regard to a person who gets the central buildings on a divided estate and who might have a very high valuation.  That is certainly a case which would be taken into account by the local authority and sub-paragraph (d) would apply, unless the person had very big means apart from that.  If he was an ordinary farmer trying to live on 30 or 40 acres with a very high valuation, it would naturally be taken into account.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Lehane's point, I was very keen at one time on grading it, of setting out so much valuation for a single man and adding to it for a wife and for the first couple of children, but in the end I was persuaded &mdash; and, I think, rightly &mdash; to cut out all these competitions and make the scheme as simple as possible.  We did that and really what we did was to put in sub-paragraph (d) to cover the hard cases.  I think it is better on the whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to say what these regulations are going to be.  I think we should be able to lay down some sort of uniform guide for the country.  Take the case mentioned by Deputy MacEoin, the man over £50 valuation where there was hardship or what Deputy Lehane had in mind, the man with a very big family just over the £50 mark.  There are quite a fair number of categories of that kind that could be considered sympathetically. The Deputy being a member of a board himself will understand that when I <Col N="1226" /> put this scheme up, the Minister for Finance asked me what (d) was going to cost.  I said I did not know and I think he was reasonable in saying: &ldquo;If you do not know, you must at least give me some check&rdquo;.  I said I was quite prepared to do that and said that I would get his approval for whatever regulations were made.  On that basis he agreed and I think he was quite entitled to it because I could give no indication of what that sub-paragraph might cost.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), page 6, lines 55 and 56, to delete &ldquo;one pound&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the appropriate amount&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When the Second Reading and afterwards the Financial Resolutions came before the Dáil, some Deputies were inclined to treat this sum of £1 which I had set out in the Bill with a certain amount of contempt.  It was called a subterfuge and so on.  I have held all the time that this sum of £1 was a serious contribution, because I had based it on, if you like, a fairly rough, but at least a firm calculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Statistics Office had given us figures showing that there were 240,000 married women under 44 years of age in the country, and the number of births each year for some years back is between 60,000 and 65,000.  Taking all the married women, it is fairly simple to discover that a child appears every four years.  Of course, in statistics you must always take the whole lot and average it out in that way. Assuming that all the women who are eligible join and we collect £1 every year from each woman, we would have collected £4 for every child born.  The cost is not going to be £8 I hope; I think it will be considerably less, so that according to statistics we would, in fact, be collecting about 50 per cent. I was quite satisfied with 50 per cent. but, as I say, there was a good lot of criticism of the amount as being entirely inadequate, being a mere token and so on.  On that account I agreed to put in this particular amendment, <Col N="1227" /> if you like, as a proof that my figures were correct.  I was sure my figures were correct and I did not mind putting it in in another way.  This amendment means that the £1 will last for three years until the Minister has some opportunity of getting experience of the figures; then on that experience he would make an Order which would have the effect of collecting about half the cost from the women concerned.  It will not apply to those already in.</P>

      <P>We will have to discuss them together.  Having got his experience the Minister would then fix the sum so as to bring in half the cost. Having examined this amendment very carefully there are one or two other points I would like to make.  The cost is a bit widely defined.  I must say what I had in mind were the medical and hospital costs and no more than that.  I think it was at one of the <Col N="1228" /> health council meetings, some of the members thought it might possibly amount to a contribution of, say £5, £10 or £20 per year.  It could not possibly amount to that unless there was some fantastic amount put down for administration or something like that.  In order to avoid that I think we should make it clear, if it is not clear already, that administration should not come into this.  It should be only the medical and hospital costs.</P>

      <P>Leaving this appropriate sum out and taking the £1 as it was in the beginning, the regulation was naturally laid down that any woman wishing to avail of this scheme would have to join, let us say, within six or 12 months&mdash;we will have to consider that &mdash; of the appointed day.  That is for existing married women and, in future, any newly married women will have to join within six or 12 months of the date of marriage.  We will have to do that, I am afraid, to avoid the case of a woman getting married, waiting three or four years until she expects a baby and then joining.  She must join when she gets married or not at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>But I do not think the Minister's statistics and figures, with all respect to him, would stand very long before an actuary.  The Minister, as far as I can make out, is basing his figures and proposes to base the appropriate amount on the figures supplied to him by the Statistics Department and on the assumption that all the women are going to register and all the women are going to contribute to the appropriate amount.  Of course, the Minister has not the foggiest idea, and could not have the foggiest idea as to the number within thousands, or maybe within tens of thousands, that will elect to come in under this.  I do not think the Minister himself would argue that he is in a position to give even a fairly close figure, and unless I misunderstand the position, the appropriate amount will be determined very largely, if not entirely, by the number of contributions or rather the number of people who are contributing. Is that not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Of course, my figures, as the Deputy knows, are based on the existing number of married women.  I do not know how many may join.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to make any point.  I know he is not in a position to say within tens of thousands how many women will be contributing to this scheme.  Therefore he could not give us &mdash; it is not a question of not wanting to give us &mdash; any idea of what the appropriate amount will be and which may now have to be a very substantial amount and a very substantial contribution.  That seems to me to be a very considerable weakness in it and, of course, it will defeat itself in a way because if those who do elect to come in under the scheme and to avail of it, find after a period that the contribution they have to make is in excess of what they thought it would be, they will be inclined to get out of the scheme and get away from the responsibility of making that contribution. It seems to me, to say the least of it, that this is a very loose provision. <Col N="1230" /> Nobody here, not even the Minister himself, is in a position to give us any indication as to how it is going to operate, how much it is going to cost either the State or the individual patient, how many of our married women are going to avail of the scheme or how many are going to remain outside it.  As I said, it seems a very loose section, drafted in a haphazard, happy-go-lucky, hoping-for-the-best attitude.</P>

I am myself much indebted to the 1947 Act of the Minister.  During my period of office, the benefits of the 1947 Act, particularly in relation to T.B., and the advantages which I was given under that Act, were largely responsible for the fact that we were able to tackle the serious problem of T.B. in 1948.  I do not think that the Minister gets half enough credit for the fact that he did at least make that power available to us by the provisions of the 1947 Act. Whether he continues with his amendment or whether he removes it, I do not think anything can detract from <Col N="1231" /> his contribution to valuable health legislation during his term of office.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the question of the £1 contribution, which was an amendment of the 1947 Health Act, particularly in relation to the mother and child section, was ridiculed, as he said, when it was put before the House. I would suggest, however, that that is not a sufficient reason for making this very radical and very serious departure from the excellent lines of this aspect of the present Bill, the radical departure being, as pointed out by Deputy Morrissey, the fact that we now are being asked to approve of an insurance scheme on the lines largely suggested by the Irish Medical Association &mdash; at any rate an insurance scheme. I objected to this amendment in the health council on grounds, strange as it may seem, very similar to those put forward by Deputy Morrissey this afternoon.  The way I look at it, is that while we had the £1 contribution we had a fixed definite amount for the lady which would bring her into benefit under the scheme.  Now, the appropriate amount, of course, throws the whole thing wide open and gives us no assurance whatever that even in this small part of this Bill we shall be providing benefits for mothers and infants which we know we could provide by the provisions of the 1947 Act, that is, that the service should be freely available to all without a means test on the principle which we have seen was so terribly valuable in another aspect of our health services &mdash; the T.B. service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, I feel, must try to give us a better justification than that which he has already given us for this serious radical departure from his £1 contribution proposal, before it could be agreed to as Governmental policy. We well know that the Government policy in relation to mothers and infants service is enshrined in the excellent 1947 Act.  Certain difficulties occurred and it did appear understandable that the Minister should pare down those proposals to the extent that they were pared down after the recent White Paper was issued.  I understood the Minister's difficulties and was glad to some extent that he had found it possible <Col N="1232" /> to retain the better aspects of the free services envisaged by him and by the Government of which he is a member under the 1947 Act.  My difficulty is this.  I know that the underlying principle proposed by the Minister and the Government in 1947 in respect of this type of service was that it should be free and that there should be no means test.  As I say that principle was vitiated to a certain extent, if not destroyed, by the most recent proposal of the Minister &mdash; that is up to this last amendment &mdash; the £1 proposal.  I must ask whether there are more cogent and more compelling reasons than that given by the Minister &mdash;that is, that the £1 contribution is ridiculed by Deputies &mdash; before I can accept the very radical departure from the proposals put forward by the Minister here in the form of a White Paper and later in the form of the Health Bill.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I regret that owing to the fact that I had to visit hospital yesterday I was unable to be present when the reply was given to this question.  The question put down by Deputy Briscoe was as follows: To ask the Minister for Finance if he would state if and when a Fianna Fáil Government approved these schemes: (a) £9,000,000 for the building of a new Dáil; (b) new Government buildings at the Phoenix Park costing £11,000,000; (c) a new jail at Chapelizod costing £1,000,000, and (d) washing the face of Dublin Castle costing £1,500,000.  The question asked the Minister to state when the schemes were approved.  I did not say that the Government had approved of a scheme. I said they had plans for a building scheme and the Parliamentary Secretary said, quite correctly, I think, that no such plan was approved for, if it had been approved they would, of course, be building and the Parliamentary Secretary got away on a technicality.  My assertion is that <Col N="1233" /> there were proposals by the then Government for such buildings and for such developments.  Perhaps I should have used the phrase &ldquo;lifting the Castle's face&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;washing the Castle's face&rdquo; because that would probably be a more correct description.</P>
      <P>The idea behind all this was I think, to keep me right for I will not impute to Deputy Briscoe any idea of trying to make me out a public liar.  I think Deputy Briscoe was anxious that I should know the truth as a matter of fact, as he knows it; but as he knows it and as I know it are two entirely different things because I, personally, saw the plans and maps for these schemes.  I saw more than that.  It was more than an idea.  When I said &ldquo;lifting the Castle's face&rdquo; to the tune of £1,500,000, I regret to say I was £500,000 out.  The figure was £2,000,000. Let me be quite definite on this: on that scheme alone there is one of the finest models ever made in my opinion lying under a revolving glass case showing what the plans were for Dublin Castle, and that model cost £600.  The Taoiseach and the Parliamentary Secretary said yesterday there was no cost; that model alone cost £600.</P>
      <P>I feel it is imperative that this matter should be placed on record once and for all.  It is already on record and, in that connection, I want to draw Deputies' attention to Volume 114 of the Official Report.  I refer the House to the speech made by Deputy McGilligan, then Minister for Finance, on the Vote on Account as reported at column 1901 and subsequent columns of Volume 114 on 29th March, 1949.  There the then Minister for Finance very clearly sets out the plans.  It is strange that the present Minister for External Affairs, then Deputy Aiken, did not challenge the accuracy of Deputy McGilligan's statement.  I would like everybody to take note of this.  I would not like Deputy Briscoe to be under the impression that he was right and I was wrong.  I want to inform Deputy Briscoe and every Deputy listening to me now of the facts. Deputy McGilligan, as reported at column 1901 said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1234" />&ldquo;In 1933 the last Government set up a Committee consisting of the then Minister for Local Government and Public Health, now the President, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacEntee; the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Aiken, and the late Mr. Flinn, to consider a plan for the housing of this Parliament&mdash;as if we were not comfortable enough&mdash; and of the civil servants attached to the Government.  A report was produced by that body in January, 1934. It was decided to have a comprehensive plan for these new Government Buildings.  The suggestion was made that an area in the City of Dublin should be scheduled and that legislative action should be taken to prevent undue inflation of site values inside the scheduled area. Those who know Dublin might be attentive to this.  The scheduled area, as recommended, was the whole portion of the district bounded by Merrion Street, Lower Baggot Street, the Canal and Fenian Street. In other words, you turn right from Government Buildings and go up towards the turn left towards Baggot Street, go along Baggot Street to the Canal, turn left along the Canal passing Mount Street Bridge until you turn left where Sir Patrick Dun's hospital is and go along Fenian Street until the corner of Westland Row and left again to Government Buildings.  That was to be scheduled&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Captain Cowan: Wiped out.</P>
    <P>Mr. McGilligan: &mdash;&mdash;wiped out. and a new Government Building with civil servants' offices to be put there.</P>
    <P>Mr. Davin: It would be a royal republic then.</P>
    <P>Mr. McGilligan: It meant the wiping out of two hospitals, I think a couple of churches, a variety of professional men's houses, a convent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Madden: They should have taken the Grangegorman site.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a plan definitely outlined then.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Let Deputies think of themselves standing at Kingsbridge, with their back to the mouth of the Liffey, and think of the buildings right and left of them as they look down towards Chapelizod.  Those properties to the right and left from Kingsbridge to Chapelizod were to be cleared.  It meant the disappearance of Cahill's, the Lucan Dairies and a host of places along that bank, but the people would have had a pleasant riverside walk.  I think Deputy Aiken made his contribution to the plan by saying that, if that did not protect the people's amenities far enough, they should have, not a compulsory scheme but a compulsory controlled scheme of the amenities of the Liffey Valley to Lucan and finally to Leixlip.</P>
      <P>Mr. Aiken: Do you object?</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: I was about to ask if the Fianna Fáil back benchers thought I was telling the truth about that, but Deputy Aiken agrees.</P>

    <P>Yesterday, it was alleged that I was drawing on my imagination.  I saw the plans and I saw the maps.  I ask the Taoiseach now to bring over the finest piece of work that one could see and leave it on the centre of that table, the model proposed for Dublin Castle, costing £600.  The work that it <Col N="1236" /> represented was to cost £2,000,000. Deputy Briscoe quite recently charged the inter-Party Government with having stopped this work on the Castle. He made it one of the charges.</P>

      <P>I do, but the idea is something that was found by a commission when I set up three people to make a report to me on what they would do to build these things.  It was more than an idea you had then when you suggested to them to make a report how to do it, and set out what they would do.  I said the jail at Chapelizod.  That has never been denied.  When I became Minister for Justice there was the farm of land &mdash; it is there on the top of the hill at Chapelizod&mdash;of which I was notified by the Office of Public Works, that it was available for the building of this, and that the Government had decided to go on with it.  I will admit quite frankly that the difference between the present Minister for Justice and myself on that was that he was calling it a borstal and I was calling it a jail, but it is a jail just the same.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach will not deny that they sat, and I will leave that to him now.  I was only pointing out that the Government were criticising the inter-Party Government's expenditure, and, as I said before, we could not hold a candle to them in their proposals.  I pointed out that there was the Argentine wheat, the Canadian oatmeal and the South African coal, and that these expenditures were far out of proportion to anything we had ever dreamt of.  I went further and said &mdash; I did not know that the Taoiseach was going to follow me so closely and corroborate what I said&mdash; that we left so much money behind us from the Marshal Aid Loan and the grant.  Mind you, I was more prophetic than I thought when I asserted that these millions were nothing to a Government like Fianna Fáil, but the Taoiseach came out in Fermoy on the next Sunday and said that the £22,000,000 was only the remnants of Marshall Aid&mdash;the tailor's clippings, only a thing of nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that the figures that are challenged are that there was any proposal of this type approved of.  When the question is put in that particular way, the Government, of course, can say quite accurately that they were not approved of because if they were there would now be buildings.  But they had these <Col N="1238" /> plans ready for submission to the House if and when the time, as they thought, was opportune to get away with it.</P>
      <P>As I say, the thing I object to is this&mdash;a Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party putting down a question to impugn the honesty of the other person and holding him up to public ridicule by saying he was drawing on his imagination.</P>
      <P>The Minister for External Affairs, then Deputy Aiken, went on to say that the inter-Party Government was going on with these, including the Castle.  Deputy Aiken said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You are not telling the whole truth.</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: There may be additions.  There were minor schemes, I must admit.  There was the Dublin Castle scheme, which was to cost £2,000,000.</P>
      <P>Mr. Aiken: And which you are going on with.</P>
      <P>Mr. McGilligan: No, we are not.</P>
      <P>Mr. Aiken: You have it in the Book of Estimates.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, washing the Castle's face was more than an idea.  It was in the Book of Estimates, and that is considerably more than an idea.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, in answer to Deputy Briscoe, may have said indeed: &ldquo;There were some things that we had not fully decided to go on with but there were some of them that we had decided to go on with&rdquo;. But when the Parliamentary Secretary in answer to a parliamentary question informs Deputy Briscoe that there was none of these things to be gone on with, none of them were approved, and yet here in the Book of Estimates you have the £2,000,000&mdash;I was only £500,000 out&mdash;to do the Castle, then the Taoiseach, the Head of the Government, gets up and says it was only an idea.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the subject matter of the question.  The subject matter under debate was whether the Government had approved of these things and then Parliamentary Secretary Beegan said that none of the schemes was ever approved by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Deputy Briscoe asked from what source the Deputy&mdash; meaning Deputy MacEoin &mdash; got his information and then we have the Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. Ryan, saying: &ldquo;From his imagination.&rdquo; I respectfully submit that that is not the line of thought that I would expect from the Taoiseach or from any member of that Government on a question that can be proved in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the time is much too short to point out all the misrepresentation that has gone on for years with respect to this whole question of Government buildings and parliamentary buildings.  When in 1922 there was the question of an Irish Parliament sitting in the open, the question of buildings arose.  In 1923, I think, a Committee was set up, a Joint Committee of both Houses, to consider this particular matter.  These buildings here were taken at the time for temporary accommodation.  When we came in in 1932 we found that the Museum, the Library, the National Gallery &mdash; institutions of public importance &mdash; were being crowded out and they wanted more space.  We also had a number of Government offices scattered throughout the city.  There are even at this day some 64 of them accommodated in private houses.  We began to consider whether it would not be in the public interest to design or get a plan which could be carried out over a long period of years according as the need arose, according as there might be a slump in employment, in construction work and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question that has to be decided, naturally, is, if there is a plan of that sort to be carried on, where is the site to be.  The first question was to consider was there any suitable site. A number of suitable sites, as the basis of a plan for construction, were suggested and finally it was suggested that the neighbourhood of the present Government buildings, that area facing <Col N="1240" /> the Government buildings, would be in the long run the most suitable.  The next thing was to examine what were the possibilities of such a site, what the development of such a site would mean.  You have to have a site if you are going to have a plan and you have to have plans in preparation a long time if they are going ever to be put into operation and to be effective for the purposes you have in mind.</P>
    <P>The consideration of that led to a number of questions.  In one way or another, the consideration of the matter lasted from 1932 to 1937.  There is no evidence there of our having been in much of a hurry about a spree, I think.  If we were all on the spending spree that the Deputy suggested, we would not have spent five years in just considering the matters that would arise in connection with a site.  In 1937, the scheme was put completely aside because of the fact that it was decided that the Board of Works should give priority to the consideration of arterial drainage.  The whole idea was put aside until, in the middle of the war, a Cabinet Committee was considering the question of post-war planning.  One of the things we had to consider was the possibility &mdash; which might have happened had there been a genuine peace after the last war &mdash; of a number of young people who had gone over to England, craftsmen and others, coming back in large numbers.</P>
    <P>Besides the other plans, we had this question of the possibility of having a plan for Government buildings, a comprehensive plan, to be operated over a long number of years, to be carried out according as the need would arise, a plan which was definitely stated to be subject to other considerations and to take its place in the queue &mdash; to be subject to the question of the availability of supplies, the question of house building, the question of schools and other more immediate and necessary public works.  It had been put aside, then, completely for the time being in 1937.  It was further considered in 1943 and 1944, and in December, 1944, it was decided to consider the setting up of a Committee of all Parties to go into the question of the selection of a suitable site.  In 1945, the then Minister for Finance was asked to <Col N="1241" /> approach the Leader of the largest Opposition Party to find out what his Party's reaction would be towards a scheme of that kind and to see whether there was going to be any co-operation in considering a matter of that sort.  It was quite clear from the report we got that co-operation as far as he was concerned&mdash;though he promised to consider it with his colleagues, he made quite clear his own reaction&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving it as I got it, that the reaction of the Leader of the Opposition or of the principal Opposition Party was against it.  There was reported to me the promise that he would consider it in consultation with his colleagues.  After that, the Minister became President and no further reply was received.  Finally, the last thing we did was to set up &mdash; I think in August, 1946&mdash;an interdepartmental committee to consider this whole question but not to have their consideration based on Merrion <Col N="1242" /> Square which had been abandoned from that point of view.  One of the principal reasons for abandoning it was that there were certain institutions within the area which it would have been impossible to disturb and not right to disturb, so it was completely abandoned.  Then the inter-departmental committee was asked to consider the question of a site in an open space in the Phoenix Park, for which plans could be easily made, where there was no question of having any demolitions or acquisition of houses or anything of that sort.  My recollection is that that committee was still sitting when we left office in February, 1948.</P>
      <P>I know nothing about the model that has been referred to, but if there is one and if it is a question of the Castle, the Castle came in in this way.  At one stage of the consideration, it was pointed out that there is a number of offices which it is convenient for the public to have situated near the centre of the city.</P>
      <P>That being so, the question of the Castle site had been considered very early, from that point of view &mdash; in order to convenience the citizens, it was considered that the best thing that could be done would be to take that area, the Castle area, and to deal with the buildings there &mdash; there were offices there already &mdash; to see how that could be developed so as to meet the needs of those offices which, for the convenience of the public, ought to be near the centre of the city.  As to the time, I think it was a period of 20 years that was envisaged for the development there.</P>

    <P>Now, it is quite clear from what I have said, which can be easily brought out by a question in much more detail than I can give &mdash; with day and date for the incidents I have recalled &mdash; that what was happening was that the Government was considering whether it would not be advisable to have in a central place close to each other a number of these scattered offices and to have also a pool of constructional work which could be used to give employment if there were a sudden slump of any kind in employment in the <Col N="1243" /> building industry.  There is nothing that we have to retreat from in the slightest.  What we have to object to and what we do object to, of course, is the misrepresentation that, in the circumstances of the time, we had actually decided to go on and start that work. You can have plans which need not be put into operation for years.  The whole thing, at the time when we were considering it first, was that it was considered desirable &mdash; it is good practice in every country &mdash; in order to meet conditions of a slump, to have a pool of public works, of useful public works, available.  This particular set of public works was definitely stated on the files to be work which was to be special, <Col N="1244" /> which was to be put in the queue, if I may put it that way &mdash; to take its place after the building of homes, after the building of schools and hospitals and after other works of greater public importance.</P>
