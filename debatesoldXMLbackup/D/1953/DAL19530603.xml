      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The power of making rules conferred by sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 3 of the Land Act, 1933, shall extend to and be exercisable for making rules for carrying into effect the provisions (other than provisions relating to land purchase finance) of this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister for Finance may make rules and regulations for carrying into effect the provisions of this Act relating to land purchase finance, and may by such rules or regulations adapt to the requirements of this Act any provisions relating to land purchase finance contained in any Act passed before this Act.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides for rules and regulations on the lines of this new section which are to be found in most Land Acts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely agree, but it is so standard that I cannot understand why it was left out of the original Bill.  I am assuming it is necessary because of some subsequent amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Amendment No. 19 is one reason, at any rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In previous sections of this kind was it not customary to have the amendment worded something like this&mdash;that the Minister for Lands may make rules and regulations after consultation with the Minister for Finance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister on this because in this amendment I think the Minister is giving the Minister for Finance complete authority without giving the Minister for Lands a chance to express his views in making the regulations.  The Minister for Lands, in my opinion, is being crushed out of this on account of the way the amendment is worded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Act introduced by the Deputy and passed in this House&mdash;the Land Act, 1950&mdash;the Minister for Finance, as set out in Section 3, sub-section (2) of that Act, &ldquo;may make rules and regulations for carrying into effect the provisions of this Act relating to land purchase finance, and may by such rules or regulations adapt to the requirements of this Act any provisions relating to land purchase finance contained in any Act passed before this Act&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The payments made and expenses incurred by the Minister for Lands and by the Land Commission in giving effect to this Act and in the administration thereof shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>This is necessary to make provision for payments and expenses which will arise as, for example, under amendment No. 7.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a normal section. I entirely agree with the Minister but I do not understand why this and the previous amendment were not incorporated in the original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons is that when the Bill was originally in contemplation it dealt with two or three specific matters.  The legal advisers to the Department have advised that the opportunity should be taken to improve the existing legislation where necessary.  That is the reason why we have these additional amendments.  I do not think there is any question of principle in them.  I could have taken the attitude with my legal advisers that we really would not do this unless it was absolutely essential. It is their view that, in order to tighten up the existing legal provisions, we should have these amendments. They are really largely a matter of draftsmanship and as Deputy Sweetman knows, of a technical character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has given that explanation, and I agree with him.  The underlying fact, however, is that I want to make the Bill a little different from the one that was introduced.  I agree that this is a desirable difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the payment of expenses incurred by the Land Commission, have not these to be voted by the Dáil?  Therefore, if this amendment becomes law, will the Minister for Finance be in a position to sidestep, or nullify, the intentions of the Dáil in voting moneys for the Minister for Lands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is conjuring up ideas out of his imagination. He knows, or ought to know, as much about the Land Commission as I do.  During the whole course of events since 1923, where, I ask, has the Minister for Finance interfered arbitrarily? The Deputy knows very well that there is consultation, and that if we cannot agree we go to the Government.  Is not that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to see the Minister for Lands in the position of finding himself up against, shall we <Col N="555" /> say, an awkward Minister for Finance, and then having to go to the Government to get that Minister's decision overruled.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> Where the price of untenanted land, or the resumption price of a holding or part of a holding, agreed upon or fixed before the passing of this Act is payable in land bonds which have not been issued before the first series of land bonds is created after the passing of this Act, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any agreement or enactment or in any order of the Land Commission or the Appeal Tribunal, the price or the resumption price shall be paid by means of an issue of land bonds of that series.</P>
    <P>This amendment meets points which have been raised by Deputy Sweetman in the amendments that he has tabled. This section is for the benefit of owners from whom untenanted land is purchased or acquired and tenants from whom holdings are resumed and whose 4 per cent., 3½ per cent. or 3 per cent. land bonds are not issued before the new bonds become available.  New bonds are to be substituted for those which they would otherwise receive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is on the question of what exactly the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo; means.  I understood that &ldquo;issue&rdquo; meant the date on which they were provisionally placed to credit which is, I think, the appointed day in respect of untenanted land.  The appointed day is almost always fixed as the date on which possession is taken.  I am not quite clear what the position is in respect to resumption cases.  I want to say, first of all, that this and the next amendment have been introduced by the Minister to meet points that I raised on the Second Reading.  As one who likes to be occasionally somewhat caustic at the expense of Ministers, I am glad to be able to take an entirely different line on this amendment and to thank and congratulate the Minister on having met the case that was put forward, a case that undoubtedly was going to mean injustice, and to say that I am satisfied that such injustice has been remedied by these two amendments. The whole kernel of this will depend upon the meaning of the word &ldquo;issue&rdquo;.  I should be glad if the Minister would clarify that.  I appreciate that the matter is a bit technical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="557" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not seem to be dealt with in the present measure.  I think the cardinal date is the point of time of vesting in the Land Commission. In so far as we have changes in this measure, the intention, as I understand it, is to try and make that the starting point.  I am informed that, as regards the actual issue of bonds, that takes place when the purchase money is paid into court by the Land Commission, which is perhaps some little time after the appointed date. That may not actually be on the appointed day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In this amendment the words used are, &ldquo;which have not been issued before the first series of land bonds is created after the passing of this Act&rdquo;.  I want to be quite clear on this because it is absolutely vital to the point of view that I put forward on the Second Reading.  There are cases at the present moment where the appointed day has been fixed.  I have in mind one case where the appointed day was fixed on the 29th January of this year.  Possession was taken by the Land Commission on some date in January of this year. Notice was published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> subsequently stating that the provisional price £x payable in land bonds had been put to the credit of that estate on that date.</P>
      <P>There is another point in respect of this which is a side issue on which I propose to ask for clarification later on another section of the Bill.  Perhaps I might refer to it now in passing.  The Minister, when replying on the Second Reading, said that there were no new land bonds issued after the 31st December last, because on the 31st December they had all been used up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that was so, I do not understand quite how these other bonds in the two cases I have in mind were placed to credit in January of this year.  In the case I am interested in, the provisional notice was issued last September.  The owner in question, who did not object to the acquisition, indicated to the Land Commission that he was prepared to agree to their acquiring the lands and that the only question for decision was the question of price.  The Land Commission took possession of <Col N="558" /> the lands in January.  Immediately, when they took possession of the lands in January, they published a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> saying that the appointed day was fixed as of the date in January on which they had taken possession and thereupon transferring to the credit of that estate the amount of land bonds provisionally fixed as the provisional purchase price pending the appeal and determination of such purchase price by the Judicial Commissioner. My worry is whether that transfer to the credit of the estate from the general land bond fund is not an issue.  I understood, from the discussion we had on the Second Reading, that is was an issue, that once the provisional price was fixed and the bonds placed to the credit of the estate then that was, in the wording of the Land Acts, considered as the issue of the bonds and that the subsequent action that takes place in respect of the bonds, when the bonds are paid out of the Land Commission to the owner of the land, is, in the parlance of the Land Acts, the allocation of those bonds.</P>
    <P>If I am right in thinking that the issue is the appointed day, then it seems to me that what we are doing in this amendment is that we are covering cases, and only covering cases, where an appointed day has been fixed but no bonds have been provisionally issued to the credit of the particular estate.  I must confess that I am a bit sorry for the Minister because this is a very technical matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises from the difficulty of dealing with cases where bonds have not already been issued. Amendment No. 6 deals with these and new bonds are to be substituted, as I have said, for those which the vendors would otherwise receive.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy Sweetman's point is, perhaps, covered in amendment No. 7 which deals with cases where the land bonds have already been issued.  In fact, no prices have been fixed or agreed upon since the end of last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <P>What is the difference, then, in the amendment No. 6 and&mdash;if I may ask this question&mdash;the provisions of the amendment which I submitted but which was ruled out of order?  In my amendment I suggested that the existing bonds already issued should be cancelled.  Does, in fact, amendment No. 6 cancel the existing bonds already issued?</P>

On the 29th January&mdash;that is, 14 days afterwards, which is what I think the Minister says &ldquo;immediately afterwards&rdquo;&mdash;a notice was published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> stating that £8,500 worth of bonds had been transferred to the credit of that particular estate.

      <P>What has happened to those bonds?  Are those bonds still left there?  I understood the Minister to take the line that those bonds were being substituted.  As I appreciate the position, those bonds which have been transferred to the credit of that estate <Col N="560" /> are left there and, in addition, under amendment No. 7, further bonds are added.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 3 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Where, before the first series of land bonds is created after the passing of this Act, land bonds have been issued in any matter in respect of the price of untenanted land or the resumption price of a holding or part of a holding and&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  possession of such land, holding or part has been taken by the Land Commission after the 11th day of December, 1952, or such land or the tenant's interest in such holding or part vested or is deemed to have vested in the Land Commission after that date, or</P>
      <P>(b)  such land vested in the Land Commission pursuant to Section 30 of the Land Act, 1933, or that section as extended by Section 30 of the Land Act, 1936, before the passing of this Act and the price thereof is agreed upon or fixed after such passing,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the Land Commission shall in such matter make an additional advance and issue additional land bonds equal in nominal amount (to the nearest pound) to such percentage of the price or the resumption price as the <Col N="561" /> Minister for Finance directs and bearing the same rate of interest as the land bonds already issued.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where, before the first series of land bonds is created after the passing of this Act, land bonds have been issued in any matter in respect of the price of untenanted land (not being land in relation to which sub-section (1) of this section applies) and such price is, pursuant to an application for the redetermination thereof, increased after the passing of this Act, the Land Commission shall in such matter make an additional advance and issue additional land bonds equal in nominal amount (to the nearest pound) to such percentage of the amount by which the price is increased as the Minister for Finance directs and bearing the same rate of interest as the land bonds already issued.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where, pursuant to sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of this section, additional land bonds are issued in any matter&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  there shall be payable by the Land Commission to the person entitled to the receipt of the rents and profits of the untenanted land immediately before possession thereof was taken by the Land Commission or to the person entitled to the resumption price of the holding or the part of a holding a sum equal to interest (less income-tax) on the additional land bonds from the date on which such land or the tenant's interest in such holding or part vested or is deemed to have vested in the Land Commission or the date on which possession of such land, holding or part was obtained by the Land Commission (whichever is the later) to the date of the issue of the additional land bonds and that sum shall be in lieu of such (if any) interest as may be appropriate under sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Land Act, 1923, and</P>
    <P>(b)  on the allocation of the additional land bonds in such matter due regard shall be had to the respective interests of all persons entitled to claim (whether <Col N="562" /> before or after the passing of this Act) in such manner and such land bonds shall be distributed as the justice of the case may require by the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sweetman has said, the intention is to add what we call, for the sake of clarification, bonus additional bonds, where bonds have already been issued.  There would be a difficulty in substituting new bonds&mdash;considerable difficulty&mdash;if they had already been issued and had, perhaps, passed to new owners.</P>
    <P>We are trying to achieve the same financial result and trying to assure that it will have precisely the same financial advantages for the vendors if we issue additional bonds to them.  The determination of the appropriate bonus percentage is left to the Minister for Finance, who will be responsible for fixing the rate of interest which newly created bonds will bear.  These are the types of cases that Deputy Sweetman had in mind where the Land Commission have taken possession of the lands since the 11th December, 1952. I think the most appropriate date is the date of the introduction of the Bill.  The concession, as I have said, extends to a small number of cases in which prices have yet to be fixed&mdash;for example, 7 (1) (b).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, as the Minister has correctly stated, is another method of doing what some of us were urging on the Second Reading of the Bill.  Let me say that I think the Minister's method of doing it is a better one than mine.  However, if I had been ingenious enough to think of the Minister's method I should have urged a date other than that of the 11th December.  The only reason I restricted myself to the date of 11th December last was because I did not think of dealing with it in this manner of bonus issue rather than by cancelling existing bonds and substituting <Col N="563" /> new bonds.  However, the Minister's ingenuity having produced this bonus issue method, I would urge him, then, that it is a method that is applicable not merely to the date of the introduction of this Bill but one under which he could reasonably be expected to go back further.</P>
      <P>One date that immediately occurs to me is a date in October&mdash;I think it was the 6th October&mdash;when there was an indication given, in answer to a question in the House, by the Minister for Finance that the issue of a new series of land bonds was to receive consideration. As well as I remember, it was in the beginning of October that that was answered.  Apart from that, there has been the question since of the loss that owners of land have suffered since the change in the value of interest rates here in Ireland with the result, of course, that the 4 per cent. bonds were reduced in price.  When the Judicial Commissioner&mdash;or the Land Commission, if there had been agreement&mdash;had fixed a price, that price was fixed without reference to the depreciation in land bonds consequent on the drop in interest rates and owners who were forced to sell their bonds immediately upon allocation suffered loss in some cases up to 12 per cent.  As well as I remember, the price of the bonds on the date of the introduction of the Bill in December last was about 88, which means that anyone who had compensation awarded to him and who was forced to sell the bonds representing the proceeds of such compensation got only £88 for every £100 awarded.  That was a pity. Now that the Minister has produced this somewhat ingenious method of meeting the situation, I think he might seriously consider going back to the period previous to the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how many cases there would be or what amount of money would be involved.  I do not know whether there are cases where possession was taken, the appointed day fixed long before the 11th December and yet the funds have not been allocated out of the Land Commission <Col N="564" /> court.  I can see some difficulty where funds have actually been allocated, but I think that difficulty could be overcome and I think it is overcome to some extent by the provisions of sub-section (3) of this amendment, paragraph (b).  As I understand that clause, where it says &ldquo;as the justice of the case may require&rdquo;, the effect of that clause is to pass on to the Judicial Commissioner the power and the right to distribute the bonus issue between the mortagages and other encumbrancers in the appropriate portions of their mortgages.  I would frankly have preferred that that clause would be so stated in specific words.  Perhaps it is reasonably clear as to what is intended, but it would have been better if it had been specifically stated.</P>
    <P>When the Minister has dealt with this matter by way of the bonus issue rather than by way of the cancellation of the existing bonds and the issue of new bonds, he might consider favourably going back behind the 11th December and reaching those cases which suffered undue, and in many cases serious hardship by reason of the depreciation in the value of the bonds, a depreciation which occurred through no fault of the owners of the estates which were acquired and a depreciation over which the Minister himself as Minister for Lands had no jurisdiction. It was a depreciation which he could not rectify without legislation, because under the existing law he was limited to 4 per cent. level and therefore he could not bring in any new bonds that would be at or nearer to par.  I would urge the Minister to consider that point.  There is another point, but I would rather not confuse the issue by referring to it now.  The Minister might favourably consider these people who have been knocked in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this matter carefully and I have accepted the date mentioned by the Deputy in his amendment.  I do not want to place him at any disadvantage in that regard.  He took up the question here in the House of the land bonds and asked a parliamentary question on the 12th November.  I think that fixing the date with reference to legislation is <Col N="565" /> more satisfactory than fixing it by reference to circumstances outside, such as the losses to the persons concerned. It could be argued that people receiving land bonds were losing for a considerable time, but I doubt whether you could prove that that was attributable to the announcement of the National Loan.</P>

If you went back to the end of 1951 you would have 261 cases.  The Deputy will see that it would be increasing the financial liability enormously and still you could not say that every case was covered, but there is no possibility whatever of going back to the beginning of the financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we not deal with it on the basis of the National Loan?  At least we would be getting in these people whose land was acquired from the date of the positive act by the Government, if nothing else, and for the purposes of this discussion the issue of the National Loan was an acknowledgment by the Government of an existing position and the effect of the issue of that loan was surely to reduce still further the value of the Land Bonds.  I did not think there would be anything like the number of cases covered as the Minister has indicated, but surely, after the positive act by the Government in the flotation of the loan on the terms on which it was floated, there is a very strong case from that date onwards that the bonus issue should be made. I agree at once that the Minister has me at a disadvantage inasmuch as I mentioned on Second Reading the date of the passing of the Act.  I mentioned that then, because I understood the position was that pending the issue of new bonds no appointed days were being fixed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequent to the debate on the Second Reading, I found that the information <Col N="567" /> I had in that regard was wrong, that certain appointed days had been fixed and that cases were covered in which there was going to be substantial and serious hardship during November.  I had thought at one stage of putting down an amendment setting out another date, but I knew that, no matter how I might argue, any such amendment would be ruled out of order and that it would be merely a theoretical exercise, but the Minister should accept the position that the date of the issue of the National Loan was the date of a fixed governmental action and should accept that date as the operative date for this amendment rather than 11th December.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) of the section, we are providing for meeting Deputy Blowick's proposals in his Land Bill and applying the bonus concession to the amount of any increase granted on redetermination of a price after the passing of the Bill.  That is also of considerable liability and I am afraid I cannot go further than I have gone to meet the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The bonus addition will apply to those cases where there has to be a redetermination of the price under Section 7, which is the Government provision for dealing with the proposals Deputy Blowick made originally in his Bill, with regard to going back and fixing a price in certain cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then is the position that an owner who came in under Section 5 of the 1950 Act, who was properly advised by his legal advisers and made his application at the appropriate time and had the market price fixed between 1950 and the present time does not get the benefit of this provision, but that the man who did not avail himself of his rights, who was not properly advised legally, if he sought legal advice, and did not do what the 1950 Act gives him an opportunity <Col N="568" /> of doing, gets the benefit at the expense of the other man?  If that is the position, surely the Minister will agree that it does seem rather to be weighting the scales against the man who gave the Land Commission no trouble?  The Minister will agree that the people who did not make their applications under the 1950 Act are now causing a certain amount of additional trouble.  Surely those who did things in the proper way should not be penalised by comparison with those who did not?</P>

This was the section that made the bonds available.  I understood him to say that the limit had been reached and there were no further bonds there.

May I describe the issue in these two cases as being due to the fact that the decision had not yet reached the issuing point; it had been taken at top level and had not yet come down, and that that is how these two bonds escaped out of the net, by some mistake?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> Before Section 8 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Where the Land Commission have, before the passing of this Act, resumed a holding, the tenant's interest shall be deemed to have vested, discharged from the claims against such interest, in the Land Commission on the date on which they took possession of the holding, or the date on which they were authorised to resume the holding where that date was later than the date on which they took possession, and those claims shall be deemed to have on that date ceased as against the holding and become attached to the resumption price of the holding, that is to say, the compensation paid or to be paid therefor by the Land Commission, in like manner as they were attached to the holding immediately before that date.</P>
    <P>(2) Where the Land Commission have, whether before or after the passing of this Act, been authorised to resume a holding, they shall be entitled to enter upon and take possession of the holding and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the provisions of Section 19 of the Land Act, 1927, as amended by this Act, shall apply to the holding in like manner as they apply to the lands vested in the Land Commission referred to in that section, and</P>
    <P>(b)  The tenant's interest shall vest, discharged from the claims against such interest, in the Land Commission on the date on which they take possession of the holding, or the date on which they have been authorised to resume the holding where that date is later than the date on which they take possession, and those claims shall on that date cease as against the holding and become attached to the resumption price of the holding, that is to say, the compensation to be paid therefor by the Land Commission, in like manner as they were attached to the holding immediately before that date.</P>
    <P>(3)  A certificate under the common seal of the Land Commission certifying <Col N="577" /> that the tenant's interest in a specified holding vested or is deemed to have vested in the Land Commission on a specified date (being the date on which the Land Commission took possession of the holding or the date on which the Land Commission were authorised to resume the holding where that date was later than the date on which they took possession) shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the fact so certified.</P>
    <P>(4)  All powers exercisable under the Land Purchase Acts in relation to a superior interest may be exercised in relation to a claim within the meaning of this section.</P>
    <P>(5)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;holding&rdquo; includes part of a holding and, when used in the expressions &ldquo;against the holding&rdquo; and &ldquo;attached to the holding&rdquo;, includes the tenant's interest;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;tenant's interest&rdquo; includes interests of joint tenants and tenants in common;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;claims&rdquo; includes the claim of any person interested in respect of any incumbrance, annuity, rent, rent-charge or otherwise however, save that it does not include any public right, the interest of any sub-tenant or of any person having a claim upon that interest or a claim in respect of any easement, right or appurtenance mentioned in Section 34 of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1896;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;resumption price&rdquo; means resumption price whether fixed or to be fixed and, in the latter case, includes interest payable by virtue of sub-section (4) of Section 39 of the Land Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>(6)  Nothing in this section shall affect&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  sporting rights as defined in sub-section (2) of Section 13 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, fisheries appurtenant to a holding within the meaning of sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Land Act, 1929, or water rights, where such sporting rights, fisheries or water rights are not in the possession or enjoyment of the tenant at the date on which possession of the holding is <Col N="578" /> obtained by the Land Commission, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any right to water power in actual use by the tenant at the date on which possession of the holding is obtained by the Land Commission, except where such use ceased on that date, or</P>
    <P>(c)  any mine or quarry being worked or developed by the tenant or his lessee at the date on which possession of the holding is obtained by the Land Commission, or</P>
    <P>(d)  any right of mining or taking minerals or digging or searching</P>
    <P>for minerals on or under a holding, provided that this sub-section shall not apply to any stone, gravel, sand or clay.</P>
    <P>This section relates to holdings resumed from tenants as distinct from untenanted land acquired by the Land Commission and makes provision for resumed holdings similar to those already existing for untenanted land and thus fills in what we might term to be a statutory background for practices which are already followed in these resumption cases.  I am informed also that it removes a doubt as to whether a conveyance from the tenant is necessary in certain cases by providing for the automatic vesting of the tenant's interest in the Land Commission.  One would imagine that there would be no doubt about it and it seems to be a very national doubt, but our legal advisers feel that, if there is any doubt whatever, it ought to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>Consequential provision is made for the transfer of claims against that interest to the resumption price.  Sub-section (2) (a) confirms the power of the Land Commission to proceed in the same manner as in the case of untenanted land where possession of a holding which they are authorised to resume is withheld.  There are certain anomalies that may have arisen where possession has been withheld with regard to the question of interest and charges attributable to the Land Commission and the general idea is to straighten out those anomalies in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>My impression of this section is that the Land Commission are seeking rather extraordinary powers in the case of resumed holdings. While I did not quite follow the Minister's explanation I cannot imagine any type of case where the power sought in this section would be necessary for the Land Commission. Perhaps the Minister could give us an example of a case where the powers under sub-section (3) would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice up to this in regard to the transfer of a tenant's interest is that his interest is resumed. So far as I can recollect, there has never been any practice of having a conveyance.  I do not remember having come across a conveyance. The Minister will have to forgive us questioning him on this because it is the worst amendment to construe that I have ever seen.  I sat down one night to study it and threw it up in despair at the end. Surely it is possible to split the one section as it is into several sub-sections and arrive at the same result by a system of drafting that somebody could understand, because, unless there were a great number of ice packs around that one could put on his head, I do not think anybody could follow what this amendment, in fact, means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I should perhaps first say that as regards sub-section (2) (a), the provisions of Section 19 of the Land Act of 1927 shall apply to the holdings in like manner as they applied to the land vested in the Land Commission referred to in that section. As I explained last night, it was the intention that the provisions dealing with taking possession of land applicable to lands taken over and governed by the 1927 Act, Section 19, should follow in the case of these resumed holdings and so on.  That has been the practice which has been followed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the point made by Deputy Sweetman about conveyances, there has never been a conveyance as far as we know, but the lawyers feel that, in order to make the position watertight from the point of view of the securing of title, we should have <Col N="580" /> this provision which makes it clear that it will have exactly the same effect as if a conveyance were, in fact, made.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the entire section is to clear up legal and technical points of detail which arise out of the work of resuming holdings.  The resumption procedure operates where the landlord's interest has vested in the Land Commission but the holding has not yet been revested in the tenant.  The size of the property is not in question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Outside the congested districts every holding exceeding £3,000 in value is deemed to be a retained holding, or £5,000 under the 1927 Act, if it is a stud farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  I was making the point&mdash;I probably had not expressed it correctly&mdash;that we have had large and valuable resumed holdings and, of course, small ones.  The law relating to resumption goes back to 1881.  From that year until 1923 holdings were occasionally resumed by private landlords under Section 5 of the 1881 Act and also by the former Congested Districts Board.  It was only after 1923 that the Land Commission came to operate the resumption procedure.  Section 29 of the 1923 Act, Section 43 of the Land Act, 1931. Section 31 of the Land Act, 1933, and Section 39 of the Land Act, 1939, deal with resumption.  Those sections cover the procedure up to the stage of the judicial authorisation entitling the Land Commission to resume the holding. They included a very important point regarding the basis of compensation, namely, market value together with compensation for disturbance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those sections, however, did not deal sufficiently clearly with three consequential stages of resumption procedure, namely, (1) possession, (2) vesting in the Land Commission, and (3) allocation of resumption price; hence the need for Section 8.  Sub-section (1), which is intended to clear up the position as regards holdings already <Col N="581" /> resumed, provides for two points: firstly, it fixes the date of vesting in the Land Commission, which is a very essential detail; and secondly, it confirms the automatic transfer of incumbrances, mortgages and other charges from the land to the resumption price, in accordance with a long established principle going back to Section 31 of the 1896 Act.  This transfer of charges was regarded as implicit under previous Acts and resumption prices have been allocated on that basis since 1923. It is the only practical course as the land must be cleared of such charges before it can be given to allottees.  To put the point beyond question it is considered desirable to confirm the practice that has prevailed since 1923 by the explicit provisions in sub-section (1).</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) deals similarly with current and future cases.  It covers three points: paragraph (a) will enable the Land Commission to get a possession order from the Judicial Commissioner when they are obstructed in taking possession of a resumed holding. Section 19 of the 1927 Act gave that facility to the Land Commission in respect of acquired land and that Act was intended to apply to resumed holdings also.  However, the 1927 Act is not quite watertight as regards the resumed holdings and it is now proposed in paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) to put that point right.  It is an essential facility; fortunately, it has to be used only on rare occasions, but the very fact that the provision exists and can be invoked if necessary makes its use generally unnecessary.  Paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) repeats for current and future resumption cases the same two provisions as regards vesting in the Land Commission and transfer of charges which have been included in sub-section (1) for holdings already resumed and have been explained in relation to that sub-section.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) is intended to provide a convenient method of proving in court, whenever the need arises, that the tenancy in a resumed holding vested in the Land Commission on the appropriate date.  There is no form of conveyance, vesting order or final list specifying the date of vesting in respect <Col N="582" /> of a resumed holding and it is, therefore, considered desirable to provide suitable documentary evidence. The proposed certificate will be <i>prima facie</i> evidence only and there are already many precedents for this kind of certificate; for example, Section 12 (7) of the 1950 Act, Section 4 of the Land Act, 1946, and so on.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (4) was not included in the Bill as already printed and I have since been advised that it is desirable to add this sub-section by way of supplement to the provisions in sub-section (1) and sub-section (2) (b) regarding the procedure for charges transferred from the land to the resumption price.  In the allocation of purchase moneys for acquired land an allocation schedule is drawn up to set out the various superior interests and charges affecting the purchase moneys. A superior interest may affect other land as well as the acquired land.</P>
      <P>In that case it is necessary for the Judicial Commissioner to exercise his powers under Section 31 of the 1896 Act to apportion the superior interest. Similarly, the Judicial Commissioner also has power to fix the redemption price of every superior interest.  Similar powers in relation to claims against resumption price have been regarded as implicit under the 1923 and subsequent Acts, but again it is considered best to state the position definitely once and for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (5) contains definations of the terms used in the other sub-sections. It will be seen from the defination of the word &ldquo;claims&rdquo; that the position of sub-tenants and persons having claims against sub-tenants is not to be affected by Section 8. Similarly, the easements, rights and appurtenances which affect a resumed holding, for example, rights of way, turbary, and so on, are not disturbed. <Col N="583" /> I think the other definitions are reasonably self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (6) was also not included in the original print of the Bill.  Apart from stone, gravel, sand and clay which generally go as part and parcel of each holding, this sub-section is a saver, saving from the operations of Section 8 such items as sporting rights, fisheries and water rights not in the enjoyment of the tenant from whom the holding is resumed.  Special rights to water power, as well as quarries and mineral rights, which are being worked or developed, are also protected. These particular items have no great practical significance in relation to resumed holdings generally, but they may arise occasionally, and it is therefore necessary to cover the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I can visualise one type of case, arising out of the Minister's explanation.  It occurs not too often but, nevertheless, occasionally&mdash; that is, where the Land Commission resumes a holding which has become unoccupied or non-residential.  Very often we find that the owner has no intention whatever of leaving the holding derelict or non-residential and in between the date of taking possession and the date that the Land Commission made the decision to resume, or even obtained the judicial order to resume, we find the original owner coming back again and taking up residence. I should like to facilitate the Land Commission.  I know that in many cases their problem is a difficult one.  Nevertheless, in this case we are taking power just the same as was given under Section 4 of the 1946 Act that a certificate of the Land Commission can be regarded as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of taking up possession and out the person goes on the road. Apparently he has no right of appeal and no court to go to.  It does happen, particularly in the West of Ireland where there is a good deal of migratory labour, that frequently tenants of such land migrate but the fact that there is nobody residing on the land is no proof that it is their intention to leave the holding derelict.  It might be that the tenant has not a penny in his pocket to stock the holding or to carry <Col N="584" /> out any improvements on it.  These people leave the holdings for no other reason than to accumulate a certain amount of capital with which they intend to come back at some future time and perhaps buy an adjoining piece of land to relieve congestion on their holdings.  Under this section for the first time, the Land Commission is asking this House to give them the same extraordinary power that the House gave them under Section 4 of the Land Act of 1946 to deal with a totally different type of case, a case, might I say to Deputy Sweetman, with which I was fully in agreement.  At the same time I do not like the same method to be applied to the type of person about whom I am speaking. Section 4 of the Act of 1946 was intended to deal with a totally different type of person.</P>

      <P>Is it not the position, so far as this amendment is concerned, that sub-section (2) (a) is solely for the purpose of enabling the Land Commission to get an order to put the sheriff in possession and to resume the holding for the Land Commission? There is no other purpose whatever that I can find in sub-section (2) (a).  There is another point about which I am not quite clear.  In sub-section (5) the word &ldquo;claims&rdquo; is defined and it includes the claim of any person&mdash;&ldquo;person&rdquo;, of course, I understand, includes the Land Commission as a corporation sole, the Minister and the Minister for Finance&mdash;interested in respect of any incumbrance or annuity.  As I understand the position in respect of a resumed holding under Section 5 of the Land Act of 1936, the redemption value of the funding annuity, that is part of the annuity on a resumed holding, is paid out of the purchase money but the ordinary annuity is not so paid.  Does that not have the effect of transferring the ordinary annuity to the purchaser, which is not the position under the previous Act?  It seems to me that there should be something in sub-section (5) to differentiate between the funding annuity, on the one hand, which is declared to be payable out of the price by the Land Act of 1936, Section 5, and the ordinary annuity as <Col N="585" /> revised by the 1933 Act which is not so payable.  There should be some form of words in this amendment to protect that difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that this is not an ordinary annuity on a resumed holding but only an annual sum which ceases to be paid, on the date of resumption, under Section 27 of the Land Act of 1931.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I will admit at once that it is not intended to be an ordinary purchase annuity but I am not pretty sure that that is clear from the wording of the amendment itself.  If the Minister would undertake to look into the matter between now and the Report Stage I would be quite satisfied. There is another point which I want to make.  As the position stands, in the congested districts where there is a retained holding, that retained holding in certain circumstances vests in the Land Commission as if it were untenanted land.  I came across a case the other day where the Land Commission gave notice that they were going to resume such retained holding in County Galway as if it were untenanted land.  The tenant objected to the Land Commission doing so and the Land Commission, when they saw the facts, agreed to his objection.  The tenant in question wanted to object only in respect of a portion of the holding.  He agreed that the Land Commission should resume the remaining portion.  As soon as the Land Commission examined the facts of the case, without even having to go to a hearing before the commissioners, the Land Commission agreed at once that the case the tenant had made was reasonable and an order was made in Chambers by consent accepting the tenant's offer.  Notwithstanding all that there is no provision anywhere whereby the costs that were incurred by the tenant should be paid by the Land Commission.  In fact, in that particular case the tenant will be obliged to pay a sum to his legal advisers for bringing about a situation that the Land Commission agreed at once as soon as they saw it was a reasonable situation.  It may be a rather technical matter but I would <Col N="586" /> ask the Minister to consider the point between now and the next stage.  I shall give him the name of the case to which I am referring so that he can consider the exact implications of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The point was that the Land Commission are asking for powers in connection with resumed holdings, powers which may be necessary in certain types of holdings.  I have in mind, however, the type of holding I mentioned a few moments ago which the tenant has no intention of leaving derelict.  It very often happens that a person is forced by economic circumstances to leave a holding, go to either England or America and there put together a little capital for the purpose of coming back to the holding, improving it and perhaps buying another piece of land. Notice of non-residence is brought to the attention of the Land Commission and the Land Commission proceeds in the ordinary way to resume.  I am quite sure the commissioners would not like to be in the position wherein they could be charged with having deliberately forced a person out of a holding that may have been in the possession of the particular family for <Col N="587" /> generations back.  Equally, I am sure they would not like to be charged with having deliberately compelled a person to go into exile because they walked in and took over his property, irrespective of how badly the holding may be needed for the relief of congestion in the particular locality.  If I remember correctly, these powers were first introduced under the 1946 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Cases of resumption are generally heard locally and the interested parties have an opportunity of stating their case.  Where the decision is taken to take over the lands and where it may be absolutely essential to secure the resumed holding in connection with a scheme of rearrangement, I think the Deputy will agree the Land Commission ought not to be held up in this very serious and important work of rearrangement by cussedness on the part of people who will not accept the decisions given in court under all the safeguards we have under the law.</P>
      <P>We will always, of course, have hard cases.  We will have people who do not perhaps understand their rights or who do not avail themselves of them but we have given ample safeguards in the Land Acts.  Deputy Blowick in his Land Act of 1950 has in sub-section (7) of Section 12 that &ldquo; a certificate, sealed with the seal of the Minister, certifying that a power or duty for the time being vested by law (including this Act) in the Land Commission or the Lay Commissioners was exercised or performed by the Minister or by an officer authorised pursuant to this section ... shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence ...&rdquo; and so on.  When these cases are brought into court there has to be some definition of the fact that the Land Commission has, in fact, acted and the certificate is not an attempt to interfere with the rights of the other parties.  It is simply a method of certifying to the court that the Land Commission has done what it says it has done and that that should be accepted as legal evidence of its having done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite agree <Col N="588" /> with the Minister in that.  The certificate mentioned in Section 12 of the 1950 Act does not apply and would not hold water in the type of case to which I have referred.  If it did, why is it necessary now to repeat it and copper-fasten the position in this Act? The certificate mentioned in the 1950 Act deals with other powers and functions. It does not deal with resumed holdings.  The Minister says that the commissioners ought not to be thwarted when they go in to rearrange a particular townland or area by a person who, through sheer cussedness, will not give way.  That is all right. I am not thinking of that particular type of case at all.  I am thinking of the other type of case where a person is forced through economic circumstances to leave a small holding.</P>
      <P>It may appear that the Land Commission will not reach the particular area to rearrange or improve it for many years to come and it would not be proper to expect a healthy man or woman to waste time on a small scrap of land like that.  It is only right that such a person would have an opportunity of getting together some capital to improve that holding.  In such a case the Land Commission, even though a hearing may have taken place in court, can decide to resume the holding if this particular amendment becomes law.  By a sealed certificate they can within one month heave the tenant out and compel him or her to perpetual exile.  I do not believe the commissioners would do that.  I do not think they would like to be charged with having done such a thing and for that reason I think this amendment should be softened down or eased in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has argued that they must get a particular holding in a particular town land for purposes of rearrangement. This is a completely new departure.  The commissioners have been charged in many cases with being harsh, with being slow, with neglecting the relief of congestion but I do not think they would seek the powers we propose to give them here.  There is always a safety valve.  Another tenant can be migrated to some other area.  I do not approve of this amendment. Such a certificate was necessary <Col N="589" /> in the cases envisaged in the 1946 Act.  The certificate under Section 12 of the 1950 Act does not apply.  This is tantamount to introducing a sledgehammer provision for the use of the commissioners.  If wrongly used injustice will be caused.  I can see no necessity for it.  The general complaint against the commissioners is that they are too slow in resuming or acquiring land for the relief of congestion and in getting on with the work.  It is a big jump from that situation to give them powers now to take up or resume a holding belonging to a person who has no intention whatsoever of leaving the holding permanently and has merely left it temporarily to get a little capital together in order to return and improve the holding.  I would be very slow to give the commissioners the power sought in this particular provision. If the Minister promises to reconsider the matter between this and the Report Stage I will be satisfied. I can conceive instances in which the commissioners would need such a power but I would be very slow to give them the full power contained in this new section without adequate safeguards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>This sub-section (3) does not give the Land Commission any additional powers in relation to resumption. The position that it envisages only arises when resumption proceedings have been completed.  The Land Commission has to go into court and produce evidence that the resumed holding vested in the Land Commission on the appropriate date.  This certificate, which is referred to here, will merely be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the fact that the tenant's interest in the land is vested in the Land Commission. It will not be conclusive evidence.  I think that, in the first place, the Deputy has not given consideration to that fact that the matter only arises when the resumption proceedings are completely ended.  In the second place, the certificate is only <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the Land Commission have this interest vasted.  Even at that stage a person who Deputy Blowick feels may be wrongfully treated can still go to the court.  The certificate is no more or no less than what it is stated <Col N="590" /> to be, that is, merely <i>prima facie</i> evidence.</P>
      <P>I do not think that I should go into-the merits of a particular case.  It is not intended that this should deal with rearrangement particularly.  I think that cases may arise where rearrangement may depend on the speedy settlement of these cases.  I am not saying that these people have not their rights and that they should not be given full weight to but I think I should say, however, although I do not think it is really relevant, that we can have a case of a person who has not seen the holding for 40 years and still sets up a claim.  The Land Commission have to clear up the situation with regard to the title of the person before they can get that land, small though it may be.</P>
      <P>We are not interfering with this person's rights in any way.  I am quoting that as an example of the other type of case where we can be held up. I presume we will be held up no matter what we may do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quoting an extreme case where the owner has been absent for a period of 40 years.  I am entirely in agreement with the Minister there or even if he mentioned a much shorter period than that.  It has occurred occasionally that the Land Commission moved in in regard to a holding from which the owner had gone only one year or two years.  It is quite a common thing&mdash; let me say that I do not like this trend &mdash;to have people approaching T.D.s, Land Commission officials, priests and others, saying: &ldquo;If I go to England in the spring, summer or for the harvest will the Land Commission take the holding when I am gone?&rdquo; That is the type of case I have mind.  The Minister says that this certificate is only <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the Land Commission have proceeded so far, but I think it goes a little bit further than that.  If the Minister assures me that the certificate which the commissioners can issue under this section, if it becomes law, is merely a certificate of evidence that they have made a decision to resume the holding, I would be prepared to let the amendment pass.  If, however, it is a <Col N="591" /> certificate giving the Land Commission the same powers as they have under a section of the 1946 Act, I cannot see my way to agree to it.  It is replacing the type of tenant who welched on his agreement with the Land Commission to work a holding prior to 1946.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to say that what the Land Commission have been doing would ever have been challenged, but experience has shown that if there is any way of challenging them they will be challenged and, as the Deputy knows, the work of rearrangement, from the legal side, has not been brought up to date.  I am informed that this amendment is necessary.  There is an example given here which is really amusing.  Suppose that a rearrangement involves the exchange of part of A's registered holding for part of B's registered holding, then strictly, the Land Commission cannot obtain a transfer and become registered owners of the part of A's holding which they require unless they first become registered owners of the part of B's holding, and at the same time they cannot obtain a transfer and become registered owners of the part of B's holding unless they first become registered owners of the part of A's holding.  The rearrangement of 30 registered holdings in the County Roscommon, carried out on the ground nearly 20 years ago, has yet to be legally completed.</P>

If the allottee persistently refuses to sign the deed of transfer from the Land Commission to him, there is no procedure for the completion of the transfer, and so, in order to carry out these rearrangement schemes and to make them legally watertight, it is considered that we should validate this principle of what they call multiple transfers so that they can all be effected simultaneously under the vesting order procedure.</P>

      <P>Before Section 14 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In addition to the persons referred to in sub-section (4) of Section 54 of the Land Act, 1939, that section shall also apply to every person who is&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  The tenant of a holding comprised in a list of vested holdings published under Section 9 of the Land Act, 1931, or deemed to have been comprised in a list of congested districts holdings by virtue of Section 12 of this Act, or the tenant of a retained holding, or</P>
      <P>(b)  the owner or occupier of a parcel of untenanted land the subject matter of an application under Section 44 of the Land Act, 1931, or Section 37 of the Land Act, 1936, or under either of those sections as amended or extended by any enactment.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Land Commission shall be entitled to revoke or cancel the appointment of an administrator or the nomination of any person to represent a person dead, absent or under a disability made (whether before or after the passing of this Act) by the Land Commission and, from time to time as occasion may require, to appoint or nominate under Section 54 of the Land Act, 1939, some other person in lieu of any person appointed or nominated by the Land Commission who has died or whose appointment or nomination is revoked or cancelled by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  No nomination shall be made after the passing of this Act under Section 67 of the Land Act, 1923, and no appointment shall be made after such passing under sub-section <Col N="597" /> (11) of Section 42 of the Land Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>(4)  It is hereby declared that any person appointed as administrator or nominated to represent a person dead, absent or under a disability by the Land Commission (whether so appointed or nominated before or after the passing of this Act) has and always had full power to transfer or otherwise deal with, for the purposes of proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts (including this Act), land registered under the Registration of Title Acts, 1891 and 1942, notwithstanding anything contained in those Acts.</P>
    <P>This section codifies and clarifies the law in relation to administrators appointed and representatives nominated by the Land Commission for the purposes of proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts.  The effect of sub-sections (1) and (3) is that all future appointments and nominations will be made under one section, Section 54 of the Land Act of 1939.  They are being made at present under two other sections, and it is considered that it would be an improvement in every respect to have them dealt with under one section.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) provides for revocation and cancellation of appointments and nominations, and sub-section (4) declares that such administrators and representatives have full power to transfer and otherwise deal with registered land, but only for the purposes of proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts.</P>

      <P>In that case there is just one point that I want to make.

It is clearly a very desirable procedure and one which might be slightly extended even <Col N="598" /> under the Registration of Title Acts to cover smaller cases.  I am not, however, a bit happy about the wording of sub-section (4) as it is here.  It will enable the Minister to carry into effect what he has been doing and what, I understand, has been the practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It brings in the same point.  The position under the Land Purchase Acts, as I can find it in the land purchase code, is that once the Land Commission have made an order by <i>fiat</i> or otherwise revesting in the tenant land which is tenanted land or is an allotment under the 1923 and subsequent Acts, then I think that the proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts have finished and are spent.</P>
      <P>One may take as an example a case of this kind.  &ldquo;A&rdquo; is appointed a limited administrator of a deceased allottee.  The holding is vested in her or in him as such limited administrator. The vesting order then travels along to the Land Registry and he becomes registered in the Land Registry as such limited administrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (4) purports to give the Registrar of the Land Registry power to accept a transfer by her on sale of the holding thereafter, the holding having in the interval become the subject of a Land Registry folio, and so on.  I understand that it has been the practice in the Land Registry&mdash; recently only&mdash;to accept that a limited administrator has such a power. According to my experience, up to recently the Land Registry and the Land Commissioners were at loggerheads and did not agree as to the <Col N="599" /> powers of limited administrators. Recently that difficulty has been resolved and I imagine it has been resolved because of the knowledge that they had of the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister wishes&mdash;and I am with him in this&mdash; that where a person has been appointed a limited administrator and the vesting has been completed and that person is vested as the owner on the folio, such person will thereafter still have the right to deal with the holding in his possession as limited administrator.  One of the tragedies that many of us come into contact with so often is that there are small holdings throughout the country registered under the 1891 Act in respect of which no effort has been made to put the title right for years.  If somebody wants to build a house on such a holding or to get a housing grant or a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, the cost is so prohibitive as to make it not worth while.  We should all like to see some method of dealing with such cases by means of a limited administrator, such as is provided here. That, of course, would be outside the ambit of this Bill but I should like to say that I would be in favour of the administratorship procedure.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how you can say that the Land Purchase Acts are still in operation once you have completed the business of the Land Purchase Act by the final revesting in the tenant. I know of a case at the moment.  It has been accepted by the Land Registry.  They have dealt with the holding by a limited administrator simply and solely because they felt that the Land Commission had undertaken that this section was going to be brought in.  I do not think it is right, as drafted, and I do not think it provides what the Minister requires. I think that if it is left as it is the only thing that will happen is that sooner or later somebody will go along to the Supreme Court and get the transfer by a limited administrator set aside. It will involve the unfortunate persons in a great deal of unnecessary costs which we could eliminate quite easily <Col N="600" /> by redrafting the section in a simple manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We are simply carrying on the procedure and the law in this matter, as laid down in previous Acts. As I have said, we are simply seeking uniformity of procedure for administrative purposes.  We are establishing beyond doubt that the Land Registry may accept dealings by limited administrators and nominated representatives with registered land for the purpose of land purchase proceedings.  We cannot, of course, agree that in this measure we should eliminate the words &ldquo;for the purposes of proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts.&rdquo;  I do not know what that would involve. Probably Deputy Sweetman's view is worthy of consideration and examination but, as he himself has more or less admitted, it is not quite the place to deal with that general situation here.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should begin by saying that this section does not relate to the collection of moneys due to the Land Commission which is governed by Section 28 of the Land Act, 1933.  Sub-sections (1) and (2) relate solely to cases such as those in which landlords bring tenants or tenants bring landlords before the Land Commission.  In these cases&mdash;which are not now very frequent&mdash;the commissioners are empowered by Section 17 of the Land Act, 1939, to award the costs of one party against the other party, so that a party to whom costs are awarded may have full power to recover them.  The section goes on to provide that the commissioners may, on the application of that party, issue an order for the levying of the amount of the costs for execution by the under-sheriff.  Such orders have been very rare.  The section has, however, been found deficient in so far as it does not specify&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that the under-sheriff may levy his fees and expenses of execution, or that an order may be made for the levying of an unpaid balance of costs as distinct from the entire costs, or that the word &lsquo;under-sheriff&rsquo; includes &lsquo;county registrar&rsquo; where appropriate.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>(a)  in those sub-sections any reference to owners in common shall include a reference to the said two or more persons and any reference to a holding to which the said Section 24 applies shall include a reference to the said right or rights, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  unless the person who appears to the Land Commission to be the owner of the said land is a consenting party to a scheme in respect of the said right or rights, the Land Commission shall serve <Col N="604" /> on him, if it is reasonably practicable to ascertain that person, a notice stating the particulars of such scheme and the manner in which and the time within which he may object thereto and paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of sub-section (4) of the said Section 24 shall apply in respect of his objection (if any), and</P>
    <P>(c)  an Order made under the said Section 24 confirming a scheme in respect of the said right or rights shall operate to entitle each of the said two or more persons to such right or rights only in relation to the part or parts of the said land specified in respect of him in such scheme (subject to the terms and conditions stated in such scheme).</P>
    <P>(2)  Section 25 of the Land Act, 1950, is hereby amended by the insertion in paragraph (b) of &ldquo;such land or any part thereof is&rdquo; before &ldquo;purchased&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>(3)  Sub-section (2) of this section shall be deemed to have come into operation on the passing of the Land Act, 1950.</P>
    <P>(4)  A copy of an Order made under Section 24 of the Land Act, 1939, shall, where any registered land is affected by the Order, be transmitted to the registering authority under the Registration of Title Acts, 1891 and 1942, and, on receipt thereof, the said registering authority shall cause the appropriate particulars to be registered under those Acts.</P>
    <P>(5)  No fee shall be payable in respect of any proceedings in the Land Registry under sub-section (4) of this section.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Land Act, 1939, as amended by Section 25 of the Land Act, 1950, lays down procedure for the partition of commonages among the persons who own them in undivided shares; it does not apply to another type of commonage which, although similar from a practical point of view, is quite different in law, that is, where the users are entitled to rights&mdash;usually rights of grazing&mdash;and the land is <Col N="605" /> owned by a single individual subject to those rights.</P>
    <P>The object of sub-section (1) of this new section is to enable procedure on the lines of that for the partition of undivided shares to be applied in the case of rights.  The owner of the land would be entitled to object to a scheme for the partition of rights.  On confirmation of such a scheme each person's right would be exercisable over a defined area.</P>
    <P>Sub-sections (2) and (3) make a minor verbal amendment in Section 25 of the Land Act, 1950, with retrospective effect.</P>
    <P>Sub-sections (4) and (5) provide for the registration of appropriate particulars where registered land is affected by an Order confirming a partition scheme.</P>
    <P>This has been found necessary also in order to enable us to speed up acquisition of those rights of commonage for forestry acquisition cases.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Schedule be the Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Under one of the earlier sections in the Bill as amended by the amendments, we are now getting new land bond interest rates for the bonds.  As I understand it, it is in the Schedule that the rates for the annuity follow the rates of interest on the bonds.  This is the point which I think Deputy Blowick was anxious to introduce after Section 2 had passed.  It is clear that while the Minister for Finance has the right to determine what the rate of annuity will be, he must determine the rate of the annuity by reference to the rate of the land bonds in operation at the time at which the land was acquired; or is he entitled discretionally to vary the rate of annuity, notwithstanding the provisions that there are in the Schedule to the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The annuity rate is fixed by the Land Bond Order creating each series of land bonds and is the sum of the rates of interest and sinking fund payable into the Land Bond Fund in respect of bonds of the series.  Thus the rate of 4¾ per cent. related to the latest issue of land bonds is made up of 4 per cent. interest and ¾ per cent. sinking fund.  Any higher annuity rate that may be fixed by a future Land Bond Order will, of course, apply only to lands purchased by means of bonds created by that Order.  The existing law limiting the liability of tenant-purchasers to 50 per cent. of ordinary annuity payments will continue to apply to future cases as well as to cases already dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The objects of this Bill are threefold.  They are, first, to authorise an increase to £14,000,000 in the present statutory limit of repayable advances which may be made to Bord na Móna from the Central Fund for the purposes of carrying out the two development programmes which it has undertaken. The present statutory limit is £8,270,000; secondly, to make additional provision for the board's housing schemes; and, thirdly, to effect certain changes of an organisational character consequential on the now accepted permanency of the board's operations.  These changes include the making of superannuation schemes for the permanent staff of the board and its whole-time members, and to provide for the making of a contract of service with the managing director of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies, I think, are aware that Bord na Móna was authorised to proceed with two development programmes, each designed towards the annual production at the end of a ten year development period of 1,000,000 tons of machined turf.  Provision was made in the two earlier Acts to finance the board's activities during the development periods by means of repayable advances from the Central Fund.  The amount authorised under these Acts was intended to cover the full development of the first programme but only the preliminary development of the second.  The financial provisions in the earlier Acts were, however, <Col N="610" /> based upon estimates made in 1947 and increases in the cost of labour and materials and increased mechanisation of production which had led to the introduction of machines, not contemplated when the 1947 estimate was being prepared, have necessitated a further revision of the estimated cost of the first development programme, and it is proposed under this Bill to provide an additional £1,480,000, thus making a total of £7,000,000, for that programme, which should be sufficient to complete it.  It is proposed also to bring the total amount available for the second programme up to £7,000,000 by the additional provision of £4,250,000.  It is, however, now proposed that the output of the second development programme will be about 2,500,000 tons of milled peat instead of 1,000,000 tons of sod turf and it will be necessary at a later date to make further provision for that second programme.</P>
    <P>As regards the housing provisions of the Bill, the board has been authorised to construct houses for its workers. The Turf Development Act, 1950, provided for the financing of the board's schemes by free grants out of voted moneys and repayable advances from the Central Fund.  It was intended that the free grant of £180 per house which was authorised under the 1950 Act would be supplemented by similar grants of £400 per house from the Transition Development Fund.  That fund was, however, as Deputies opposite will remember, wound up on the 31st March, 1951, before Bord na Móna was in a position to avail of its provisions. It was always intended that the board should receive the same assistance as was available to housing authorities in rural areas and it is, therefore, proposed under this Bill to increase the amount of the grant to £570 per house, which is equivalent to the grant now provided from State funds to rural housing authorities.</P>
    <P>The aggregate amount of £420,000 which it is now proposed to make available by way of grant is sufficient to cover the board's housing programme up to date and for the next few years. The balance of the cost of the houses is met by repayable advances from the <Col N="611" /> Central Fund.  The existing provision for repayable advances is adequate for the board's housing programme for the next few years.</P>
    <P>The Turf Development Act, 1946, under which Bord na Móna was constituted, provides for the appointment by the Government of members of the board, including the managing director, for such period not exceeding five years as may be fixed by the Government. The present managing director of Bord na Móna holds a permanent post as a principal officer in the Department of Industry and Commerce but he has been seconded almost continuously since 1934 for whole-time work with the Turf Development Board and later with Bord na Móna and it is felt that the time has come to regularise that position.  The Bill, therefore, provides that the Minister for Industry and Commerce may, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and the approval of the Government, enter into a contract of service with the managing director for such period not exceeding five years as may be determined. The provision in this Bill is similar to that which was made in the Industrial Development Authority Act, 1950, by which that authority was constituted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also proposed to make provision whereby the Minister for Industry and Commerce may prepare a scheme for the payment of superannuation benefits on retirement to whole-time members of the board. Each scheme will be subject to the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and the Dáil will have an opportunity of approving or rejecting any such scheme which is laid before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is also being made for the establishment of superannuation schemes on a contributory basis for the permanent employees of the board, for the setting up of superannuation funds <Col N="612" /> and for their administration and management and for machinery for the settlement of disputes arising out of these schemes.  The establishment now of such schemes may be regarded as an indication that the policy of developing and utilising the country's peat resources is of a long-term nature which will be consistently pursued, irrespective of whatever Government may be in power.  The assurance of permanence and of security for the future which these schemes will provide for the board's staff should help to ensure the continuance of that spirit of service and co-operation which is so essential to the success of the pioneer work which the board has undertaken.</P>
    <P>Investigation of the cost and the nature of the proposed schemes has not yet been completed but it is intended that they should be on the same general lines as those which already exist for the staffs of other State-aided bodies.  These schemes will also be submitted to the Dáil and the Dáil will be given an opportunity of approving or rejecting them.</P>
    <P>A provision has been included which empowers the trustees of superannuation funds which may be set up to lend moneys to the board and for the board to borrow from such funds, if it so desires, for its general purposes. That provision is purely permissive and is in fact on the same lines as the provisions in the E.S.B.  Superannuation Act, 1942.  I might mention that in the case of the fund set up under that Act the E.S.B. and the trustees of the fund have found that the existence of such a power is mutually advantageous.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill affords a suitable opportunity for reviewing briefly what Bord na Móna has already acheieved and, indeed, an opportunity of paying a well deserved tribute to the success of its operations as well as of giving an outline of what it is hoped to achieve with the assistance of the additional moneys which this Bill will make available to the board.</P>
    <P>The first development programme of Bord na Móna was set out in the White Paper which was published in 1946 and that programme was designed to <Col N="613" /> achieve the development of 24 bogs with a view to obtaining an annual output of 1,000,000 tons of machine-won turf per year by 1956, together with an annual output of 20,000 tons of briquettes from the briquetting plant at Lullymore.  By last year, 1952, the output of machine turf and briquettes had reached 568,000 tons.  Of the 24 bogs referred to in that 1946 White Paper, 20 have now reached the production stage.  Three of the remaining four are in Offaly.  They were originally intended for the production of machine turf but are now being developed for the production of milled peat for use in an electricity generating station.</P>
    <P>The 1946 White Paper estimated production of briquettes at Lullymore at 20,000 tons per year.  Production during the year now ended, the year ended on the 31st March, 1953, was almost 30,000 tons and it is proposed to increase the output of milled peat at Lullymore so that up to 35,000 tons may be produced when certain further improvements have been made in the factory there.</P>
    <P>The board have for some time been investigating alternative methods of drying milled peat for briquette production. A system of fluidised drying which was developed experimentally by the United States Bureau of Mines is at present under consideration by the board and limited tests of the process have already been carried out in the United States by the United States Bureau under a technical assistance project.  The system appears to offer considerable advantages in simpler operation, higher efficiency of drying and much smaller capital cost but it has not yet been brought to the commercial stage.  The board hope to arrange for the visit of an American expert from the bureau of mines to this country during the present year to see the Lullymore factory and to discuss the erection of a suitable fluidised drying pilot plant there.</P>
    <P>The 1946 White Paper also estimated the output from the Kilberry peat moss factory at 50,000 bales per annum but that output has been considerably exceeded during each of the past four years.  Annual production has averaged 70,000 bales, of which 75 per cent. has <Col N="614" /> been exported.  Over two-thirds of these exports have been sold in the dollar market and represent a not inconsiderable addition to our dollar earnings.</P>
    <P>In the last few years, however, competition from continental countries in dollar markets has become very intensive and it has become increasingly difficult to secure an economic price there.  Exports were continued for a period with a view to retaining a hold on these markets although this involved heavy losses and contributed appreciably to the deficit on the operation of the works.  There has, however, been an increasing demand for this peat moss in the home market and in Britain and the Six Counties.  Prospects in these areas are good and both output and sales for the current year are likely to show a further increase Should it be necessary, an annual output of 150,000 bales can be achieved with very little addition to existing plant.</P>
    <P>It is now estimated that in 1956, the original target date, production under the first programme will amount to 712,000 tons of machine-won turf together with 280,000 tons of milled peat and 35,000 tons of briquettes. Production of peat moss in that year will depend largely on the demand for the product but present prospects are encouraging and it is hoped at least to maintain the present rate of output and possibly to increase it.  Of the machined turf, at least 390,000 tons will be required for the existing turf-fired electricity generating stations at Portarlington and Allenwood and a further 90,000 tons for a station to be erected near Lanesboro'.  The balance, together with the briquettes, will be available for commercial sale.  The 280,000 tons of milled peat from the Boora area will be used in the proposed turf-fired station near Ferbane which is expected to come into partial operation in 1956 and which will be expanded according as further supplies of milled peat become available from other bogs in the area under the board's second development programme.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report that the financial results of the board's operations have been equally encouraging. <Col N="615" /> The board is entering on a profit-making period.  There is still a debit balance amounting to £30,211 on the profit and loss account, at least there was that debit balance shown in the accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1952, but it is anticipated that the accounts for the year ended 31st March last will show a further reduction in this deficit.  The board has discharged all its financial obligations to the State as well as making reasonable provision for depreciation of its assets.  The obligations which had to be met by the board were mainly those which had been incurred by its predecessor, the Turf Development Board, Limited, and for which Bord na Móna was required to assume liability under the provisions of the 1946 Act.  These liabilities included the repayable advances which the Turf Development Board received from the Exchequer for the development of various bogs.  The net liability assumed by the board in respect of these repayable advances was £434,561, of which £358,742 represented capital advances and the balance interest.  By the 1st April, 1952, the capital sum outstanding had been reduced to £261,713. That sum has now been funded and will be repaid by a half-yearly annuity of £9,227 10s. 0d. over 25 years.  The first instalment was paid on 1st October, 1952.</P>
    <P>The exemption from interest charges on advances for the first development programme made prior to 21st June, 1951, which the board enjoyed under the earlier legislation, is no longer in operation and the board has become liable for the payment of interest on these advances from 1st October, 1952.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>How much did that amount to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give you that figure.  The interest on advances made up to 21st June, 1951, was fixed at 2½ per cent. per annum and the rate of interest payable on any advance made since that date is the rate that was current when the advance was made. The interest paid to date amounts to £109,042.  When regard is had to the many difficulties which the board has experienced because of the novel and <Col N="616" /> difficult nature of the work, the unavoidable delays in securing plant and machinery and the constant rise in the level of production costs, I think Deputies will agree that the board's management of its financial affairs has been as satisfactory as its production achievements.  Now that all first programme advances are liable to interest, the board's financial obligations will be much heavier than heretofore and, may I say, will represent a substantial annual contribution to the Exchequer.  It is estimated that in the year ending 31st March next payments to the Exchequer by the board will amount to at least £184,000 and of course will show a progressive increase in each year thereafter.</P>
      <P>In the board's second development programme, for which an additional provision of £4,250,000 is included in this Bill, 13 bogs are at present scheduled for development, but other bogs may be included in the programme later.  The greater part of the output of this second programme will be in the form of milled peat for use in electricity generating stations.  It is hoped to achieve full production of 2,250,000 tons by 1960.  The original target was 1,000,000 tons of sod turf, but the decision to change over to milled peat has necessitated its revision.  Part of the output will be available from 1956 onwards for use in the generating stations which will be coming into commission gradually during these years.</P>
      <P>In addition to milled peat, machined turf output from the second production programme bogs is estimated to reach 162,000 tons by 1960, but part of this output will be available from 1955 onwards. By 1960 therefore, when the board's second programme bogs are expected to be in full production, the total output from all the board's bogs will be as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Machined turf, 874,000 tons, of which at least 390,000 tons will be used in the generating stations at Portarlington, Allenwood and Lanesboro'; milled peat, 2,500,000 tons, all of which will be used in electricity generating stations to be erected at Derrynagreenagh, Bangor Erris and Oweninny, Gowlan <Col N="617" /> and Ferbane; 35,000 tons of briquettes per annum and 100,000 to 150,000 bales of peat moss per annum at Kilberry.</P>
    <P>As regards the housing programme, considerable progress has been made in the provision of houses for the board's employees.  Already 366 houses have been completed.  As a matter of interest, I may mention that the board has received nearly 600 applications for tenancies from persons not employed by them.  It is the board's policy, however, to grant tenancies only to actual employees and applicants for houses must become employees of the board before they are considered for tenancies. At present, 104 houses are under construction and further building will be undertaken according as the need arises.  The amount of employment afforded by the board is, of course, considerable and will become larger when full production is attained under the two development programmes. The board is actively recruiting workers at present and is in a position to offer employment to an additional 500 or 600 workers.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that in the board's second development programme, the main emphasis is on the winning of turf in the form of milled peat for use in generating stations.  The decision to concentrate on milled peat was taken in the light of the many advantages which that form of production offers as compared with sod peat.  Its winning lends itself more easily to mechanisation; less manual labour is required and it is cheaper to produce per calorie than so turf; it can be burned at a higher moisture content; the necessary preliminary development work in the bogs is less elaborate and can be done more quickly.  Over all, it is cheaper and more easily produced fuel than sod turf.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that the increase in the E.S.B.'s generating plant which will be required for the next ten years to meet the increase in demand for electricity will be based to the greatest possible extent on the utilisation of our water and peat resources.  Our available water resources, however, when fully generated, will, it is estimated, <Col N="618" /> provide only about 1,000,000,000 units of electricity annually, which is less than our present consumption.  That output must therefore be supplemented by steam stations.  It has been decided that these steam stations will be designed to use turf as a fuel and that further steam stations using imported fuels will be constructed only when the native water and peat resources have been fully exploited.</P>
    <P>In connection with the turf-fired station arrangements, a very close liason is being maintained between Bord na Móna and the E.S.B., and a joint technical committee consisting of representatives of both boards has been established.  That committee discusses matters of common interest with a view to co-ordinating their activities.</P>
    <P>The plans of the E.S.B. for the provision of additional generating capacity will come before the House in greater detail in connection with a Bill which will shortly be introduced. For the moment I think it is sufficient to say that of the total installed capacity which the E.S.B. expect to have by 1961, two-fifths will be in turf-fired stations.  Deputies may be interested to learn of the success which has attended the operations of the two existing turf-fired stations since they were brought into commission.  The Portarlington station, which was designed to produce annually approximately 90,000,000 units of electricity from 120,000 tons of turf, actually produced 164,000,000 units from 200,000 tons of turf in the year ended 31st March last.  The Allenwood station has not yet been in full production for a complete year, as the second set at that station came into commission only at the end of September, 1952.  It was designed to produce annually 135,000,000 units of electricity from 180,000 tons of turf; in the year ended 31st March last it produced over 158,000,000 units from 193,000 tons of turf.</P>
    <P>These achievements should dispose of any doubts which may still be entertained regarding the practicability of using turf for electricity generation. They also show that in abnormally dry years, such as we experienced in 1952, <Col N="619" /> or when other types of fuel cannot be easily obtained, turf-fired stations are just as capable of coping with the demand as are coal or oil-fired stations.  In fact, it has now become the practice, in the case of the steam stations, to give the maximum possible load to those which are turf-fired, leaving the balance to be taken by the coal and oil stations.</P>
    <P>Although not strictly relevant to the present Bill, I think some mention should be made of Bord na Móna's experimental station at Droichead Nua in County Kildare.  The station deals with the investigation of problems connected with the production and the utilisation of turf, and close contact is maintained with developments in the turf industry in other countries.  A great deal of attention has been devoted to the mechanisation of development and of production operations and considerable economics in manpower requirements have been secured as a result of the work at the station.  For instance, drainage operations have been almost completely mechanised. The work is constantly proceeding on the design and construction of experimental machines of various types to cope with the problems which are experienced in the board's bogs.  Particular attention has been devoted to methods of securing the most economic and efficient utilisation of turf for domestic heating and for industrial power purposes.  It is worth while mentioning that considerable results have been achieved in both these fields. A number of Irish manufacturers have, as a result of co-operation with the board, succeeded in producing domestic turf-burning appliances which are not only highly efficient but which are also attractive in design and finish.</P>
    <P>Recently the station has designed a special method of burning turf in industrial installations and several factories have adopted it.  This method which the board has devised not only secures a high degree of combustion efficiency but also a saving in costs as compared with installations using coal or oil. The position in which Irish industries in country areas were handicapped by high fuel costs has now been completely <Col N="620" /> reversed.  So far as fuel costs are concerned, the location of an industry in a turf area is now a very definite commercial advantage.  That is an achievement on which the board and the staff deserve to be congratulated. I may say that the services of the board's staff are always available and will be very gladly offered to any industrial user who requires advice and assistance on any problems connected with the handling and utilisation of turf.</P>
    <P>Since the systematic and scientific development of our turf resources was commenced, experience has shown that the most economic method of using turf on a large scale is in electricity generating stations.  The details which I have given in regard to the operations of our existing turf-fired stations support that view. Large-scale development has other obvious advantages.  It is desirable from the point of view of national security and it provides opportunities for employment in areas in which employment is normally difficult to provide. The erection of power stations in the more remote and undeveloped areas should facilitate the extension to those areas of rural electrification and should also provide an incentive for the establishment of industries in those areas.  That in turn should help An Foras Tionscal in carrying out work which was entrusted to it under the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
    <P>Finally, if we could succeed in effecting a reduction in our need for imported fuel by providing a greater proportion of our energy requirements from native sources, it would help considerably to redress our adverse balance of trade.</P>
    <P>I have stressed that the services of Bord na Móna's technical staff are freely available to industrialists requiring advice and assistance in the handling and burning of turf.  I am unable to understand the persistence of the tendency among some industries and institutions in the turf burning areas which formerly depended on turf, to change over to installations using imported fuel.  Many of these industries owe their existence to facilities granted to them by the State and it is not <Col N="621" /> unreasonable to expect that in return they should co-operate in the policy of utilising our native resources as much as possible.  It was stated in the 1946 White Paper that assistance to industries located in areas where the use of turf fuel was economic would be conditional upon that fuel being used and I have recently had to refuse to consider applications for protection, by way of tariff or for the amendment of existing tariffs, from concerns which had not considered the utilisation of turf as fuel or had changed over from turf to fuel oil.  In each case the firm concerned, on having its attention directed to the availability of an efficient fuel locally and to the methods by which that fuel could be used economically, found that they could turn back to turf with a saving in costs.  Every consideration of self-interest and national security demands that we should develop and utilise our turf fuel resources and in that work it is expected that we shall have the co-operation of industrial undertakings and of public authorities responsible for the control of institutions, particularly in the turf areas.  Bord na Móna has been entrusted with the development of our turf resources and the success which has been achieved in its operation so far gives every reason to hope that it will make a considerable contribution towards supplying the requirements of fuel and power from our own resources.  As that is an objective of national policy which is universally accepted, I recommend the Bill to the House confident that it will secure approval here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that I welcome this Bill.  I think I can also say that the House has listened with pleasure to the survey which the Minister has made of the satisfactory advances which have been made by Bord na Móna over the years. The Bill seeks as the Minister said, firstly, to give power to make very substantial financial provision for the carrying out of the schemes laid down by the board.  It also provides for further financial provision for the erection of additional houses for those employed by the board.  It provides further for the regularisation if I <Col N="622" /> might so term it, of the position of the managing director.  I think that provision is not before its time.  It was quite wrong, in my opinion, that the chief officer of this national undertaking should have had to continue over a period of nearly 20 years merely as a seconded officer from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The Bill also provides for a superannuation scheme for the board, the staff and the employees.  I think all of us will welcome these provisions.</P>
      <P>I should like, with the Minister, to pay my tribute to those who are, and who have been, responsible for the satisfactory development, organisation and utilisation of the fuel resources of the country.  I agree entirely with the Minister that this is a national project, that it is a permanent structure, and that it is not going to be influenced by any change of Government. May I say here and now that I at any rate would like to see a national organisation, such as this is, removed entirely, or as far as it can possibly be removed from Party politics or from the possibility of one Party or one set of individuals trying to utilise it to get some particular credit for themselves.  We should have passed that stage.  I think we have been fortunate in the organisation that we have in Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I am going too far in saying that we were fortunate in the personnel we had there because I think those on whom the responsibility fell for being the main driving force in that organisation were themselves keenly interested in the development of turf and it was not just merely a job to them.  At the same time I think we should be quite conscious of one fact. I suppose it is a good thing that out of evil circumstances good sometimes does come.  I think we were helped very considerably rather than hindered by the war situation.  There is no doubt at all about that but perhaps the most revolutionary change which has taken place, a change which will enable the board enormously to expand its activities, was the perfection of the milled peat scheme.  I want to say for the last time, apropos of what I said a moment ago, that when Deputies state, as some Deputies like to <Col N="623" /> state: &ldquo;We developed the bogs in Mayo and elsewhere; nobody else had anything whatever to do with it,&rdquo; let it be clear that these huge bog areas in Mayo could not possibly have been developed for the generation of electricity if we were not able to do it through the milled peat process.  They could not possibly have been developed with the sod turf process.  Having said that, I shall never return to the matter again.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister did not even think it necessary to say that the milled peat process has now been proven to be entirely satisfactory&mdash;I mean that it is entirely removed from the experimental stage, that it is accepted as a sound commercial proposition and that not merely does it involve the development of enormous stretches of bog, particularly in areas where we are anxious to give employment, but it enables us to do it more economically than we could do it and are doing it under the sod turf process.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of this matter that does give some little concern but to some extent what the Minister said with regard to his policy in relation to the use of turf by industry has lessened my concern.  As far as I understand the Minister, the ultimate aim is somewhere about 850,000 tons of sod turf, of which approximately half will be utilised for the generation of electricity, leaving us with roughly 500,000 tons to be disposed of for domestic or industrial use.  That causes me some little concern as to whether or not we will be able to dispose of 500,000 tons of turf produced by Bord na Móna in addition to the 3,000,000 or 3,250,000 approximately that is supposed to be produced by the private producers.  That is an important matter and that again will, of course, to a large extent be determined on the question of quality and competitive prices at the time.  In relation to that, I think our dependence will have to be in the main on the continued good work that is being done and has been done by the experimental station at New-bridge.</P>
    <P>When this Bill becomes law provision <Col N="624" /> will have to be made to a maximum of £14,000,000.  I would like to emphasise, if I may, what the Minister has said in that connection because it is, as the Americans say, very hard to get this across to the public.  There are still great numbers who believe that Bord na Móna is just a State institution, costing the taxpayers enormous sums of money by way of annual grants, when in fact Bord na Móna is to a large extent at the moment, has in the past, and will certainly in the future operate almost entirely on the same basis as the E.S.B.; not merely will it have to repay the advances which have been made and the further advances which will be made when this Bill becomes law but it will have to repay them with interest sufficiently high at least to cover all that money. I merely want to reiterate what the Minister said in that connection because there are great numbers of our people who still think Bord na Móna is just something that is being kept there and is costing the taxpayers enormous sums of money.</P>
    <P>There is one very important aspect of this development to which the Minister did not refer.  It is an aspect in relation to which I would like the Minister to give us some picture, if not at this stage, certainly before the Bill finally passes into law.  It is a secondary consideration, but it is a close second.  I refer to the land which is reclaimed as a result of the cutting away and clearing of our bogs.  I know that Bord na Móna is doing its best scientifically to drain and cut the bogs in order to leave the reclaimed land, if possible, suitable for agricultural development or, if not suitable for agricultural development, at least suitable for forestry development.  That is of very great importance and may be of very great and very lasting benefit to the nation.  It is a factor that must always be taken into the cost of turf production, or any other sort of fuel produced by Bord na Móna, although it has not always been taken into consideration in the past or, indeed, given any consideration by other State bodies even, much less by people outside.  When one thinks of thousands of acres of land, not merely <Col N="625" /> along the western seaboard but even in the heart of the country, that have been lying there entirely useless and that we are now getting an opportunity of reclaiming and putting to some useful purpose, that is an aspect of the matter with which we ought to make ourselves fully conversant.  I think I am right in saying that in Germany in the development of their peat resources there reclamation was not a secondary consideration.  It was the primary consideration since their need for peat as fuel was not and is not as great as ours.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister tell us about the extremely satisfactory development in Clonsast and Allenwood. It is very satisfactory indeed but, of course, the increased output will shorten the life of these bogs very much.  However, we are not likely to run short of turf in the country anyway.</P>
    <P>I want now to make some reference to peat moss.  I have always felt&mdash;I know the difficulties&mdash;that there is a really enormous market in America for peat moss.  I do not know if there is such a market in Canada or, if there is, how extensive it is, but there is no doubt at all that some of the European countries have a tremendous export of peat moss to America.  I know that Bord na Móna finds it very difficult, if not impossible, to put peat moss on the American market in present circumstances at competitive prices.  I am not so sure as to the extent to which our handling and transport costs at this side of the water are responsible for that and to what extent, if any, these costs of handling, packing and transporting from the bog to the ship can be influenced by ourselves.  I do not know whether or not things could be so organised that some of our own ships could be used at certain periods for the transport of peat moss. Of course, I know very well that when one is going into a competitive market one cannot deliver as one would wish to do.  One must deliver as and when required by the buyer.  It does seem to me, however, and I did at one period to make extensive inquiries into this because I thought there was something in it that would give us a <Col N="626" /> valuable dollar export that this is a matter worthy of every attention that can be given to it.  It would not be a question of only 100,000 or 150,000 tons, or anything like that.  It could be ten and 20 times that amount.  If we can get in at competitive prices the market is undoubtedly there.  I understand the American imports run into very, very large figures indeed.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, I am glad that the Minister is taking the necessary powers to make available to Bord na Móna grants on the same basis as the grants made available to local authorities for the provision of similar houses.  I think that housing scheme is a very good idea.  As a matter of fact, it is a necessity.  I think you can attract first-class workers to Bord na Móna and, provided you give them the necessary accommodation and reasonable remuneration, you can ensure not merely adequate skilled labour for the present but also for the future.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister&mdash;this may be a small point but, perhaps, it is an important one&mdash;how the rents of these houses that are already built and tenanted have been assessed in the absence of that additional £400 per house and whether the rents were based on the only grant which was available at the time&mdash;£180?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to get at.  Let me put it this way. Were the rents which were charged and which are being paid by the tenants fixed in anticipation of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right.  I agree entirely again with the Minister on this question of the utilisation of native fuel by industries which are only brought into existence and kept in existence by State help provided, of course, that the switch-over, if a switch-over is necessary, to the utilisation of turf does not involve a capital expenditure that would be unreasonable and provided they can get at least the same power from the utilisation of turf as they would from imported fuel-Perhaps, <Col N="627" /> I would not even go so far as that but let me leave it as it is for the moment.  I fail to see, even from the purely selfish point of view and having regard to all the protection for the continuous operation of the particular plant in times of emergency, why industrialists would not opt, even if it cost a little more, for the utilisation of native fuel.</P>
      <P>That, I think, is particularly true where the fuel used is fuel oil.  The danger would not even be so great from the point of view of steam generated from coal.  I think we are inclined not merely in respect of our industries but in other respects also to place ourselves too much at the mercy of what is our most vulnerable point, fuel oil. I know that the experimental station has been invaluable not merely from the point of view of improving and adapting existing machinery but also in the actual inventing and producing of machines of their own for further mechanisation in regard to the production and saving of turf.  I know the experimental station.  The staff there have done very excellent work.  They carried out experiments in relation to the by-products of turf.  They produced quite a number of by-products, including wax.  I would like if the Minister could tell us what the position is in relation to those efforts if he is in a position to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of employment, I am very glad, as I say, to see the provision that is being made here for superannuation for employees. Strangely enough, one of the greatest obstacles to greater progress and greater output which Bord na Móna has had to face in recent years, notwithstanding our large number of registered unemployed, is the fact that not in any one year have they been able to get the full number of men for whom they had work available. This may help.  I am not as conversant with present-day rates of remuneration, allowances and so on as I was some years ago but if the rates have progressed during the last two or three years and kept step at least with the rates in outside firms&mdash; so far as I know the rates and conditions <Col N="628" /> offered by Bord na Móna are reasonably good.  I will not put it any further than that.  I think they are reasonable&mdash;it does seem very strange, to say the least of it, that some of our people are not prepared to work on bogs in Kildare, Offaly or Mayo where they are reasonably housed from what I saw on a couple of occasions.  They are even more than reasonably fed. They are given reasonable wages.  Yet it is an extraordinary thing that they are not prepared to accept work in those places under those conditions but are apparently prepared to go to England and go down into a mine.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was sitting where the Minister is now sitting and dealing with this matter and complaining that we could not get people from the western counties where they knew all about cutting and saving turf to come as far as Kildare and take up employment, I was asked by a member of the then Opposition whether I wanted them to go from Galway to Kildare at a time when they were going from Galway to Hull and Lancashire. However, that will probably be got over.</P>
    <P>I do not want to drag out this discussion unduly but there is one thing to which I should like to pay a tribute in passing.  It is not covered by this Bill.  It is probably not very relevant to it although it is very clearly allied to the whole matter we are dealing with here.  I refer to the experiments in bog conversion, if I might call it so, carried out by the Sugar Company.  I think those efforts are worthy of our encouragement.  I sincerely hope that the experiments which they are carrying out at present will be successful because, if not, I am afraid that the future of the sugar factory in Tuam will not be very secure.  There has been difficulty over the years in getting a sufficient supply of beet in that area.</P>
    <P>I noticed that during the week the Minister opened a new plant for the production or processing of grass meal from what is grown on what I have already described as largely useless stretches of our country.  In so far as those efforts can be successful it will be a tremendous achievement.  I do <Col N="629" /> not think there is any other point I want to make at the moment except to pay my tribute to the work that has been done and which continues to be done.  I am very glad, indeed, that the Minister is making in this Bill provision for those who were the pioneers of it and for those who have carried on under extremely difficult circumstances. It ought also, of course, be remembered that, apart altogether from the board and the staff, the employees have had to work under extremely unfavourable conditions.  The work was done and well done.  It had to be done during hard weather, often on a three-shift day, working through the night under artificial light.  Taking everything into consideration, I think the work was well done.</P>
    <P>Let me say this before I sit down. If we are going to succeed to the extent that I hope we shall succeed in the development of the peat resources of the country I would like the Minister and the E.S.B. to take another look at what they are doing or propose to do in relation to the development of the remaining water power of the country.  Let us not go too far in one direction or another.  I am given to understand that the board, whether at the Minister's behest or on their own initiative I do not know, are surveying our small rivers.  I speak, of course, on this with all the ignorance of a layman, but I doubt very much if the development of the number of units that we will produce from some of those small rivers will be really worth it.  However, that is a matter for the Minister and his expert advisers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  The Minister himself mentioned it in the course of his speech, and in any event I do not think I would have much trouble in showing that it was in order on the Second Reading of this Bill.  I am not going to deal further with it except to say that people outside&mdash;perhaps some of them have vested interests&mdash;have expressed their concern, for instance, <Col N="630" /> about the threatened destruction of valuable salmon and sea trout fisheries. That, of course, would be all right if you were dealing with a river like the Erne, but when you come to deal with very small rivers the return by way of generated energy from them would be comparatively small.  It appears to me that the necessity of doing that is not now so great since we have got this milled peat process. In the past I suppose we had not much option except to go ahead with the fullest possible development of our water-power resources unless proposed schemes were shown to be entirely uneconomic.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I welcome the Bill. There may be one or two small points which I may have to raise on the Committee Stage but generally I welcome what is in the Bill.  I think it is something which should be done. I should like to join with the Minister in paying tribute to the people who have put us in the position that we are in to-day in regard to the development of our native fuel.</P>

One important aspect has been mentioned in connection with this Bill.  It was the question of a market for the extra machine-won turf that will be produced here within the next few years.  I am sure that is something which is worrying the Minister and the board at the present time, especially when we consider the fact that during the last 12 months we have had here a considerable quantity of surplus machine-won turf in the hands of Bord na Móna. If we have that surplus at present for which there is no economic market available, what is the position going to be in 1956 or later?  How are we going to ensure that there will be a market available for the increased supplies of turf then being produced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one aspect of the matter with which I propose to deal.  I suggest to the Minister that the time is now ripe for planning ahead so that <Col N="631" /> this market for the turf will be available. The first thing that I would like to point out to him and to the House is that if Bord na Móna in the past had planned their campaign properly with regard to machine-won turf, this problem of surplus turf would not have arisen to-day.  I think it is an extraordinary thing that in a country like this, with huge undeveloped peat resources, we should be importing annually considerable quantities of foreign fuel.  Within the last six months, the State Guarantees Bill was passed in this House.  That Act covered Fuel Importers Limited to the tune of £4,000,000 for the purpose of importing fuel into this country.  It might also be of interest to the House and to the general public to know that last year we paid £128,000 in interest alone on the overdraft in respect of accommodation for Fuel Importers Limited.  These figures cannot be contradicted.</P>
    <P>While that is the position, how can we expect a market to be available for the first-class fuel that is being produced here?  In the last five or six years, large sums of money have been handed over to Bord na Móna for the development of our peat resources.  I would like to say that the programme of supplying the generating stations with peat is an excellent one.  The criticism, if I may so describe it, that I have to offer in connection with that programme is that it is painfully slow. I think that Deputies on all sides of the House are in agreement on the use of peat for generating electricity.  We have not, however, reached agreement on the speed with which this programme should be carried out.  I am not the only one who has criticised both Bord na Móna and the E.S.B. for their slow rate of expansion in this regard. Recently, we had some American experts in this country who stated in their report that the progress of Bord na Móna in its development work was painfully slow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out <Col N="632" /> that this was levelled by alleged experts who came to this country on the invitation of the Government.  I am quite sure that when they came here they were given all possible information by the experts in Bord na Móna with regard to the problems of drainage and development and that, consequently, they were given full information with regard to the length of times it takes to drain a bog.</P>
      <P>It might interest Deputy Morrissey to learn that it takes more than three years to drain some bogs in order to get the proper return when you start on a first-class fuel production programme.</P>

      <P>We are not going to get very far in this House with regard to getting results in connection with the expansion of the activities of Bord na Móna or hurrying them up in their large-scale programme of development for generating stations but I think that, with regard to the first problem I mentioned, the question of the supply of machine-won turf for the home market is one that should meet with careful consideration.  In order to get a proper idea of the areas where turf can be sold I think it is essential that a proper section be set up within Bord na Móna.  If you like, you can call it a marketing section.  I understand that such a section exists there at the present time&mdash;that is the information at my disposal&mdash;but I am afraid it exists only in name if we are to judge by the results or lack of results in the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I put down a question to the Minister in connection with the setting-up of a proper marketing board within the framework of Bord na Móna in order to get over the difficulties of prospective purchasers in rural areas who have found it difficult to obtain Bord na Móna turf in reasonable quantities. The Minister replied that he had no information that difficulties had been experienced by prospective customers in obtaining supplies of turf whether produced by Bord na Móna or by private producers.  I had hoped, at <Col N="633" /> that time, to raise this matter on the Adjournment but I was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  I am glad, therefore, of this opportunity of bringing the matter to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>There are many prospective purchasers of Bord na Móna turf who cannot get their requirements and who cannot get them in suitable quantities. If the Minister cares to go to Galway to-morrow morning he will find that it is an impossibility for a person there to purchase a lorry-load of Bord na Móna turf.  That has been the position in the past fortnight in Galway City. While that is going on in Galway, Bord na Móna has had to close down a number of its bogs in County Roscommon. On the roadside adjoining those bogs there are thousands of tons of turf&mdash;and no market available for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same in North Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>So I understand. This is a criticism of the administration. To make things worse, in order to get rid of the turf on hands in Roscommon, Mayo and elsewhere, Bord na Móna turned round in our county and offer the Roscommon County Council 4,000 tons of this turf at 24/- a ton less than it cost to produce. Naturally enough, the ratepayers of Roscommon were delighted to get this opportunity of purchasing Bord na Móna turf at 24/- a ton less than it cost to produce.  However, if we look at this from a national point of view, I think we must agree that it was a scandal that Born na Móna should be allowed to sell semi-automatic machine-won turf at that cut-throat price just because they panicked when they found that, as a result of the good weather last year, they had a huge supply of turf on hands for which they had made no effort to obtain a sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the fact that they had so much turf on hands this year is responsible for the decision they took to close so many of these bogs.  I believe that that was a retrograde step.  I believe that every bog that Bord na Móna worked last year should <Col N="634" /> be in full production this year and that if a proper marketing section is established in Bord na Móna there will be a market available for all the turf that can be produced on these semi-automatic bogs, and even more if we had machines available.</P>
    <P>You can picture the situation in my constituency where the county council, through pressure, were forced to purchase this turf.  It meant that they were purchasing subsidised turf from Bord na Móna in competition with the hand-won producer.  That means that, this year, only a small market is available in the county for the private producer because what he has supplied up to the present has now been supplied by Bord na Móna and the people as a whole&mdash;in other words, the taxpayers&mdash; are paying for the cheap turf they are getting in Roscommon.  It is very unfair that the taxpayer should be asked to vote money for Bord na Móna and to find that that money is utilised to get rid of the surplus turf for which Bord na Móna failed to find a market last year.  Personally, I think it is the duty of Bord na Móna to obtain a market for its product.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too critical or sore about it but I think that, when there is too much criticism to-day of State companies and State control, it is up to this particular body to leave no room for criticism.  There are so many critics in the country to-day of State schemes and semi-State bodies that it is deplorable that they should leave any room for criticism.  In view of the fact that, broadly speaking, the work being done by Bord na Móna is excellent, it is a pity that, in an important aspect such as the marketing of turf, grave inefficiency is shown.</P>
    <P>I will give further examples to the Minister of the lack of touch&mdash;if I might so describe it&mdash;which the Bord na Móna marketing section shows with regard to the present day situation.  I have here a cutting from the <i>Waterford Star</i> of the 29th May.  The Waterford City Vocational Education Committee after a number of meetings decided to use coal burners for the vocational school. At a meeting before the one in question, they discussed for hours the relative merits of coal, coke and oil <Col N="635" /> and evidently these gentlemen in Waterford never heard of turf.  This is a paper published pretty widely in the South.  Surely if Bord na Móna were alive to their responsibility they would have pointed out to the vocational committee: &ldquo;We have burners here, Mona jet burners, that can compete any day in service and cost with the coal, coke or oil burner.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have an example in Athlone, where last year the vocational committee decided to install burners operated by turf, this new Mona jet burner.  I understand it is on a similar principle to the oil burner.  Up to that in Athlone they used coke.  The cost per annum of heating the Athlone school with the coke burner was £250. They have installed a turf burner instead and there is just as good heat, it is every bit as satisfactory and they have saved £100 per annum on the fuel cost.  That is not made known publicly.  There are very few vocational committees in Ireland that realise that. It is quite evident that the Waterford people heard nothing about this new burner.  What is the publicity or marketing section doing that they have not brought these things to the notice of public bodies generally?</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated, in reference to what I have just been speaking about, that the same thing applies to industrial concerns now, that he is encouraging new industries to utilise native fuel in preference to the foreign commodities.  I hope that under the Undeveloped Areas Act any industries coming to the West will get no facilities whatever in the way of loans or grants from the Department unless they give a guarantee to utilise the turf that is available in the West.  The Minister could go further and when any new industry is being established, whether in Dublin, Cork or the West, it should be pointed out&mdash;there is no question of compulsion&mdash;that no trade loans, grants or quota facilities will be given unless they are prepared to utilise native fuel in their factories.  In addition, it is time to carry out an investigation into companies already in operation and industrial concerns established <Col N="636" /> here over the last 15 years. They should be given a limited time in which to change over to peat instead of coal or oil.  It cannot be done overnight, but every industrial concern enjoying State protection or help, that may have been in existence for the last 15 years, could be ordered to change over within a specified period to peat for heating and energy and could be warned that if they failed to change over, all facilities given to them up to the present would be withdrawn. These are ways in which we can gradually replace coal by the native product.</P>
    <P>My own view is that we should give the power to Bord na Móna that already lies in the hands of Fuel Importers to choke off the importation of coal when necessary.  The question need never arise in this country of overcharging for turf, if Bord na Móna had power at their disposal to bring in coal.  With that threat hanging over the heads of private producers, they would realise there was no good in killing the goose that laid the golden egg.  I understand there would be difficulties involved in trade agreements and so forth with regard to implementing that suggestion of mine, that we have not the power in this country by which we could choke off coal, that Britain could come back very quickly with regard to our cattle. That is a deplorable state of affairs, but there is a nicer way, by ensuring that every industrial concern, every housing authority and every public body will have to utilise the native product.  In that way we could choke off the market for coal by degrees.</P>
    <P>Many people are worried that if we keep on cutting the bogs at the present rate there will be no turf left after a period of years.  They think we should conserve our bogs and use the peat supplies only in conjunction with coal. That is only another argument to allow coal in.  One need not worry about the bogs being cut away, by making provision now that on the cut-away portion the Department of Forestry will get to work.  That type of ground, cut-away bog, is ideal ground for afforestation and when we cut out the turf we could replace it with timber.  There <Col N="637" /> is no use in taking up that question in 20 years' time.  Bord na Móna and the Forestry Department should work hand in hand on this problem; they would do an excellent day's work for the Forestry Department as well as ensuring our future fuel supplies.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, the Minister says that Bord na Móna have constructed 366 houses&mdash;I did not get the exact figure&mdash;and that there is a big list of applicants who are not Bord na Móna employees.  I would like him to tell us how many of the applicants are Bord na Móna employees.  That is much more important.  I would like him to let us know whether the board can find sufficient applicants to take up residence in all the new houses that have been constructed in Kildare and Lanesboro, from amongst Bord na Móna employees.  I met a number of these men myself and they were very dissatisfied with the terms offered by the board.  One of the snags in the contract agreement is that if for one reason or another the employee falls out with the board or gets sick and does not want to work any longer with them, he is turfed out of the house and his family along with him.  In other words, he is only a tenant of the Bord na Móna house so long as he works for the board.  That is the nicest form of blackmail I know of.  There is a little threat there, a little intimidation. When it comes to a question of employees looking for an increase in wages, it can always be held over their heads as a threat of dismissal and as a result of dismissal that the turf worker would have to leave his abode, with his family as well.  I should like the Minister to let us know whether there has been any trouble in finding tenants for all the houses constructed up to the present.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the main problem that worries me&mdash;the securing of a market for machine-won turf in our towns.  I put a suggestion to the Minister&mdash;I do not know what the board thought of it&mdash;that, in towns like Roscommon, Ballina, Sligo, Galway and towns in the Midlands and even in the South, Bord na Móna should set up fuel depots&mdash;they need not necessarily be closed-in constructions; they <Col N="638" /> could be big yards&mdash;so that if a purchaser wished to obtain turf in one-ton or two-ton lots he could ring up the depot and say that he wanted to buy a ton of Bord na Móna turf, which turf would be delivered to him or could be collected by him.  One of the big snags with regard to turf in towns is its bulk. Very few houses have storage accommodation sufficient for more than one ton of turf, so that there is no use in offering turf to people in towns in five and six-ton lots.  They should be in a position to buy turf in the very same way as they can buy bread.  That may sound somewhat exaggerated but if the public are facilitated in obtaining turf in lots which suit them, far more people will take it.  One of the advantages of coal is that it takes up so little space.</P>
    <P>In most of the towns the question of the type of chimney does not give rise to much trouble and I do not accept the suggestion made by a number of Dublin Deputies as to the grave danger of fires through the utilisation of turf.  Bord na Móna have got over that difficulty within the past six months but it is only when one makes inquiries of Bord na Móna officials that one gets the full information or when some member of Bord na Móna reads a paper to some group or association which gets half a column in the newspapers. That is not sufficient publicity, so far as Bord na Móna is concerned.  The board should give first-class publicity to any improvements carried out and to the results of any successful experiments they may have made with regard to chimneys and the utilisation of turf.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting for a moment that turf be poured wholesale into Dublin straightway.  There are plenty towns outside of the cities where there is a first-class market for turf, if the proper steps are taken.  The Minister may be told by the board that, if Bord na Móna were to set up these fuel depots in towns in the West, they would be completing with hand-won turf.  That is nonsense.  If the private producer is offered a guaranteed price, in the same way as the whiskey distillers give a guaranteed price for malting barley, <Col N="639" /> and if a man is known in a particular area as a producer of so much hand-won turf for sale per annum, I see nothing wrong with a Bord na Móna depot in Roscommon town stating that they are prepared to purchase 700 or 800 tons of hand-won turf every year at such and such a price.  That turf can be sold along with the semi-automatic turf from the very same yard and purchasers will be found for it, in preference often to the machine-won turf.  In that regard, no harm will be done to the private producer.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that you will not have a full market for all this Bord na Móna turf until Bord na Móna take steps to set up a distribution centre in each town throughout the country.  We will be told that the sale of turf is a matter for private enterprise and that Bord na Móna would be stepping too far into that sphere.  I do not accept that at all.  Every worthwhile development that has taken place in this country took place through State interference. Private enterprise has achieved nothing in this country without first-class State aid or protection, and, if Bord na Móna are to be the primary producers of turf, it is their duty to see that that turf reaches the public, whether they themselves have to take the steps necessary to make it available to the public or are able to reach agreement with the people who up to the present have acted as the principal distributors of the foreign commodity, coal.  I do not care what way they do it, but the present system will have to be changed, and my suggestion is that Bord na Móna should enter the distributing business by setting up these fuel depots in each of the towns.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing in the Bill which I know is going to be welcomed by all sides of the House.  I hope that, as a result of the encouragement being given by all Parties, Bord na Móna will be spurred on to greater efforts, feeling that they have the entire backing of the House and the country in their desire to expand production and to increase the utilisation of peat instead of the foreign fuel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been <Col N="640" /> welcomed, and rightly so, by everybody in the House.  It is in some respects to be regarded as a milestone on the way to very definite progress, because we have now got to the stage at which we are no longer wondering about the potentialities of turf, but talking about its further expansion and development, accepting it for what it is, a national project of prime importance.</P>
      <P>The point I particularly want to make is that this project has got to the stage at which it can contribute significantly to power production in this country.  It has been pointed out, and rightly so, that there are peculiar advantages attached to this, because not only does it represent a useful employment of resources which heretofore have been unused but an employment of resources which are relatively valuable in a country which unfortunately is fairly poor in that type of resource.  It also represents a certain insurance against an emergency, as Deputy Morrissey pointed out, and, in that connection, as I understand the situation&mdash;perhaps the Minister would be able to give us figures because sometimes our information is incomplete&mdash;during the month of March this year, the cost of power from turf at two of the turf burning stations was less per unit than the cost of power production from oil or other fuels.  If we have achieved that situation, it is indeed very satisfactory and it should be a stimulus to go right ahead and develop our power production as far as possible on these lines.  In the past we were all used to the argument and, perhaps, a reasonable argument that there are advantages attached to turf and they could be enumerated but, as against that, the bogey of cost was held out and you were told that imported fuel oil or coal would produce far more cheaply.  Apparently that argument no longer holds, if the information which I have is correct.  Such information as we Deputies get sometime in the course of wandering around is not altogether complete but that is the information which I have come across.  If that is the position it is an extremely satisfactory one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey's attitude in this <Col N="641" /> debate was a very welcome one indeed and his approach a very proper one. In that approach he has done a great deal to help to keep this debate in its proper perspective and I hope we will be able to keep all discussions on this and kindred subjects in that perspective the rest of the way, no matter how long it may be.</P>
    <P>In that regard Deputy Morrissey touched on the question of co-ordination. Seeing that Bord na Móna, of itself, through all the vicissitudes of childhood has now got to the stage of development that it has got itself, this question of over-all co-ordination becomes extremely important, particularly in regard to power.  Before mentioning some heads&mdash;I have no intention of going into this in any detail&mdash; it is perhaps not inappropriate to say that in a modern economy the first requisition is adequate supplies of power at economic rates, whatever that may be.  I hesitate to say or to pin it completely to a matter of cheapness but, in a modern economy, power is the first requisite.  It is what moves things, what keeps the whole thing going and, whether it is industry or agriculture, power is needed.  If we look forward to the development of this country, whether on the industrial side or on the primary agricultural side, we see the need for power. Everybody will appreciate it on the industrial side but it has a very big bearing on our agricultural efficiency as well.  It would be a big thing in this country, and it has been pressed ahead under rural electrification, if the mechanical and other facilities that can come to a farmer when he has power laid on and available were universally available to all our farmers.  Whether for domestic use or for agricultural and industrial use, power widely distributed all over the country at an economic rate would be a very good social thing also and might help to secure a balance which we feel is necessary as against urban areas and rural areas, but that is a digression.</P>
    <P>The point is that the first prerequisite to the development of a modern economy is power and the Governments that have been here have been right in their approach to this <Col N="642" /> in so far as they have put that as the primary objective as far as weight of effort went.</P>
    <P>We have three possible supplies, roughly, in this country in regard to power.  Perhaps one could say four. Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle would allow me to enumerate them.  I do not think I am trespassing too far.  I think it is relevant just to mention them. There is water power.  Nobody can deny the value of that.  Deputy Morrissey has touched upon it.  It is a very important angle for us who are poor in natural power resources.  There is the question then of supplementing that by generating stations of the heat type of some form or another.  That supplementation will be absolutely necessary, no matter how it is balanced, because of the dependence of hydro-generating stations on weather conditions to some extent.  For instance, the last year was a dry year and I think the power production from the hydro-electric schemes was down. When there is more rainfall you can get a better output.  There is definitely a need for balance there.</P>
    <P>If that is so, the question arises, how?  We have two means at present. We are using stations fired with imported fuel and we are using stations fired with domestic fuel, and the domestic fuel, apparently, is now even more economic on a cost basis.  Frankly, I think there is need here now for such bodies as the E.S.B. and Bord na Móna to be co-ordinated in the long-term as well as the short-term operations. In the planning there is need for co-ordination here and I presume it is the Minister and his Department who should be the proper co-ordinating influence.  It is not a question of cut-throat rivalry between the two.  The E.S.B. and Bord na Móna are equally essential and equally important and the work done on both sides is work of prime national importance.</P>
    <P>It is only natural, perhaps, that the E.S.B., having started off as largely concerned with hydro-electric schemes and having a bias in that direction, would have a lean towards that. Perhaps an engineer, in particular, would have a lean towards such a type of scheme.  Perhaps from a purely <Col N="643" /> drawing-board calculation point of view, seeing certain difficulties associated with turf, when it comes to supplementation, there may be a leaning towards the view, if one looks at it from the narrow engineering efficiency point of view, that there is a case to be made for the oil-fired station as against others, and so forth. But, the over-all national economic picture should be taken into account, particularly as the situation is as I mentioned and, therefore, joint planning of the two concerns is of some importance. Perhaps it is a matter that should be reviewed at the present moment.</P>
    <P>There may be another method of power generation.  I do not know.  It has been considered in the past but it is not for discussion on this Bill.</P>
    <P>The important thing is to use our bogs as far as we can now for this purpose and I would, off the cuff, so to speak, be inclined to agree with Deputy Morrissey that in the production of new stations it might be better to go for more turf-fired stations, suitably located, than to go too far on the hydro-electric side, if you have not got a likely return from it.  It is a matter for balance, a matter for careful consideration, one that cannot simply be dismissed in a few words.  I do think it is important and I would like the Minister to tell us what the prospects are for development on that line.</P>
    <P>The next thing is co-ordination again.  It is a question of co-ordination with the development of the land.  The grass meal project in Galway has been mentioned and that seems to be very promising.  The question of reclamation of the land for turning it to useful work after the turf has been reaped from it is also important.</P>
    <P>This bears on a number of other interests. Deputy McQuillan mentioned forestry.  It has also a bearing on agriculture and I wonder whether the necessary co-ordination at the top on a broad basis is getting enough attention. I presume it is, but I think I should mention it at the same time. Then there is another matter arising out of this in regard to employment and houses.  It is a very good thing that the board will provide housing, <Col N="644" /> which is one of the difficulties in getting labour because we have a rather exceptional situation in regard to employment in this country which is perturbing and which to some extent has been mentioned by Deputy Morrissey.  It seems to be a fact in certain rural areas in connection with work, such as essential work like this in regard to our bogs, which is first-class production work as well, that there is a difficulty in getting employees. In other words, there is a difficulty in getting labour.</P>
    <P>It is only within the past month that I was talking to somebody very closely associated with a western county council who informed me that it was impossible for that council to get the labour they required for work on the roads and other local work.  The people sign on or register themselves, whatever the mechanism is with regard to the Labour Exchanges but the necessary number could not be found.  That seems to be the position in regard to certain areas in the country.  On the other hand, we have the very definite problem that in the City of Dublin and in certain other areas there is definite unemployment, particularly so in the building trade.  It is very hard to know how to tackle a problem of that nature, but certainly the provision of houses as an inducement to the workers to go there is something of importance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey pointed out and, I think quite rightly, that it is very hard to explain why people will emigrate from the areas where there is no employment to Britain, under worse conditions, rather than go to the areas in the country where work is to be found. That statement would accord with information which has been given to me. The board, in providing these houses, should be able to do something to redress that.  Deputy McQuillan also made a point in regard to that.  But there is another side to that.  If these houses are for the purpose of procuring the necessary labour, some arrangement is necessary whereby the houses will be kept for employees who are going to give a productive return.  A terribly important thing is that we are getting production here.  We are not merely providing relief schemes.  From <Col N="645" /> the employment involved in Bord na Móna and E.S.B. we are getting production of real value to the nation.</P>
    <P>There is another thing about this which requires comment.  We have had a very large housing drive in this country over a number of years and we have made remarkable progress in 20 years in rehousing our people.  But we are now beginning to find in certain areas a problem which was not thought of at that time.  The housing situation was so bad when we were starting at it that we did not think of possible complications.  But a complication has arisen in a number of areas to my knowledge and it is this.  County councils, with State aid, have erected a number of houses in certain localities. From a social point of view that was an excellent and proper thing to do. But it has had the effect of increasing the density of population in a number of restricted areas where there is no employment to absorb the people, so that you have in certain areas densely-populated patches with excellent housing facilities, but the people have to go a long distance from such areas to get employment.  That is a complication in the problem.  Here we have the two things related.  Bord na Móna is providing houses in relation to the employment. That is an important move on the part of the board.  But I have often wondered whether some of our transport problems could not be solved in restricted areas, even if it were only by rural electrification locally in connection with the transport of turf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It would certainly arise in regard to the board itself supplying power for it.  In Holland and many other countries you see transport of that nature so carried.  However, I think the Minister is anxious and we are all anxious that this Bill should not be delayed.  It is needed so as to get on with the work.  I am gratified to find that there is a move to make provision for an emergency, if it should come.  Deputy Morrissey pointed out that being at the mercy of fuel oil is perhaps our weakest point.  I could if I were to take the time, go further <Col N="646" /> along that line.  I think we will all join in wishing the Minister well with his further scheme for development and that the House will watch it with interest and give him every support in future.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Cogan speaks I should like to make a correction in the order of business to-day. The programme announced this morning provided for the taking of the Local Elections Bill on report after Questions and then the order was to be resumed, which would mean taking this Turf Development Bill.  I have engagements in the Seanad and I may not be back in time to deal with the Turf Development Bill.  I think, therefore, it would be preferable not to order its resumption after Questions, but that the Local Elections Bill should be taken and that we should then go on with the Estimates which are intended to be taken.</P>

      <P>I am at some disadvantage as I did not hear the Minister's entire statement.  It was gratifying, however, to hear Deputy Morrissey express on behalf of the Opposition entire agreement with the Bill's provisions and with what it hopes to achieve. It is very gratifying to know that all opposition to turf production has virtually disappeared, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, by his untiring efforts for the development of native turf production, has ruled out all opposition and that we have on all sides of the House a unanimous endorsement of the policy of this nation to provide, as far as it is possible, for our requirements in fuel supplies.  The fact that we imported £12,000,000 worth of coal in 1951 and £10,000,000 worth in 1952 is proof that there is a very big market within this country for our native fuel.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state why he has insisted on this duty other than for the purpose of having another Supplementary Estimate at the expense of the ratepayers in County Kildare?  Is the Minister not aware that his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, and his colleague the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, determined last year that there were not produced within the State articles of this nature which would be acceptable. That is last year.  I do not know about this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it as correct that a test carried out by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs early in 1952, that is, prior to the preparation of the combined purchasing list for the year 1952, revealed some deficiency in the quality of this protective clothing manufactured here.  The Kildare County Council did not report this in 1952.  At that time there was available from home sources at a lower price protective clothing of excellent quality. In the circumstances I could not justify the granting of a duty-free import licence.</P>
      <P>May I also point out that the combined purchasing arrangement does not preclude the Kildare County Council from purchasing other than from the contractor named on the official list if they can purchase goods of equal quality at a lower price from someone else, and that the official combined purchasing list for 1952 contained a footnote which made it quite clear that import duty would be payable on these goods if imported?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the number of widowed civil servants who have been re-established in the service; (b) whether such persons are eligible for payment of children's allowances on the same scale as that payable to married civil servants; and, if not, the estimated cost of paying children's allowances to such persons, and (c) whether the Government intends to bring in proposals for legislation to make children's allowances payable to such persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) Eighty-seven widows have been reinstated in the Civil Service in a pensionable capacity since 1937, when the present arrangements for their reinstatement were introduced. (b) Reinstated widows are not <Col N="654" /> eligible in their own right for payment of Civil Service children's allowances. No estimate can be given of the cost of paying such allowances as the necessary particulars are not available.  (c) It is not proposed to introduce payment of children's allowances to reinstated widows.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may not be aware that the Civil Service scheme of children's allowances applies only to a proportion of the married men in the service, namely, those in classes which contribute by receiving lower salary rates whilst unmarried.  Men civil servants not conditioned to these lower salary rates do not on marriage become eligible for children's allowances as they have not made any contribution. Equally as women civil servants make no contribution they cannot qualify for benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether income-tax is assessed on the holdings of land purchased by migratory workers who have earned the purchase price of such holdings in Britain and the number so assessed for the years 1951-52 and 1952-53.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether migratory workers are assessable to income-tax in respect of holdings of land purchased by them depends in each case on the amount of the worker's total income and the personal allowances to which he may be entitled. There are no statistics available as to the number, if any, of migratory workers assessed to income-tax in respect of such holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very nice qualification.  There have been at <Col N="655" /> least some in County Mayo who have been assessed.  I would request the Minister for Finance to take up this question so that migratory workers will know where they stand.  I consider it a most objectionable practice. It is bad enough that they have to go to England, without salting them in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of serious damage caused to boats and fishing gear by ground swell and storms at the pier, Clare Island, County Mayo, through lack of a breakwater, and if he will take immediate steps to have a breakwater of the necessary dimensions erected and the surface of the pier repaired.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>A proposal was under consideration some years ago for the erection of a breakwater at Clare Island Harbour to enable motor boats to lie safely at anchor in the harbour, but it was found that the cost of the work placed it outside the scope of employment schemes.</P>
      <P>I understand that the pier is in the custody of the Mayo County Council, and the proposed repair of the structure is, accordingly, a matter for the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that, apart from the employment that the scheme would give, the population of Clare Island is falling year by year?  One of the principal causes why the population is falling is that the people are getting no assistance in this way.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the decision that he has just given and not try to pawn over the matter on the Mayo County Council.  I would ask him to undertake the erection of a breakwater for the sake of saving the people's boats and fishing gear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of pawning over anything on the Mayo County Council that we can carry out legally, but the Mayo County Council at all times have been one of the most unco-operative county councils in regard to matters of this kind.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy wants me to indicate who, I think, or who he may possibly think, <Col N="671" /> should be blamed for the delay, but I am glad to know that he realises that the Department is not responsible. There are 280 acres of land held in undivided shares by 14 tenants and the total price of the land is £360.  The cost of proving the title is obviously the stumbling block.  The State solicitor has done his utmost.  I shall try again to get the vendors' solicitor to clear up the question of title.  I am afraid there is nothing further I can do about it.</P>

      <P>The cost of the conveyance of letter mails to Britain in the year 1952 was £56,000 approximately. Had the mails been conveyed solely by surface transport the cost would have been lower but the service markedly inferior.</P>
      <P>On occasions when the air service is suspended no extra expense is involved.</P>
      <P>I do not understand the purport of the last sentence of the Deputy's question unless he implies that there should be a special airmail letter rate to Great Britain.  The revenue likely to be received would not enable a lower internal postage rate to be charged.</P>

      <P>There is still a good supply of old potatoes, and earlies from home growers have made their appearance.</P>
      <P>Regular shipments to Great Britain will not begin until next week.  I cannot indicate what prices there may be, as they change from day to day. Up to last week the demand was fairly good and fancy prices were paid. Increasing supplies from a variety of sources may now be expected, and these will inevitably cause a fall in price.</P>

    <P>Last night, when discussing this Bill, the Minister indicated that he was not <Col N="683" /> very clear as to what exactly were the respective effects of Section 2 (4) and Section 6.  I have put down this amendment to enable the Minister to clarify his own mind and the mind of the House.  As I understand it, the effect of this sub-section is that it in fact gives power to the Minister to make dissolution Orders after the passing of this Act, and to make Orders for elections in respect of bodies dissolved both prior to and subsequent to the passing of this Act.

    <P>Go ndeonfar suim nach mó ná £221,680 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfas chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de <Col N="689" /> Mhárta, 1954, chun Tuarastal ague Costas Oifig an Aire Oideachais agus chun Costas a bhaineas leis an gComhairle Oideachais.</P>
    <P>I gcaitheamh na bliana atá imithe tharainn do léas gach ceann a tháinig fém láimh de na léirmheasta a deineadh ar an gcóras Bun-Oideachais seo againne.  Gach rud a luadh ina locht, do dheineas é d'iniúchadh; gach rud a moladh chun feabhsaíthe, do dheineas é mheá.  Chítear go maith dom féin go bhféadfaí feabhas do chur ar ghnéithe áirithe den chóras agus go bhféadfaí obair níos éifeachtúla a dhéanamh fiú gan aon athrú, ach sé rud a chuaigh ina luí orm i gcoitinne ná nach raibh an cháinseoireacht ná na moltaí chun feabhsaithe bunaithe ar an eolas cruinn ceart atá le fáil de bharr fíricí an scéil go léir d'iniúchadh.</P>
    <P>Tá iniúchadh mar sin ar siúl le tamall anuas ag an gComhairle Oideachais. Is áil liom mo mheas ar na daoine go bhfuil an tromchúram san orthu a chur in iúl, agus a rá nach mian liom go dtuigfí go bhfuilim ag teacht rómpu in aon rud dob áil leo a lua ins an dtuairisc a chuirfidh siad ar fáil. Idir seo agus Meastachán Coitianta mo Roinne-se a chur i láthair na Dála don chéad turas eile, tá súil agam caoi a chur ar fáil do Theachtaí an Tí a meas agus a dtuairim a thabhairt ar a mbeidh sa tuairisc atá dá hullmhú fé láthair ag an gComhairle Oideachais.</P>
    <P>Is geal le croí gach glas-eolaí oideachais an clár scoile mar ábhar tuairimíochta.  Do réir mar a bhíonn luí aige féin éilíonn gach glas-dhuine acu go soláthrófaí am chun obair adhmaid, nó chun talmhaíochta, nó chun tuaitheolaíochta, nó chun eolaílchta, nó breis a chur lena bhfuil d'am chun Staire.  Is mian lion a rá arís go dtuigtear domhsa gur fearr d'ullmhú ar leanbh, i gcóir a bhfuil roimhe sa tsaol agus sa ghnó a thógfadh sé air féin, go mbeadh buneolas maith diongbhálta aige ar bheagán d'ábhair bhunúsacha in ionad maoleolas spréite, bearnach a bheith aige ar mhórchuid ábhar.  Ní mór a chur san áireamh, leís, gur fíorthábhachtach an rud é, ar mhaithe le diongbháltacht meoin do mhúnlú sa leanbh, go leanfaí go ríalta d'iarracht treortha, agus is <Col N="690" /> fíor go milltear aon tairbhe dá leithéid sin tré bheith ag iarraidh daltaí dochur ar aghaidh ó ábhar amaháin atá ar leath-eolas acu go dtí ceann eile go bhfuilíd dall ar fad air.</P>
    <P>Sé is príomhaidhm don Bhum-Oideachas, dar liomsa, ná meon aná leinbh a mhúnlú, an duine óg a oilíúint chun rudaí áirthe a dhéanamh go ceart, slachtmhar, a shuím a mhúscailt&mdash;pé slí inar féidir leis an oide é sin a dhéanamh&mdash;ins an obair atá ar láimh, agus an bhaint atá ag an obair sín lena thímpeallacht agus leis an saol atá roimhe a chur ar a shúilibh dó.</P>
    <P>Ní hionann agus cáineadh ar na hábhair éagsúla úd gur moladh iad a chur ar an gelár, a rá nach bhfuil ró-thábhacht iontu muna mbíonn bunobair na scoile déanta go maith éifeachtach ar dtúis.  Gan an scéal a bheith amhlaidh, ní thiocfaidh an tairbhe is cuí de bharr ábhair bhreise a theagasc.</P>
    <P>Le déanaí do dheineas tairiscint go ndéa nfaí leathlá sa tseachtain do chur ar leataoibh le caitheamh ag teagasc aon ábhar nó ábhair ar leith nó ag cleachtadh rud ar bith a dhéanfadh leathú ar réim aigne agus eolais a chuid daltaí, dar leis an oide áirthe a bheadh i gceist.  Tá a gclaonadh agus a mbuadhanna féin ag gaháil le hoidí seachas a chéile.  Dá gcuirtí roinnt uair an chloig sa tseachtain ar fáil dóidh chun go bhféadfaidís na tréithe sin a thabhairt i bplé, agus saoirse iomlán acu ó ghnáthrialacha, ba chóir go mba chaoi é chun tréithiúlacht ar leith a thaispeáint agus b'fhéidir, sa thlí sin, go mba shásamh é ar an éileamh ar scoilchlár níos leithne.  Ba mhaith liom go dtuigfí ná gabhfadh éigeantacht ar bith lena bhfuil i gceist sa tairiscint sin; bheadh saoírse iomlán ag bainisteoirí agus ag oidí glacadh leis nó gan a dhéanamh, do réir mar be mhian leo féin, agus do réir mar d'oirfeadh dá scoileanna áirthe féin ar leith.  Fanfad go gcloisfead na tuairimí agus na léirmheasta a thiocfaidh chugam i dtaobh na taíriscínte sin.</P>
    <P>Rud a dhein mórchúram dom is ea an riocht atá ar a lán de na foirgrintí scoile, mar tá uímhir mhór díobh nach bhfuíl oirúnach agus is follas go bhfuil an bhaínt ag na coinníollacha féna ndeintear an obair scoile leis an dtoradh a bhíonn dá barr.  Do réir <Col N="691" /> a chéile táthar ag tógaint nua-scoil-eanna in ionad na sean-cheann a bhí neamhoiriúnach, agus táthar ag deisiú agus ag cur leis an gcuid is mó de na cinn eile díobh atá creat-slán sa tslí go mbeidh nua-chruth orthu agus iad níos oíriúnaí chun an ghnótha.  I ráiteas na Meastachán anuiridh do chuireas in iúl go raibh an £900,000 a cuireadh ar fáil ar an suím ba mhó do tugadh riamh chun na hoibre sin. I gcaitheamh na bliana dar chríoch Márta 31, do dáileadh suim £1,500,000 ina dheontaisí fé thuairim 58 nua-scoileanna a thógáil agus chun cur le 15 agus chun mórdheisiú a dhéanamh ar 317 eile, sin 390 scoileanna san íomlán&mdash;cuid acu nua ar fad agus an chuid eile chomh maith le bheith nua de bharr na hoibre a deineadh. Is mían liom a ndícheall a thraoslú do na hailtirí a bhí i mbun na hoibre. Ina leagan amach agus ó thaobh oiriúnachta, tá na scoileanna san chomh maith le haon scoileanna atá dá gcur ar fáil in aon tír sa domhan.</P>
    <P>Ach ní dul chun cinn a bheidh déanta i ndáirire muna gcoimeádtar a bhfuil déanta ar dea-staid. Tógáil ar bith dá fheabhas, tiocfaidh droch-bhail uirthi i gcionn aimsire muna bhféachtar chuige go gcoímeádfar i gcaoi cheart í.  Do thugas cuaírt ar scoil le déanaí agus bhí sí go geal cóirithe agus go slán iomlán cé gur chomh fada síar leis an mbliain 1847 a tógadh í.  Do chonac scoileanna eile agus fíor-dhrochbhail orthu cé ná raibh aon cheann acu dathad bliain ina sheasamh.  Ag labhairt dó i láthair chomhdháil de mhúinteoirí le déanaí, dúirt cainteoir go rabh titim mhór sa chéadchodán den chaiteachas a dháileann an Stát ar Oideachas.  Níl fuaimint ar bith leis sín mar ráiteas.  Tá méadaithe thar na beartaibh ar chaiteachas an Stáit ar mhaithe le hoideachas. Tuigtear domhsa nach rud inmholta é iomlán an chostais chun scoileanna a thógáil agus a choimeád ar dea-staid do thitim ar an Stát. Mura fonn leis na daoine ins na ceantair éagsúla aon chúnamh a thabhairt chun costas na scol, is comhartha san gur beag acu an t-oideachas agus gur lú ná san acu beatha an náisiúin. Ná tuigtear gur cúrsaí áitimh é sin <Col N="692" /> agam chun laghdú a dhéanamh ar chaiteachas an Stáit ar an oideachais. Sé tá á áiteamh agam ná go nglacfaí rannpháirteacht phearsanta sa rud so, rud gur mór é a thionchar ar bheatha an náisiúin agus chun leasa an oideachais, agus gur ceart go bhféadfaí a thabhairt í gcrích&mdash;caithfear é thabhairt i gcrích&mdash;más áil linn toradh fónta a bheith ar ár n-iarrachtaí.</P>
    <P>Is minic a deineadh tagairt do théacsleabhair anso le linn díospóireachta ar na Meastacháin so agus do tháinig gearánta ó áiteanna eile leis i dtaobh cuid acu atá in úsáid.  Do scrúdaíos go speisialta an chuid sin díobh a úsáidtear chun léamh na Gaeilge agus léamh an Bhéarla a theagasc uathu.  Táid go léir go maith. Tá cuid acu ar fheabhas.  Bhí ceann amháin a mheasas a bheith ródheachair le haghaidh teagaisc i mbun-scoileanna. Ach taobh amuigh den cheann san amháin, ba léir dom gur lucht dea-eolais ar ghnóthaí oideachais, agus ar a raibh ag teastáil, a chuir na leabhair sin le chéile.  Bhí mórchuid eolais i mbeagán spáis ins na leabhair. Dalta ar bith a ghabhfadh chuige féin an t-eolas san, ní fhéadfaí a rá go raibh sé gan oideachas.  Na scéalta, na haltanna agus na dánta a bhí ins na leabhair sin, bhí dea-chaoi iontu don oide chun suim an dalta do mhúscailt ionas gurbh fhonn leis-sin dul ar thóir breis eolais.</P>
    <P>Sé mo thuairim gur mór ab'fhiú an t-eolas breíse sin a chur ar fáil go saoráideach do na daltaí.  Dá bhrí sin, táim go mór i bhfábhar leabharlanna a bheith ins na scoileanna. Do thiocfadh dá bharr san, in áit an téacsleabhar a shamhlú ina cheann de na scoil-dualgaisí nach féidir a sheachaint, gur ina eochair a bheadh sé a osclódh doras amach go dtí tír mhór na n-íontas.  Daltaí a bheadh mall agus trom go leor iontu féin, b'fhéidir go mbíogfadh a n-intinn fé bhrí a mbeadh le fáil sa leabharlainn acu ach deathreoir chuige a thabhairt orthu, agus b'éadtroime de san ualach na foghlama ins gach slí.  Tré chomhoibriú leis an údarás áitiúil, go bhfuil gach cóir cheana féin acu chun an ghnótha, ní fheicim bac ar bith ar leabharlainn a chur ar fáil ins gach scoil.  Ní hé is áil liomsa baothaithris <Col N="693" /> a dhéanamh ar modhanna oideachais atá i réim i dtíortha eile ach, chomh fada agus a bhaineann le soláthar leabharlann, táimíd go mór chun deiridh ar an gcuid is mó de na tíortha agus táimse den dtuairim gur mhór an tairbhe d'ár gcóras oideachais na leabharlanna san a sholáthar.</P>
    <P>Is trom agus is tuirsiúil í obair an mhúinteora sa ghnáth-bhunscoil, ach tá de bhuntáiste ag an oide ná bíonn air bheith ag plé le lucht éislinne. Fadhb de shaghas eile ar fad a bhíonn le réiteach ag an oide a bhíonn ag teagasc lucht daille, nó lucht daille's bodhaire, nó lucht díth mheabhrach. Obair í sin gur gá tréithe mórcharthannachta agus íbirte ann.  Ní mór foidhne fhada agus cómhbháidh gan teora chuige.  Is do-chreidte agus is iontach leis an ngnáthchuairteoir a fheabhas de thoradh a bhíonn ar an obair theagaísc a deintear i scoileanna ar a mbíonn daltaí dá leithéid sin.  Ba chóir go mbeadh an obair a deintear ins na scoileanna sin ina shampla agus ina rabhadh do na daoine sin a bhíonn ag gearán go glórach ar leathnú riarachas an Stáit, agus ins an am gcéanna ag éileamh seirbhíse ar an Stát gurb éigean don stát réim a riarachaís a leathnú chun freastal ar an éileamh.  Tá daoine ann a mheasann gur ceart don Stát freagarthacht níos leithne i gcúrsaí airgeadais a ghlacadh chuige féin, agus ní smaoineann siad ar an dochar a dhéanann sé an fhreagarthacht a bhaint de na daoine coitianta i leith rudaí a bhaineann le múnladh meoin agus beatha an náisiúin. Daoine atá ar an intinn sin, tá easbaidh tuisciona agus críonnachta ortha.</P>
    <P>Tá fadhbanna agus constaicí á réiteach agus á sarú ag lucht na scol san i slí níos éifeachtúla ná mar a fhéadfaí a dhéanamh choíche de bharr reachta dlí agus riarachais oífigiúil. Iocann an Stát tuarastal na n-oidí agus deontas beag éigin chun fearas speisialta do cheannach.  Tugann an Stát agus an tUdarás Aitiúil araon allúntas maireachtála i leith na leanbh. Ní hé amháin go ndeineann obair na scol so maolú mór ar mhí-ádhmharacht, ach cothaíonn sé solas dóchais agus misnigh i gcroí an leinbh.  De bharr íbirte agus dílse an lucht stiúrtha tugtar gach cóir agus compord ar na <Col N="694" /> leanaí gan trácht in aon chor ar na buntáistí eile thar míniú a gheibhíd uathu.  Deintear an tseirbhís seo go léir i slí ná titeann ach beagán dá chostas ar phobal díolta na gcánach.</P>
    <P>I bhfianaise shampla mar sin ba chóir gan aon mhí-fhonn a bheith ar an bpobal an bheagchuid de fhreagarthacht chostais a iarrtar orthu a sheasamh chun cúram glanta agus cóirithe na scol náisiúnta.  Go bhfios dom féin níor theip an fhéile ná an fhlaithiúlacht riamh ar ár muintirne agus measaim go mba bheart nár chuí é gan cleachtadh na féile sin a iarraidh orthu, nó diúltadh dá dhéanamh san.</P>
    <P>Ceist eile is ea cás na leanbh atá mall, maol-intinneach.  Tá a líon súd chomh beag san ins na scoileanna beaga tuaithe nach dtagann a gcás chun práinne ansúd.  Ach ins na cathracha, agus i mBaile Átha Cliath go speisialta, tá géarghá le réiteach a dhéanamh a laghdódh ar dheacrachtaí a thagann i gceist de dharr nithe nár tugadh áird go dtí seo orthu.  I scoil amháin de chuid na cathrach tá rang do leanaí dá leithéid sin.  Is geal liom a rá go bhfuil ag éirí thar barr leis an rang úd&mdash;chomh maith san go n-éiríonn le cuid mhaith de na leanaí dul chun cinn, isteach ins na ranga leis na ngnáth-scoláirí, agus déanamh rómpa ann chomh maith le daltaí na rang san féin. De bharr an teagaisc speisialta so, tagann do na daltaí sin go léir misneach agus meamna nach raibh acu roimhe. Im thuairimse, is rí-thábhachtach an obair í sin.  Do cuireadh an rang ar bun de bharr dúthracht roinnt bheag d'oidí ard-thréithe gurbh áil leo freastal ar dhroch-chás na leanaí.  Ba mhaith liom a ndúthracht a thraoslú dóibh siúd a thóg an gnó trom san orthu agus atá á fhreastal chomh éifeachtúil sin. Toisc an dea-thoradh atá ar an iarracht, táim ar aigne iniúchadh a chur á dhéanamh i scoileanna Cathrach Átha Cliath d'fhonn teacht ar an méid den chineál sin oibre atá ag teastáil ionas go bhféadfaí fóirthint choitianta a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Is fada é mo chaidreamh leis na múinteoirí.  Le dhá bhliain anuas táim ag obair i gcomhar agus i gcomhaon leo.  Táim sásta go bhfuil ár modh oiliúna oide tar éis ár riachtanaisí <Col N="695" /> a sheasamh go maith agus trid is tríd le chéile go bhfuil idir fhearaibh agus mhnáibh de na múinteoirí ina ndaoine deathréithe, cultúrtha.  Ceist mhór atá ar láimh ag lucht mo Roinne-se ná an ganntanas de mhúinteoirí oilte atá orainn&mdash;ceist go gcaithfear réiteach sásúil a thabhairt uirthi. Nuair a thagann oide go húrnua as an gColáiste Oiliúna is intuigthe go mbeadh díth na coda sin d'ealaín a chéirde air a thagann de bharr cleachtadh múinteoireachta agus maoirseoireacht daltaí. Caithfidh sé a chuid teoirice a chur ag obair i láthair nithe gur beag a thaithí orthu, nó b'fhéidir gan aon taithí in aon chor aige orthu; caithfidh sé a mhodhanna a chur in oiriúint dá riachtanaisí, agus beartú a dhéanamh a sháróidh constaicí.  Is de bharr taithí dá leithéid sin a thagann sé chun tuisceana agus chun cothroma ina chéird.  Toisc go dtagann san chun criche i gcás gach duine díobh, beagnach dealraíonn sé domhsa go bhfuil ár modh oiliúna oidí go héifeachtúil oiriúnach.</P>
    <P>Féadaim a rá go bhfuil comhoibriú dlúth i leith gnóthaí oideachais idir an Roinn seo agamsa agus an pobal múinteoireachta, ach is ábhar díomá dom é bheith le rá agam nár éirigh leis an Rialtas&mdash;de bharr cúrsaí nach raibh máistreacht ag an Rialtas orthu &mdash;Scéim Idiréitigh agus Eadráin do na múinteoirí a chur ag obair in áit na bunscéime sealadaí a chuaigh as feidhm um Mhárta, 1952.  Ba mhaith liom a rá, áfach, go bhfuil comhráite ar siúl agam le Cumann na Múinteoirí Náisiúnta fé théarmaí nua-scéime a bhféadfaí a thabhairt isteach nuair a réiteofar bealach chuige sin.  Idir an dá linn, mar do léirigh an tAire Airgeadais ina óráid ar an gCáinfhaisnéis, is rún don Rialtas díolaíocht na múinteoirí do mhéadú, ar an mbonn chéanna leis an méadú a tabharfar do na Stát-Sheirbhísigh de bhárr Eadráin, ón gcéad lá de mhí Aibreáin na bliana so.</P>
    <P>Leanbh ar bith a ghabhann tré chlár na Scoile Náisiúnta, tá rud curtha ar a chumas dó gur mór is fiú é, bíodh agus ná beadh aon oideachas foirmiúil thairis sin le fáil aige.  Ach ba chóir go mba rud indéanta againn é caoi níos fairsinge a sholáthar dó chun tuilleadh a chur leis an mbunoideachas <Col N="696" /> san.  Bíonn na h-úirlisí agus an bhunoiliúint ag an leanbh a chuireann ar a chumas tuilleadh eolais a ghabháil chuige féin: ba chóir gur d'ár gcúramna an fonn chun tuilleadh eolais a chothú ann.  Leanbh ar bith a chaitheann seal de bhlianta gan treoir gan cuspóir tar éis dó an bhunscoil a fhágaint, is measa de mheon an linbh sin é.  I rith na mblian san is cuí agus is tuisceanach an rud é an leanbh a dhíriú ar bhealach a leasa, mar is iadsan na blianta is mó a fhágann rian agus treo ar a aigne.  Ullmhúchán chun cúrsa saoil an duine is ea an t-oideachas agus, dá bhrí sin, caithfidh sé freastal ar an riachtanas atá leis an duine a oiliúint chun obair thairbheach a dhéanamh&mdash;agus iarraim gurb í an bhrí is leithne a bainfear as an gcaint sin.</P>
    <P>Dá mbeadh barr foirfeachta ar chóras oideachais do threoródh sé gach duine fé dhéin an chuspóra is dual dó, ach ní saol gan locht é seo againne agus is beag de na daoine a chuireann ina bhun go n-éiríonn leo ionad a fháil dóibh féin ann a thugann caoi dhóibh lán-úsáid a bhaint as na tréithe agus as an acmhainn atá iontu. Dá bhrí sin, ní mór daoine a oiliúint ionas ná cuirfeadh deacrachtaí ná díomuaidh dá dtreoir ná dá n-aidhm iad.  Is téarma neamhchruinn é &lsquo;oibrí gan ceard.&rsquo;  I measc lucht oibre níl éinne gan ceard éigin aige ar a chuid oibre.  Níl aon obair ná gabhann a ceirdiúlacht agus a deasláimhe féin léi. I saol síor-athraitheach na linne seo is rud riachtanach é go mbeadh sé ina chuid d'ár gcóras oideachais oiliúint a thabhairt sa cheirdiúlacht agus sa deasláimhe.</P>
    <P>Anuas go dtí gearrthamall ó shoin, do réir mar a tharla, ní raibh ach bealach amháin ann ina bhféadfaí cur le hoideachas an linbh&mdash;b'shin bealach an mheán-oideachais.  Maidir leis an meán-oideachas féin, cé go bhfuil ag méadú in aghaidh na bliana ar an líon a bhíonn á shaothrú, ní leor é mar sin féin chun ár riachtanaisí náisiúnta a shásamh.  Tá an t-easnamh á líonadh ag an gcóras gairm-oideachais agus tá ag leathnú air sin in aghaidh na bliana agus caighdeán níos airde á shroisint ann.  I mbliana tá 211 gairm-scoileanna ann agus líon 90,000 de scoláirí iontu.  Sin an líon is airde <Col N="697" /> de scoláirí a sroiseadh riamh anall agus d'fhéadfaí cur leis sin féin dá mbeadh ár ndóthain slí againn chuige agus breis mhúinteoirí.  Tá gach dícheall á dhéanamh againn chun cur le líon na múinteoirí agus is mian liom buíochas a ghabháil le lucht ceannais Choláiste Ollscoile Chorcaí agus le Coiste Gairm-Oideachais Chathair Átha Cliath agus le Coiste Gairm-Oideachais Chathair Chorcaí as ucht a dtugadar de chabhair agus de chúnamh go fonnmhar dúinn chun cúrsaí do chur ar bun d'fhonn na múinteoirí atá ag teastáil uainn a oiliúint.</P>
    <P>Ní fada ó shoin ó chonac féin i mBaile Átha Cliath anso dhá thaispeántas de shaothar daltaí na nGairm-scol agus bhí fairsinge go leor de cheird-réim ina raibh dá thaispeáint chun saothar gach déantúsóra sa tír, beagnach, a léiriú iontu.  Ní hé amháin gur theaspáin an obair sin feabhas an teagaisc agus dúthracht na ndaltaí, ach ba chreidiúint í do na fostaitheoirí go léir sin go raibh sé de thuiscint iontu a gcuid príntíseach a chur go dtí na scoileanna, agus níor lú ná san de chreidiúint, leis, í do na Ceard-Chumainn a chomhoibrigh go feídhmiúil san iarracht agus a chuir mórshuim in obair na scol.</P>
    <P>Tá eagraíocht an ghairm-oideachais ins na cathracha anois fén am so sa riocht gur féidir freastal ar a mbeadh eile ag teastáil ach cur lena bhfuil déanta cheana féin.  Ní mór leanúint do réiteach a dhéanamh le haghaidh na gcathrach, gan amhras, ach as so amach caithfimíd gabháil níos treise i mbun na boibre ins na tuathcheantair agus cúram ar leith a dhéanamh de lucht feirmeoireachta a oiliúint chun ceirdiúlachta ina ngnó féin.  Tá cúnamh tugtha chuige sin cheana féin ag lucht Mhacra na Feirme agus is áil liom buíochas a ghabháil leo as ucht an dea-shampla a thugadar dá gcuid ball i gcoitinne.  Sampla amháin den dea-thoradh a tháinigh dá bharr san ná an scoil aon-tseomra ghairm-oideachais a dhein lucht Mhacra na Feirme a thógaint as a stuaim féin amháin i mBaile an Mhíola i gContae Phortláirge.  Sampla eile de thoradh dea-spioraid an phobail isea an ghairmscoil dhá sheomra a thóg muintir na háite as a gconlán féin, leis, ar an gClochán Liath i dTír Chonaill.  Sé <Col N="698" /> an machnamh agus an díospóireacht agus an grinn-scrúdú a deineadh roimhré a réitigh bealach chun go dtíocfadh borradh mar sin fén gcóras, agus samhlaítear domhsa gur follas uaid sin go bhfuil an beartas atá á dhéanamh againn go ciallmhar, tairbheach. Níl áireamh ar a thairbhí atá sé don leanbh, faid a chur le tréimhse a chuid oideachais fhoirmiúil agus, ins an soláthar atá á dhéanamh againn chun réim an ghairm-oideachais a fhairsingiú, tá córas á chur ar fáil againn a dhéanfaidh freastal ar gach gné de shaol eacnamaíochta an phobail seo againne.</P>
    <P>Rud iontach é, agus rud nar mhiste don náisiún seo bheith bródúil as, an t-éileamh atá i ngach ceard den tír ar thuilleadh oideachais, ar oideachas gairmiúil.  Creidim gurb é an t-éileamh sin ar oideachas agus ar léann an t-ábhar dóchais is fearr dá bhfuil againn.  Ba mhór an peaca náisiúnta é gan freastal ar an éileamh sin, agus gan an dúil sin in oideachas agus in oilíúint do chothú i muintir na hÉireann.  Tá rún daingean agam an freastal agus an cothú san a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Is fada siar a théann stair an mheán-oideachais in Éirinn.  Suas le dhá chéad blíain ó shoin, do réir mar bhí ag maolú ar dhéine na bPéindlithe, do cuireadh síol an chóraís a tháinig chun blátha ó shoin, sé sin, córas de scoileanna neamhspleácha, príobháideacha. Níl ach timpeall seachtó bliain ó thosnaigh an Stát ag cabhrú leis na meán-scoileanna.</P>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, ní beifí ag súil le mórathruithe do theacht ar chóras ná ar chlár na scol ó bhliain go bliain agus, tríd is tríd, is maith is ceart do phobal na tíre a bheith lán-tsásta le dílse an díchíll atá á dhéanamh acu súd go bhfuil cúram soláthar meánoideachais ag titim orthu.  Le blianta beaga anuas sé is mó a dhein cúram don Stát ná feabhas do chur ar choinníollacha tuarastail agus pinsin na meán-mhúinteoirí.</P>
    <P>Is ní inspéise é, áfach, go bhfuil ag méadú go leanúnach ríalta ar an líon de mheán-scoileanna, agus ar an líon na scoláirí iontu, agus ar an líon de ranga as a ndíoltar deontaisí speisialta chun Eolaíochta, chun Eolaíocht Talmhaíochta, chun Eolaíocht Tís agus <Col N="699" /> chun Adhmadóireachta.  Tá ag méadú amhlaidh, freisin, ar an líon de mheánmhúinteoírí atá ag fáil breiseanna tuarastail agus ar líon na n-íarrthóirí chun na scrúdaithe.</P>
    <P>As an 439 scoileanna atá ann, tá an teagasc go híomlán nó cuid de á thabhairt tré Ghaeilge i 224 díobh. I 98 díobhsan, deintear an teagasc go léir tré Ghaeilge ach amháin a ndeintear de theagasc na nuatheangan tré mheán na dteangan san féin.</P>
    <P>Ag deireadh na bliana airgeadais seo caite do thugas Scéim i bhfeidhm mar leasú ar na Scéimeanna Aosliúntais do Mheán-Mhúinteoirí.  De bharr na Scéime leasúcháin sin do laghdaíodh óna haon go leith (1½%) go dtí a haon fén gcéad (1%) ar a mbeidh le díol ag baill na Scéime ionas go bhféadfaí seirbhís inphinsin a tugadh ón gcéad lá Lúnasa, 1929, i leith a áireamh ina seirbhís chun aisce a thuilleamh.  Ina theannta san, bhí forála eile sa Scéim a bhí chun maitheasa na múinteoirí.</P>
    <P>Tá ar aigne agam Scéim eile leasúcháin a thabhairt os cóir an Tí go luath chun feidhm a chur ins an mbreith a thug an Rialtas le déanaí go n-íocfaí cnapshuim le meán-mhúinteoirí a bhí ar phinsean ar chéad lá d'Eanair, 1950.  Measfar méid na cnapshuime sin mórán ar aon dul leis an gcnapshuim atá leagtha amach cheana féin do na sean-mhúinteoirí bun-scol a bhí sa chás céanna.</P>
    <P>An Scéim sin atá luaite agam, beidh dhá fhoráil eile inti, leis, agus ní beag é a dtábhacht do mheánmhúinteoirí, mar atá den chéad rud, ón dóú lá déag de Mhárta, 1952, amach, sé tuarastal ar a mbunófar idir phinsean agus aisce ná tuarastal an oide ar dháta a scuir agus ní hé, mar a bhí go dtí seo, meán an tuarastail a tuilleadh i gcaítheamh na dtrí mblian roimh dháta a scuir: agus, den dara rud, íocfar aisce scuir do réir ráta aon chéadú (1/100) den dtuarastal ínphinsin le gach ball den Scéím Aosliúntais i leith gach bliain de sheirbhís dea-mheasta teagaisc a tugadh roimh an chéad lá Lúnasa, 1929.</P>
    <P>Is áil liom é bheith le lua agam leis an dTigh go bhfuil nuascéim Idirréitigh agus Eadrána do MheánMhúinteoirí <Col N="700" /> tar éis a shínithe le déanaí ag ionadaithe na Múinteoírí óna dtaobh san de agus ag an Aire Airgeadais agus agam féin ó thaobh an Rialtais de.</P>
    <P>Dealraíonn sé domhsa go bhfuil faillí throm á thabhairt againn i ngnéithe áirithe oideachais go bhfuilimid freagarthach iontu agus muna dtagaidh malairt aigne orainn i dtaobh na nithe sin tiocfaidh damáiste mhór dá bharr.  De bharr ceal spáis ins an Leabharlainn Náisíúnta, tá leabhair agus croinicí á gcur ar coimeád sa riocht agus gur ró-dhócha gurb é a n-aimhleas a thiocfaidh de.  Ins an Ard-Mhúsaem Náisiúnta ní féidir nithe a chur ar taispeánadh i gceart ná cúram mar is cóir a dhéanamh dhíobh gan leorchuid spás.  Dálta mar atá déanta i dtíortha eile cheana féin, ní mór dúinne, leis, Músaem Dúchais, sé sin, Folk Museum, a chur ar bun.</P>
    <P>Ins an Dánlainn Náisiúnta táthar tar éis nua-chóiriú a chur ar shoilsiú, ar mhaisiú agus ar chrochadh na bpictiúirí, agus do cuireadh ath-eagar ar an dealbhra i dtreo go bhfuil nua-chruth ar an Dánlainn anois agus í i bhfad níos inspéise.  Do tugadh sreath de léachtaí san Dánlainn agus bhí an slua éisteachta i bhfad níos mó ná mar a ceapadh a bheadh.</P>
    <P>Ar cheann de na nithe luachmhara a fuairtheas le déanaí tá an &ldquo;Teaghlach Naofa&rdquo; de shaothar Fra Bartolomeo a mhair sa chúigiú nó sa tséú haois déag.  Sileann lucht eolais gurb é an saothar is áille de chuid an ealaíonaí sin é.</P>
    <P>Sa chuid sin den ghnó leis tá an easpa spáis ina cheataí do éifeacht na Dánlainne. Is ins na soiléir atá coimeád ar a lán de na pictiúirí áille, luachmhara, agus cé go ndeintear an cúram is mó is féidir díobh, ní hionann san agus a rá go bhfuil coimeád mar is cóir orthu.</P>
    <P>Níor deineadh clár-liosta riamh fós dá bhfuil de oibreacha ealaíon san Dánlainn agus, in éamais mórán dua agus cuardaigh a dhéanamh, ní féidir freagra a thabhairt ar an iomad de cheisteanna a chuireann lucht Dánlann ó thíortha iasachta orainn ina dtaobh.  Ba cheart an clár-liosta san a dhéanamh chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Dalta gach Dánlainne eile dá chómhéid agus dá thábhacht ba chóir <Col N="701" /> go mbeadh glantóir oilte i mbun na bpictiúirí san Dánlainn Náisiúnta so againne.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh ar mo chumas tairiscintí a dhéanamh gan ró-mhoill fé thuaírím na leasuithe sin a dhéanamh agus táim ag coinne le dea-mhéin agus comhoibriú na Dála sa ghnó san dom.</P>
    <P>De bharr faillí na mblian tá géarghá anois le creat-dheisiú mór a dhéanamh ar Réadlainn Dhún Sionca.  Is maith liom é bheith le lua agam gur deineadh gléasadh agus ath-eagrú na Réadlainne i slí tuisceanach, sásúil.  Sé fáth a bhfuilim ag tagairt go speisialta don Réadlainn sa Dáil ná toise a laghad eolas agus tuiscint atá í gcoitinne ar a mbíonn á dhéanamh inti, agus ba mhaith liom a shocrú go raghadh Teachtaí as gach Páirtí ín aon-ghrúpa ar cuairt go dtí an Réadlainn.  Táim ar intinn dul i gcomhairle leis na Páirtithe éagsúla i dtaobh an scéil sin.</P>
    <P>Is gnáthach go ndeineann an Dáil ócáid den díospóireacht ar Mheastacháin an Oideachais chun léarscrúdú a dhéanamh ar an toradh atá tagtha ar iarrachtaí an náisiúín chun an Ghaeilge do thabhairt in athréim sa tír.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá annseo go bhfuil obair mhaith, obair fhíor-mhaith déanta cheana féin, agus dá déanamh fós, ins na scoileanna i leith na teangan. Agus ba mhaith liom a rá, leis, go bhfuil dúthracht agus dícheall an Rialtais dá chaitheamh leis an gceist seo.  An té adéarfaidh nach amhlaidh atá, níl taithí na tuíscínt aige ar an gceist.</P>
    <P>Ach tar éis an mhéid sin a bheith ráite agam, ní mór dom a admháil nach bhfuil an toradh in aon ghar do bheith ag freagairt don síolrú atá déanta ins na scoileanna agus don chothú atá tugtha ag an Stát.  Dá mbeadh, ní bheadh aon ábhar imní ná drochmhisnigh againn i dtaoibh na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Ní le hairgead, ná le hobair, ná le hintleacht a thabharfar an Ghaeilge ar ais&mdash;ná fós leis na trí rudaí sin i dteannta a chéile.  Is fíor-thábhachtach na nithe sin, cinnte, ach tá rud amháin eile atá riachtanach chun bláth a chur orthu, sé sin, an bharrshamhlaíocht&mdash; idealism.  Agus ní hé cúram na múínteoirí amháin, ná cúram na Roinne Oideachais amháin é, an bharrshamhlaíoeht sin a chothú.  Tá an dualgas sin <Col N="702" /> orraínn go léir: ar an gcléir, ar mhuintir an Oireachtaís, ar lucht gaírme agus ceírde, ar gach saoránach den Stát seo. Muna n-aithnímíd go bhfuil aidhm éigin uasal romhainn in obair seo na Gaeilge, is deacair dúinn aon chiall a a fheiscint ins an obair ná ins an chaiteachas. Tá go leor teangacha ar domhan a dhéanfadh ríar ár gcáis dúinn i gcúrsaí gnótha agus tráchtála, i gcúrsaí caidrimh, agus fiú amháin i gcúrsaí litríochta.  Ach níl ann ach an t-aon teanga amháin gur linn féin í, go bhfuíl ár ndúchas agus ár n-oidhreacht fite intí, a múnlaíodh ar intinn mhuintir na hÉireann agus gurb í fealsúnacht ár sinsir is anál anama di: sí sin an Ghaeilge.  Agus muna bhfuilimíd sásta íobairt agus obair a dhéanamh le grá don teangain sin, ní fiú dhúinn bheith ag fógairt don tsaol gur náisiún sinn.</P>
    <P>Sula gcuirfead críoch leis an gcaínt seo is mian liom a rá gurb é brí a mheasaim a bheíth leis an bhfreagarthacht atá ormsa, ná léargas níos leithne agus níos tuisceanaí a thabhairt í réim í leíth an oideachais.  Sé modh a ghlacfad chun é sin a dhéanamh ná gach gné oideachais go bhfuil lámh ag an Roinn seo agamsa ann a thabhairt chun breís léire, de bharr a ríachtanaisí agus a lochtaí a lua, mar a chítear dom féin íad, agus díospóireacht agus léirmheas a iarraidh go coitianta.  Na torthaí dob áil linne go léír do theacht de bharr an oideachais, ní féidir iad a thabhaírt i gcrích gan costas.  Is mian liom aigne an phobail a thabhairt cleachtach ar an smaoineamh sin agus tacaíocht gach Teachta a iarraidh ionas go nglacfaí léargas níos saoíthíúla i leíth ceisteanna oideachais na tíre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that it is unfortunate that the Estimate for the Department of Education should come up to-day.  The Minister is aware, of course, that we adjourn at 6 o'clock and I greatly fear that many Deputies who have other engagements availed of that to leave for their homes.  Let us hope, however, that the debate will continue until next week so that the various Deputies of all Parties can give their views to the Minister and so help to try to bring about desirable improvements in the sphere of education.  Secondly, I should <Col N="703" /> like to congratulate the Minister on his very detailed statement covering the various departments of education&mdash; primary, secondary, vocational and so forth.  I should also like to say that, notwithstanding certain grievances which the teachers have&mdash;and it is only fair to meet the teachers in certain of their demands&mdash;on the whole the Minister has done his best during his period of office to do everything possible for the welfare of the teachers and of education.  Perhaps, in cases in which he failed, the fault was not entirely his.  We usually throw the blame on the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>This question of education has never been a controversial one in this House or, I suppose, in any Parliament, because we can all agree that it is a matter which requires the help of all. Of all the Estimates put before this House, I believe that we can regard the Education Estimate as not only one of the most important, but the most important, because really the progress of the State and the advancement of our people depend, first of all, on the education that they have received from the time they came to the use of reason and during all the years they were engaged in trying to bring about their mental development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering education, I shall regard it under three headings&mdash;the school, the child and the teacher.  We may regard the school as a factory, because really it is a factory.  We can regard the children as raw material and the teacher as the skilled or expert worker.  There are the other factors also in connection with the development of education.  You have the inspectors, the managers and the heads of the Departments ruling over all.  Now, when a company come together to erect a factory, they plan it carefully from every point of view that it will be sanitary and that it will be comfortable in every way for those who will work in it.  The same thing should apply to the erection of a school, not only in regard to its situation and the style of architecture, but in regard to everything necessary to ensure that it will be comfortable <Col N="704" /> for those who work in it, the children and the teachers alike.</P>
    <P>We know that ever since a native Government was established in this State each Government in turn has done its best to ensure that our national schools would be in keeping with the ideals of a people who always admired education, but I am afraid that the progress that we would desire is not being made.  It is very easy to understand the difficulties.  Many of our schools were in a shocking condition. Many of them were never meant to be schools and I am sure it will take many years yet, before we shall have proper national schools in all districts. The new schools that have been built are a credit to those who designed them, a credit to the Department of Education which made money available, and a credit to the local people who contributed their share towards their erection.</P>
    <P>In speaking of local contributions I may as well state that in many cases there is great difficulty in getting the required sum.  I believe the Department requires a local contribution of one-third of the total cost, but the Minister and the Department will very readily understand that in poor areas in the country one could never raise that amount.  I do know, however, that in that respect, the Department is rather reasonable and so long as there is a local contribution of some amount it generally carries out the construction of the schools.</P>
    <P>However, in some districts it is absolutely impossible to get any sum worth while although it is my personal view that if people wish to have a school in their area, as a centre, as it were, of culture, they should at all times do their very best to contribute as much as they possibly can afford. I think it is only right that people should be made to realise their responsibilities in that regard.  If they have respect for their children and wish to ensure that everything possible is done to promote their educational advancement, I think they should be willing even to make sacrifices to ensure that the local schools would always be kept in a proper condition, not only in regard to the construction <Col N="705" /> of the schools but also in connection with the maintenance, heating and cleaning of the buildings.</P>
    <P>This question of maintenance and of heating and cleaning is a sore problem which has existed over a number of years and it has become more acute in recent times when, of course, the maintenance of schools as well as the heating of schools has become so expensive. The local contribution at the present time is not at all sufficient to keep the schools sufficiently clean and heated.  In fact, the State grant for heating and cleaning, to my mind, is not given in the proper way, because it is paid according to the average attendance at the school whereas it should be based on the space or the accommodation in the school.  Take a school, for instance, with an average of 90 pupils. In that school you will probably have two or three rooms, each of which must be heated.  In such a case, where you would have a fairly large number of families sending children to the school and where each family would contribute its share, either in the form of turf, wood or money, the local contribution would help to a great extent with the State grant to keep the school properly heated in winter time.  Then you may have a school, also of two or three rooms, in which the average may be only 30 or even 40.  In that case you may have only eight, nine or ten families to provide the local contribution.</P>
    <P>It is easy to see that where you have only that small contribution, each family contributing a rail of turf or wood or giving a money contribution of, say, 2/6 per child, the school cannot be properly heated during the winter since you would have to keep at least two fires going.  The State grant was fixed, I think, a number of years ago when the cost of fuel was not, I suppose, one-fifth or one-sixth of what it is nowadays.  I can tell you further, and it is a remarkable fact, that it has always been my experience and the experience of most teachers in country districts, that parents who make their contribution in the form of fuel do not always bring the best type of fuel or turf to the school.  That is rather unfortunate because I think that they <Col N="706" /> should be ready to send the very best fuel for the sake of their children.</P>
    <P>This question of the maintenance and cleaning and heating of schools has always been a problem for teachers and managers.  In the first place I think that the Department should increase the grant to bring it more in line with the present cost of fuel.  There is then the trouble of cleaning the school.  We all know how our schools were cleaned. We brushed them, dusted them and did everything possible and we never grumbled.  However, times have changed and, while I do say that I do not think it would actually do any harm to children to do a certain amount of this work in school&mdash;in fact I think some children like to ensure that their schools are clean and tidy&mdash;I suggest that in this modern age, children should not be required to do the type of work they did in the schools in years gone by.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy say why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I should answer that.  We have our Government Departments.  We have this Legislature.  I wonder would the Deputy like to come in here to-morrow morning and help to clean it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would do us a lot of good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if the Deputy would like it however.  I have said that such work does not do any harm to the pupils.  Children are always willing and anxious to help.  Even if there is somebody employed to light the fires the children during the day will tend the fires.  Fires must be looked after constantly.  The papers must be picked up off the floors and the rooms must be kept properly ventilated.  These are tasks that the children can easily carry out.  On the other hand, State officials go into their offices in the morning and they find them cleaned and heated.  I see no reason why the same conditions should not obtain in our primary schools.  I am sure the vocational schools are well looked after in that respect.  The managers in the case of primary schools have no funds at their disposal to help in the maintenance, <Col N="707" /> equipment, heating and cleaning of the schools.  It has been my experience that the teacher himself does most of that work, no matter how expensive it may be.  Very often he must put his hand in his pocket to provide fuel and equipment, to buy maps, school books for necessitous children, stationery and so on.</P>
      <P>Teachers over the years have been a suffering body and they have become used to that situation.  But that cannot go on indefinitely.  I think the Minister should take steps to bring about a conference between the managers, the teachers' organisation and the representatives of the Department to discover what means they can devise in relation to the heating and cleaning of schools.  This matter has been considered seriously by the teachers' organisation.  I know the managers have had it under consideration too. Possibly it causes some antagonism between the teachers and the managers and I am sure the Minister would like to see harmonious relations at all times not only between the teachers and the managers but also between the teachers, the managers and the Department.</P>
      <P>Now that deals with the actual factory itself.  There is then the child or the raw material.  We have the factory and the skilled worker.  The next stage is to study the development of the child mind.  There is, of course, a programme laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That programme was drafted many years ago.  It has been altered from time to time to suit requirements. Occasionally not alone Deputies but people outside demand the addition of new subjects to that programme.  It is said that agriculture should be taught in the primary schools.  That is quite impossible.  I know it is the Minister's view, and it is the view of all educationalists, that a few subjects well taught in the primary school are better for the development of the child mind and for the child's educational advancement than trying to teach a number of subjects in a rudimentary way.  I am sure the three R's will always be regarded as the foundation of primary education.  Other subjects, <Col N="708" /> such as history and geography, will be taught as essential subjects.  It is quite impossible to teach rural science in the primary schools because there is not enough time for it.  The child at that age cannot avail of such teaching because the subject is too difficult and the child is not sufficiently receptive. Agriculture should be taught in a practical way.  We have in many areas vocational schools.  It is in those schools that the pupil should be given a rudimentary knowledge of theoretical and practical agriculture.  It is in those schools domestic science should be taught, though I will admit that in the primary schools the pupils are equipped with a good knowledge of cookery and needlework, and the Minister's Department has reported that these subjects have been successfully taught in many of the primary schools.</P>
    <P>The programme is one of great importance and neither the Minister nor his officials should add, at any time, too many subjects to that programme. As the Minister stated in his opening speech, there is no difficulty with the normal child.  There is always difficulty with the sub-normal or mentally deficient child.  Various theories have been propounded as to how best these children can be taught.  Some held they should be put into a special class with special teachers.  Very often a mentally backward child is particularly deft with his hands.  Putting such children into a particular class might create an inferiority complex because such a class would inevitably become known as the dunces' class and that label would have a bad psychological effect. I am sure the teachers do their best to try to equip these children with a basic knowledge of the subjects taught.</P>
    <P>It has been the experience, however, that when inspectors come on an incidental visit they invariably pick on the dull child.  It has been known that when the inspectors come along on a fiosrú mór visit they always speak to such an extent to the dull child that they show up that child in a certain way.  They make the child feel bashful so that he or she has no confidence in himself or herself.  They show the teacher up, too.  Very often, in times gone by&mdash;I want to give the inspectors <Col N="709" /> their due and say that there is a big improvement now&mdash;the inspector's report on the school was based, to a good extent, on the efficiency or rather the want of efficiency in the case of the backward child or children in that school.</P>
    <P>So far as primary education is concerned, it is only when a child leaves school at 14 years of age that he or she understands what education actually means.  Up to that stage, the child is learning perhaps more or less against his or her will.  It is only when children have passed the age of 14 that they come to realise what education is, and to love it.  They understand then its necessity.  Therefore, I think the Minister and his Department should, at the first opportunity, make provision for the raising of the school age first of all to 15 years, and, later, when there is sufficient accommodation in city and town schools and a sufficient number of trained teachers, they could extend it to 16 years.</P>
    <P>The point is that if you raise the school-leaving age you must make provision for an extended programme. Perhaps the ideal solution would be to have what one might call a higher primary school under a special teacher for children between the ages of 14 and 16, to teach them some extra subjects or advanced arithmetic, Irish, geography and history.  I am speaking now of children who cannot go to a secondary school.  After all, 90 per cent. of the children of this country receive their whole education in the national school.  It is only when they have completed their primary and higher primary education that they can avail fully of the subjects taught in the vocational schools.</P>
    <P>As I am on the subject now, and as there is a great deal of controversy about the progress of Irish in the schools and the revival of the Irish language, may I say that if the language is to be revived, as we all wish it would be, that can only be brought about by the children remaining in school up to the age of 16 years, with provision also for the teaching of Irish as an ordinary subject in the vocational schools.  Of course, great differences of opinion exist among educationists as regards <Col N="710" /> the method of reviving the Irish language.  Some appear to hold that its revival depends solely on the national school.  In fact, it is remarkable that since Irish was made a compulsory subject, and since it can really be taught everywhere, pupils seem not to take very much interest in its revival. Perhaps if its survival were banned, as it was at one time under the rule of the English Government, the people would take a greater interest in it.  It may be that we are a contrary kind of people, and that when we are told not to do a thing, that is the thing we wish to do.</P>
    <P>Many years ago the teachers' organisation sent a circular out to the teachers asking for their opinions on the method of teaching Irish in the schools and on the revival of Irish. The teachers, with all their vast experience, were almost unanimous in stating that no progress was being made with the advancement of the Irish language&mdash;that the teaching of subjects through Irish, where children had not sufficient knowledge of the language, and in cases, too, perhaps where the teachers had not a sufficient knowledge of Irish either, was not making the advance that should be made.  That position still holds.  That report was submitted to the Department of Education.  I do not think any action was taken on it.</P>
    <P>We still have the same system.  We start teaching infants solely through Irish.  I do not know what my own opinion would be about that.  I do think that teaching subjects to infants through Irish does not matter very much.  Perhaps they can follow the teaching because their knowledge of the English language is not very wide. But when Irish is not the language in the home, when the parents have no knowledge of it and cannot help their children with their home lessons, it is utterly impossible to expect children in the Galltacht or the Breac Ghaeltacht or even the Gaeltacht to learn subjects such as mathematics, history and geography through the medium of Irish.  Of course, Irish is a compulsory subject.  It will always remain that while we have an Irish Government. It might perhaps be better if it were <Col N="711" /> taught as a language, first of all, until such time as the children in the various areas&mdash;in some areas perhaps sooner than in others&mdash;are able to understand it to such an extent that they can really imbibe the knowledge that later on will be imparted to them through Irish in the other school subjects.  I know that this is a controversial subject.  I am only giving my own view, but I believe that in doing so I am giving the view of the vast majority of the teachers of the country. It is unfortunate that, no matter what we have done for the Fíor-Ghaeltacht and the Gaeltacht, Irish is dwindling in those areas.  It is not for me to advance any causes now, as they are more or less well known.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the school, the child and the programme and now we come to the teachers, whom I refer to as the experts or skilled workers.  It is unfortunate that in many of our schools we have not fully qualified trained teachers.  I know it is the aim of the Department that we should have those. There are numbers of small country schools at present where you have teachers with only leaving certificate or matriculation, or those qualified as junior assistant mistresses.  They may be good teachers, they may do their work and do their best.  In many cases an untrained teacher has done work as good as that of a trained teacher; but training should be the hallmark.  In the schools in the most remote areas, the children and their parents deserve the highest qualified teachers just as much as those in cities and towns.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister for Education, in the early days of native government, was wise in setting up the preparatory schools where pupils intended for teachers are segregated and cut off entirely from any intercourse with the people outside.  I believe&mdash;and I have said so each time I spoke on this Estimate&mdash;that the training of teachers should be through the university.  I heard Professor Dr. O'Rahilly deliver a lecture at the Teachers' Congress in Killarney at Easter and I was very glad to note that <Col N="712" /> his ideas were akin to mine.  The idea is not exactly my own, although I, personally, always believed in it; it is also the view of the teachers' organisation. Just as doctors and solicitors have to go through the university, after getting matriculation or leaving certificate, and graduate there in certain degrees, so also a student who has taken out a degree such as Bachelor of Arts, Science or Commerce, and who expresses a wish to become a teacher, should be given facilities for entry to a training college.  That student may be regarded as having finished his education and as entering a training college for specialised training in putting his education into operation in schools.  That course should continue for at least one year and it is only when he has passed his final examination there in practical teaching that he should be regarded as qualified.  That would be better than the present system, where student teachers are cooped up in a preparatory school for four years and in a training college for two years, cut away entirely from society.  What I have suggested could be done, but I think the better system would be to complete the education in the university and get the practical training afterwards.</P>
    <P>The teacher would then be regarded as a member of a profession.  He would hold a higher social position in the community&mdash;which is only right, as the teacher who is moulding the minds of the young should be looked up to in the locality, not only as an educationist but as exemplary in every way and taking an active part in the affairs of the community around him or her.</P>
    <P>Full provision must be made also for remuneration.  It is only when a teacher is fully qualified that he can obtain the maximum salary of the profession. When there are untrained teachers of various kinds and junior assistant mistresses, their salary in these times is not a sufficient living wage&mdash;any more than it is for those who have attained the very highest rank and salary in their professions. This question of teachers' salaries has been a burning one down the years. Teachers have never been fully <Col N="713" /> satisfied, as they have never got what they asked.  I suppose no one is fully satisfied&mdash;the civil servants are not satisfied, the teachers are not satisfied, the farmers are not satisfied, and so on.  It was regrettable that once conciliation and arbitration was conceded in 1950 is was not continued by the present Minister.  It was a pity&mdash;from the point of view of the relationship that existed between the Minister and the Department and the teachers for some time, for over three years, until about a year ago&mdash;that that unfortunate incident should happen by which conciliation and arbitration was not continued.  Whoever was responsible for it, it was most unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Then comes the point that the teachers will get some extra remuneration because of the award being made to the civil servants.  The civil servants are not satisfied with their award from the 1st April last&mdash;and rightly so, because it should have been awarded from the 1st November last.  The teachers should get the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>If you must have conciliation and arbitration and it is conceded, there is no reason why it should not be continued, so that whenever the teachers had a grievance they could refer it to conciliation and, if that failed, to arbitration.  The award of the Arbitration Board should be carried out just as the award of the Labour Court is carried out by employers.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, it was not fair that the Minister or the Department of Education should have tried to impose conditions on teachers before the arbitration would be set up.  A certain class of teachers had a grievance and were taking their case to the courts, as they had a constitutional right to do.  If you want to have education advanced in this country, you must have a contented body of teachers.  If teachers are to be content, <Col N="714" /> like any other body, they must have the wherewithal to live in fairly decent comfort.  The conditions for the welfare of education are certainly well paid, qualified teachers, good schools, a suitable programme and an inspection system which will be agreeable to teachers and the Department. Any Minister of any Department should always endeavour to meet those demands and to see that they are carried out.  I am not saying that our Department and our Ministers are not doing their best.</P>
      <P>There is another matter in regard to teachers which has been debated and which has been put before the Department by the teachers' organisation during the past 20 years.  It is the question of the marriage ban. I need not go into the details of the arguments in favour of removing the marriage ban.  Of course, I know the Minister says there is no ban on marriage of teachers.  There is not.  But, when a lady teacher gets married she must give up her position.  I do not know who was first responsible for that rule but I am sure it is the cause of having so many untrained teachers at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It cost a large sum, not only to the State but also the parents of a girl student, for training.  After a year or two or, perhaps, three, four, five, six or seven years, a lady teacher may get married and must give up her position. That is detrimental to education because, if a lady teacher knows that she will have to retire on marriage and, as it is the desire, I am sure, of every lady and I am sure of the lady teacher, to get married, she will not pay that strict attention to her school work which she would pay to it if she were certain that she would be a teacher for 40 years.  It interferes with education.  It interferes with the welfare of the lady teachers.  On ethical grounds alone, it is not right or just. I would suggest that the Minister should again examine this problem and bring together, perhaps, members of the I.N.T.O. and the managers and the Hierarchy and discuss the rule whereby lady teachers are forced to retire on marriage.  Those lady teachers who entered the preparatory college or training college before the rule was <Col N="715" /> promulgated have a special grievance. They began their education in the preparatory college.  At that time they did not know they would have to retire on marriage.  Otherwise, perhaps, they would not have gone in that direction. It is not fair to those teachers. They, at least, for a start, should be allowed to continue to teach after marriage if they so desire.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of this Estimate.  There are aspects of it that concern vocational and secondary education.  I have dealt with it sufficiently from the point of view of primary education and will leave it to others who are interested in other matters to give their views.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the trouble that arose between teachers and the Departments of Education and Finance. There is another question in regard to pensioned teachers, those who retired prior to 1950.  The Minister gave an <i>ex gratia</i> grant.  That was welcomed and the pensioned teachers had the hope and still have the hope that they will eventually get the full sums to which they were entitled, to the same extent as the teachers who retired after the 1st January, 1950.  The real grievance in connection with the <i>ex gratia</i> grant was that it was paid in three instalments except in a case where it was £50 or under.  If the Minister could have paid it in one instalment it would certainly have brought about greater agreement amongst those pensioned teachers.  As there is no provision made for the payment of it in one instalment, I suppose it must go on now to be paid in three instalments.</P>
    <P>So far as the Minister and the officials of the Department are concerned, they have always been very courteous and anxious to meet my view in any case which I referred to them on behalf of teachers who had a grievance or any other matter.  Despite what may be said about their being bureaucratic, so far as I am personally concerned and so far as I know from other Deputies or people with whom I have discussed the matter they are always ready and willing to do their best to try to meet the reasonable <Col N="716" /> demands of those who approach them on matters in which they or other parties may be interested.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the Minister's statement, copies of which were supplied to Deputies who could not follow the Irish.  It is very informative and encouraging.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on the information contained therein.  I note with a certain amount of gratification the progress that is about to be made in connection with the retarded or backward child.  Almost every year I have had cause to refer to the neglect of the retarded or backward child.  I want to congratulate the Minister on his personal interest in the matter.  He said with regard to backward and retarded children that the number of these in small rural schools is so few that they do not constitute a problem, but in cities, particularly in Dublin, there is urgent need for action that will tend to ameliorate the defects which arise in conditions hitherto unconsidered. I am very happy to know that these children are now being considered and that the Minister has found a group of people highly interested in the backward or retarded child who, because of some little defect, is not able to absorb the education imparted to it.  The Minister tells us that a class was started on the initiative of a few gifted teachers who are deeply concerned with the welfare of such children and that the class has been eminently successful, successful even to the extent that a significant percentage of these retarded children are now able to pass into the ordinary classes and look after themselves.  The Minister will not mind my taking some little pride in the fact that I have been raising this matter for some years.  It was very gratifying to hear the Minister say that that class is meeting with great success and that he intends to have a survey made of the other schools all over the city to see what can be done for any backward or retarded children in these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on that, I wish the Minister would not alone do it in Dublin but in other places.  In almost every town and village in Ireland, in fact in nearly every parish there is at least one backward <Col N="717" /> or retarded child.  These children should be collected with the approval of their parents or the parents should notify the Education Department that they are prepared to allow the children to go to some special place of training in order to overcome whatever little defect they may have.  It would pay the parents handsomely to have such children made efficient or partly efficient.  As well as that, in every town and village there may be a deaf or blind child.  It is a pity, because of the fact that they are so distant from one another, that something cannot be done to bring them together so that they can be made the efficient citizens which the Minister has shown by his example he is anxious for them to become.</P>
    <P>I hope the parents will take up the matter.  Parents do not like to part with a backward or retarded child or some child which may be deaf or dumb.  If the parents could see the advantage of having such children properly looked after it would be a very good thing for the children and for the parents.</P>
    <P>The Minister also dealt very effectively and encouragingly with the question of vocational education.  He said that the vocational system develops and reaches a higher standard of achievement each year, and that this year there are 211 vocational schools with a record number of almost 90,000 students, which number would be much swollen if we could provide the needed accommodation and the necessary extra teachers.  For many years I have been drawing attention to the fact that every time a vocational school is opened in the City of Dublin there is a rush of boys and girls anxious to avail of the facilities for vocational education.  It is a terrible pity that, owing to lack of accommodation and teachers, students who are anxious to avail of vocational training have to line up in queues and that more than half of them are disappointed because they cannot secure entry into vocational schools.  That means that these boys or girls will very often drift into some sort of cul-de-sac employment.  I would ask the Minister to encourage the corporation to open still more schools.  I know that there <Col N="718" /> is co-operation between them at the moment and that every effort is being made to increase the number of vocational schools so that there will not be a number of boys and girls disappointed in the future.  The corporation vocational committee is doing a wonderful job and doing it well, but I know the chairman, who is present in this House, will not mind my drawing attention to the fact that more and more schools are wanted in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Dublin City is extending rapidly.  It is a pity that those who think that Dublin consists of the square mile around the Nelson Pillar do not go out into the outskirts, to Cabra, Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Milltown and Donnybrook, and see the magnificent houses that the corporation, with the aid of the State, are building.  That means, of course, that more vocational schools and more national schools are required for the children.  In that connection, I should like to express the hope that the Minister will still continue his interest in the provision of national schools.  I do not want to throw blame on anybody, as sometimes there is a difficulty with regard to parish finances, but when the corporation decide on providing suitable housing schemes in outlying districts I should like the Minister to see that schools are started at the same time.  In these districts the people have little or no money and the parish manager may be faced with the building of three or four big schools to hold 1,000 pupils.  That is a very big job for a parish manager. I suggest that in these cases a site should be given free of charge for the building of schools and that, if possible, the school should be ready for occupation when the houses are built. Children in these districts who were formerly living in the city have to travel three or four miles in buses to schools in the city.  I agree that the bus fare is not too high as the Minister made some special arrangement.  But, if four or five children in a family have to come to the city from Finglas or Ballyfermot, the parents have to pay one penny each way for these children. I do not know whether it is a penny return fare, but the fact remains that they have to pay these fares for <Col N="719" /> children coming into the city.  If there are any free buses in the city I do not know of them.  I think some arrangement could be made by which the Minister would be notified when the corporation intends to embark on a housing scheme in any particular area in which, perhaps, there might be up to 2,000 children and he should insist that, as far as possible, the new school should be ready for the children when they come to reside in the new houses.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the question of repairs to some of the old schools.  First of all I want to say that new schools built on the outskirts of the city with the co-operation of the Government and the parish managers, are amongst the finest not only in Ireland but in Europe.  We have some of the finest schools in Europe.  As against that we have some schools in a very backward condition which could be much improved with a little extra expenditure.</P>
    <P>Another matter referred to in the Minister's statement was the storage in the Museum and in the National Library of some very valuable exhibits. Whether they are of paper, marble or canvass they are stored, it appears, in the basement cellars.  It is a great pity that we should have that happening in a city such as this&mdash;that for the sake of space some very fine exhibits of all classes are stored out of sight and cannot be seen by the people.  I appeal to the Minister to see that the public will get an opportunity of seeing these exhibits and that the people in charge of our Museum and our National Gallery should get an opportunity of showing to the best possible advantage the treasures they have to exhibit.</P>
    <P>There is just one other matter to which I should like to refer.  The last speaker who has some practical knowledge of the people concerned has already dealt with it.  Many teachers were retired say, five, six or ten years ago, on pensions of about £200 or £300.  Considering that £200 ten years ago would be worth according to today's values only £86&mdash;so the economists say&mdash;I think the time has come when the Government should consider <Col N="720" /> giving those people who served as teachers some compensation for the depreciation in the value of money since.  This is, indeed, a matter that affects ex-officials of all kinds who retired some years ago on pensions that were considered very good at the time.  I earnestly hope that the Minister will recommend that all these ex-teachers, for whom he is responsible, should get an increase in their pensions to enable them to buy the same quantity of the necessaries of life as they were able to buy when they first retired.  At the present time they are not in a position to buy a sufficient quantity of the necessaries of life because of high prices.  The Minister is, I think, in a position to recommend that the teachers who retired some years ago, for whom, as I say, he is responsible, should be placed in a position to share in the good things of this world.</P>
    <P>I should like, in conclusion, to compliment the Minister on the very informative paper which he has supplied to Deputies.  There is quite an amount of useful information in it.  I have no doubt that other Deputies will have some comments to make on it and will give the Minister the meed of encouragement that is his due.  My principal object in speaking was to bring to the notice of the Minister the position in regard to retarded children, the absence of facilities for vocational training, the number of people who are disappointed in consequence, and, lastly, the question of the position of pensioned teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardButler" hpid="Mr. Butler Mr. Butler">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of reference has already been made to the question of primary education and vocational education.  I propose to limit my remarks to a question that I think is unlikely to be ventilated otherwise here, at least judging from past experience. I want to make a strong plea to the Minister for an increase in the capitation grant to secondary schools.  The capitation grant for juniors, that is, up to the intermediate certificate stage, has been £8; and for seniors, that is, up to leaving certificate stage, £10. That grant was fixed in 1929 and the grant has remained at the same figure since, in spite of the devaluation of the <Col N="721" /> £ and the increase in outgoings of all sorts&mdash;repairs to buildings, new buildings and increased wages to employees such as caretakers, cleaners, groundsmen, etc.  All these costs have soared, and still the capitation grant remains as fixed in 1929.  I do not think that any figure fixed as fair in 1929 could now be regarded as fair.  I think the grant could be doubled without leaving the schools one whit better off than they were in 1929.  The secondary schools are privately owned, most of them by religious communities, and the Department does not contribute directly to the cost of construction or repairs.  Of course, the capitation grant helps to defray the cost of repairs, to pay the basic salaries of teachers and to keep down fees, but I wonder does the 1929 figure hold good in any other Department with regard to upkeep or general expenses?</P>
      <P>There are about 60 Catholic lay secondary schools throughout Ireland. Most of them are in small remote towns or villages.  In the most remote town or village you may have one, two or three very brilliant boys or girls who would be an ornament to any profession or a success in any calling. Where they have to leave school, just after receiving a primary education and are unable to go further, I think it is nothing short of a tragedy.</P>
      <P>Special consideration should be given to these schools in remote villages and towns run by university graduates, fully qualified teachers. Each of these schools must have three to four fully qualified teachers.  Most of those teachers are married.  But for these schools many of them would have to emigrate.  As it is they provide facilities for education which would otherwise be lacking.  If these schools did not exist children would have to travel long distances or their parents would have to send them to boarding schools.  They may not be able to afford to do that and the children will have to go without.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These schools are run by private enterprise for the benefit of the working man's son, the labourer's son and the sons of tradesmen and small business people.  Consequently the fees <Col N="722" /> have to be low and they range from six guineas a year upwards.  These schools play a very important part and I appeal to the Minister to increase the capitation grant given to such schools. Usually these establishments hold their own with technical schools where the feet is as a rule a nominal charge of 10/- per session.</P>
    <P>These teachers build their own schools.  The building and equipment of a modest technical school in a rural area would at the moment cost about £30,000.  The State pays that.  It pays the teachers.  It pays the caretaker. It pays for heating and lighting.</P>
    <P>The request for an increased capitation grant comes from every quarter, from the Catholic clerical headmasters, the convents, the Brothers and the Protestant authorities.  Several bishops have spoken about the matter.  On the 20th December, 1952, the Most Rev. Dr. Rogers, Coadjutor Bishop of Killaloe, when addressing parents and students at St. Flannan's College, said that under a native Government, secondary schools had been seriously neglected in Ireland in regard to educational grants which were not now meeting the needs of such schools.  The cost of living had considerably increased. Yet, there had been no increase in the grants.  Money could, however, be found for other schemes and could be found for universities but, if the secondary schools were not given favourable consideration for grants, then the universities would soon be empty.</P>
    <P>On the 20th December, 1952, the Right Rev. Dr. Harvey, Bishop of Cashel and Emly, Waterford and Lismore, presiding at the annual distribution of prizes at the Bishop Foy school in Waterford, referred to the financial aspect which he described as not being very satisfactory.  He said that the service which a voluntary school, such as the Bishop Foy school, performs for the community is not receiving adequate consideration.  He said it was very ironical and very tantalising to the board of governors that in all matters under their control they could achieve success and give pupils a balanced education but they <Col N="723" /> could not balance income with expenditure owing to the ever-rising cost of maintenance, which was beyond their control.  He said that state of things could continue for a while but not indefinitely. There was a temptation to cut down or postpone repairs, to reduce dietary, to offer inadequate salaries to their staff and all the while the Government capitation grant remained stationary since 1929.  His Lordship said that the Government had accepted in principle the subsidising of voluntary schools and he said that the corollary to that should be that this subsidy was in proportion to their needs, and it certainly was not that at present.  He said other voices have been raised drawing attention to this fact and we should be failing in our duty if we did not add our own support to those voices.</P>
    <P>That shows that this request is coming from every quarter in the sphere of secondary education.  I appeal to the Minister to make special provision for the small rural schools with under 50 or 100 pupils.  I think these should get £1 or £2 per head more than the large schools with 500 to 3,000 pupils.  It is unfair to pay the same capitation grant to the small school as is paid to the large school. The secondary school with 30 pupils must have at least three teachers to cope with the pre-intermediate years, the intermediate year and the leaving certificate.  A large school with three teachers can deal with, and teach, from 120 to 200 pupils.</P>
    <P>The vocational schools are doing excellent work.  I do not think that they are getting one penny too much for what they are doing.  I think that if one were to make a comparison between what the technical schools are costing and what the secondary schools are costing one would find that the position is rather amazing.  It would lead one to the conclusion that a great deal more should be done to help the secondary schools.  I do not wish to say anything more on this question. The other points have been touched on already but that is an aspect of education that I feared might pass without comment during this debate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> I would like to say that I thoroughly agree with Deputy Palmer when he says that our method of recruiting teachers is really a bad one.  He suggested another method which, I think, would be very good.  From my own experience, I know for a fact that the old monitorial system of recruitment was far better than the one at present obtaining.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Palmer when he attaches such great importance to education.  I think it is the most important of all things.  A great deal, at least, of juvenile delinquency and juvenile crime, if one likes to put it as harshly as that, is due to the lack of education in the home and, possibly, in the school, for the simple reason that very often these unfortunate children are not sent to school at all. That only points back to the fact that their parents themselves were not properly educated.  Crime among adults, too, I am quite convinced, is largely due to the lack of proper education in the home, first of all, and, later, in the schools.  If parents neglect the home and the school with regard to their children, there is no use in hoping that these unfortunate children will profit much by anything they will hear in Church.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to mention.  I would like to express my appreciation of the school medical service.  I wish indeed that it could be extended.  A great deal has been said here this evening about mentally defective children.  I was quite amazed, after years of teaching, to find that children whom I had regarded as backward or possibly bordering on mental deficiency were backward simply because of eye trouble or partial deafness.  I found that when these children got proper treatment for their eyes and their ears they went ahead in a way that was most amazing to me.  I hope that the school medical service will be extended, if possible.  To my own knowledge, T.B., as well as defects in regard to hearing and eyesight, have been spotted in the schools on the occasion of the doctor's visit.  I think that is a great development and a <Col N="725" /> great blessing.  I hope it will continue, and that it will be extended.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire as ucht an óráid a rinne sé inniu.  Theasbáin sé go raibh suim mhór aige in a Roinn féin agus sa cheist Oideachais ar fad.  Ní rabhas anseo nuair bhí sé ag caint, ach is dóigh liom gur labhair sé i nGaeilge. Mhol sé é sin a dhéanamh.

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the speech he delivered here to-day in the native tongue in which he is so proficient.  My only reason for making my introductory remarks in Irish was to make some little use of the Irish I have, and thereby give some good example, for what it is worth, to those who have even a little less or a little more Irish than I have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like, first of all, to refer to the Irish Language.  I think that the Minister, in his brief reference to it, summed up pretty well the situation as far as the Irish language is concerned. There was one true remark that he made, although I think it could be given a wrong slant.  I cannot get his exact words at the moment, but I think he did say that the progress of Irish in the schools was satisfactory.  I think that is a fact. The progress of Irish in the schools is satisfactory, but the progress of the language in the country, as far as I can observe, is not satisfactory.  That is so because I think the problem lies within the schools.  The treatment of the Irish language within the schools is the source of the whole problem of the revival of the language.  I have always been of the opinion&mdash;I think I have spoken in much the same strain on this practically every year&mdash;that, as long as Irish is regarded as a school subject on the same par with English literature, mathematics, geography and other subjects, the language will not progress.  If the young boys and girls of this nation believe that Irish is an obligation, that it is a subject which must be passed in examinations, <Col N="726" /> then the very first thought that enters their minds, when they leave school, is to have nothing to do with something that has been a burden to them while they were at school.</P>
    <P>I know that argument can be knocked this way, that way, and the other way.  As far as anybody's experience goes, it is this, that in the majority of cases young boys and girls in the primary and in the secondary schools will, immediately they leave school show that they have no great liking for the Irish language.  What we should be trying to do is to get them to love the language.  As I say, as long as we treat Irish as a subject, such as arithmetic, English literature, physics and geography, we are not going to have progress.  I believe, not from experience, but from speaking with people who were active in the language movement at the time that much more progress was being made with regard to the revival of the Irish language when the Gaelic League was at its strongest than is being made now.  I move to report Progress.</P>

      <P>Deputy McQuillan has given notice that he wishes to raise on the order for the Adjournment the subject matter of Question No. 1 of the 7th May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of time at my disposal for this question is so limited and the subject matter of the question is so important that I am sure many people here would say that there are other ways of dealing with it.  I agree entirely with that point of view.  However, there is an urgency about this matter and the rules of procedure here limit me as a private Deputy with regard to making my views clear at any length on this subject.  Perhaps a motion would be the most suitable method, but if I submit a motion it is quite possible that it will be at least 12 months before <Col N="727" /> it comes up for discussion in the Dáil.  There is urgency about the matter and I hope that, when I have finished and have given my reasons for raising this question, there will be no need for me to put down any formal motion for discussion later on.</P>
      <P>The question that I asked on 7th May was addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I asked if,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;in view of the demand abroad for Irish whiskey and the necessity for safeguarding our national economy by building up our export trade, particularly in hard currency areas, he will seek such powers as are necessary, by the introduction of proposals for legislation, to enable his Department as a responsible authority to foster and develop the export of this commodity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As I indicated in reply to a previous question, official assistance in seeking and developing foreign markets for Irish whiskey is provided for the business interests concerned as a normal practice.  No special powers are required to enable my Department to render such assistance, and it is not necessary to introduce legislation for this purpose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There are two main reasons which induced me to put down that question. The first is the fact that this year there was a considerable reduction in the acreage of malting barley, as a result of the fall in the consumption of whiskey on the home market during the past 12 months.  This fall in the production of barley has come at a time when we all advocated an increased tillage campaign.  The second reason was that I discovered that last year Scotland exported whiskey to the value of £32,000,000 and that in the same period the value of the export of Irish whiskey amounted to less than £500,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his reply to me, the Minister stated that he indicated in a former reply to me a certain line of action. In the former reply he suggested that the export of Irish whiskey was primarily a matter for the business interests <Col N="728" /> concerned.  I do not agree at all with that point of view.  I believe that it was the Department's viewpoint which was declared in this House and I do not believe that it is Government policy.  I say that we must look on this as a matter of national importance, that it transcends the personal interests of the distillers.</P>
    <P>I say with a full sense of responsibility that if the distilling industry were properly developed it could become our most valuable money earner.  It could surpass the cattle trade and also the tourist business.  If the same efforts and the same expenditure were undertaken in developing a market for our whiskey as is being expended on the attraction of tourists, I have no hesitation in saying that, relatively speaking, we could become one of the most prosperous little countries in the world.</P>
    <P>I think that grave mistakes have been made in the past, both by the different Governments in office and by the distillers, in dealing with this business.  It is not too late to remedy the situation, but no time can be lost now, especially when we consider the dangerous situation that exists this year.  There is a big reduction in the acreage of malting barley being sown. That means that next October, when the distilling starts, there will be a consequent decrease in the amount of whiskey distilled.  This trend will become really apparent only in five or seven years' time, when the whiskey distilled this year has matured.  In five or seven years' time there will be, on this years' distilling programme, only a very limited amount available&mdash; possibly not enough to supply the home market, never mind trying to improve the export trade.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that this year, on the average, the maltsters have reduced their contracts by at least 50 per cent. to the farmers for the production of malting barley.  I know personally of one distillery that last year purchased 15,000 barrels of malting barley for distilling purposes and this year the purchase by that company was 3,000 barrels.  That is a serious reduction.  I could not get the figures from some of the other distillers.  I <Col N="729" /> know they use native fuel for firing their furnaces and if there is a decrease in the amount of whiskey distilled, there will be a decrease in the amount of fuel used and a consequent increase in the amount of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to emphasise that the distilling industry is a very important arm of agriculture; yet no aspect of agriculture has been so grossly neglected.  It is beyond contradiction that all the products of the land should be processed to the last degree by Irish workers.  I think it is mandatory on an Irish Government to foster and develop an industry that can be based on the raw materials that come from the land.  The distilling industry means barley for the maltster; it means a rich cash crop to the farmer; it means excellent employment for the worker; it means whiskey for export; and it means a residue of grain to feed the farmers' live stock. In addition, it has been discovered recently that the waste product discharged up to this from the distilleries can now be processed into an excellent food for pigs.  This product is at present being used in various places in the country and is highly recommended by those who go in for pig-breeding.  In other words, the making of whiskey is a cycle of industrial perfection.  From the time the barley seed goes into the ground until the finished product is listed over the bar counter, there is first-class employment, there is tillage and there is absolutely no wastage.  All the by-products of the whiskey can be utilised for other purposes.  Yet, as I have already pointed out, last year Scotland exported £32,000,000 worth of whiskey and our export was only less than £500,000 worth.</P>
    <P>We make the best whiskey in the world.  The raw material grows on our land.  We have the best technicians available.  Yet we allow the world market to be captured and held by foreign distillers who sell an inferior product.</P>
    <P>It is time action was taken to remedy this deplorable state of affairs.  I do not believe, and neither does the Minister believe, that the export of Irish whiskey is primarily a matter for the business interests concerned.  I do not <Col N="730" /> accept that the Government or the Minister really take that view.</P>
    <P>In his reply to me the Minister admitted that during the emergency and up to quite recently there was a restriction on the export of whiskey from this country.  I believe that was a short-sighted policy when we should have been endeavouring to get our foot in the world market.  I do not want for a moment to suggest that it was wrong to prohibit the export of whiskey to England and Scotland but, if we looked at it in the way that the British and the Scotch looked at it, we would have taken a different line of action.  During that same period, the Northern distillers restricted their home market in order to capture the foreign market.  In Scotland the very same line of action was taken.  In order to capture the world market, they restricted the amount of whiskey available in Scotland and England.  The restriction imposed in the North of Ireland was on the home market.</P>
    <P>The case may be made here that it was impossible for us to export whiskey to America and elsewhere during those years.  That is something that the time at my disposal is too short to deal with but many ships made the journey from here to America and they only carried ballast.</P>
    <P>Having, if you like, criticised the Government's attitude, I say that as far as the Irish distillers are concerned they have shown a deplorable lack of initiative and enterprise.  Their attitude has been one of complacency.  They have shown no desire to break into the world market.  Their attitude, in the words of the secretary of the distillers' association recently, has been that the industry must depend on the home market as the export market is problematical in these times.  When you have that line of argument put up by the distillers, there is very little hope that they, unless urged on by the Government, will take the necessary action to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Much can be said about the fact that many of them failed to plough back their profits into improving machinery and so forth.  I do not propose to go into that but I would like to say that this is a national problem and we <Col N="731" /> should not be frightened about the rights of private enterprise.  To my mind, it is time that the Government either order those who control this industry to develop it in the national interest or intervene to do so themselves, even if it meant nationalisation.</P>
    <P>In my question I asked the Minister if he would seek such powers as are necessary, by the introduction of proposals for legislation, to enable his Department to foster and develop the export of this commodity.  The Minister replied that such special powers were not required.  I am glad to hear it. If that is the case, it makes it all the easier to solve the problem.  I am suggesting that the Minister, as first step, should summon a conference of the distillers and point out to them the necessity for a united co-operative effort on their part just as the Scotch, in 1920, got agreement amongst themselves to produce a standard whiskey for export.  In order to obtain this product each distiller should be allowed to supply so much whiskey to a pool, to contribute his share.  That would in no way interfere with their whiskey for the home market.  I know that some of the distillers are willing and anxious to co-operate in this respect. This product should then receive the official backing and recommendation of the Government and an intensive campaign should be launched throughout America.  All our Irish Societies and Irish-American Societies should be contacted and every energy and drive that we have at our disposal through Córas Tráchtála should be roped in in order to get this trade in America.</P>
    <P>There are other markets that can and should be tackled.  I refer in particular to Canada where at present serious restrictions are imposed on the importation of whiskey but where, I understand, a change is likely to take place with regard to these restrictions within the next few years.  The other market I refer to is Africa.  I understand that some firms have already secured a limited market there but they are not in a position to advertise in a big way. That would take State help.</P>
    <P>These potential markets must be <Col N="732" /> explored to the utmost.  I know that some of the distillers are conservative and opposed to co-operation in that effort.  I know also that the Minister, who is a very able man, and has done a great deal to build up Irish industry, can deal with these people in his own way.  Steps must be taken to bring them to their senses.  I am confident that the Minister, if he concentrates on this problem, will do much to increase the prosperity of the country and give first-class employment to the people at home and, in addition, do much to solve the problem of our balance of payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody would like to see increased exports of whiskey or any other home-produced commodity, but we will not get them either by wishing for them or by refusing to face up to the facts of the situation. The predominance of Scotch whiskey in the world's export markets did not begin this year or last year or even during the recent war.  It began 50 years ago and, whoever was responsible for the mistaken commercial policies followed by the Irish distilleries then, there is nothing much we can do about it now.  The world market is for a Scotch type of whiskey.  That is my view.  Not all the Irish distillers agree with that.  They consider that they have built up a fair trade in potstill whiskey of the kind that we Irish like and that they may well jeopardise that trade by marketing as Irish whiskey a blended product of the Scotch type.</P>
      <P>We have, however, carried out through Córas Tráchtála a market survey in the dollar countries.  That survey appears to support my view that the predominant demand is for a blended whiskey, and that even with a suitable blended whiskey properly packed a very substantial trade promotion campaign would be necessary to secure sales in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If whiskey exports are not expanding at present, it is not because we have not got whiskey to export.  The stocks of whiskey now in bond are substantially higher than the stocks normally carried in pre-war years. What proportion of these stocks is represented <Col N="733" /> by matured whiskey I could not say.  The quantity of new whiskey distilled last year was higher than in pre-war years.  The volume of new distillation depends largely upon the orders available to the distilleries. Only a small proportion of the whiskey produced by the distilleries is held by them in bond until maturity and marketed by them under their own trade name.  Some distilleries do not market any matured whiskey.  They produce only green whiskey for sale as such to blenders and bonders.  Even the larger distilleries determine the volume of their distillations on the basis of the orders received by them from whiskey bonders and private commercial firms who calculate the size of their orders on the basis of their estimate as to how the market is going to go.</P>
    <P>It is a very difficult trade because, as the Deputy mentioned, no whiskey is allowed to be sold here until it is at least five years old, and it is the normal practice of most of our major distilleries not to sell whiskey until it is seven years old.  Under the American law, we cannot ship whiskey there at any lower age than that at which we will permit it to be consumed at home, so that even from the point of view of developing an American market we must think of the conditions likely to prevail five years hence when deciding upon the policy to be followed to-day.</P>
    <P>It is true that we restricted the export of whiskey during the war.  Deliberately, we decided that our interests required a different policy from that adopted by the British Government. We were concerned to maintain adequate supplies for the home market and to maintain a corresponding revenue to the Exchequer.  In different circumstances, the British Government decided to withdraw supplies of whiskey from their own people in order to increase their exports and they are still following that policy, so that the total quantity of Scotch whiskey now being sold in Britain is less than the British market is capable of absorbing.  As I said, I still do not think it is necessary for us to follow the same policy here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> It is true that whiskey sales have fallen here.  It is also a fact that they have fallen everywhere else.  There has been a substantial drop in whiskey sales in America.  What the reason for that is I do not know.  It is true that Scotch whiskey exports to America did not fall, but Scotch whiskey exports only represent about 5 per cent of the American whiskey consumption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Should not that leave a very big opening for the Irish product if we had proper publicity in America?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My personal view is that there has to be a blend of potstill and patent whiskey, whiskey of the Scotch type.  I do not think that all the distillers would agree with that but, as I said, my view has been supported by the market survey carried out by Córas Tráchtála.  A number of exporters are carrying big stocks at the moment.  Whiskey exports are moving slowly.  Therefore, any falling-off in exports this year will not be due to the non-availability of supplies or the lack of efforts by the firms concerned to sell them, but to conditions prevailing in export markets.</P>
      <P>In a number of countries it has been decided to cut down whiskey imports for balance of payments considerations. They may ease their restrictions later.  Many countries have import restrictions which make it particularly difficult to trade with them.  Where quotas for whiskey were negotiated under trade agreements the necessary facilities have not always been freely and fully provided.</P>
      <P>Developing the export trade in whiskey on a substantial scale&mdash;we may not hope to reach the Scotch level, but we can hope to reach a level higher than the present one&mdash;will be a long-term project which will involve very careful consideration of the issues likely to arise.  One of the issues is whether we should change our policy to permit of the sale of whiskey here at three years old.  Under the American law, we cannot export to that country at a lower maturity than we allow the retail sale of it at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we did reduce the maturity of <Col N="735" /> whiskey sold here to three-years old, would it mean a greater import of Scotch whiskey?  It might.  At present, the fact that whiskey sold here must be five years old probably constitutes some sort of protection for Irish distilleries, because Scotch whiskey, three years old can be fairly readily sold at the present time.  If we do not reduce the maturity of whiskey to be sold here, can we hope to compete with the Scotch in the dollar market with five-year old whiskey which would be dearer than the three-year-old whiskey the Scotch sell?</P>
    <P>These problems are being considered at present.  I had a number of conferences with the distillers and merchants concerned, before the war and during the war.  During the war I drew the attention of the distillers to the prospects of the post-war period and offered them unlimited facilities for new distillations to meet post-war trade.  While we restricted the exports of spirits in a total quantity during the war, so far as the dollar markets were concerned, the distillers clearly understood that they would get supplementary licences for all the sales they could effect there.</P>
    <P>Further conferences have been held recently.  To an extent, they have been <Col N="736" /> inspired by representations received from certain merchants who are holding substantial stocks of whiskey and do not mind who takes them from them, even if it is the Government. To an extent, they have been inspired by various possibilities which have presented themselves as a result of the operations of Córas Tráchtála.  I would not like to see the Government going into this business.  It is far too complicated a business to be run by civil servants.  It has to be directed by commercial enterprise seeking its own interest.  Decisions must be made from day to day and month to month of a kind which are likely to arise from the lively appreciation of personal interests rather than considerations of general policy.  Whether the discussion now proceeding between Córas Tráchtála on the one hand and the organisation called the Whiskey Exporters' Association and the distilleries on the other, together with other Government agencies which might be interested, will produce a practical and agreed method for tackling the problem I do not know, but the effort certainly will be made.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 6.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 9th June, 1953.</P>
