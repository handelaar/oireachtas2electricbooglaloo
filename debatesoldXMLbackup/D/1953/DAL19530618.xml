      <P>(2) Where the seconder of a motion proposed by a private member has not made a speech in the course of the debate on the motion, a period of not less than a quarter of an hour shall be allowed for a speech in reply which may be given by the proposer, or such other member who has not already spoken as the proposer may authorise in that behalf.</P>

    <P>This motion, which is an amendment of Standing Order 83, was recommended by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and was circulated to Deputies recently.  The proposed amendment is reproduced verbatim in the motion and is, as stated in the report, designed to remove a source of discontent which has arisen from the application of the time limit on Private Members' Motions.</P>
    <P>The effect of the suggested amendment is to provide formally for an allotted period for a closing speech from or on behalf of the proposer when the seconder of a motion had not made a speech in the course of the debate on the motion.  It will be noted that the proposer can if he wishes select a member to close the debate provided that that member has not already spoken.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dail Éireann hereby approves of the Sugar (Prohibition of Import) Order, 1953.</P>
      <P>The House is, I think, aware that under the Sugar Import Act, 1936, an Order made prohibiting the importation of sugar has validity for a period of 12 months only.  Every year since the Act was passed a motion of this kind has been submitted to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if the recent increase in the retail price of sugar was due to higher import costs or to higher prices paid to home producers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The recent increase was, of course, due almost entirely to the need to withdraw the levy on sugar used in the export trade. Another factor affecting the price of sugar was increased costs within the country, but not of imports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was merely a shifting of the burden on to the domestic consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In a sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>What would the total increase amount to roughly for the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain.  The position was that up to the present the domestic consumer was enjoying the benefit of a subsidy, the subsidy being made possible by reason of a levy on sugar used in the export trade.  Now that international conditions have made it impossible to continue that levy without prejudice to important export industries the situation has to be rectified and sugar sold at an economic price to everybody.  Last year the quantity of sugar used in export was about 35,000 to 40,000 tons.  What it may be this year is, of course, a matter of speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the total amount involved in the change?  What is the total amount involved in putting ½d. per lb. on the domestic consumer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a ½d. per lb. upon roughly 100,000 tons of sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say to the nearest date for which he has figures what is the proportion of our imports now as compared with our home production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year imports were 66,000 tons and home production 82,000 tons.  This year it is expected that home production may be as high as 100,000 tons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Minister that the last time there was a saving to the Exchequer of some £200,000 which has been conveniently forgotten.  Now, once again, the consumer is being asked to take the rap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchequer does not come into this at all and is not involved in this transaction.  The proceeds of the levy on export sugar went <Col N="1562" /> to the Sugar Company and were used to reduce the price of sugar sold at home.  There is no question of any benefit to the Exchequer either way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Where these adjustments take place there should be a fair balance in the aggregate as far as the consumer is concerned.  If the Exchequer saves on one particular commodity, such as it did in the case of bread prices, surely the next time an opportunity arises to adjust prices the consumer should not be asked to bear the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchequer does not come into this at all.  I think it is only fair to the Sugar Company to point out that the price at which they are producing and selling sugar is much lower than in most European countries.  So far as I know there is no country in Europe in which sugar is sold at a lower price without a subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also fair to point out that Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll having swallowed the camel is now straining at the gnat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>What does this increase mean to the Sugar Company?  I have seen some of the profits of the Sugar Company.  Is there any justification for putting on this ½d.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Without it they would certainly be working at a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter about which we argue with the Sugar Company. The company think that the profits allowed at the present time on present prices are inadequate to permit of their normal development.  I think they are adequate, but we have constant arguments on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who studies the balance sheets sees they have a profit of £77,000.  They should not get any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a small profit on the total capital invested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This impost of ½d. in the lb. works out at £4 8s. per ton. On 100,000 tons it would amount to <Col N="1563" /> over £500,000.  It is another £500,000 taxation on the ordinary domestic consumer, a shifting of the burden from those who are well able to bear it to those who are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy says &ldquo;those who are well able to bear it&rdquo;, may I remind him that we have industries here engaged in an export trade that was worth £12,000,000 to the country last year?  Does the Deputy think we should kill that trade by continuing to levy a tax upon export sugar, a tax which would have the effect of making those exports no longer possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is suggesing that the export trade should be damaged in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Deputy suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am suggesting that the Minister is trying to conceal the fact that this impost is any hardship on the consumer and that the ½d. does not mean anything.  It means over £500,000.  I merely want to emphasise that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the Control of Imports (Quota No. 13) <Col N="1564" /> (Artificial Silk Piece Goods Amendment) Order, 1953.</P>
    <P>I have circulated an explanatory memorandum on this matter, an innovation which, I am sure, the House will welcome.  When we amended the Quota Order relating to woollen and worsted piece goods so as to bring within its scope spun rayon cloths manufactured to assemble woollen and worsted suitings we limited its application to cloths 37 inches, or more, in width.  Subsequently imports of cloth of 28 inches in width began to arrive, the effect of which was of course to defeat the object of the Quota Order. This new Order is now being made to amend that Order so as to catch these spun rayon suitings 18 inches in width, or greater.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that fully but I am also fully aware of the difficulty.  There are very definite difficulties in many cases for makers proving to the satisfaction of the Department that their application for a duty-free licence is necessary.  There are very great difficulties.  Perhaps there should be difficulties, but what I am concerned with, and I am sure the Minister is concerned with it too, is to see that in trying to close one gap, so to speak, we do not open another gap which will adversely affect another part of the trade just as important, if not more important, from our point of view and from the employment point of view.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on Section 15, as amended.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on Section 15 was adjourned last night, I had said&mdash;and I want to repeat it now&mdash;that this section is the fundamental section in the Bill.  It enshrines the principle which Deputy Dr. Browne and his colleagues, Deputy Cowan and Deputy Cogan, refused to accept or refused to allow to be inserted in the proposals which Deputy Dr. Browne himself had and which led to the general election and the change of Government with all the consequences which have followed from that.  It is, as I say, the fundamental section in the Bill.  I want to make it clear again, as we have so often in this debate made it clear, that we are not objecting to that principle.  As a matter of fact, it was on that principle that the situation came about which led to the change of Government.  It seems to me difficult to understand that Deputies are now prepared to accept something, if not more than, they were asked to accept on the previous occasion. Deputies who brought about the situation in which we find ourselves discussing this section to-day instead of having in operation for the last three years a better Bill, will, I am sure, let us hear their views on it and will be only glad to get an opportunity of defending their acceptance of the principle in Section 15.

I am not trying to discuss previous proposals. All I am saying is that if certain members of this House were prepared to accept three or four years ago what apparently they are prepared to accept now we would not be discussing this Bill or section at all. We would have had in operation over the last two or three years an infinitely better Bill.  Let Deputies justify how their action has helped to improve the health of the people in the meantime by putting the absolute necessities of life and good health beyond the reach of the people.  There will be greater demands under Section 15 because of what has taken place in the last few years.  Essential nutritious foods are being put beyond the reach of certain people.</P>

On the Committee Stage of a highly contentious Bill and a Bill which purports, but only purports, to change the whole of our medical and surgical services in this country, Deputies are not merely entitled but are in duty bound to examine each section and amendment in a detailed way.  If we had more detailed examination of measures on Committee Stage in this House we would have less bad legislation.</P>

      <P>I am going to repeat what I said in case the Minister's interruptions may have smothered it.  The actions of the Government and those who support and keep them in office have reduced the people's resistance to disease in the last two years because essential nutritious food has been put beyond the reach of the people, particularly beyond that of the very poor. If to increase the price of butter from 2/8 to 4/2 a lb. and the price of the loaf of bread from 6½d. to 9½d. is a contribution to good health, to keep the people in the condition that they will not have to avail of the services provided under Section 15, I do not know what to say.  I am fully entitled, and so is every member on this side of the House, to pin the ears of certain Deputies to the pump and pin on them the responsibility for throwing this country into the state it has been in for the last two years and putting the imposts on the people who will have to avail of the services of the Bill if and when it becomes law.</P>

It would have been a better Bill and it could hardly be much worse than this.  These are the facts and Deputies cannot deny they are facts.  This principle is now being accepted.  I am glad it is being accepted even now.  I regret, as hundreds of thousands have reason to <Col N="1568" /> regret, that the principle was not accepted three and a half years earlier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I want to make is to repeat what I have already said as regards the principle of the section in reply to what Deputy Morrissey has said.  The principle underlying the making of the £1 charge which I have accepted in this Bill is, as he says, the fundamental difference between us.  It is the only contentious issue in the whole of our health legislation. This principle was put forward to me a few days before the break-up of the inter-Party Government by the T.U.C.  It was Deputy Larkin who was largely responsible for putting it forward.  I accepted the principle at that time.  These facts, again, are available.  I can give the Deputy the references if he wants them.  This principle was referred to in the annual report of the T.U.C. for that year and, as I say, I accepted the principle of making the £1 contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> The procedure then was for the T.U.C. deputation to contact Deputy Norton, who was to put the proposal before the Government.  I am sure that Deputy Morrissey's contention this morning was probably made in good faith.  The proposal, I understand, did not reach the Government, as I am informed at this stage.  The only point is that I had accepted the principle at that time.  I was unable to put it into operation not because of any decision of the Government or of any decision of mine, but by virtue of the fact that Deputy MacBride had insisted on my resignation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it very amusing to see Deputy Morrissey charging the Fianna Fáil Government with not bringing in the Bill which the inter-Party Government were to bring in.  It is a most revealing situation. There is a fundamental difference which Deputy Morrissey cannot by-pass in this situation, and that is that the inter-Party Government pledged themselves to bring in a certain type of Bill, but in all the contests that took place they changed their minds completely. Deputy Dr. Browne stuck to his principles and resigned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>The position, as far as the present Government is concerned, is that we have reached the Committee Stage of this Bill, and, despite a number of amendments, the Bill has not suffered any changes whatsoever in principle.  As far as the present Government are concerned, <Col N="1570" /> they are absolutely in the clear.  They proposed in a White Paper to introduce a certain type of Bill.  They did introduce it, a Bill that was exactly in principle with the White Paper.  The Bill has now reached the Committee Stage and the Government have indicated that they propose to stick to their guns.</P>
      <P>That is a very different situation from what Deputy Morrissey has been speaking about, that they had an infinitely better Bill.  Surely if Deputy Morrissey and Fine Gael had an infinitely better Bill, then why all these months and years of discussion on health legislation when we were not allowed to hear from them that they had an infinitely better Bill? If this Bill is as bad as they say, why could they not have taken one or two of the valuable suggestions in their infinitely better Bill and put them down to this Bill by way of amendment? We all want some form of health legislation.</P>

It is a great pity that we cannot all get together and put forward suggestions representing all our different views on this subject. But it is absolutely hopeless if you have a Government bringing in a Bill, with Independents and the Labour Party putting down amendments to it, while all you get from the main Opposition Party to this section and to all other sections of it is destructive criticism without any alternative being offered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say categorically that the Fine Gael people do not know at this moment what they agree on or what they disagree on. Deputy Morrissey talked about proposals which might ultimately have seen the light of day as a Bill, and said that it would have been a better Bill than this.  He pretends to have great concern for the poor people who, as a result of the loss of two years in the passing of a Health Bill of this kind, have seriously deteriorated in health.  I say that he pretends to have that concern.  Deputy Morrissey has now left the House when I wanted to answer him straight from the shoulder. I say that this particular Health Bill and the section that we are discussing are the natural consequence of the 1947 Health Act.  Deputy Dr. Browne, when he became Minister for Health in the inter-Party Government, was accepted not only by this House but by the whole country as a Minister who was concerned with improving the situation in regard to our health services.  Everybody had testified, even when we were in opposition, that he had done tremendous work.  It is now quite clear that that work was that of Deputy Dr. Browne himself and not of the inter-Party Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand the attitude of the Opposition.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde, I say, is against this section.  I heard him speak several times on it.  He adduced as evidence of the frame of mind he was in the hospital board treatment that was going to be given if this section was passed with the Bill as it is now more or less agreed.  He knows very well that is not the case. I have some little experience, not as a medical man but as a layman on the board of a very important maternity hospital in Dublin, the Rotunda Hospital. I have some idea as to the need for this section and the advantages this section will bring to the vast multitude of our people who will benefit under it.  I cannot understand at all <Col N="1573" /> what is in the minds of Fine Gael on this matter.  I know that the Labour Deputies are in support of the Bill and in support of this section as it is now going to be put through and as explained by the Minister yesterday. Labour are in favour of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>According to my particular interpretation of the section, the amendment which the Minister proposed to introduce would have had the effect of stating now that whatever the charge would be after it was ascertained, the contributor would pay 50 per cent. of that charge.  Nobody knew what the charge was going to be.  The Minister himself said that from the examination he has given it and from the statistics available, he believed his estimate was a correct one <Col N="1574" /> and because he believed that he was prepared to withdraw the previous amendment and enshrine in another amendment a provision fixing a maximum of £2.  When we come to the stage of deciding the charge, it can be discussed here.</P>
      <P>The fact is, however, that a mother and child scheme will be made available for the people who need it, both under the £600 level and over it.  It will be made available in the sense that was intended when Deputy Dr. Browne came to his Government with his health scheme proposals for the purpose of framing a Health Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not know yet and I would like to know if there is any agreement among those in the Fine Gael Benches in regard to this Health Bill.  Are they in favour of it or are they against it?  Are they divided on it?  Who is the power behind the throne that is directing the policy at the moment, if there is some strong opinion held by some leading member of Fine Gael?  Notwithstanding what Deputy Morrissey says about the willingness of the inter-Party Government to bring in a better Health Bill than this, with a better Section 15, the conclusion everybody has come to, in listening to Fine Gael interventions and in reading what they have said, is that they are only trying to delay the passage of this Bill in the hope that it will never become a completed measure as far as the country is concerned.</P>

      <P>Deputy Morrissey is in favour of it and other Deputies are <Col N="1575" /> against it.  If Fine Gael were really concerned about the welfare and health of the people and about making the means available by legislation to help further in that direction, surely it was their business to come in here and produce an amendment to this section to make it a better section.  In all my experience in this House, I felt always when we were in opposition or in the Government that if we wanted to improve a Bill we could improve it by way of amendment, but all I can gather is being done in this regard is delay and delay.  Maybe they hope that something would happen and that a situation would arise where this Government could not fulfil its intention with regard to this Bill.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to say there is a big difference between the method in which this Bill is being handled and that in which the health proposals of Deputy Dr. Browne were handled.  At least the Minister here has the complete co-operation of his own Government and he has the backing of his whole Party.  That is something Deputy Dr. Browne did not have in his Government.</P>

      <P>I must sympathise with the Minister for Health on Deputy Briscoe's contribution to the discussion.  I do not think it was just what the Minister wanted.  Deputy Morrissey has stressed the point that the principle of the payment for what is regarded as a contributory scheme is very important and that he is glad that the Minister has taken that line. We get this situation that one Deputy says he always accepted that and another Deputy, who immediately supports him, says that that was not so. Be that as it may, the fact that it is inserted now shows that the Minister is prepared to accept the advice of people who are in a position to give it to him or are qualified to give it to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told by Deputy Briscoe that this amendment and section are the natural consequence of the 1947 Act. I would like to hear from the Minister some explanation as to what Deputy Briscoe means by that because Deputy Briscoe has said that the Minister has <Col N="1576" /> the support of every member of his Party.  Therefore, I assume that he has discussed these sections with the Party and that the Party are <i>au fait</i> with every principle involved.  Neither the Bill, when introduced, nor the White Paper contained the contributory scheme or the £1 contribution.  It has been amended to that extent.  The big point in this section that I want to get after is not that.  I am opposed to this section because it establishes the State official, the State doctor.  No matter what anybody may say to the contrary, if a doctor in an area does not enter into a contract or agreement with the Minister to operate the section, a patient who may want that doctor will not be able to get him. The Minister was quite positive last night that unless the doctor had a contract or agreement with the local authority, that doctor could not be paid and that any doctor operating the service in a maternity case would not be paid, unless he had a contract.  Therefore you are forcing the patient to accept the State officer. That is what the doctor will be under this new regulation.</P>
    <P>That State officialism is condemned generally.  I do not want to be sneered at when I try to prevent it.  I would remind the House that, no later than yesterday, in Cork, it was asserted that it was important that those in public life should be able to study the implications of Catholic principles and their relevance to the controversies of the hour.  Therefore, there is an obligation upon everybody to see exactly where the Minister is going or where we ourselves are going and that we should know.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the Minister at the earliest opportunity should say that the Bill as he now proposes to amend it does meet the requirements.  If he said that, it would be a helpful contribution to the whole question, but he goes on ahead as if 1947 was to be ignored as never having happened, as if 1950 and 1951 never happened.  We must remember what occurred.  These things remain facts.  The obligation is on the Minister to do his part.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe said that we did not know whether we were in favour of the <Col N="1577" /> £1 or not, and that the Minister had asserted that it was to be £1.  That is not so.  It is quite obvious that Deputy Briscoe did not know what the Minister said last night, that the best he would go and the farthest he would go was that the contribution would not be above £2, that he put a ceiling of £2 on it but that it may be £2.  If more than that is required, I presume the Exchequer will bear it.  In the past it was undertaken that the Exchequer would bear practically all the expenditure. I do not know how the Minister is able to convince Deputy Dr. Browne and others that that is the same as they wanted.  They bell everybody in this country for not accepting it.</P>

      <P>Can anybody rival Deputy MacEoin as a smug Catholic in this House, a Catholic who is glad to see that there are good Catholics on the other side too?  Did anybody ever hear of the man who, when he kneels down to say his prayers, says: &ldquo;Thank God, I am not like the rest of men. I am not like the rest of the men sitting opposite me in the Dáil?&rdquo;  It must be a great consolation to the Deputy to feel that he is not like the rest of men and it must be a great trouble to him that he is facing heretics and others in the Dáil every day.  I suppose we must have respect for Deputy MacEoin if we thought he was sincere in that and that he would like to convert us, but he is doing it all for the sake of a few votes in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No?  He is not thinking of that at all.  He is trying to convert us.  He gets up here day after day trying to make out that the good Catholics are sitting beside him and the bad Catholics are sitting opposite him and calling on the country to throw us out and put them in because they <Col N="1578" /> are good Catholics.  It is the lowest motive for which anybody could talk religion in this House, the lowest of motives.  As the statesman said once, &ldquo;religion is the last refuge of the scoundrel&rdquo;.  That is very true, indeed. It is the last refuge of the scoundrel and when anybody in politics has to turn to religion and accuse his opponents of not being as good Catholics as he is in order to get a few votes I do not know how to describe it.  I think it is disgusting, that is all, just disgusting, that any man should go on with that talk and go on with it day after day.  Of course, he is joined by his colleagues on the other side.  I have been for seven or eight days here listening to this sort of thing, listening to them day after day trying to get some little handle so that they could show that we are not as good Catholics as they are.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy is a very good theologian, as a matter of fact. He says that State officialdom is condemned. I believe it is.  It should be avoided as far as possible.  In this particular section we are making the thing very much more acceptable from the religious point of view than it has been before, very much more acceptable, by giving a choice of doctor. Deputy MacEoin twists that around; he twists the choice of doctor to officialdom.  It is obvious that somebody must find out who is prepared to work this scheme and, as I have explained, the regulations will lay down that the doctor who undertakes this scheme will be obliged to give certain service, certain visits before. certain visits after, the birth.  He will be paid so much.  That, of course, if the Irish Medical Association are willing to do so, will result from negotiations with the Irish Medical Association and then the regulation will lay down what the agreement is and all that is necessary then for a doctor to do is to send his name to the local authority and to say: &ldquo;I am prepared to work this scheme&rdquo;.  That is officialdom. That is condemned by the Church according to Deputy MacEoin &mdash;condemned by the Church, that the local authority would like to know who is going to work this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1579" /> If a man comes in here as an authority on theology and tries to get that theology to fall in with his own crooked, distorted, political views, that is dragging religion in the mud, if ever it was dragged in the mud, but Deputy MacEoin is prepared to do it in order, as I say, to get a few votes down the country.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies opposite would try to drop this silly obstruction and to make this a better Bill and if they have any suggestions to make we will listen to them, but the only suggestion so far from their side is that this is such a rotten Bill that we cannot do anything about it and that they will go on opposing it.  What proposal would they make on this section? Deputy Morrissey says that it is right in principle.  What he means is that it is right in principle that there should be a contribution from the better off people.  I think that that is the principle he agrees with.  What is the suggestion made to improve matters?  No suggestion has come from Fine Gael&mdash;none whatever.  They have talked on this for four days now.  This is our third day on this section and they have made no suggestion whatever to improve matters&mdash;just obstruction, that is all.  I am sure that they have no suggestion to make but they go on with this obstruction.  Is it not time that they told us what would be a better suggestion than what is in the Bill?</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan made a suggestion here last night that a doctor need not enter into an agreement with the local authority.  Well the first case he takes up he must tell the local authority he is taking it, otherwise he cannot be paid.  Surely if he does not notify the local authority he has taken on a case the local authority cannot pay him.  The only difference between us is this that Deputy McGilligan has suggested that we should wait until he sends in his bill and says: &ldquo;I have agreed to your terms,&rdquo; and I say let him agree to the terms before he sends in his bill.  That is the great Fine Gael suggestion.  We have spent the third day on this section and that is the only suggestion that has come from Fine <Col N="1580" /> Gael, the only suggestion on this Bill that has crossed the floor of the House in three or four months.</P>
    <P>As I have said here already, it is fairly obvious what the Fine Gael opposition is due to.  They are watching like hawks all the time seeking to see can they catch us saying something or doing something that is not exactly in line with Catholic principles.  I suppose they will catch us out.  It is easy to catch people out on that sort of thing, but what will they achieve if they do catch us out is what I cannot understand.  I do not know.  I suppose they hope to gain something out of it, otherwise they would not go on with this talk.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey, speaking here, talked about how in the last two years we had injured the health of the people by increasing the price of food.  Where is the proof that we have injured the health of the people?  It is not true just because Deputy Morrissey says it or because Fine Gael says it, and the only guide we have in these matters are returns published from time to time.  These returns have shown that in 1952 the health of the people was higher than ever.  I do not know what 1953 is going to show, but there is no evidence to suggest that the position is changing in any way.  The health of the people is improving all the time and has improved.  It improved under the Coalition Government and has improved since, and why Deputy Morrissey will get up and make a statement like that for which there is no foundation I cannot understand. The fact that there is no foundation for it does not stop Fine Gael making these statements.  But I do not see what is gained by that.</P>
    <P>One of the big objections that I think Fine Gael have to this section is that we are only providing accommodation or services for women in public wards. When we come to another amendment, amendment No. 45, we may discuss that matter, whether it is true or not.  But suppose it is true, why this shoneen attitude of Fine Gael about public wards?  Would Fine Gael, I wonder, produce any reputable doctor in this city who will say that the service given <Col N="1581" /> in the public wards of maternity hospitals is not better than in the private hospitals or at least as good?  Why this criticism of the public wards?  Is it not only a sort of class distinction in the Fine Gael mind?  They are appealing to a certain type of person who would not like to have it said that she would go into a public ward.  They are appealing to the prejudices of a particular type of that kind.  But, as I said, so far as this section is concerned, that question is not dealt with. When we come to amendment No. 45 we can discuss the question of what service is available at the patient's choice or what service is available to patients in the public wards.  I think that particular objection made by Fine Gael can be left until that stage is reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is desirable that our Party should place on record their general attitude to this particular section. Let me put it like this.  In a general health scheme or a comprehensive health scheme our Party believes that a contributory scheme of some sort should be worked out because the fundamental fact is that we wish to accept our benefits not as a charity but as a right, a right to which we have contributed and paid in some measure.  In this particular section of the health scheme we have envisaged and in this particular scheme we would wish to see no means test but accepting that benefit as an overall right to which we had contributed. That has been our view and is our view&mdash;a free for all mother and child scheme within a general health service to which you contribute.  When the difficulties arose in the previous health scheme and Deputy Dr. Browne was Minister for Health&mdash;I do not want to mention how they arose&mdash;but when they arose we faced up to the fact that it did not then appear possible to get a free for all mother and child scheme.  The T.U.C. made certain proposals to Deputy Dr. Browne which we understood he was willing to accept and which he gave certain assurances on.  He would not take certain action until they had been either examined further or cut out. What arose then is a matter of history. <Col N="1582" /> It is clear that this Government are being forced back to the very same position as the inter-Party Government were.  There is no possibility of going on with a mother and child scheme free for all, because of certain objections.  The Labour Party are keeping consistent in this.  We in the past were prepared to accept either a free for all scheme or, if we had to, a certain scheme in which we paid a certain amount.  We were prepared to do that.  Certain Deputies in this House have in the past day or two been suggesting that the Labour Party did not carry out its functions and were afraid to do things.</P>
      <P>That is ridiculous, in face of the fact that these same Deputies have now been forced to swallow the very thing that we faced up to.  I only make the point to show that the Labour Party has been consistent in its attitude.  Our view of a health scheme has been to move a step closer to every approach to the ideal scheme, where health services will be as required on a contributory basis within the means of every person and given without distinction of class, creed or social position.</P>

They seem at one particular time to sum up the Fine Gael attitude to the Bill by saying we are completely against it and are just indulging in obstructive and delaying tactics here.

We asked and pleaded that the Minister would put us in the position of having a proper inquiry, by the kind of committee we asked should be set up.  The Minister does not do that, so we are inquiring.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Minister what we want to know.  We want to know the services that are being provided, the principles upon which those services are being provided, who is going to get them, who is going to pay for them, and what they will cost.  The Minister has made no attempt to answer that.  We are told he has the whole of his Party behind him and the whole of the Government behind him.  They are so convinced the thing is right that they want it put through.  Although no doubt they have the Department behind them, with the whole machinery of statistics and the machinery of the State, they will not go to the trouble of putting their proposals down in a systematic and clear way.  We want them to tell us <Col N="1584" /> exactly what these services are going to be, and who is going to benefit from them.  We want them to give us information that will show us how these services are going to be put there, what they are going to cost to put there, what they are going to cost to maintain and who will have to pay for them.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, I say that we have not got the material for criticism.  We have got the opportunity for inquiry.  Everything in the Bill and the whole of the Minister's approach to it confirms, day after day, as we go along, that this Bill is a fraud of a Bill and that it will not work.</P>

      <P>How does this arise on the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises in this <Col N="1586" /> sense, that I want to explain to the Minister why it is that we are pursuing a policy of inquiry with regard to this section.  We still find in the Minister what we found then, that the Government were incapable of an educational approach.  They were intent upon compulsion. They think that by dipping their hands into the public purse and setting up control over health services to which people will have to go, they will cure all the ills of the people.  The spirit we find there is the same and the lack of information makes us convinced that the objections we had to the 1945 and 1947 Bills are not uprooted in the minds of the Government.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I want to ask the Minister to tell us something about this section. For instance, the proposals here are conceived in an insurance frame of mind, or they are conceived in the frame of mind that the people are unable to pay for the services the Government think they should have, or they are conceived in the frame of mind that the Government think that more efficient services should be arranged and that they will not be arranged unless the State has its hand in it.</P>
      <P>On the insurance question, are the proposals here based upon a health insurance principle?  It is very difficult to conceive that they are in view of the discussion we had yesterday on the amendment in relation to the appropriate sum, and the result of that amendment, and in view of the joint contributions this morning from Deputy Briscoe and the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe tells us that the £1 is going to remain.  The Minister says it is not.  The <i>Irish Press</i> of this morning suggests that the sum will be £2. In any event, will the Minister please tell us if there is an insurance principle behind this proposal and, if that is so, will the Minister do something to convince us that there is some kind of a normal approach to an insurance proposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me impossible to think that any kind of an insurance approach has been systematically worked out, in the light of the discussion we had yesterday, the way in which the amendment has been withdrawn and <Col N="1587" /> the kind of discussion we have been able to have this morning about it from the Government Benches.</P>
    <P>Is it on the question of ability to pay?  The Minister has indicated that 88 per cent. of the farming community of this country will come in under the completely free mother and child service.  Imagine, 88 per cent. of the farming community of this country! We boast that the whole economic fabric of this country is based upon our agriculture.  The Government have had 16 years of office beforehand and now they have had a further couple of years in which to deal with the problem of building up our agriculture. After all that the Minister can hardly say that it is as a result of inability to pay that these proposals are being put forward for a free maternity service for 88 per cent. of our farming community.  Is it a question of inefficiency?  If it is, then will the Minister say to what extent the domiciliary work of the State medical service at the present time in dispensary areas is of a higher class than the domicilary work of any other section of the medical fraternity, and will he say on what exactly he bases his claim for efficiency on the part of the public administration of maternity work in institutions?</P>
    <P>I quoted the Minister yesterday with regard to the figures for beds and also the figures that are available as a result of parliamentary questions which were put to the Minister.  These are the things that come perfectly readily to our minds when we want to examine these services to enable us to come to our own judgment as to the cost and the types of services that are available and estimate their effect from the financial, medical, social and even moral points of view.  At the present moment it is very difficult to have any kind of an idea as to the background or proposal of this section. As far as the free service is concerned, we deal with three classes&mdash;(a), (b) and (c) in Section 14, sub-section (2).  Has the Minister made any estimate of the number of people in the insured class in the under £600 class or in the farming class that will have to be attended <Col N="1588" /> to?  Does the incidence of maternity differ in these three classes and what is the average number of cases that would require to be dealt with under each of these classes as a domiciliary case and as an institutional case and what are the costs of these likely to be?</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to snobocracy in connection with the mention of public wards.  Our concern about the public ward is that the Minister bases his financial estimate for the running of this thing on the public ward of the institutions up to the present and the dispensary system.  The Minister has indicated that the average cost of providing medical, surgical, midwifery, hospital and specialist services for a birth, and everything connected with the birth, without taking into consideration the administrative overheads, is £8.  I think the Minister should give us some information that would carry a little more conviction to our minds than we are able to get for his belief that £8 is the average cost of all the services&mdash;of medical surgical, midwifery, hospital and specialist treatment&mdash;that go with a maternity case at the present time. These are the considerations that make us press here now.</P>
    <P>We believe that if the Minister were true to his responsibilities and if he himself examined the background of these matters to the extent which I have outlined, then, without any necessity on our part to continue to pursue the inquiry that we are pursuing here, he would withdraw this Bill and sit down again with the various classes of people&mdash;local authorities, doctors and others&mdash;who have a concern in this matter and have a contribution to make and make a decent Bill out of it. We do not believe that the present Bill will work or that it would stand the scrutiny and examination of any body that got a chance of examining it.  The Minister is not giving this House a chance of examining it but we will continue to examine it as long as the Bill is before us in this House.</P>

      <P>I wonder if Deputy Mulcahy expects this House to believe the sort of dishonest statement which he has made to the effect that his <Col N="1589" /> Party are merely making inquiries? Will the Deputy read the speech made here last night by Deputy McGilligan on this section&mdash;a speech which lasted for over an hour&mdash;and see if he can find a single inquiry in it?  We have put up with a lot but it is very hard to put up with that sort of thing from the supposed Leader of a Party who says, after three days' discussion, that they are not obstructing but merely making inquiries.  The discussion on this section started this day last week. Why were the inquiries not made then?  Why have they waited until now?</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asks if this £1 is an insurance scheme.  I think I mentioned about four times since the discussion on this section started that it is a type of insurance scheme.  It does not fulfil all the conditions of an insurance scheme but it is run on the basis of an insurance scheme.  What more can I add to that?  After three days' discussion, the Deputy comes along and wants to know something further: he wants to know if it is an insurance scheme.  Is it not ridiculous to ask us to understand that sort of dishonest nonsense?&mdash;and it is nothing else.</P>
      <P>Again, Deputy Mulcahy comes back to the question of beds.  The relevant figures were very fully given on a previous occasion.  Does he want the subject of beds to be brought up again and discussed?  I really do not know what Deputy Mulcahy expects to gain out of this.  If I had some idea of the political advantage he might get out of it, then maybe I could sympathise with him in trying to build up a derelict Party on some rolling stone.  I cannot see what political advantage he would get from this obstruction and therefore I feel that the whole business is futile.</P>

The difficulty of those on this side of the House, as has been stated by Deputy Mulcahy, <Col N="1590" /> Deputy Morrissey and others, is that we have not the requisite information.

      <P>This section divides the nation into three different classes. We have the lower income group, the middle income group and the upper income group.  It has been stated to-day that Deputy Dr. Browne is accepting certain principles that he was not prepared to accept before.  I hope I will be in order in quoting from a speech by Deputy Dr. Browne made in Dublin, as reported in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 23rd May, 1951, when he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I will not under any circumstances vote for any amendment of the Health Act which would authorise any Minister to bring into life what should be dead 50 or 100 years ago, this means test, the pauper law, the red ticket, and all the rest of it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is not that a definite statement by Deputy Dr. Browne that he will not stand for a means test in any shape or form, for the red ticket or anything pertaining to pauper law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 15 is dealing with three sections of the community.  One of them is the lower income or dispensary class, if you like.  This section makes no real difference for the lower income group except in so far as it is purported to offer them a choice of doctor.  That <Col N="1591" /> was fully discussed yesterday and I think it was shown that in many cases there would not be a choice of doctor. As far as that goes, it is acceptable to us, if it is at all possible.  The benefits proposed for these people are benefits which they already have under the existing medical services.  They have the right to be treated by a doctor, the right to go into a hospital if they are emergency cases.  The only change is this, and this is where we join issue with the Government, that the benefits which they now enjoy they will be sharing with the rest of the community, and the hospital accommodation and the maternity resources in this country are already grossly overtaxed.</P>
    <P>As far as the lower income group are concerned, what they get then is permission to choose a doctor.  Whether that will be practicable or not it is not necessary to go into now.  But the strained resources of the State will be thrown open to another large section of the community and, when you have people queueing up for something, it is always the poorest section who suffer because they will probably be at the end of the queue.  That is one of the things to which we object. We have stated that this is an impracticable scheme.  In spite of all the taunts thrown against us, the Fine Gael Party want to give to the public the best maternity services possible in keeping with the power of the Irish people to pay.  All through this discussion there has been no indication as to what the scheme will cost and who is to pay for it.</P>
    <P>We now come to the middle income group, which includes farmers under £50 valuation and people with an income of up to £600 a year.  One point which strikes me in regard to that income of up to £600 a year is that it will be the county manager or city manager, as the case may be, who will be the deciding factor with regard to anything relating to a means test. Of course in this maternity section there is no charge imposed on those with an income up to £600 a year.  But the point is that they will have to prove that their income is under £600 <Col N="1592" /> a year.  How is that to be done?  If a person says that he is entitled to this treatment free because his income is under £600, how is the Minister or his representative, the county manager, to decide whether he has more or less than £600?  That seems to me to make for a lot of administrative work and that is another reason why we object to it.  We object to any increase in administrative charges.  I stated very categorically the point of view of this Party with regard to the voluntary hospitals.  We felt that these hospitals are being run with the minimum of administrative costs.  A State medical service means more civil servants and if you have more civil servants you have fewer medical benefits.  That is our objection.  The Minister has not clarified that position or indicated to us how much will be absorbed in administrative costs and how much will go to the benefit of the people.  He has not given us anything like a proper bill of costs.  If he has introduced a bill of costs, he has not broken it down.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the higher income group.  Deputy Dr. Browne and others who support this Bill along with him have accepted the principle of a means test.  That is a fair statement.  I do not blame them for accepting it.  Probably they could not get anything else. Deputy Dr. Browne has been systematic throughtout in saying that what he wants is a free-for-all medical service.  He makes no secret of that. I think I am right in saying that Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll wants the same thing.  Who is to pay for it?</P>
    <P>Then we have this extra provision with regard to the £1 a year in this section under which the higher income group are to pay £1 a year; the approprivate sum went by the board yesterday. The Minister has given us one item of financial information relating to that.  He told us that he estimates that each birth will cost £8.  We have asked him to break that down.  He has not given us any information at all. He simply said statistically each child would cost £8.  Therefore he proposes to balance it by collecting such charges as would cover the cost.  Let us look at what benefits the people who pay this £1 a year are going to get.  I think it is quite fair to say they are going <Col N="1593" /> to get, if they require it, a bed in the public ward.  This is the upper income group earning anything over £600 a year.  People living in Dublin and in the country to-day are all suffering from excess taxation and these people find it hard to live.  People earning say between £700 and £800 are not fabulously wealthy.  By the time they pay income-tax, pay for everything for which prices have multiplied within the last couple of years they have not a great deal left to spend.  We would like to see on this side of the House a maternity service that would be of benefit to these people but what we are asked to support here&mdash;and the Minister gets quite cross when we oppose it&mdash;is this £1 a year scheme on the assumption that everybody in the country is going to race in and offer to pay the Minister £1 and he is going to collect enormous sums of money which is going to make the thing pay for itself straight away.  That is nonsense. If he was offering something of benefit they might come forward.  But what is he offering?  A bed in a public ward.</P>
    <P>The people I am talking about at the moment in normal circumstances probably go to a nursing home and there is nothing snobbish in saying that.  It is to the advantage of the rest of the community that they should do so because if not they are competing for the free beds in public wards with people who are already occupying those wards.  There is a considerable shortage of those beds yet the Minister is offering simply the right to a bed in a public ward.  As I understand it, I think they are entitled to a bed for a fortnight in a public ward and in certain circumstances that can be extended.  We agree with the principle of people paying who are able to pay because we accept the fact that in the final analysis every 1/- collected by the Minister, or being collected, comes out of the people's pockets in the end.  We also accept the principle that we believe that people should have freedom and the right to spend their own money.  We think that is the right way to have it.  Under the £1 a year system you pay £1 a year and you have the right to a bed in a public ward.  I say, why not let the Minister face facts?  He <Col N="1594" /> has accepted the principle&mdash;those who support him have accepted the principle&mdash;of a contributory basis of some sort.  Therefore, he cannot be under pressure by them.  Why cannot the Minister face facts and scrap this Section 15 altogether?  It is an unworkable section as far as we have heard from the Minister.  But why cannot he introduce contributory insurance?  I do not ask him to introduce the Irish Medical Association insurance scheme but he could introduce a contributory insurance, which is simply an insurance. You pay so much and for that you are entitled to so much money.  It can be worked.  You get a certain rate of remuneration in return for that contribution if you are sick.  You are reaping the benefits of that insurance and you would be entitled to go to any doctor or institution you wanted.  That is free choice of institution and free choice of doctor.  That is what we stand for.  That is a simple means to the end.  If a person knows what he is going to get he will come in any pay contributory insurance. It has worked in other countries.  In Canada they have a contributory insurance for civil servants and it has worked admirably for a number of years.  Of course it covers wider services. There is no reason why the Minister should not embody it in the whole scheme and the people would know what benefits they were going to get.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that people if they pay something must get some return for it, and if the Minister introduces a State subsidised scheme there is no compulsion about it.  Under such a contributory scheme you could have a free choice of doctor and hospital or nursing home; in other words you could be free, and not a slave.  In the system advocated here you will have forced on you a State medical service and that is all it boils down to.  The words are used &ldquo;there is no compulsion&rdquo; and &ldquo;nobody is forced to engage in the scheme&rdquo; but they are forced to pay for it.  An already overburdened nation is being asked to shoulder this new impost the extent of which the Minister has not told us.  That is the fundamental principle we object to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this maternity section as a whole I do not think the Minister has given us any information on the domiciliary side.  He made several statements but I have not heard him explaining the domiciliary side&mdash;or has he any <Col N="1596" /> domiciliary scheme whatever?  I do not see how he can unless he has consultations with the people concerned. The first thing you want for a domiciliary scheme is the doctors and nurses.  The Minister has made no agreement and had no consultations on the financial arrangements with any of those people at all.  How can you introduce a domiciliary scheme unless you have some discussion beforehand with those who are going to work it? We are interested in a domiciliary scheme.  Everybody is interested in it. When I travel about my constituency many people, particularly farmers, ask me about this health scheme, what exactly they are going to get from it, what it means to them and what it is going to cost.  I do not know what it is going to cost.  The Minister does not know what it is going to cost and, apparently, his officials who have drafted the scheme do not know what it is going to cost.  Are we unreasonable when we say that we are opposed to such an unworkable scheme?  We are told to put down an amendment to it.  Deputy Costello said at the outset that he believed this Bill was so bad that it was unworkable.</P>

It is quite obvious that the further he goes the deeper he is getting into the morass.  We have been here for three days.  We, as the major Opposition Party, have, of course, a right to state our case; that is what the people sent us here for.  I do not know, therefore, why the Minister is getting so worked up.  We have a right to ask the Minister to explain the provisions of the Bill, to give us some idea of what it is going to <Col N="1597" /> cost and how it is proposed to implement it.  There are one or two other things about which I should like to get some information from the Minister.</P>

      <P>Mention was made by Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll of the emergency squad.  I mentioned that matter myself in a speech I made on the Health Estimate about a year ago. Emergency squads do exist&mdash;at least they exist in all the big towns in England.  There are life-saving squads.  They provide domiciliary treatment and bring to the home of the patients the most up-to-date modern methods of life-saving and treatment.  They have with them a doctor who is a maternity specialist and a nurse.  They have a blood transfusion apparatus and equipment for dealing with any emergencies which may occur.  Several instances occur in which the use of such apparatus may be called for.  There is no need to recapitulate them here, as every Deputy who is a doctor will appreciate what they are.  They are mostly cases that would be fatal because of haemorrhage.  These squads exist everywhere in all the big towns in England.  It is quite a usual thing for doctors there to ring up in order to have the emergency squad brought out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll suggested that the Minister might consider the introduction of such a system here. I agree with him but I do not think it would be very feasible to introduce it all over the country.  It would be very difficult, as medical Deputies will appreciate, to get to the spot in time to save life if you had to go to the extremes of Donegal or Connemara. The scattered population here may not make it possible to have such a service in different centres but I think the Minister would be well advised to consider its introduction in the Dublin area.  There must be many instances in Dublin where it is necessary to transport patients to hospital and it may be that lives are lost through the shock of transport and so forth. If an emergency squad were established <Col N="1598" /> here on the lines suggested, I think it would be of very considerable benefit.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister a good many questions.  In particular, I have asked him to clarify the financial position and to say whether he would consider scrapping this section or to amend it by introducing a contributory insurance scheme, the principle of which he has already accepted, a scheme which would give more benefits to the people, benefits which they could visualise and which would be better than those which exist at the moment.  I think that the contributions which the Minister would get from the £1 scheme would be absolutely negligible. I do not think that they will pay even the administrative costs.  I should like the Minister when he is replying, to give us some idea particularly of what he estimates the administrative costs will be in relation to this section alone and in relation to the medical benefits that accrue from it. I think that it is very important that we should know this before we proceed any further.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to answer a point made by Deputy Dr. Esmonde in regard to a statement which I made in 1951 about the means test.  I most certainly made that statement and I certainly stand over the views which I expressed then, that I have the strongest possible objection to a means test in regard to social services or medical health services.  I take that stand not from a political doctrinaire point of view but from the ordinary medical point of view&mdash;that a means test leads to discriminatory types of medicine, indifference to the <Col N="1599" /> people and a poor quality of health service for the poorer or lower income groups.  I think Deputy Dr. Esmonde supported that view in his remark that when you have a number of people looking for service, the poor tend to suffer.  I do not intend to delay this debate any longer than is absolutely necessary.  I think there can be only a first-class health service where the doctor does not know who is paying for it, where the doctor-patient relationship is purely a medical relationship and not a financial relationship. I do not think that there should be any financial relationship.  It should be a purely personal or medical relationship which should have nothing to do with money.  That is why I accept this particular scheme.  I had already accepted that principle, once it was made clear to me that it was necessary to accept it, in order to bring it into line with certain moral objections that were made.  I think that no Deputy would expect me to continue to resist the objections which were put forward and which apparently would be met, and are being met, by the £2 contribution which the Minister says he has now accepted to meet the objections that were raised.</P>
      <P>I might say in passing that I find it difficult to understand why a completely non-contributory scheme is acceptable in the Six Counties and in Great Britain for our fellow co-religionists and is not acceptable here. I do not propose to pursue that further.  I merely say that I accept the proposition that is now put forward here and I think I have shown why it was possible for me to make that statement in 1951 and to accept the scheme now put forward.  The only force that could make the present scheme acceptable to me was the force of the moral objection put forward by particular authorities.</P>
      <P>As to the other point raised by Fine Gael, that is to this levelling down, Father Coyne put the case for that extremely accurately in a contribution to <i>Studies</i> in March, 1953.  He stated:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a type of service that women in this middle income group, <Col N="1600" /> and still more those in higher income groups, desire and have been accustomed to.  Is a woman to pay a £1 contribution per year to enjoy the same services as she has already paid for in taxes for less well-off women to enjoy free?  Private rooms, a special nurse, a different type of cooking, general amenities &mdash;presumably these will not be supplied free to mothers in the middle income groups and to those paying the £1.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot see any difference at all between one mother and another, whether she is in the middle, upper or lower income group.  So far as I am concerned, she must receive one standard of service.  If there is any disgrace, any shame or any odium attached to the public bed, our job is to get rid of it and not to say that that condition must persist.  It is a fantastic attitude to adopt in what is described as a democratic republic to say that the public bed is good enough for the lower income group and not good enough for the upper income group.  I cannot see any difference, as I say, between one and another. Each must be treated equally in relation to the medical service she gets.</P>
    <P>That is my ambition and that is why I support the amendment, because I believe that, in time, we will be able, by dint of infinite patience and slowly, to educate those who do not see that point of view, who differ from us conscientiously, into an acceptance of the view that there should not be a difference between any of the services, medical, nursing, accommodation or amenities of any other kind.  I do not agree with Deputy Dr. Esmonde or the Fine Gael Party in this regard, nor do I agree with Father Coyne's discrimination&mdash;this class distinction or snobbery which is completely out of place in what we claim to be a democratic republic, a republic founded on a democratic programme, the Proclamation of 1916, and James Connolly's conception of the Ireland he would like to see.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Esmonde asked if this would or could work.  I point to many other countries in which this has been tried, countries where there are equal <Col N="1601" /> opportunities in respect of all aspects of social life, education, health, old age pensions and so on.  In New Zealand, to a large extent, in the Scandinavian countries and also in Great Britain, there is tremendous equality of opportunity and there has not been a drop in the standard of the service.  Here at home, we have equality of opportunity in respect of our infectious disease services, in our T.B. and fever hospitals and we are now coming to the stage at which there is no need for private beds in relation to these services.  There is the single room referred to by Father Coyne, but that single room is reserved for the sick person, irrespective of whether that person has money or not. The sick person gets these amenities because he or she requires them, because he or she is a human being in need of them, not because of being one of the soft well-cushioned members of society who can pay for them.  I cannot understand the mentality that would divide our people into those who should be treated in a particular way and those who should not be so treated. They must all get the best, rich and poor.  I simply do not understand the attitude of Fine Gael Deputies or of these contributors to periodicals, who, however, are not here to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>The question of emergency squads has been referred to and we have in Dublin one of the best emergency squads, I suppose, in Europe for a neo-natal health service operated by the three maternity hospitals.  It is a free, no means test, neo-natal service under which any mother in any income group can get the finest neo-natal health treatment, with magnificent modern equipment of every kind&mdash; superb equipment, hospital beds and incubators thermostatically controlled, as good as there is in Europe.  It is a most interesting and most excellent service operated by the three maternity hospitals for the Dublin Corporation who pay for it.  The whole principle we are fighting here has already been exploded and it is simply a myth to suggest that it brings medicine back or that it can be objectionable.  It is already in existence in relation to thousands of beds in our hospitals and <Col N="1602" /> it is doing marvellous work in our Dublin hospitals.</P>
    <P>The hospitals have made agreements with the local authority in regard to it and I do not think they have found any onerous conditions insisted on.  The local authority says: &ldquo;You run the service and send us the bill.&rdquo; and it is being run extremely well and has been instrumental in saving many lives.  I agree that such a service would be very difficult in Connemara, but these difficulties could be overcome, and I hope the service will be extended throughout the country when further experience of its working in the City of Dublin has been obtained.  All the medical men operating that service operate it on a salary basis.  The service is already there and all the principles being opposed here, because of the fear of doctors being imposed upon by the State, are in existence already and are doing great work, and I cannot see why the principle cannot be further accepted without all the bitter quarrelling that is going on.</P>
    <P>As to Deputy Mulcahy's contribution, he said he is asking questions to get information, but he also said to Deputy Briscoe that he intended to obstruct the Bill.  That was his function. I would exclude Deputy Esmonde in this regard, because he has made some interesting points and helped us a little in telling us what is Fine Gael policy, but I do not think Deputy Mulcahy has done anything, as Leader of Fine Gael, but obstruct, so that that must be their policy.  I do not think he could honestly say he has made any conscientious inquiries.  We have to have patience in order to carry on and make progress in face of the very stiff opposition put up by Fine Gael.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, echoing the Minister, has said that the sole function of this Party is to obstruct the Bill and not to make any contribution to it.  I think it is quite useful that this section has been so fully discussed. I understood the Deputy to say at the beginning of his speech that he now accepts the principle enshrined in the Bill, although at a later stage of <Col N="1603" /> his statement, he spoke of the principle which &ldquo;we are endeavouring here to explode&rdquo;.  I will leave it to the Deputy to reconcile these two statements.  This talk about the snobbery of Fine Gael in relation to differentiation between classes is, of course, absolute nonsense.  What we are exposing here is the pretence to people who will be charged fees under this in addition to what is paid for these services through the rates that they will get different treatment and different institutional segregation from those who are already entitled to free services.  That is the pretence of this Bill.  We are exposing that.  I think we are entitled to expose it.  May I remind Deputy Dr. Browne that his description yesterday of this section of this Bill was that it is merely an extension of the poor law system? That was his own description of this particular Bill, a Bill about which he appears at times to be rather enthusiastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As briefly as I can may I say&mdash;unless I am needlessly provoked now I do not intend to speak again on this particular section&mdash;that the discussion on this has been extremely useful?  The Minister has changed his stand on this section at least twice, if not three, times in response to representations made to him from both outside and inside this House.  I think I am correct in saying in relation to this section that the Minister had not even the £1 in his head originally.  That was the first change made in the Minister's scheme to meet representations or compromise on certain representations made to him.  Subsequently in reply to still further representations, both inside and outside the House, the Minister put down an amendment to delete the £1 from the section and to substitute &ldquo;an appropriate amount&rdquo;. As a result of the debate on this section and on that particular amendment, which is, of course, a fundamental amendment, and as a result of representations made not merely from this side of the House but by the Minister's own Party, by Deputy Dr. Browne and others, the Minister has again changed his step and we are <Col N="1604" /> now in the position that we do not know whether, when this section is finally passed, if it is ever finally passed, it will contain £1, 30/- or £2. The Minister tells us in one breath that after careful examination he is satisfied that all the services set out in sub-section (1) of Section 15 will not cost more than £8.  The average cost, he says, will not be greater than £8, and on more than one occasion he said that he was satisfied it would be less than £8.</P>
    <P>Now we can agree to differ on that but, if that is so, what does the Minister mean now by talking about £2 if he is still going to retain the 50 per cent. liability on the patient because he can only justify his £2 for the making available of these services if the services are to cost £16 and not £8? Surely we are entitled to ask for information on that.  May I remind the Minister again that he has not been able to give, or if he has been able, he certainly has not given to the House, what the cost of this will be to the State?  In so far as the Minister has given any information on that point he has again changed his step.  A fortnight ago we were told that the estimated cost to be borne by the local authorities would be £900,000 and the estimated cost to be borne by taxation would be £900,000.  Subsequent to that he told us that it would cost £1,000,000 from taxation and the estimated cost on the local rates would be another £1,000,000.  That represents an increase of £200,000 already.  The Minister has not been able to tell the House, nor was he able to tell the representatives of local authorities whom he met, whether it would be 2/- in the £, 2/6 or 3/- or even more.  We do not know what the particular class concerned will have to pay for whatever maternity services are provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not know and we do not know and we are criticised now for trying to get for the people some idea of what this will cost.  That does not mean for a moment that we are measuring the lives of either mothers and infants or adults against the cost. No one is trying to do that.  As I said earlier, if certain Deputies were prepared to insert, or agreed to the insertion <Col N="1605" /> in a health scheme three or four years ago, what the Minister is now inserting and what they are now agreed on we would never have had all this trouble.</P>

      <P>I will answer the questions once more but I guarantee that I have answered the questions at least ten or 12 times already.  I will answer them once more, just to see what will happen.  I have been accused by Deputy Morrissey of changing step. I said in the beginning in the White Paper that the estimated cost was £1,200,000 on the central Exchequer and £1,200,000 on the local authorities. There were certain amendments made then as a result of discussions with local authorities.  Does the Deputy blame me for changing my step when I met these representatives?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of a White Paper is to get suggestions and make certain modifications.  As a result of certain modifications the cost will now be £900,000 on the central Exchequer and £900,000 on local authorities because we introduced certain things like the £1 for the higher income groups and also a certain charge for hospital treatment.  As a result of further amendments subsequently in relation to choice of hospital, etc., the cost went up again.  It will now be roughly £1,000,000 on the central Exchequer and £1,000,000 on local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as far as the cost goes now.  I have never changed from that, whatever the Deputy may say.  Let Deputies be clear on it now so that they will not have to spend another day asking the same questions. In the White Paper it was £1,200,000 on the local authorities and £1,200,000 on the central Exchequer.  As a result of changes made between the issue of the White Paper and the introduction of the Bill that figure became £900,000 on the central Exchequer and £900,000 on the local authorities.  After the Bill was issued it changed again and the cost went up to £1,000,000 roughly on local authorities and £1,000,000 on the central Exchequer.  I admit these are all rough figures because no one can accurately estimate the cost.  That deals with that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies go back over the progress of the Bill they will find that all these figures were given before. Deputy Morrissey accuses me of changing my step once more in relation to the £1.  The White Paper was not acceptable.  It was opposed very, very strongly by the local authorities as being too costly.  It was opposed by the ecclesiastical authorities as giving a free service to people who could well afford to pay for it. The £1 was put in for the higher income group then as an insurance or contributory scheme.  Then, as Deputy Morrissey says, as a result of objections to that £1 being a subterfuge, I offered an amendment.  I have all the time believed that the £1 was a fair contribution if we were going to pay 50 per cent.  I have always believed that and I still believe it.  I admit that I may be wrong sometimes in my estimate but neither Deputy Mulcahy nor Deputy Morrissey will ever admit they might be wrong.  I am not afraid of my estimate.  I am prepared to put in a clause to say that if it is more than that I will collect it.  When that amendment was put in certain people had a fear that the amendment might be used by a <Col N="1607" /> subsequent Minister who had not the same ideas as we have about these schemes and might pile up all sorts of administrative costs and make the contribution £5 or £6.  That would be ridiculous.  It could never be made that amount.  In order to ensure that no future Minister would do that I withdrew the amendment and put in £2.  That is what happened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough. It confirms what I said.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister reiterated the figure of £1,200,000 reduced in a particular way to £1,000,000 but he has not given us any information in relation to the breaking down of that figure.  Neither has he given us any information as to what the broad costs of the proposals in Section 15 are.  He has not in any way gone into the situation as to the principle behind the scheme.  He says there is an element of insurance.  He has not indicated in any way that there is an element of inability in regard to a scheme which brings in 88 per cent. of the farming population under a free mother and child scheme. He certainly did not cover the point that I raised as to what extent a scheme like this is based on efficiency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I outlined very fully on a previous occasion why I thought it was necessary to help the people in the higher income group.  I guarantee that if you go back you will find mention of it at least once in the debate.  Take the case of a young married couple in the City of Dublin.  Perhaps, they have to buy their house.  They may have to buy their furniture on the hire purchase system.  If the young married man happens to be a commercial traveller or in some other business he may require a motor car.  He may have an income of £600 per year and it is not easy for him to meet his expenses. That is why I said that the higher income group will have to be assisted. Is not that sufficient?  That was what induced me to do something for the higher income group.  I mentioned that before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> Deputy Esmonde put a question to me in relation to maternity costs. Deputy Esmonde is a member of the Irish Medical Association and he may be on a group negotiating with me in regard to what the doctors will be paid.  Am I going to be in the position where Deputy Esmonde will say: &ldquo;Surely, you said in the Dáil you were going to pay the doctors so much?&rdquo;  It should be obvious that I cannot mention these matters until they are fixed up with the doctors.  I would have liked to have negotiated this thing with the doctors before this Bill was brought in but they adopted the same attitude as Fine Gael, that is, they would not have it.  If you have a small dwindling Party like Fine Gael adopting that attitude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy mean the collection of the £1?  Let us take the position in Wexford which the Deputy represents.  I estimate that there will be hundreds, not thousands, of women who will adopt this scheme in the County Wexford.  The clerk dealing with the matter will buy a book costing 4/- or 5/-.  He will have to enter three or four hundred names per year. That should in all probability take over half a day in the year.  Therefore, the administrative costs will be negligible so far as that is concerned.  When a doctor sends in a bill in respect of a patient the clerk has to look up the book and will say: &ldquo;She is all right. She is eligible,&rdquo; and the bill is paid. I cannot see the administrative costs being more than those few pounds a <Col N="1609" /> year.  Paying out the money is a different matter.  It may happen that a woman may join this scheme in preference to disclosing her income.</P>

      <P>I put a number of amendments down earlier with some other Deputies suggesting certain changes in the section and they were ruled out of order.  I wanted to ask the Minister whether he really felt that in the mother and child scheme it was sufficient to leave the limit for children at six weeks.  I think that it would make for a better scheme if it could be extended.  Originally, the scheme of the inter-Party Government covered up to 16 years of age.  I think we would have a far better scheme and far better co-ordination of the services available if it were brought up to 16 years.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulties and the fact that there has been so much delay in discussing the Bill.  At this stage, I am quite happy to see any progress being made at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel, particularly in view of the fact that the Minister has included the school medical service under this Bill, that the various investigations which will have to be carried out under it will, in fact, be part of the extension of this mother and child section to 6 years instead of six weeks as envisaged in the Bill.  I believe that when the scheme is in operation whoever is administrating it at the time will find it very much easier to extend it. The Minister knows that the neo-natal side of the scheme has been in operation in Dublin City for some time. That is a point that Deputy Dr. Esmonde did not seem to realise yesterday when he said that the Minister had not made arrangements to negotiate with any doctors except the dispensary doctors.  That is not so.  When Deputy Dr. Browne was Minister for Health he negotiated arrangements for the neo-natal side of this scheme which the present Minister is going to co-ordinate in the Bill under the mother and child scheme.  In the Dublin maternity hospitals special arrangements were made available to provide neo-natal facilities.  The scheme is in operation at present.  I wonder would the Minister consider it possible to extend <Col N="1611" /> this scheme beyond the period of six weeks as envisaged at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the plea that has been made by Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll.  The Labour Party had an amendment down, their view being that the period should be brought to six years.  We felt that when a child had passed that age, it would continue to receive attention in school right up to the age of 16 as Deputy Dr. Browne had thought of doing in his earlier scheme.  I think there is need for to do what Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll has suggested, so as to close the gap between the age of six weeks and six years.</P>

      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would clarify this matter a little bit for me.  I appreciate that no arrangements have been made so far, with regard to the implementation of Section 15.  Section 16, more or less, continues treatment for the infant after birth.  I wonder could the Minister tell me if it is envisaged that the doctors will be paid a capitation fee for attendance during the period of childbirth and whether that will cover the six weeks' period after birth?  Will the two run concurrently in any contract that may be entered into between the Minister and doctors who may accept service under this scheme?  With regard to what Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll has said about the neo-natal service, I would remind him that it is run by the voluntary hospitals and is not a State concern.  That makes a considerable difference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give special consideration to this question of medicines.  As most Deputy-doctors know, medicines, in recent years, have become a terribly big part of treatment in relation to disease. <Col N="1613" /> Fortunately, that does not trouble me personally, but I do know of general practitioners who, on occassion, have found it necessary to order an old-fashioned drug which is not so effective as one of the more modern drugs, simply because they knew that their patients could not afford to pay for the more expensive drug.  Really good new drugs when they come on the market, are terribly expensive.</P>
      <P>From conversations which I have had with general practitioners, I know that very often they have to face the very difficult problem of deciding as to whether they will order a less expensive and less effective drug simply because they do not want to expose patients to the considerable charge of paying for the modern drugs.  I know that this is a terribly difficult question. That is one side of the question.  There is the other side, that if a doctor did feel that he had not given the best possible treatment because the patient could not afford it, I think that would greatly weigh with me in considering an extension of the provision of medicines.  I understand some sort of safeguards have to be established.  I would imagine the Minister could get a lot of information and experience from the British scheme and the New Zealand scheme as to whether it would not be possible to work out some scheme which would be equitable and at the same time not outrageously expensive.  I make the point that nowadays medicines are one of the most expensive components of the treatment of the average serious case of illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of medicines is a very difficult one.  I have been considering that very carefully now for some time.  If a woman were to make an agreement with a doctor to look after her and if he said to her: &ldquo;This is going to be a difficult case.  You should go to hospital.&rdquo;  In that case she is being sent to hospital and everything is paid.  There would be a difference if a woman said to a doctor: &ldquo;I would like if you could get me into some hospital or a home.  I would prefer it.&rdquo;  In that case, as far as medicines go, they would have to be on the same basis as in domiciliary treatment.  Take the domiciliary treatment. <Col N="1614" /> When considering this scheme first, I was inclined, I must say, to the view that medicines should be included free.  But it is a very difficult matter. We had a great deal of worry and trouble in coming to a decision on it and we ended up by leaving medicines out.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything in the Bill that would prevent a local authority from paying for medicines eventually.  Of course, in that case they would have to get the sanction of the Minister for Health because he would have to pay half.  However, I do not think there is anything in the Bill to prevent it being done at a later stage when we find a practicable way of doing it.  I did meet the pharmaceutical chemists to discuss the matter. They were very helpful but they were not able to get me over some of the difficulties with which I was confronted. Anyway it is a matter that can be discussed further with the pharmeceutical chemists and all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if the position is going to be that if the patient accepts institutional treatment, as the Minister says&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the medicines and everything else will be free, that will be a very strong inducement to the patient to claim institutional treatment as against domiciliary treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only where the doctor says: &ldquo;You would be better in hospital than you would be at home.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would be in a position to know that there are certain cases, in fact, quite a number of cases where family circumstances would almost compel the doctor to send the patient to the institution. There is no doubt that, as Deputy Dr. Browne says, medicines can be a tremendously costly item and it can impose a very heavy burden indeed. I think we are all agreed on what the Minister and Deputy Dr. Browne have said, that it is a difficult problem but to the extent that the Minister will try to meet it, surely this is an elastic £8.  It could not conceivably <Col N="1615" /> provide for those things.  I do not want to score a point on that but I do not want us to fool ourselves into believing that we are going to be able to provide the services which this Bill contemplates particularly if it includes medicines and other necessary commodities that are known to doctors.  There is no use in pretending that we can do it for £8.  Speaking as a lay person I feel that on the face of it it could not possibly be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel there is something in what Deputy Dr. Browne says. I am not often in agreement with the Deputy but certainly in this case I am. It is largely the middle income group who would be concerned in this.  The costs of the products of the chemist shop have gone up considerably recently.  Medicines and all the necessary appliances such as cotton wool, disinfectants, and so on, are extraordinarily expensive.  Would it not be possible within the framework of the Bill to work out some scheme whereby the Minister could allocate a small amount for the middle income group?  As Deputy Morrissey stated, this £8 is already strained to breaking point and I do not think it could reasonably be hoped to cover medicines at all.  Perhaps in consultation with the chemists he could devise some scheme which would meet the case so as to lessen the hardship on these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of patients going to hospital has been mentioned.  The Minister, being a medical man, as I am, will appreciate the fact that the difficulty in childbirth is that you never know in many cases whether it is necessarily a hospital case until the event actually occurs.  I can see the occasion arising whereby the housewife would lay in for domiciliary treatment all the appurtenances necessary for childbirth and then may subsequently find herself transferred to hospital. She would then have the expense of going to hospital.  Of course, <Col N="1616" /> there would be no charges in the hospital but there is always a certain amount of expense connected with these things and she would have laid in these items which would not be necessary.  Perhaps the Minister could allocate some amount.  I would not be prepared to indicate what that amount would be, but surely the Minister is in a position to meet the chemists and consult with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we could meet this problem at all it would be done somewhat on that line.  At least there will be a maximum fixed.  As the Deputy says, I would like to get some average cost and I think it could be got fairly easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately all I get is indignant letters from people telling me what it did cost.  Of course, these are very outlandish cases I hear about. However, it would be easy enough to get from the chemists or private hospitals an indication as to what the average cost is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I want to make.  I am not suggesting the Minister should take his rate of cost from indignant letters he receives from patients.  I suggest he could take it from experienced people.  That is where the consultative council comes in.  Since the Minister has chemists on that perhaps he would consider discussing the matter with them and acting on those lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the children between six weeks and <Col N="1617" /> six years.  This section provides that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A health authority shall, in accordance with regulations, make available, without charge, at clinics, health centres or similar institutions, medical, surgical and nursing services for children under the age of six years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This service applies to everybody, of course.  Every woman who is prepared to take her child to the clinic will get free advice and free treatment for minor defects that may exist but it will depend on her income after that as to what service will be given. Hospital service, of course, will be given to the people in the lower income and middle income groups. Domiciliary service will be given to the lower income group.  Every service will be given to the middle income group.  Hospital service and specialist service will be given as laid down in Section 14.  So far as the higher income group is concerned, they only get the service that the higher income group get&mdash;that is, free service in case of infectious diseases and free immunisation, and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicates here that this section deals with a child from six weeks to six years. Surely it includes the position with regard to children under six weeks, who do not come in under Section 16. On the face of Section 16, it would seem that that was the one real piece of free-for-all service enshrined in the Bill, but, apparently, the intention behind the word &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; would contradict that.  Will the Minister say in what way these regulations will be published and in what form they will be presented to the House, considering that it proposes to make distinctions between different classes of people and that it proposes to make different charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if there was a desire to do so, the regulations could not make a charge because it says in the section &ldquo;without charge&rdquo;.  The regulations could not alter that.  Regulations will be necessary to lay down the conditions with regard to the location of clinics and, perhaps, the conditions of service of doctors and nurses concerned, <Col N="1618" /> and so on, but they cannot interfere with the charge because it is a free service under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it cannot interfere with the charge, apparently, it can discriminate between children of different classes.  Is not it rather remarkable that behind a section that speaks of giving service for children unqualified with regard to position, class or means, there would be the intention to discriminate between different classes and different means by way of regulation?  Surely it is not reasonable that a section would appear like that and that regulations would make discriminations.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;A health authority shall, in accordance with regulations, make available, without charge, at clinics, health centres or similar institutions, medical, surgical and nursing services for children under the age of six years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I take it that children between the age of six weeks and six years in the lower income group are entitled to all treatment free of charge, as at present. Is not that right?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> According to that, if we read the Bill right, the only people who will get free treatment are the lower income group. They will get free treatment for everything. The section is wrong in saying &ldquo;without charge&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Whatever is given to them at the clinic is free.  I want to make that clear.  They are examined at the clinic free.  They get whatever service is given at the clinic free.  If the dentists agree to operate this, that would be free.  Treatment for tonsils would be free.  Whatever would be done at the clinic would be free.  If the doctor says: &ldquo;What you want really is an operation for appendicitis,&rdquo; then it would depend on what group the patient is in.  If he is in the lower group, it is free.  If he is in the middle income group, what applies in the case of hospitalisation is that they get the hospital and operation, and so on, but they may be charged up to £2 a week, if their means permit it.  I want to make it clear that whatever they get at the clinic is free.  That is the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important matter arising under this Estimate now is the recent trade agreement.  There is no doubt that that agreement has been received by farmers throughout the country with intense satisfaction. For a number of years we have been told and it has been held forth by certain elements of the Opposition, that the only person in this country capable of concluding a satisfactory trade agreement with Great Britain was a man named James Dillon&mdash; Deputy Dillon I suppose we should call him in this House.  Events have shown that Deputy Dillon's successor, meeting the British Government representatives in conference over a long period and debating the issues relating to the export trade of this country, has been able to conclude an even more satisfactory agreement than that of 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also well to remark in passing that the improvement in live-stock prices which took place following the restriction of trade during the war period dates back a little further than 1948, as those of us who engaged in farming all that time and people engaged in the cattle trade know quite well that in 1947 there was the first sharp rise in live-stock prices.  That rise, of course, followed the removal of restrictions on shipping and the expansion of trade in Great Britain.  It was the first substantial relief, if you like, and it occurred, as I say, in the summer of 1947.  Even at that time the differential between prices of cattle <Col N="1622" /> here and cattle in Great Britain was being narrowed down, and the trade agreement of 1948 did nothing more than to underline and make permanent that small differential between the prices of cattle here and in Great Britain.  The agreement now goes a substantial step further and reduces still further that differential.  With a steady upward trend of prices in Great Britain the proportionate differential between prices here and the British prices has been reduced by even more than the 6d. per cwt. that is outlined in this trade agreement.</P>
    <P>The agreement also emphasises and ensures that there will be no restriction whatever on the export of carcase meat to Great Britain.  There was a restriction embodied in the 1948 agreement.  It was not, of course, enforced after a time but it was there none the less, and it is a good thing to have it removed so that we will be in a position of looking forward to an increase in the carcase meat trade.</P>
    <P>The agreement also provides for a close link of sheep and lamb prices with the prices prevailing in Great Britain. That, again, means a substantial advantage and it is one which will be of very considerable value to the farming community.  In addition there is a provision in clause 6 of the annex that the price of carcase meat in Britain will be related closely to the price of live cattle.  There, again, there is a definite assurance of a reasonable price and I think that is an important clause.  Taking it all round, this trade agreement puts our export trade on a sound basis for a period of years and I think that is very desirable from every point of view.</P>
    <P>I felt rather sorry for Deputy Blowick as he had moved the Adjournment the day before and yet he was thrust aside by Deputy Dillon and not permitted to speak first on this trade agreement. One would think that a person claiming to be the Leader of a farmers' Party would have a special right to express his views on the trade agreement. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the fact that Deputy Dillon had spoken at great length on the previous day, whether by agreement or otherwise with Deputy <Col N="1623" /> Blowick, he succeeded in pushing the Leader of Clann na Talmhan aside and getting in the first statement in regard to the trade agreement.  I am told there was a race down the corridor, a neck and neck race, and that Deputy Dillon won by a short neck, probably a hard neck, and that he got into the House before Deputy Blowick.  Be that as it may, he got the first chance of expressing his views on the trade agreement; and he concentrated a good deal of fire and fury upon clause 3 in relation to carcase meat inasmuch as there was a removal of all restrictions on the export of carcase meat to countries other than Great Britain in so far as it related to the meat of cows and bulls. He made the extraordinary statement that you cannot base the agricultural industry on cows and bulls.  One would imagine that an agricultural industry from which cows and bulls have been completely eliminated would be a very anaemic one.  We all believe in promoting the maximum output from the land in every shape and form.  We believe in the plough and in the cow and in the sow, as Deputy Dillon has so frequently said, yet he made the extraordinary statement here in the House in connection with this trade agreement yesterday that we cannot base the agricultural industry on cows and bulls.</P>
    <P>I think that cows and bulls do form a very important feature of agriculture and I think that the opportunity provided in this trade agreement for an expansion of the export trade in cow meat is a very important one.  It will mean that in the export and marketing of carcase meat of cows we will not be confined to the British market.  We will have all the markets of the world at our disposal and as a result we can look forward to reasonably good prices for fat cows.  Of course, we all know that it is an inevitable thing that every cow, when it has the good fortune to die a natural death, will, eventually, go to the manufacturer.  It is a very desirable thing from the point of view of the live-stock industry that old cows, cows that have passed their days of usefulness and productivity, will fetch a good price, so that the farmer will <Col N="1624" /> be able to replace that worn-out cow with a young heifer without any financial loss in the transaction.  That is a very important thing.  It is particularly important at the present time when we hear so much about low-yielding cows, unproductive and uneconomic cows.  It is a good thing that through this trade agreement we are enabled to secure a good price for the uneconomic or inefficient cow, a price that will enable that cow to be replaced by a cow of better milking quality without any substantial loss to the farmer.</P>
    <P>These are all desirable points in the trade agreement.  We ought to be happy that, no matter whether it is Deputy Dillon, Deputy Walsh or whoever may be the next Minister for Agriculture, it will always be possible to conclude satisfactory agreements with the country that takes the greatest volume of our live-stock products.</P>
    <P>The agreement opens up the way for further expansion and development of the agricultural industry.  Speaking as a farmer, I maintain that the volume of our agricultural output is not by any means as high as it should be.  I do not hold that that is due to any real inefficiency on the part of the farmer or to any neglect of the land.  I entirely disagree with Deputy Dillon when he says that any suggestion that our output is not as high as it should be is an insult to the farmer.  There are a number of causes that can contribute to low output other than inefficiency on the part of the farmer.  It might be inefficiency on the part of the Department of Agriculture.  It might be due to circumstances over which we have not effective control.  I do not think we are doing any harm in suggesting that our agricultural output is capable of being increased.  There is not one farmer in the country who does not know in his heart that an increase is possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, having ousted the former Minister for Lands, dogmatically expressed his views on agriculture and harked back to the suggestion that agricultural policy should be based on one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough, notwithstanding <Col N="1625" /> the fact that he had contradicted that statement by saying that agriculture should not be based on cows and bulls.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary fact must be recognised by every admirer of Deputy Dillon&mdash;and I count myself as one of them&mdash;that in the period during which Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture we did not get one more acre under the plough; we got a reduction of 500,000 acres under the plough.  I do not know how Deputy Dillon reconciles that reduction in the tillage acreage of 500,000 acres with his frequently expressed claim that agricultural policy should be based on one more acre under the plough.</P>
    <P>In the last year that Deputy Dillon was in office there was a very substantial reduction, according to the figures here, in the number of cows, notwithstanding the fact that he talks about one more cow.  In 1950 there were 1,206,000 cows.  In 1951 the number was down to 1,189,000.  There were 113,000 in-calf heifers in 1950.  The number went down to 80,000 in 1951.  There is no indication there of one more cow. In the same way the number of sows was reduced in the last year that Deputy Dillon was in office.  I am glad to note that the number has very substantially increased during the last two years.  So, it appears that the policy of one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough is being more vigorously pursued at present than it was during the period when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick repeated the statement which he has frequently made, that the increase in our agricultural exports during the last year was due, not to increased production on the part of the farmers, but to reduced consumption.  He did not attempt to adduce evidence in support of that statement.  As was said by a prominent Churchman some time ago, the policy of the Clann na Talmhan Party has been nothing but an ineffective echo of the Fine Gael Party's policy. Deputy Blowick's speeches in this House on agriculture have been nothing but a weak and shrill echo of Deputy Dillon's more dogmatic assertions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> Deputy Blowick is aware that over the last fortnight at least one member of his Party has been speaking on Deputy Dillon's platform in County Wicklow and has, probably, thereby endorsed the entire policy laid down by Deputy Dillon.  Even the Deputy-Leader of Clann na Talmhan has been in the last few days acting as election agent for Fine Gael.  We do not know where we stand with regard to this so-called Farmers' Party.  It has become a sort of tail wagged by the Fine Gael dog, and a very ineffective tail, if you like.  Does Deputy Blowick, as Leader of Clann na Talmhan, endorse completely the entire policy laid down by Deputy Dillon in regard to tillage generally?  Deputy Dillon, while Minister for Agriculture, said that he would not insult his land by growing wheat. In the course of this debate he reopened the attack on wheat-growing. He pointed out that the price of imported wheat is falling and that it is now much lower than the price of the home-grown wheat.  I think that the Deputy is quite wrong in the figures that he gave and I think that he exaggerated the price of Irish wheat as compared with that of the imported wheat.  He suggested that, on the basis of the prices he mentioned, we could get our wheat requirements from abroad cheaper than at home.</P>
    <P>What is behind this policy of not encouraging the growing of wheat in Ireland?  Is it not obvious that it will result in some of the best land in the country being used for grass or for the growing of oats and that such oats will then be sold in competition with oats grown by people who have less fertile land?  The market will then be flooded with oats by people with first-class land which would be suitable for the growing of wheat.  It is time we had a clear definition of policy in regard to all this.</P>
    <P>It is quite certain that Deputy Dillon's policy in regard to wheat is unchanged.  During the whole period of his office as Minister for Agriculture he did not advocate the growing of wheat until, within a month of being thrown out of office, he was forced&mdash; I suppose by his colleagues in the Government&mdash;to come forward, in the middle of the month of April, and ask <Col N="1627" /> farmers to grow more wheat at a time when every good farmer had his wheat sown.  That is Deputy Dillon's record in regard to wheat-growing.  I think, therefore, that the country is entitled to know his policy for the future.  We are not dealing in this matter with the policy of one individual.  We are dealing with the policy of a Party and possibly of a group of Parties.  Deputy Blowick has shown himself incapable of offering any independent line in regard to agricultural policy.  I know that, in the event of the present Government going out of office in the next two or three years, if a Fine Gael, Labour and Clann na Talmhan combination comes into office, it is by no means certain that Deputy Dillon will be the Minister for Agriculture.  The Labour Party may, and very probably will, claim that portfolio for the leader of the Federation of Rural Workers, Deputy Seán Dunne.  Then again, we shall have to ask what Deputy Dunne's policy is in regard to wheat growing. Does he agree with Deputy Dillon that the growing of wheat insults the land? Will Deputy Dunne, if he takes over the office of the Minister for Agriculture, seek to cut down the area under wheat and beet?  Those are two crops which provide a very large volume of employment both directly and indirectly. We know that the growing of wheat provides direct employment on the land and, in addition, men are employed transporting it and milling it. In the same way, sugar-beet offers opportunities for employment on the land, in the sugar factories and in transport.  They are very valuable crops.  If at any time during the next four or five years, Deputy Dunne should take office as Minister for Agriculture he will have to put his foot down fairly heavily with regard to Deputy Dillon if he is to maintain the growing of wheat and sugar-beet.</P>
    <P>While we may criticise the policies advocated in this House by various Deputies, I should prefer myself to concentrate entirely on suggestions for the extension and development of the agricultural industry.  It is no reflection on the farmers of this country that output is not as high as it should be <Col N="1628" /> or as it could be.  The disparity between output here and output in Denmark is not quite as great as some people try to make out.  We know the number of cattle per acre in Denmark and we know the amount of tillage there.  Very often, people who compare the Danish figures with our figures overlook the fact that we have a very substantial sheep population which Denmark has not got and also that we have a very substantial beef production and export trade, which Denmark has not got either.  Nevertheless, I think everybody will admit that there is room for expansion in our agricultural industry.  I think it would be a very sad thing indeed if there were not that room for expansion. All our hopes of making this country more prosperous lie in our ability to get more out of the land.  I should say that that is the fundamental basis of an agricultural policy.  We must get increased production per year and at the same time maintain fertility.</P>
    <P>Because I believe in getting increased production from the land, and at the same time maintaining its fertility, I am whole-heartedly in support of guaranteed prices both for wheat and sugar-beet.  Both of these industries are branches of the agricultural industry which enable the farmer to get the maximum output from the land. A cash crop such as wheat enables the farmer to cultivate his land and to get paid for so doing.  A cash crop such as beet not only enables a farmer to cultivate his land and get paid for so doing but, in addition, it leaves a residue in the soil which will be of value to crops that will succeed the beet crop in the ordinary rotation. Therefore, any Minister or any would-be Minister for Agriculture who condemns the growing of wheat and the growing of sugar-beet is striking a death blow at all the hopes we may entertain of expanding agricultural production.  One of the great advantages of a secure cash crop is that it enables the farmer who is short of capital to get on his feet.  The farmer who has land but very little money to stock and work it can contract to grow sugar-beet.  On that contract, without any further security, he will get credit <Col N="1629" /> to the extent of £18 per acre.  That is adequate to manure and seed the land properly.</P>
    <P>I think that that credit is available to him until his crop is sold.  The debt is paid out of the price of the crop.  The advantage of that to the farmer is only now beginning to be fully appreciated.  The growing of beet requires adequate fertilisers, adequate organic manure and adequate liming, and that leaves the land in a very much better condition than it was before the crop was sown.  One of the best ways of increasing the quality of our land would be for each farmer to contract for a substantial acreage of beet each year.  It is a matter of great satisfaction that the acreage under sugar-beet has substantially increased this year as compared with last year.  That increase in acreage means that a very considerable area of land will be improved.  It also has the added advantage that in at least two factory areas the maximum price will be given, as the bonus of 2/- per ton in addition to the basic price will be available.</P>
    <P>Last year, unfortunately, there was an organised move by Fine Gael to cut down the acreage of sugar-beet.  I suppose the people who inspired that thought that by cutting down on this valuable tillage crop they would add to the volume of unemployment, thereby embarrassing the Government, and that they would also lower the prestige of the Government considerably by being able to point to a reduction in the acreage under this very important crop.  The agitation, however, boomeranged to a great extent on those who organised it.  A number of prominent farmer members of Fine Gael deliberately and publicly cut down their acreage of beet to one acre.  They would have cut out the one acre only they wanted to retain a foothold in the Beet Growers' Association.</P>
    <P>The net result of their agitation was that they lost a considerable amount of money and caused a number of decent farmers to lose a certain amount of money.  This year they have increased their acreage because of the <Col N="1630" /> success of the crop last year.  They made this dastardly attempt on the economic life of the country in a year that was most satisfactory for the growing of beet.  They were unlucky in that respect because it turned out to be one of the best years on record as the average yield per acre was very substantially higher last year than in any previous year.  In addition to that, I suppose the yield on the better lands in Carlow, Kildare and Kilkenny brought the growers more profit than was secured in the past.  Thus an attempt to mix politics with agriculture and with economics, while it did a certain amount of harm in regard to employment in the sugar factories and to the economic life of the country in general, did the greatest amount of harm and inflicted the greatest amount of loss on those who organised the campaign.  In the present year beet growing has substantially expanded and I hope that the acreage will continue to expand.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see a move made to bring beet growing into a new county, namely, Donegal and I would be glad to see it expanded in Wicklow.  There is a prejudice against beet growing in many counties due to the fact that in the first years it failed miserably there because of a shortage of lime in the soil.  A deficiency of calcium in the soil resulted in a complete failure of the beet crop in many counties, particularly Wicklow, where the lime deficiency is very marked.  The memory of these failures has created a prejudice in the minds of farmers.  It will take a considerable effort to overcome that prejudice, but I think it ought to be overcome because in beet growing we have something that gives a very large output from each acre of land, which provides a very large residue of feeding stuffs for live stock and leaves the land very much better than it was before.  These are the great advantages of the growing of beet.  I feel that we can confidently look forward to the future with an assurance that no political party, whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Clann na Talmhan or Labour will ever again organise a campaign against the growing of sugar-beet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> Fundamentally, the most important thing is to get general agreement in regard to the basis of agricultural policy. I have no use for faddists who have prejudices against particular crops or particular types of stock.  The sane and practical farmer has no such prejudice. He will grow any crop that he thinks will grow satisfactorily on his land and he will keep any type of stock that he thinks will give him a decent return.  The general policy of agriculture should be based on the fundamental fact that all Parties should aim at increasing the total output of the land and at the same time improving the quality of the land.  That is the fundamental basis in regard to agricultural policy and it is one in regard to which I do not think there can be any difference of opinion.  People like the former Minister for Agriculture may dig up imaginary difficulties.  They may introduce the Egyptian bee or the warble fly or some insects with which they may be on familiar terms, but these are only attempts to confuse the minds of our people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has also drawn attention to that fact that there is not even one farmer Deputy of all the <Col N="1632" /> Opposition Parties in the House while the Agricultural Estimate is being debated.  As far as they are concerned they have as little interest in agriculture as Deputy Dillon had when he said he hoped and prayed God would speed the day when wheat and peat and beet would go up the spout.  That day has not yet arrived, and I think it is very far distant.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally, if we want to increase agricultural output, and I think that is the desire of every Deputy on every side of the House, we must start on the foundation&mdash;with the soil.  The first important essential is to improve the soil, to put into the soil the ingredients that are in short supply.  It may be lime or fertiliser, or it may be organic manure, but whatever it is that is deficient it ought to be supplied; and while it is the first duty of the farmers, as owners of the land, to endeavour to do that it is also the duty of the State to assist and encourage them in every way in achieving that as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to the Fine Gael Deputies over the past fortnight in County Wicklow and the Clann na Talmhan Deputies speaking on a Fine Gael platform asserting that the ground limestone scheme was due entirely to the wisdom and foresight and ability of Deputy Dillon.  Now I happen to know a little about this ground limestone subsidy scheme.  As we all know, there was for a number of years&mdash;I think since 1940 or 1941&mdash; a scheme for subsidising burned lime. It was operated by the county committees throughout the length and breadth of the State.  There was a substantial subsidy per ton and the committee, of which I am a member, provided a subsidy of 25/- per ton on all burned limestone.  When ground limestone came on the market we decided that, since two tons of ground limestone equalled approximately one ton of burned lime, we would give a subsidy of half the amount payable on the burned lime.  We accordingly decided that, subject to the sanction of the Department of Agriculture, we would provide a subsidy of 12/6 per ton on ground limestone, but in December, 1948, a circular was sent to <Col N="1633" /> our committee and to all other committees intimating that the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, had decided that the lime subsidy should not be payable on ground limestone. The result was that&mdash;as usual and like all committees&mdash;we protested and sent a deputation to the Minister for Agriculture.  If the present Minister wishes to look up the records of his office he will find that the deputation from the county committee of agriculture waited on Deputy Dillon some time early in 1949 and asked him to restore or sanction the subsidy provided by us on ground limestone.</P>
    <P>The members of the deputation stated their case to the Minister and he said that he was prepared to continue the subsidy on burned lime but under no circumstances would he undertake to subsidise ground limestone. He said it is cheap enough at 16/- per ton at the factory.  That was the answer that he gave us and he said: &ldquo;I am not going to subsidise this industry.  It can stand on its own feet and, perhaps, through competition between the different companies the price will be reduced.&rdquo;  That was the stand taken by Deputy Dillon in 1949 and in 1950, and that was the stand taken by him when he resisted the demand made by the E.C.A. representative here, Mr. Paul Millar, that lime should be subsidised.</P>
    <P>Viewing the whole position of agriculture retrospectively as an outsider, seeing the broad outline of production and the obstacles to increased production, the E.C.A. representative, Mr. Paul Millar&mdash;and I think Mr. Carrigan before him&mdash;suggested that the most urgent need for agriculture was to get as much lime as possible manufactured and put on the land as quickly as possible.  If we did that there would be the largest possible expansion of output.  He suggested that no State expenditure could give as great results in increased output as the subsidisation of ground limestone.  Yet we know on Deputy Dillon's admission that he said when that proposition was put to him as Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;This makes me mad.&rdquo;  It made him mad that a prudent adviser should put his finger on what the country required <Col N="1634" /> and should endorse what had been suggested to Deputy Dillon by hundreds of thousands of farmers during the two years he was in office.  The suggestion which he turned down when made to him by the farmers was endorsed emphatically by the E.C.A. representative and Deputy Dillon declared that made him mad.  But mad as he was, he was forced to accept it because the American representative undertook not only to provide Marshall Aid loan funds for that purpose but also to provide the money by way of Marshall Aid grant.  So that he left Deputy Dillon with no leg to stand on and he was forced in the last few months that he was in office to accept that scheme and put it into operation.</P>
    <P>Before I leave that, I am inclined to say that it is one of the best schemes of helping agriculture, but I think there is an undue amount of profit being made out of it by the main transport company.  It is difficult perhaps to come down too hard on a company like that which is losing money, but nevertheless I do not think C.I.E. should be helped along out of a subsidy that is provided in the main for agriculture. I think that something should be done to ensure that there is the utmost efficiency in the transport of ground limestone.  There is no sense in transporting limestone, say, from North County Dublin down to parts of West Wicklow, while there is limestone available nearer which may also be transported a very considerable distance. I think that is a matter which requires attention and that some saving should be effected by cutting down undue distances in regard to transport and transferring whatever money is saved in that way to the subsidisation of a greater tonnage of limestone. That is what we all desire and that is what the country needs.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of improving the soil, a fundamental question in regard to agriculture, I think it desirable that soil-testing should be expanded and speeded up.  There is, of course, a tendency on the part of farmers not to soil-test until they are coming near the sowing of the crop. As a result there is a rush at that time and sometimes results are not <Col N="1635" /> obtainable until it is too late to buy fertilisers.  If the testing of the soil and the application of the lime, at least, could be distributed over the whole 12 months it would be a great advantage.</P>
    <P>I think that the scheme in operation for the provision of credit for the purchase of lime and fertilisers under the land rehabilitation project should also be amended.  As I say there are many benefits to be derived from that scheme but, at the same time, it has certain disadvantages.  I was one of those Deputies who, when the Land Rehabilitation Act was going through the Dáil, advocated that particular scheme.  I was grossly insulted then by Deputy Dillon for making that suggestion.  I was told that I was asking the Minister to manure the farmers' land while the farmer as he said in that eloquent language that he occasionally employs, could &ldquo;sit on his sash.&rdquo;  I could never understand what exactly that phrase meant although I looked up many dictionaries but that was his reply.  A year later, however, he introduced the lime and fertiliser scheme.  The disadvantages, as I see them, in that scheme are that the farmer must submit his entire farm to the scheme and the essence of it is that the cost is transferred to the annuity.  The Land Commission naturally would be disinclined to deal with portion of a holding at a time.  For that reason farmers are a little bit scared, or perhaps prudently hesitant, about adopting the entire scheme and adding a fairly substantial amount to their annuities.  They fear, wisely, that they might be doing an injustice to themselves or to their families if they were to add to their permanent land annuity a substantial annual sum.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that he might amend the scheme in this way at least, that if the farmer did not wish to impose that liability on his holding, he could if he so desired adopt the scheme only in relation to the application of lime, that he might be allowed to purchase the fertilisers as required from year to year and that he would get the lime requirements on this long-term scheme. There is a lot to be said for not putting the fertiliser on a long-term scheme <Col N="1636" /> because the life of a fertiliser in the soil is very short while there is a lot to be said also in favour of putting the purchase of lime on a long-term scheme because lime, once applied in sufficient quantities to the soil, will leave its mark on that soil for a very considerable time.  I think the Minister should consider the desirability of amending the scheme so as to allow the farmer if he so wished to use lime only.</P>
    <P>I know also the disadvantage of the existing scheme so far as farmers with limited capital are concerned.  If the farmer secures all the nitrogenous manures his land requires, he will have a very big increase in his production of grass in the year in which the manures are applied.  If he has not sufficient capital to purchase additional stock, or stock are unduly dear at the time he requires to purchase them, he cannot reap very much value from the increased output of grass.  He will derive no advantages from the production of that large quantity of grass which he cannot use economically and he will be saddled with the burden of paying the debt he incurred to purchase the fertiliser.</P>
    <P>I mentioned before the necessity for complete agreement in regard to agricultural policy.  It should not be a Party question.</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Morrissey suggest that we should have a fight at every cross-roads about beet, about limestone, live stock and everything else?  Does he think that these things should be made the subject of Party controversy?  Does he think that we should have a would-be Minister for Agriculture going around the country telling the people that the Government were going to introduce compulsory tillage or were going to enter into an agreement to cut off live-stock exports?  Does he think it is an advantage to have a would-be Minister for <Col N="1637" /> Agriculture telling the people that the Minister is going to introduce the warble-fly inspector again?  Does he think that is good Party propaganda? Deputy Morrissey is appalled at the idea that the Party in opposition should drop that kind of play-acting and concentrate on the sound fundamentals of agriculture.</P>
      <P>In so far as Deputy Dillon in opening the debate expressed views of any importance, the only genuine difference he indicated with the Government in regard to agricultural policy was in connection with advisory services or the system of agricultural instruction and education.  He suggested that instead of agricultural instructors we should have parish agents.  That is the basis of the change in the existing system that he has been trying to put over on the country for the last two years.  It has been suggested that, instead of the efficient agricultural instructors we have at present, most of them zealous young men, we should have what he calls parish agents and that once we have parish agents, there will be a change in the whole outlook and position of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Members of committees of agriculture and farmers generally know that the whole proposition is utterly absurd.  Changing the name &ldquo;instructor&rdquo; to &ldquo;agent&rdquo; does not make him any more efficient.  It probably gives him a more American flavour, because I think they have parish agents, county agents and various other agents over there, but here the average farmer looks upon the agricultural instructor as a man trying to instruct and help him, but he looks on an agent as somebody who goes round from door to door trying to cod the farmer into buying something which is of no use and which he does not want.  Every farmer has had painful experience of being tricked by one or other of the various types of agents and I do not think that a change of title would make these zealous officers of the Department any more acceptable to the farming community.</P>

    <P>There is no merit whatever in the change and neither does it constitute <Col N="1638" /> any fundamental change in the existing position.  We have had over the past two years a very substantial increase in most counties in the number of agricultural instructors.  That increase has been brought about mainly through the demands put forward by Macra na Feirme, the Young Farmers clubs.  The members of that organisation have been asking for more agricultural instructors and naturally the committees have met that demand. The Government has also encouraged the committees to meet it and have cooperated by paying 50 per cent. of the cost.  The suggestion which Deputy Dillon tried to put over was that, under his parish agent system, each agent would have a compact area of about three parishes in which he would reside and would be able to keep in close contact with the farmers in the area but that is exactly the position which every competent county committee of agriculture maintains at present.</P>
    <P>Carlow is a very small county, but it is divided into three comparatively small areas, each looked after by an agricultural instructor.  The essence of what Deputy Dillon suggested through his parish agent scheme is already in operation in most counties.  In Wicklow, the county committee have also increased the number of instructors and have also divided the county into two compact areas, in each of which an agricultural instructor will reside and operate, in consultation with Macra na Feirme and other progressive farmers' associations in the area.  If that has not already been done in every county, I hope it will be.  I hope each county will be divided into local areas and that each area will be under the control of a resident agricultural instructor.  In some cases, it may mean a little difficulty for the agricultural instructors to have to reside in the area with which they deal, but it is most important that the agricultural instructor should reside as near as possible to the centre of the area in which he operates and should keep in the closest possible contact with the farmers, and particularly the farmers' sons.  He should know every farmer in his district and should know the type of land <Col N="1639" /> on every farm.  He should be able to give sound advice in regard to how those farms are operated.</P>
    <P>There is great merit also in the idea of the pilot farm.  A pilot farm is a farm operated by the farmer who owns it but operated in exact conformity with the instructions of the local agricultural instructor.  The essence of the scheme for pilot farming is that on one hand the farmer undertakes to carry out the entire instructions of the local instructor, and on the other hand, because of his entering into that undertaking&mdash;I suppose a verbal undertaking&mdash;the local instructor pays particularly close attention to that farm and thus makes it a demonstration farm for the area.  Tribute should be paid to the county agricultural officer in Kildare for having adopted that scheme successfully and I think the example he has set will be followed by every county agricultural officer throughout the State and that eventually we will have a large number of these pilot farms operating and setting a headline to the community in the area.</P>
    <P>When it is realised that there is so little between any sensible people who exist among the Opposition Parties and the Government in regard to agricultural policy, I have often felt that it would be a good thing if that unity of viewpoint in regard to policy were cemented and implemented by the establishment of a national council of agriculture.  It would make for an increase in confidence amongst the farming community in agricultural policy generally if all progressive and representative farmers' associations were represented on a national council of agriculture.  During the course of the milk strike early this year I had occasion to meet representative farmers from many counties who were engaged in milk production and I found that there was a very strong desire on their part to have a definite and direct say in agricultural policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a good thing if a council of agriculture had a chance <Col N="1640" /> of considering the heads of agreement in regard to trade with Britain.  That is only one of the many matters a council of agriculture could consider, in co-operation with the Government.  I know that the constitution of such a council offers difficulties, but if we accept the essential principle that every approved and representative nonpolitical farmers' association should have representation, I think we will find that it can be done.  We have congresses of various kinds which work efficiently and such a council of agriculture, a general national body representative of agriculture and meeting the Minister&mdash;not only the Minister for Agriculture but other Ministers&mdash;at frequent intervals would be able to have a voice in decisions on policy. If that were done it would obviate the frequent misunderstandings that arise and often lead to trouble.</P>
      <P>The difficulty with regard to milk supplies in the City of Dublin and Cork recently was in large measure due to misunderstandings and misrepresentation. That kind of thing could be avoided if we had a council of agriculture with representatives of Macra na Feirme, the Beet Growers' Association, the Milk Producers' Association and the various other associations representing agricultural interests which would meet the Minister for Agriculture and other interested Ministers in relation to discussions on agricultural policy.  I think such a council would clear the air and help to create a spirit of confidence and goodwill amongst the farming community in general.  The workers, of course, should also be represented on that council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a consultative body at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of consultative councils dealing with specific matters.  I want something that will be more in touch with Government policy with regard to agriculture. Indeed, such a council might have a wider scope and take into its ambit such matters as land acquisition and division, afforestation and so on. I am thinking in terms of a body with very wide interests, next in importance perhaps to the Oireachtas itself having regard to the fact that agriculture is <Col N="1641" /> of such fundamental importance to the economic life of the nation as a whole.</P>
      <P>A council of that kind would help, too, to protect the farmers from the kind of misrepresentation frequently indulged in by whatever Parties happen to be in opposition.  I am not now dealing with one Party any more than another.  If we had such a council it would not be possible for would-be Ministers to go around the country raising scares, telling the farmers that the Government was about to do something drastic such as prohibiting the export of cattle or something of that kind.  Through such a council the farmers themselves would be in close touch with the Minister and the Government and they would therefore be in a position to counter that kind of propaganda.  Such propaganda very frequently damages agricultural production. If people become disheartened or alarmed they may be forced out of some particular line of production which really offers opportunities.</P>
      <P>In addition to such a council and in addition to the county committees of agriculture there should also be district committees.  I think the county committees should be composed of the farmers in each county.  So should the district committees.  I believe a district committee representative of the area covered by an agricultural instructor would be the ideal committee. In each county there are two, three, four or five agricultural instructors. Each should have a specified area under his control and he should be responsible directly to a local committee of the farmers in that area.  He would, of course, be still under the control of the county agricultural officer but he should be compelled at the same time to give an account of his stewardship each month to a representative committee of local farmers. These farmers could make suggestions to him.  He could make suggestions to them in regard to experiments, pilot farms and demonstrations.  In that way the farmers would keep in close touch with the local agricultural officer and that would keep him on his toes.  He would meet the farmers regularly and have discussions with them.  I think such committees are overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> It is through such organisations&mdash;district committees of agriculture, county committees of agriculture and a national council based upon the farmers' associations&mdash;that we will succeed in bringing the farmers into closer contact and co-operation with the Department.  I am sure the Minister and others have noticed that Macra na Feirme in their weekly journal are very critical of the Department of Agriculture.  They regard it as a hopeless Department.  That may or may not be true.  If it is true, it is a bad thing.  If it is not true, it is still a bad thing that the farmers should feel that it is useless.  If the farmers were brought into closer contact with the Department through the medium of a council of agriculture that would help the Department to overcome the difficulties and weaknesses encountered when it tries to advance various schemes.</P>
    <P>We are not doing enough to offer incentives and inducements to increased agricultural output.  Frequently farmers contend that it is no use increasing production because increased production means reduced prices.  That argument is not entirely sustainable.  So far as wheat and beet are concerned it does not matter how much is produced because the guaranteed market is there.  There is no limitation.  There does not seem to be any limitation in regard to cattle, sheep and meat products of every kind.  No matter how much is produced there will be a market. Frequently prices decline on the world market without any regard to what the Irish farmer may or may not do. Prices on the world market are governed by world conditions and they will rise or fall irrespective of what we may or may not do here.  It is somewhat of a fallacy to suggest that increased production necessarily connotes reduced prices.  Confidence in relation to increased production was damaged in the years after the war. Poultry and egg production was boosted to the skies.</P>
    <P>An express guarantee was given by Deputy Dillon that the more we produced the higher would be the price.  That statement was made and circulated to every poultry keeper <Col N="1643" /> throughout the length and breadth of the Twenty-Six Counties.  To make it more acceptable and attractive it was accompanied by a large portrait of Deputy Dillon so that there could be no doubt that he was the man making the promise.  If they did not like to read the statement they could look at Deputy Dillon's face and see how honest he was.  In spite of that, egg prices collapsed completely from 3/- to 2/- and the bottom was knocked out of the whole poultry industry.  The auctioneers had a great time disposing of poultry houses that had been purchased at high prices and erected on the strength of the promises made. That kind of thing should not happen.</P>
    <P>I think Ministers should be guarded in giving guarantees in regard to prices.  They should only give those guarantees where they are firmly convinced that nothing is likely to happen to reduce the price for at least a certain period.  In that case too they should be careful to be specific.  Nothing is worse than that there should be a lack of confidence and a lack of security amongst the farming community.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that there is a tendency&mdash;a very proper tendency&mdash; to compare agriculture here with that in Denmark to our disadvantage.  A number of representatives of farmers' associations travelled to Denmark in the last few years and even in the last few weeks.  A very representative delegation of Macra na Feirme travelled to Denmark, stayed there a while, and lived and worked amongst the farmers.  They tried to find out what the Danes had got that we had not got.  The net result of their activities was to convince themselves that the Danish farmers have not better land than we have.  Neither are they getting better prices than we are.  I think that our young farmers satisfied themselves that the Danish farmers were not&mdash;I do not want to be discourteous&mdash;anything more intelligent than our farmers.  I do not think I should suggest that they were less intelligent, but certainly they had not any great advantages in regard to intellectual ability.  They had not any <Col N="1644" /> great advantages in regard to the quality of the soil or to the prices they received for their produce.</P>
    <P>The question would, therefore, arise as to where did the advantage lie in Denmark as compared with this country.  Where has Denmark the advantage over this country?  One is immediately forced to the conclusion that in Denmark there is a very great measure of specialisation as compared with this country.  Here we produce beef, milk and everything so to speak.  In Denmark there is intensive concentration on butter fat and on butter fat alone.  For that reason cows are bred solely for their butter fat output.  Of course, that certainly makes for higher efficiency.  Any farmer who has experience of beet growing in this country will realise that those who go in for beet growing extensively improve their farming because they specialise in that particular line.  In the same way farmers who went in for supplying milk to the city to a large extent improved their methods.  A certain amount of specialisation has helped to increase the output of Denmark.  Perhaps, the most important difference between Denmark and this country is that we have only about one-eighth of our land under cultivation while there is about two-thirds of the land under cultivation in Denmark.  That intensive cultivation does make for getting the last ounce of productivity from the land.  Here we have nearly 10,000,000 acres of permanent pasture land which from year to year produces, perhaps, a profit for its owners because there is very little outlay in working it and very little use for machinery.  You can work a very large farm with a little outlay if you keep it under permanent pasture.  The net result is that you have low output, low costs and you are able to make a reasonable profit if you have sufficient land.</P>
    <P>That may be all right for the individual farmer but it is bad for the nation.  The time has come when definite and effective incentives should be given to the farmer to step up the acreage under tillage.  The British found that a tillage bonus was extremely effective during the war. <Col N="1645" /> Some such incentive would be desirable here.  Land does not produce its maximum when it is left to the activities of nature.  It is an established fact that land left to nature will tend to produce not feeding stuffs for live stock or food for human beings but vegetation of every kind that has very little value.  For that reason it is essential, whether we concentrate on growing foodstuffs for live stock or food for human beings, that we should take the plough over the entire farm at frequent intervals.  There are exceptions, of course, to every rule.  You cannot dogmatise in regard to agriculture but as far as the ordinary land is concerned if you do not take the plough over the entire farm a substantial portion of that farm will go to waste.  First, heath, rushes and everything else will spring up plus the ordinary vegetation on the pasture and the land will deteriorate from year to year and no addition of fertilisers or manures will improve that land.  We must set ourselves deliberately to stepping up the acreage under tillage.</P>
    <P>I think that should be the first objective of Government policy.  &ldquo;One more acre under the plough&rdquo; is a slogan that has been frequently used but it has not always been implemented by those who use it.  I do not think that the Government should go in for adopting empty slogans of that kind but that they should go in for practical methods and step up the acreage under the cultivation of crops. In that way and in that way alone will we get the last ounce of productivity from the land.  I move to report progress.</P>

The Government agreed in March, 1950, that our local authorities should have a 95-120 hour fortnight provided, they said further, any extra cost would be met by a saving on the Estimate.

When the corporation take over rooms which <Col N="1649" /> they may get, they give back only 200 for 1,000 people.

      <P>The present statutory basis of distribution of the agricultural grant is the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1939.  Local authorities have, however, been proceeding on the mistaken assumption that the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, was in operation or that it would be extended, without amendment, to the financial year 1953-54.  As it is proposed to submit legislative proposals to the Oireachtas to apply the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Act, 1946, with amendments, to the current financial year, it was necessary to notify local authorities of this intention.  They were informed that demand notes might be prepared in accordance with the new proposals, but they were given no direction on this point.  This procedure <Col N="1651" /> was followed on previous occasions.  It is obviously the only practicable procedure in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 18 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A health authority shall, in accordance with regulations, make available, without charge, a health examination and treatment service for the pupils attending schools to which this section applies.</P>
      <P>(2) This section applies to every school which is&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a national school or</P>
      <P>(b) a school to which an order under sub-section (3) of this section applies.</P>
      <P>(3) Where a health authority are not satisfied that an adequate health examination and treatment service is available for the pupils attending a school in their functional area which provides elementary education and is not a national school, the health authority may by order direct that this section shall apply to the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Nothing in this section shall <Col N="1652" /> be construed as authorising a health authority to provide any general domiciliary service or any services such as are mentioned in Section 14 or Section 19 of this Act.</P>
    <P>The effect of this amendment is to limit the school health examination and treatment service to children attending national schools and other elementary schools in relation to which the health authority are not satisfied that an adequate service is available for the pupils.  It will be applied to all national schools and every elementary school where that elementary school has not carried out a satisfactory medical examination&mdash;that is, satisfactory to the local authority.</P>
    <P>This amendment has the effect of confining the school medical examination to elementary schools only.  A good deal of consideration was given to the medical examination of children in other schools, that is vocational schools and secondary schools, but there was a great difficulty encountered with regard to the various proposals that were put up.  There is one thing that we think is definitely impossible and that is to have a medical examination of night pupils at technical schools. It would, I feel, be possible to have the pupils of the day vocational schools medically examined the same as elementary schools.  When we enter into the field of secondary schools we are up against difficulties.  The day pupils in secondary schools are living at home.  The other boys and girls of the same age, that is 14 to 18, are going out on other business during the day. There is no medical examination as far as they are concerned.  In any case, the day pupils of secondary schools between the ages of 14 and 18 are under the control of their parents and they would be looked after in the same way as any other section of the population between the ages of 14 and 18.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it came down to a question of day pupils at national schools and boarders at secondary schools.  When we came to consider the boarders at secondary schools we were up against the problem of the means of the people attending.  In some of these schools, the pupils are paying a fairly substantial fee and it would look incongruous <Col N="1653" /> that they should be granted free examination and free treatment.  Then it was thought that we might have a clause similar to that which we have for elementary schools, that where the local authority was not satisfied that a proper examination had been carried out, they themselves would carry it out but at the expense of the manager of the secondary school.</P>
    <P>At that stage I met the clerical managers of schools and they objected to that provision, because they said some of the secondary schools could not afford this charge.  We could not see how any proper division could be made between those who could afford to pay and those who could not afford to pay.  As a result of consideration and these various meetings, I thought that the simplest way out in the present Bill was to confine school medical examination to primary schools.  That is the effect of the amendment offered here.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion that was made to me was that we should give the service to secondary schools who. applied for it.  I would not see any great objection to that, I must say, but I think that on the whole when we go so far as to make a proper provision in this Bill with regard to elementary schools, it might be sufficient for the moment and it would be possible to deal with other pupils as we go along.</P>
    <P>Those Deputies who have read the recommendations of the Youth Unemployment Commission will have learned that it was recommended there that all pupils attending elementary, vocational and secondary schools should have medical examinations.  But they also advocated medical examination for young people going into a trade.  That would appear logical because we would be including most of the population between the ages of 14 and 18.  I think it might be as well to stop, as I propose to stop in this amendment, and consider what provision can be made generally for examination of youths between the ages of 14 and 18 at another stage. Therefore, I feel that the simplest and the most logical way of dealing with it is to deal with elementary schools only, as proposed in this amendment.</P>

Under this proposed new section the local health authority is not given any further powers than they have under the law at the moment and I do not think it even purports to enable them to enlarge on the services that they provide now.  It may enable them&mdash; and I do not think they need this provision to enable them&mdash;to have more frequent inspections.</P>
      <P>I think they have that already.  In relation to the bringing within the scope of this provision the elementary schools other than national schools, it must be borne in mind again that in so far as regulations are going to be made there and in so far as they are going to be enforced, and particularly with regard to the grading of the pupils from the point of view of means or capacity to pay in whole or in part for whatever treatment may be prescribed as a result of the examination, the rules and regulations made or approved by the Minister must be enforced by the county council.  I just mention that, but it does seem to me that this section does not give any further powers.  If it gives any more power either to the Minister or the local authority in regard to national schools than they have at the moment I would be glad if the Minister would tell us about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the section is concerned, the Deputy is right.  It does not change the position very much but the Bill does change the position slightly.  As this section is drafted now free examination in national schools and free treatment for any defects arising out of that examination are given.  If the medical examiner thinks, for instance, that the child should have his tonsils removed, teeth extracted or his eyes seen to or that he should be given some treatment by way of orthopædic surgery, all that will be free. Apart from that, however, as the Bill stands, if the medical examiner, for instance, says to a child: &ldquo;I think you <Col N="1656" /> should go for examination to your own doctor.  You seem to be suffering from anæmia,&rdquo; and his own doctor says: &ldquo;You want hospital treatment,&rdquo; if he is in the middle income group, the hospital treatment is free.  In that case there is better hope of treatment than there was before because I would say the great majority of national school pupils will be in the lower or middle income group.  For the few in the higher income group, there is nothing being done there.</P>

Does the Minister intend to do that in the present Bill, as he works through the clauses, by way of amendment, or later as that works out?  By the removal of Section 18 completely, there is no authority now for the examination of pupils of secondary schools.  I suggest that secondary school pupils do not come within the category of people who do not need free medical services because many working people, because they live in the country, have to make sacrifices to send their children to secondary schools, even to boarding schools.  That is the only way they can be educated.  They would need medical services in the same way as the lower income group need them.

From my own personal experience in dealing with school children living in my own town, fully 50 per cent. of those children would come within the normal scope of people transferred from the <Col N="1661" /> national school and kept on in secondary education, not because of the fact that their people can provide it but because the convent there provided it practically free for them to give them the chance of better education.

      <P>I am concerned with the compulsory element in the Minister's amendment.  The Minister says that where a health authority are not satisfied that adequate examination and treatment are available for pupils attending a school in their functional area which provides elementary education and is not a national school, the health authority may, by order, direct that this section shall apply to the school.  Now the Minister has spoken of examination being carried out in a national school or in an elementary school.  Do I understand the Minister to imply that if an examination is carried out under compulsion in a non-national elementary school the owners or the managers of that non-national elementary school will be required to provide facilities for examination of the pupils in that school?  That is No. 1; and No. 2 is, what is elementary education in relation to the intention of this amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A national school is a definitely definable institution.  It is scheduled with the Minister for Education and is a definite recognisable type of school. An elementary school is not so definable or recognisable, and a school which provides elementary education is even less recognisable and definable. The Minister must be aware that all secondary schools are to some extent based upon junior schools.  Some of these junior schools may be national schools definitely recognised as such. Others are junior schools which are entirely private schools and in respect of which the State has no responsibility for examination or any payment of any kind.  There are then a number of schools conducted by private persons. Some of them may be entirely elementary, for infants; some of them may range up to the ages of, say, 11 or 12, but others may be the analogy of the junior schools in some of the more <Col N="1662" /> established institutions.  They are private secondary schools.  There are many parts of the country, particularly in Cork, where they have developed recently, and such a private secondary school will have its junior foundation. Now if this is so, then it is evidently a school which provides elementary education.  There are, therefore, at least two points that we require some information about here&mdash;the power of compulsory entry into a school, and the power compulsorily to require facilities in a private school for carrying out the examination of such pupils there if their parents do not object.  We want to know what the Minister means when he talks of elementary education and the various types of institution in which elementary education is carried out other than in a national school.</P>

      <P>There was the Public Health, Medical Treatment of Children (Ireland) Act of 1919.  It, in a way, defines it thus:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An elementary school means a national school or any school recognised by the local government board as providing efficient elementary education.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Evidently it is a very hard thing to define, and we can only do it in the same way.</P>

      <P>In the 1919 Act, evidently, they had some difficulty in defining an elementary school, and they defined it by saying a school where the Minister is satisfied that they are carrying on elementary education.  Well, 1919 is a long time ago, and there was no such thing as bureaucracy at that time, and if we do the same now I am sure it will not be objected to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to compulsion, first of all, it must be known to all Deputies that no child is compelled to submit to a medical examination if the parents <Col N="1663" /> object.  Parents have that right, and we still maintain that right of withdrawing their children from the medical examination if they so wish.  But apart from that, the medical officer of health lays down a programme of the number of schools where he is going to have a medical examination carried out, and he gets in touch with the manager and tells him that his medical examiner will be there on a certain day.  Very seldom is there any trouble as far as that goes, because he may give a direction which would compel the manager to provide the facilities if he is not willing to do so.  That covers the point where the Deputy asks the question whether compulsion will be used.  Where elementary schools do not want this medical examination they will have to provide it if the medical officer of health notifies them that he intends to carry out a medical examination.</P>
    <P>The medical officer of health, of course, will know all the elementary schools in his area, and will have a fair idea, without inquiry at all probably, whether proper medical examination is being carried out.  If he makes inquiries and satisfies himself that the manager of the school is unco-operative and refuses to give any information the only thing he has to do is to say: &ldquo;I am going to carry out a medical examination and am sending a medical examiner in on such a date, and I am now giving you notice that you must provide the facilities&rdquo; and so the thing is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand this, to take one point?  Say that in a small urban area a private teacher takes in young children of junior age to the number of say, 12 or 16, and gives them the foundations of primary education.  Is the Minister's case that he is going to bring this elementary school within the meaning of this Act and bring it within the range of the local authority so that it may apply medical inspection to that school?  If four of the parents do not object but the manager does not want to have anything to do with the medical examination, is the inspection going to <Col N="1664" /> be forced in that school, must the manager provide for the inspection, inside the precincts of that school, of those four children?</P>

      <P>If there is to be that firm policy on the part of the Minister for compulsory examination in these cases, for compulsory entry into such schools, we want to be clear as to the range of schools over which he can press that compulsion.  The definition in this section leaves it completely in the air.  It speaks of &ldquo;a school in their functional area which provides elementary education.&rdquo;  The Minister has referred to the 1919 Act for a definition of an elementary school.  Why does the Minister avoid the use of the words &ldquo;elementary school&rdquo; here?  He speaks of a school where elementary education is given. There are schools which, while entirely in private hands, are analogous in structure to a secondary school like Belvedere or Blackrock College, where you have secondary education carried on as a private institution but by a religious order and fully organised and where there is a junior school run in connection with it.  If a school is organised on those lines by a private lay person in the country, is the junior side of that school going to be open to compulsory examination in this way?  On the other hand, are the junior schools of the more established institutions open to this examination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I have in mind that you might have an elementary school as part of another school.  The Deputy gave an example in the case of Blackrock.  I do not know the conditions there, but if there is an elementary school there for pupils between eight and 12 years of age, it would satisfy me that it is an elementary school for the purpose of the section. I am a little doubtful whether we have expressed ourselves sufficiently on this point of elementary schools.  I would like to examine it, to see whether we should not define it again in the section.  It might be safer to have it defined.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister appreciate that we have to read these sections, and even the proposed new Sections 20 to 30 inclusive, in the light of the wording of Section 21?  If the Minister would occasionally advert to that, he would have a little more patience with us.  Section 21, under which the other seven or eight sections have to be operated, says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations applicable to every health authority, every health authority of a particular class or a particular health authority as to the manner in which and the extent to which they are to make available the services specified in Sections 13 to 20 of this Act and generally in relation to the administration of such services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then sub-section (2) says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Regulations under this section, may, in particular, provide for services being made available for a particular class of person only.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have to read and examine Sections 13 to 20 in the light of what is set out there in Section 21, having regard to the fact that the regulations&mdash;either general regulations covering the whole country or specific regulations for a specific area or even particular regulations for a particular school&mdash;will be made by the Minister and operated by the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He may make regulations for a particular class of health authority, that is to say, he may specify the city health authorities or the rural health authorities, or even one health authority.  He may provide regulations applying to a particular class of persons. That class of persons may be school children, or elementary school children.  I think these refinements are necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the things that makes me rather afraid.  Section 21 is so cleverly worded and so fully comprehensive that it empowers the Minister to make any sort of regulations he likes in respect of any particular service, either the manner of the service or the extent to which it may be administered and to any particular class of person.  Extraordinary powers are given there and there is an amazing variety and number of regulations which the Minister could make, and there is power to enable him to make these regulations of as wide or narrow an application as to him seems fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not quite clear that the power under this section is very sweeping?  I am satisfied that the present Minister would not make regulations that would outrage anybody's feelings or rights, but this is continuing legislation and this section and the amendment are of so ambiguous a nature that anything can be done.  Picture for a moment one of those elementary schools with about eight or nine pupils&mdash;three of the children belonging to one family and one or two others belonging to other families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us assume that the majority of the parents object to the examination but that there is one child whose parents are neutral and who do not say either &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The manager is then ordered to proceed to make the facilities available for the examination.  He does not feel that he should, in view of the fact that the parents have objected.  He can be <Col N="1668" /> prosecuted for failure to make the facilities available for the inspection of one or two children out of the eight or nine children in the school.  If he wants to co-operate with the medical officer and tells him that the parents of some of the children object, the medical officer is then guilty of an offence and it is an outrage upon the rights of the child or the parents.  My objection to this section is that it gives a sweeping power to the Minister to make regulations relating to all these particular things.  We have no indication as to how far the Minister may, in a whim or when he is incited by some particular anxiety or for some cause, make a regulation of a very sweeping nature.  I think the Minister should reconsider the whole section and the amendments thereto.  It would appear to me that the Minister is assuming a power that is too far-reaching and too dangerous.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it has been found in all Parliaments that you cannot legislate for every possible contingency that may arise.  Therefore, we have the procedure of regulation because it may be changed from time to time.  If you tried to draw up a Bill covering every possible contingency, in all probability you would need an amending Bill the following year.  The only way of saving parliamentary time is the system of making regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under paragraph (17) of amendment No. 55, all regulations must be put before the Health Council.  I want to point out that more than half the members of the Health Council will be appointed by professional associations and not by the Minister.  Therefore, you will have a majority on that council who will, I feel, be a very good watchdog on the Minister.  It is true that they cannot stop the Minister.  The Minister must have the last word.  He cannot delegate his authority like that. However, at least they can make a bit of trouble if they think the Minister is doing anything unreasonable.  They can publish the fact that the Minister has made regulations which, in their view, ought never to have been made and which are not right and they can also put something in their annual <Col N="1669" /> report.  I have not the slightest doubt that if the Minister makes a regulation which they do not like, they will get in touch with their friends in Parliament. The regulation would then have to be put on the Table of both Houses of the Oireachtas and discussed.</P>
    <P>We could not possibly provide in the Bill for every contingency.  We must do a good lot by regulation.  However, I have tried to make it not impossible but very uncomfortable for any Minister to make regulations that might be objected to.</P>

      <P>I know that the Minister has arranged for the examination of the regulations made by him in this particular case and under other Acts of the Oireachtas and in this case the Health Council may indeed be of some very material benefit in protecting the interests of the citizen. Does everybody know, however, that the power of Ministers to make regulations is utilised to stop some loophole or some interest that the citizen may have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that you cannot legislate for everything.  That is true, but if the citizen gets some right or if some protection is given in the Act of the Oireachtas, the Minister can then take power under a regulation to stop <Col N="1670" /> that particular right and to close that loophole against him.</P>
    <P>If, in the course of the administration of this Act, some privilege or right was established for the citizen to protect him against inroads on his rights by the Minister, the Minister could then step in and make a regulation to stop that and to close that loophole. That has been the complaint of every constitutional lawyer and every parliamentarian in the world&mdash; that the power of the Oireachtas or Parliament is handed over to the Minister or to an executive to make regulations that were never intended by the Oireachtas or Parliament when the Act was going through.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he has these two bodies on the Health Council and follows it up by saying that they have not any power to compel the Minister but that they could get in touch with their friends in Parliament. That was one of the objections that I had, prior to this&mdash;that, to get what you are entitled to, you have to go and approach some Deputy to protect you.</P>
    <P>I think you should not have to do that.  Then the Minister says that the Oireachtas may annual the regulation. We know that it is almost impossible to do that against a Government with a parliamentary majority.  Their name, their reputation and their prestige are at stake.  They would never dream of allowing members of the Opposition to have a regulation annulled because it would practically be a vote of no confidence in the Executive.  On the other hand, to get members of the Government's own Party to approach the Government to have the regulation annulled would be tantamount almost to mutiny within the Party.</P>
    <P>While they may look fine on paper, as protection, what rights has the citizen?  I think they are very poor props when called upon to carry the burden.</P>

Is it not worsening the position of the workman's child who is at present attending a secondary day school?

But I want to make this reservation. I may have to make some provision under the regulations that if a child, say, is going back week after week to have broken spectacles renewed, a charge will be made.

      <P>There are one or two points in this section which were referred to when we were discussing Section 15.  I notice that sub-section (b) of this section says: &ldquo;for children under six years of age attending clinics, health centres or similar institutions, in respect of defects discovered at such clinics, centres or institutions&rdquo;. Does that mean that these will be the centres in which the mother and child scheme will be administered? If that is the case, I should like to know why the mother and child scheme extends only to a child up to six weeks of age.  If children are to be treated at some centres from the school age onwards, why was not the mother and child scheme extended to children up to six years of age?

      <P>Ophthalmic treatment is specialist treatment.  Specialist treatment for the middle income group is supposed to be free whether in an institution or otherwise.  This section deals with pupils of national schools and children attending clinics.  Why should there be charges?  The section states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A health authority shall, in accordance with regulations, make available, either, as may be specified by the regulations, without charge or at charges approved of or directed by the Minister dental and ophthalmic treatment and dental, optical and aural appliances&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) for pupils of national schools, in respect of defects discovered at school health examinations, and</P>
      <P>(b) for children under six years of age attending clinics, health centres or similar institutions, in respect of defects discovered at such clinics, centres or institutions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was specialist as I read it as far as <Col N="1674" /> we have come.  The middle income group are entitled at least to the Minister's offer of specialist treatment.  Am I to take it this is free only if they go to institutions?</P>

      <P>As I have already said (a) deals with pupils attending national schools.  It is intended that pupils attending national schools will have free medical examination and free treatment for any defects arising out of that examination.  It is obvious that dental and ophthalmic treatment will arise out of that examination.  You might add tonsils.  They would be free. They would also, as I pointed out on Section 17, be free to children under six years of age attending a clinic or similar institutions in respect of defects.  These are defects, as I mentioned on that particular section, and therefore they are free.  But I said I was making certain reservations. The principal reservation is where a pupil is inexcusably careless&mdash;say, breaking spectacles every week or so. The same might apply to the teeth, maybe not to a child of that age, but it might apply to an old person who breaks his plate very often.</P>

      <P>The White Paper pointed out that complete medical and hospital services would be made available free of charge for children up to the age of six weeks whose mothers are entitled to avail of the maternity service and for children attending welfare clinics <Col N="1676" /> or similar institutions up to six years of age, and a school medical service for pupils attending national schools.  It says then that it is intended at a later date to extend these and make them available to persons in the middle income group for a charge not exceeding half the cost.  It is not possible however to provide these services until suitable arrangements be made and until local authorities have adequate personnel and facilities available.  This is the section dealing with the middle income group.  We have dealt with children under six weeks, and then children from six weeks to six years and then children attending national schools and now we are coming to the people in the middle income group who are not covered by these juvenile classes and it is laying the obligation on the local authority to provide the services for dental, optical and aural appliances and treatment for which a charge may be made. That charge will be made by regulation, but as laid down in the White Paper it would not normally exceed half the cost.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give us any idea where dental services are at present operating, the extent to which they are adequate or otherwise, and could he give us any idea what organisation is ultimately contemplated or likely to be established under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the present time the local authorities employ dentists, firstly, for school children and, secondly, for lower income groups. There is no service supplied so far by the local authority for middle income groups.  The National Health Insurance section, which is now in the Department of Social Welfare, would make contracts with certain dentists for carrying out the work for them. The local authorities, as far as I am concerned, have not got adequate services, not even for the lower income group and children of national schools at the moment.  I have been urging local authorities for some time back to improve the service by employing more dentists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the middle income group come into this, it is claimed by dentists that <Col N="1677" /> a great deal of their work will be taken from them.  I do not want to see men driven out of business and I must say that I certainly would not object to&mdash; in fact I think I would approve strongly of&mdash;local authorities not getting all their work done by full-time dental surgeons.  They will want some full-time dental surgeons but they can also offer employment&mdash;whether dentists will take it or not is another question&mdash; on a sessional basis to the existing dental surgeons in the county.  I think we can get over the difficulty on both sides by that system, that is, that the local authority will get more dental surgeons if they are asked.  The dental surgeons who are now in practice in the county and who are afraid that they will lose a great deal of their practice, will get work in lieu of that from the local authority on a sessional basis.  Personally, I think that is the way it should be done.  I have mentioned that to the dentists themselves and I think they would welcome that type of arrangement.  I have not met the local authorities yet to discuss the matter with them, but I have no great doubt that the local authorities will agree because I am sure the members of local authorities would be anxious to ensure that existing dental surgeons are not put out of business completely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister speak in the way in which he has because, apart from the aspect he stressed now, I think the Minister will find that in regard to dental and optical work the availability of a full-time dentist or a full-time optician is very largely wasted.  Where local institutions have had to depend upon a full-time man, particularly in the case of dentists, it was almost impossible to ensure that people in the institution were properly served by one dentist. Usually in many cases, the dental trouble had passed before the dentist arrived, so that I think the line of thought the Minister was pursuing with regard to the use of part-time dental and optical officers is the right line to adopt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to agree with that.  I take it that the <Col N="1678" /> Minister will allow a free choice of dentist. Does the proviso exist also, as in the case of doctors, that the dentist concerned must be a dentist who has entered into a contract with the Department of Health or is the Minister going to throw this open <i>ad lib</i> to all dentists?  Could the Minister give us any idea of what this type of treatment is going to involve financially? Will it be paid for, partly out of the rates and partly from central funds, or is there any indication as to what this particular service will cost?  I take it that the dental service is thrown open to the entire middle income group.  That will cost a great deal, and I should like to know where the Minister proposes to get the money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy realises that all these charges, the charges under this Bill and under the 1947 Act, are paid by the local authority and that they are recouped to the extent of 50 per cent. from the Department of Health.  The same will apply here. Whatever extra charges are incurred, they will be regarded as health charges and will, therefore, rank for the recoupment of 50 per cent.  The Deputy mentioned one other matter.  I do not want to be misunderstood.  When I said that I was anxious that the existing dentists if they feel&mdash;some may not feel&mdash;that their living is going to be taken from them, by the extension of the services provided under this Bill, and that I would certainly agree, and in fact would encourage, local authorities to employ these men on a sessional basis, that did not necessarily mean that there will be a choice of dentists.  I have no objection to that, but it may not be possible in all cases. It may very well be that a local authority will have only one man in a particular district.  I could not say definitely but there would certainly be a good chance of a choice of dentists, just as there is a choice of doctor in maternity cases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit to the Minister my doubts on that?  They would have no power whatever to do that because after all the national <Col N="1681" /> health insurance scheme is a separate service to which people pay contributions and under which they are entitled to certain benefits.  My view, which I submit just for the Minister's consideration, is that the sections dealing with dental benefits do not in any way give either the Minister or the local authority power to interfere with the present benefits due under the National Health Insurance Act.  This section makes it mandatory on the local authority to provide a service.  I do not want anybody saying afterwards that the Minister said that they could take the national health insurance scheme as an alternative.  I do not think that is so under this.</P>

      <P>When I meet the local authorities and say: &ldquo;We must hammer out a scheme for this group and I think it would be a good idea to put it on a sessional basis,&rdquo; they may say: &ldquo;Why not a scheme like the national health insurance scheme?&rdquo; In other words, they say to a person: &ldquo;If you want a tooth out, that is free; if you want a filling, you must pay half and we will pay the other half; and if you want a plate, you must pay two-thirds and we will pay the rest.&rdquo;  I am merely giving these as examples.  That is roughly the national health scheme and that might be the scheme which they would prefer.  They might say, however, that they would have a sessional scheme under which a person comes in and is told: &ldquo;Go and see the dentist who will be there from 11 o'clock until 1 o'clock and we will find out afterwards what was done.  When we know what was done we will have to make a certain charge.&rdquo;</P>

For the contribution I am paying, I am entitled to all the benefits under the national health insurance scheme without any further contribution.  If I come in here as a person who, the local authority says, should make a contribution, in addition to my national health insurance contribution, I would <Col N="1682" /> be expected by the health authority to make a contribution for dental treatment over and above.

It arose only where there was a surplus in the fund and when the new scheme came in, there was nothing at all provided for it.

      <P>This section replaces Section 28 of the 1947 Act and Sections 20, sub-section (3) and 90 of the Public Assistance Act of 1939. Section 28 of the 1947 Act is in much the same words as this.  It reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations applicable to every health authority of a particular class or a particular health authority as to the manner in which and the extent to which they are to exercise their powers under this Part of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The two sections I refer to in the Public Assistance Act of 1939 are very long and I do not propose to read them, but they also give power to make regulations.  I should like to say, however, that, in the White Paper, there is section 35, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Modifications of the scheme to meet local requirements may be necessary.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think that would be a case where it would be necessary to have different regulations for different health authorities. It also says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>proposed under this scheme can be</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The full additional benefits <Col N="1684" /> made available gradually only.  The enactment of legislation, recruitment of staff, provision of clinic buildings and other facilities are steps which must be taken before the full services can be made available.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is fairly obvious that, in relation to some of these services at least, some local authorities may be ready before others and they may indeed be urged by intending or expectant beneficiaries to bring in the scheme, and they, in turn, may urge the Minister to make the necessary Order to set the scheme up, so that from many points of view it will be necessary to have regulations which will apply to some authorities and not to others, at least at the same time.  There is quite a lot to be said for the section as drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section to which I referred earlier when discussing the new Section 18.  It is the section which provides the Minister with the power to make all or any regulations dealing with the preceding seven or eight sections which cover perhaps one of the most important, and certainly one of the most controversial, parts of the whole Bill.  The cost of providing the services is to be borne, in the main, by three different parties&mdash;the patient, the central authority and the local authority&mdash;but all power under this section is being taken exclusively by the Minister.  The section says:&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations applicable to every health authority...&rdquo; It does not even include the words in some of the other sections: &ldquo;...or the Minister may approve of regulations.&rdquo;  May I respectfully suggest that, if regulations are to be made for a health authority, for every health authority of a particular class or a particular health authority as to the manner in which and the extent to which the services shall be made available, and, in particular, the services for a particular class of persons, these exclusive powers should not be given to the Minister? Where variations in the regulations will have to be made by the Minister, they will have to be made in the main because of differences in local conditions. Where differences in local conditions are concerned I submit that, <Col N="1685" /> while I do not want to cram any more power or authority into the hands of the county or city manager, whoever he may be, regulations suggested by the local health authority with full knowledge of local conditions for the approval of the Minister would, I think, be a more satisfactory way, and probably get better results than having it exclusively in the hands of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I know that I can be answered by saying that the Minister, before he makes regulations, will consult with the local authority in regard to the regulations he proposes to make, or that it will be in response to suggestions made by the local health authority that the regulations will be made and that they will be restricted either to the manner, the extent to which, or to the particular class of persons as suggested by the responsible local health authority.  Frankly, I would prefer that all the power was not reserved to the central authority in a manner like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the section under which Sections 13 to 20, inclusive, will in future be operated and, if the local authority is so empowered to make these regulations subject to the approval of the Minister, then I think at least we could assume that these regulations which would be proposed for the Minister's approval would only be put forward by the local health authority after consultation with the county medical officer for health and the other medical men in the particular health area.  In that way I think we would be more likely to get rules and regulations suitable to local requirements than if we leave it exclusively in the Minister's hands.  I do not see that the Minister can have any very strong grounds against inserting or agreeing to insert in this connection the words &ldquo;or regulations approved by the Minister&rdquo;, the intention being to give to the local health authority the power to draft regulations to meet local requirements, to send them to the Minister for his approval, or otherwise.  In that case we would be more likely to get for each health authority a set of regulations and rules more suited to its particular requirements than we would get by <Col N="1686" /> rules and regulations made entirely by the central authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a good deal of what the Deputy has said.  If the regulation were to come from the local health authority it might be a very good thing.  There are two matters that we must keep in mind.  Firstly, we want a certain amount of uniformity. I am sure Deputies will admit that if there are contiguous counties giving different benefits, the one that is not doing so well as the adjoining counties will have to be compelled by regulation to come up to that level of efficiency in benefits.</P>
      <P>One might as well let them all start off on the same level because we want a certain amount of uniformity.  On the other hand, we recognise that conditions vary in the cities and towns and the rural areas and that is why we say here that we can make a different regulation for a specific health authority.  If a particular health authority drafts its own regulations and sends them to me for approval and I then say that I am prepared to make the regulations, we actually achieve what the Deputy has in mind.  I would be very glad indeed to have that co-operation from the local authorities. I am sure we will have it.  I would like to have the local authorities take the initiative.  We will certainly accept their co-operation and I think it is unlikely that we will have to force any unwelcome regulations on them.</P>
      <P>I was looking at sub-section (2) again.  I will consider it to see if it is really necessary.  It may not be necessary. I notice it was not in the 1947 Act.  Why it is put in here I do not exactly know but I will have the matter examined to see if it can be removed on the next stage.  I think sub-section (2) is the one that gives rise to most anxiety so far as members of the Opposition are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course we have already met that in a previous section. I am glad, however, that the Minister will have another look at it.  I am afraid that what he has said now does not resolve my fears.  He said it was desirable to have uniformity.  I agree that is desirable in so far as it is possible. <Col N="1687" /> We know, having regard to the different health authorities, that it is very difficult&mdash;indeed almost impossible to have uniformity.  I do not want to be misunderstood now and I want it to be remembered that I am not talking about anybody here present, but we are not legislating here for to-day, to-morrow or next year.  I am afraid that people in the central health authority without a local intimate knowledge may be so concerned in getting uniformity that they may, in fact, make regulations impossible to implement or likely to cause hardship in their implementation.  The Minister says they will have the co-operation of the local authority.  I have no doubt at all about that.  If I had any fears on that point it would be that the local health authority might be inclined to co-operate too freely, if the Minister and the House understand what I mean; the local health authority might accept something about which it had doubts merely because it was framed and made a regulation by the central authority to whom the local authority is responsible.</P>
      <P>I think there is a distinct difference between having regulations governing the operation of the sections to which I have referred&mdash;regulations thought out, drafted and initiated by the central authority &mdash; and the central authority examining proposed regulations which have been thought out and considered in the light of local circumstances and initiated by the local authority.  I think there is a very big difference there.  Frankly, I do not see that the Minister would take from himself any of the powers that he should reasonably expect to have or would in any way forgo any of his official authority by agreeing to amend this section to read &ldquo;that the Minister may make regulations or approve of regulations&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of fact, that is in some other section in the Bill.  In my opinion it would not in any way weaken what the Minister wants to do.  I would suggest it would make it much easier even to get as near as one can to the uniformity about which the Minister speaks.  There is no use in thinking <Col N="1688" /> that we can have uniformity as between County Dublin and County Leitrim or as between County Limerick and County Donegal.  I think it will be almost impossible to get it.  I think we can get nearer to it by giving the local health authority the right to draft and submit to the Minister for his approval with or without amendment or addition, a set of rules which, in the opinion of the local health authority, with the advice of the county medical officer and the other medical officers attached to that particular authority, are satisfactory. I seriously suggest to the Minister that what I am now putting forward would improve rather than disimprove this particular section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am prepared to consider that but not as suggested by the Deputy.  I am not going to make a point about that, however.  I am afraid another sub-section is required and I will have the matter examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The uniformity here is for the purpose of giving the Minister administrative control over the situation.  Uniformity is very often the foster-mother of delay, frustration and disorganisation rather than anything else.  You will have cases, say, where the Department will hold out for the appointment of a full-time assistant in a particular place because there has been satisfactory work done by a full-time man in some other place.  The result is that there is delay if somebody is appointed and he does not get satisfactory assistants.  They have not a satisfactory income and their services are wasted.  You will come up against cases in relation to a small district hospital where the work is being carried on by the local dispensary doctor who is the doctor for the hospital as well, because in some other part of the country there is a person in charge who is a medical officer in charge of a district hospital.  That is his sole public appointment.  A vacancy occurs and a separate dispensary doctor is required for the area and for the district hospital.  Two people are appointed to part-time positions. Neither of them will be able to give adequate assistance to the area.  The result is that both the dispensary doctor and the district hospital doctor <Col N="1689" /> appointed are only waiting to get out as quickly as they can.  There is a delay in getting people to take the jobs and, when they are filled, the people stay for a short time only and then clear away.  Then there is not a satisfactory medical officer because the principle of uniformity has been brought in.  That which operates well in one particular part of the country does not operate so well in another. I think the Minister in looking for too much uniformity will want to be careful that he is not looking for just delay and frustration and disorganisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to think that the central control of local authorities and the power to induce them to accept certain principles as to how they should govern are being put into effect in this health administration. I am convinced that it will lead to dire confusion everywhere.  I feel myself in agreement with what Deputies Morrissey and Mulcahy have said, that a different set of circumstances will apply to practically every county.  To start with, the financial conditions in each one of the Twenty-Six Counties are different.  Certain counties will be in a position to introduce certain regulations and carry out certain types of health administration efficiently, while other counties will be unable to do that.  The matter would certainly rest with the local authority which, I presume, is the county manager.  I hope that he will consult with the medical officer of health as well.  The local people will be in a better position to decide what is suitable to local conditions.  I do not suggest that the Minister will do anything out of the way if he gets these powers, but the whole trouble in this Bill is that we are legislating for the future. We want to ensure as far as we can, if we are going to have these health services, that at least they will be run with as little friction as possible.  A parallel case exists in regard to housing where the local authority is subservient to the Local Government Department.  Local authorities can do nothing without reference to it.  This leads to delay and confusion and maladministration. I think this section is of the same kind.  If you are going <Col N="1690" /> to have health services they must be put into effect by the people on the spot who know local conditions.  I am glad to see that the Minister is inclined to meet Deputy Morrissey's suggestion.  That will be welcomed by the people on these benches.</P>

      <P>Section 22 is a very simple section as the reading of it will indicate. It provides that a maternity grant will be payable to all women in the lower income group.  It defines, of course, what confinement means.  I think we have already defined persons in the lower income group.  A person in the lower income group is a person who is unable to provide for himself by his own industry or other lawful means medical, surgical, ophthalmic treatment, etc.  Such a person would be in the lower income group and the women concerned would get the £4 grant.</P>

I do not know how you are going to get uniformity there. The point that I want to make is that perhaps where the milk for children is most needed, or in the health authority area where it would be most needed because of the comparative poverty of that area or district, it is likely, because of the poverty of that district, to be the one in which the service will not be supplied.</P>

In those circumstances, the local authority is left with an option.

    <P>(a) the charge approved of or directed by the Minister under Section 24 of this Act for such services in a private or semi-private ward (as the case may be) in that institution, and</P>
    <P>(b) the charge approved of or directed by the Minister under Section 24 of this Act for such services in that institution otherwise than in a private or semi-private ward.</P>
    <P>The idea behind this amendment is that if a person in the middle income group, seeking hospital treatment, is anxious to have a choice of hospital, the local authority would give the choice of hospital but would only be responsible for the payment of a subvention for such hospital treatment. The next point is, how is that subvention to be calculated?  The local authority will take the weekly agreed amount paid to voluntary hospitals at that particular time, and from that amount they will deduct two guineas. The difference between the two would be the subvention which they would pay.</P>
    <P>Persons who opt for choice of hospital and accept this arrangement with the local authority of a subvention of so much a week would be entirely responsible for all the charges, in addition to that subvention, wherever they might go, whether to a voluntary hospital, to a private ward or a private <Col N="1697" /> home.  All that the local authority is bound to take responsibility for is the subvention.  Let me give an example of the subvention.  At the present time, local authorities are paying £5 12s. per week to voluntary hospitals for any patients they send to them.  If we deduct £2 2s. from that, we are left with £3 10s., so that if this section were in operation at the moment and a person were to approach a local authority, sent, of course, by his family doctor and preferring a hospital, and the local authority were to say: &ldquo;Yes, you have been sent by your doctor there and we accept it that you want treatment in hospital; you are in the middle income group; we have verified that, and so we are prepared to grant you a subvention of £3 10s. a week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the meaning of this particular amendment and that is how it is intended that this particular amendment would operate.  On the Second Reading of this Bill, Deputy Dr. O'Higgins expressed a desire for a choice of hospital; so did others.  The Catholic Hierarchy were most anxious for a choice of hospital and I think this is the amendment that meets the situation.</P>

      <P>I would like to point out to the Minister that as far as people insurable under the Social Welfare Act are concerned, their lot under this section is not going to be as good as it is at present.  It is not a very big point but take, for example, the case of people who are in insurable employment at the moment and who go to a semi-private ward of a hospital or to a private hospital.  They are in a position to obtain the full amount of what the contribution is from social welfare towards the payment of their expenses there Under this amendment and under the new Bill they will not get the full amount.  They will get £2 2s. a week or 6/- a day less than the full amount.  Therefore, the person who elects to go to a private ward in a hospital or to a private hospital, instead of having £5 12s. per week towards the cost of the expenses, will only have £3 10s.  That is quite a drawback for a large section of the public.  They will lose very considerably by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1698" /> This is not a very big matter.  I do not think the subvention, whether it is £3 10s. or £5 12s., will make an awful lot of difference to people in this particular group but it is an example of where a relatively large section of the community are going to be worse off in that respect under the new legislation than they are under the existing Social Welfare Act.</P>

      <P>I take it that the free choice of hospital will penalise the patient to the extent of £2 2s. per week or 6/- per day.  The middle income group is entitled to specialist treatment. If they go into a hospital that is accepted by the local authority, that is, if they go into a hospital which the county manager, who is the health authority, wishes them to go into, they have the full amount paid.</P>

      <P>They are also entitled to free specialist treatment, but if they wish to go into a hospital to which they are recommended to go by their own private doctor they are at a disadvantage. We must accept the fact that certain hospitals may be better for certain types of treatment than other hospitals.  Any doctor who has been practising over a number of years will recognise the fact that if you are dealing with a particular type of ailment, you may send the patient to &ldquo;A&rdquo; hospital for such and such treatment and to &ldquo;B&rdquo; hospital for another type of treatment.  That is why it is desirable that the medical officer or the doctor in attendance should be in a position to decide where the patient is to go.  This amendment of the Minister's permits him to do that already, but if the doctor sends him there the patient loses the benefit straightaway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to this Bill the middle income group are supposed to get the benefits of free specialist treatment and free maintenance in an institution. This amendment, in effect, removes that from them so that they lose £2 2s. per week or 6/- per day plus the right <Col N="1699" /> to free treatment.  In other words they are going to be heavily fined for a free choice of hospital.  Having a certain amount of experience over the years practising in Ireland and in England as well, I am very strongly opposed to this, and I think every member will agree with me&mdash;perhaps the Deputy doctors will agree also&mdash;that doctors are in a position to say what is the best place to send the patient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister stated.  I took a note of it. He said that in relation to the middle income group.  The voluntary hospitals are charging £5 12s. per week to the local authority.  If the local authority is sending a patient to a hospital that has a contract with the local authority that full sum will be paid for specialist treatment for the middle income group.  This amendment permits him to send that patient to another hospital that has not got this particular agreement with the local authority.  If he does that, as I heard the Minister and as I read this amendment, the patient will be at the loss of £2 2s. per week.  He will receive only £3 10s. instead of £5 12s.  He will also lose the right to free treatment.  I cannot read it in any other way.</P>
      <P>I do not think this is a satisfactory amendment at all.  You are purporting to offer the people a free choice of hospital and free choice of doctor and you are penalising them for doing so. I do not think that is a satisfactory state of affairs.  As I have stated before, and as I state again, what we in these benches regard as right is that people should have a free choice of doctor and that a doctor should have the right to send a patient to any hospital.  That is the only way you will have a satisfactory health service or give the people the best services available within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment, although it is very long, is fairly clear as far as it goes.  It provides that the patient may be sent to a hospital or a nursing or maternity home approved by the Minister.  The particular hospital or home must be approved by the Minister.  The rest of it sets out what is to be paid by the local authority towards the cost of the services which the patient will get. It will be a sum £2 2s. less than the amount charged by the hospital or nursing home at the particular time to the local authority.  These are the only two points that are really covered in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, all that is qualified by sub-section (1), which I want Deputies to read, because it brings me back <Col N="1701" /> again to the famous Section 21.  It says the person is entitled, &ldquo;having regard to the regulations under Section 21 of this Act.&rdquo;  We are going to pass this amendment, but we do not know what the regulations will be or what type of person will become entitled under them.  Whatever is proposed to be given in this proposed new section, it will be governed entirely by the regulations which will be made later by the Minister himself. Those regulations will not determine the amount to be paid, because that is set out in the amendment, but they will determine the persons entitled to take advantage of this free choice of hospital or home.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde, if I may say so, appeared to be making the point which Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll endeavoured to make when he made the distinction between what will be allowed under this new amendment and what the person is entitled to under the National Health Insurance Act. The two things which are specifically set out here are that the hospital to which the person may be sent must be approved by the Minister, that it must be on the approved list&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOCarroll" hpid="Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not challenging that at all.  The home or hospital must be approved by the Minister.  I merely say that, plus the proportion to be paid, are the only two conditions set out here specifically and that are not conditioned by the regulations to be made under Section 21.  What we have been asked is to pass the amendment without knowing to whom the benefit is going to be available or what type of person can avail of it. That will be determined under those regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say a few words to remove any misunderstanding or misapprehension.  Deputy Esmonde was under the impression that a person in the middle income group is entitled to free hospital treatment.  That is not altogether true.  A person who goes into the county hospital in the ordinary way does not ask for choice <Col N="1702" /> of doctor or hospital, but he may be charged up to £2 per week.  It depends on his means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In the middle income group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is quite definite. A person who is told he will be charged the £2 may say that he will choose his own hospital, in that case; or he may say he is quite satisfied with the county hospital in any case and is making no change.  I want to make it clear that a person in the middle income group may be charged £2 at present.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke of the doctor sending his patient to hospital.  I had that in mind myself.  Although we innocently make legislation here giving the person the choice of hospital, we really give it to the person's doctor. The person will very seldom express a choice.  The doctor may advise the patient and the patient will probably accept the advice.  Therefore, Deputy Esmonde was speaking correctly, to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The choice of hospital, the Deputy says, carries a heavy penalty, because if a person chooses for himself he will have to pay something as well and will also have to pay his doctor.  I have not great sympathy for that person.  I have sympathy for a person who has that sort of mental anguish that leaves him not prepared to face a certain hospital which he may be prejudiced against.  It would be very bad to drive that person there and a great pity not to give him a choice. But the person who has no prejudice gets no great sympathy from me.  Our local health institutions give as good treatment as any hospital in Dublin or elsewhere.  If a person has a whim or fancy for another hospital, I do not see why the local authority or the Department should be put to the expense of paying something extra to satisfy that whim.  I am talking now only of a whim or fancy.  It is quite a different matter if the doctor says there is a very good reason why his patient should go to a certain hospital.  It may be specialising in a certain ailment, such as genito-urinary disease. Whether the patient is able to pay or <Col N="1703" /> not, if the doctor has a good reason, the patient will be sent to that hospital. The doctor will send a note with the patient into the county hospital, as he must get the medical surgeon to agree.  Then the patient will go to the hospital indicated.  There is no doubt about that.  No lay person is going to interfere with it and all the lay person will be asked to do is to make the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputies to realise that if there is a good medical case for a choice, it can be made, without any extra expense to the person concerned. Secondly, even if the person does not choose his own hospital, he may have to pay up to £2 a week.  When we are told that the patient has to pay heavily for choice of doctor, I may say there are modifying circumstances, and it is not as bad as that.</P>
    <P>On the point made by Deputy ffrench-O'Carroll, it is true that under this section an insured person will not get as good terms as he is getting at the moment.  Against that, however, every member of his family, if he is in the middle income group, will get free treatment or treatment at a small charge; whereas at the moment only he himself is entitled to free treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that in certain circumstances a patient may be charged £2 2s. in the local hospital, even if he is in the middle income group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, according to his means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister clarify that and indicate in what circircumstances he might be charged, as it is not very clear to me?  I was under the impression that the middle income group, provided they availed of the services of the State or rate-aided hospital, were entitled to free maintenance and free treatment.  It was news to me that they had to pay £2 2s. under certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made the case that a particular type of case such as he mentioned may be transferred to a particular hospital.  Does it rest with <Col N="1704" /> the county surgeon in the county hospital?  Has he the authority to do that, or does it rest with the county manager; because the whole point I wish to make is this&mdash;that the person who has a moral contract with the patient is the doctor who is attending him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the doctor ought to be free and untrammelled in his choice, and I would not like to feel that the doctor is in a position that the official person who decides whether he has a right to send that particular type of patient for treatment is a layman&mdash;the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not agree with the Deputy.  I was explaining that the doctor treating a patient would have absolute discretion as to the hospital he would send the patient to; but sometimes a difficulty would arise as we all know that there are certain doctors in the country who do not like the county surgeon and who might be inclined to say: &ldquo;Well, I will not send a patient to that fellow, anyway.  I would like to send him to a decent hospital in Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It could work the other way, too.  The county surgeon might not like certain doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is quite true. The only sensible way to work it is this.  Throughout the country if there is a patient whom the doctor thinks is a case for hospital, if it is a surgical case, I think the county surgeon should verify that, and if it is a medical case the county physician should verify it, and the county manager will not in any case interfere with that decision. There may be certain cases where a dispensary doctor is very reliable and perhaps sends only one or two cases a year and they are always passed, and if there was urgency about a case the county manager may say: &ldquo;Well, this man is always reliable.  We will send on this case to a hospital in Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely under the regulations the county manager has the power to veto any decision that is <Col N="1705" /> made.  The Minister states that the attending physician or surgeon recommends the patient for treatment, and if it is a surgical case it will be decided by the county surgeon, and if it is a medical case by the physician resident in the hospital.  But surely the regulations such as they are give the county manager, who is the health authority, the right to veto that.  I do not say that he is going to do it, but we are making legislation for the future.</P>

      <P>I wonder would the Minister reconsider this point?  I think that Deputy Dr. Esmonde has given genuinely constructive criticism of some of the aspects of this amendment here.  We can perfectly understand if an insured person was pressing for the benefit of the section and chooses to go to a private hospital that he should be asked to pay something extra if there is a means test in the section, but I cannot see why it is reasonable to ask a person to pay £2 2s. a week for wanting to go to one hospital rather than to another.  That is what I would call interference in something which is purely a medical problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with you there.  After all it is really a medical problem, a matter between patient and doctor where the doctor and the patient decide between themselves that it would be best for the patient to go to a particular hospital. There are many general hospitals in Dublin and the Minister has admitted himself that patients may have prejudices against certain hospitals.  They may have had relatives there before who were not happy during an illness. There may be a psychological factor like that, which is quite important, and they may have very definite ideas of where the patient should go.  I do not agree for a moment with Deputy Dr. Esmonde that in general the choice under this Bill is going to be less than it is at present.  I would ask the Minister could he reconsider this.  It seems <Col N="1706" /> to me that if a patient and his doctor make up their minds that it would be more suitable for the patient to go to a particular hospital it is not fair that it should have to be submitted to the local authority whether the patient should pay £2 2s. as a result of the doctor and patient having arrived at that decision.  I think there is a fair point there and I would ask the Minister if he would consider it.</P>

      <P>Of course those Deputies who have some contact with local authorities know that that is the practice at the moment.  Patients of the middle income group going into the county hospitals or even the city hospitals are charged a certain amount, very seldom more than £2 2s. a week, and it is merely intended to continue that practice; but there are not very many charged the full £2 2s.  Some may be charged less and the majority <Col N="1707" /> nothing at all.  Anyway it is provided already as far as this Bill is going that the local authority will charge £2 2s. a week to certain people if they go, say, to the local authority hospital.  If a person comes in and says &ldquo;I want to choose my own hospital&rdquo; we cannot possibly charge him less than £2 2s. because we would stultify ourselves if we did.  If it were less than £2 2s. they would be charged in choosing their own hospital it would be pointed out &ldquo;well, the charge here at the moment is £5 12s. but of course you are in the middle income group and you are at the top of it.  You have to pay £2 2s. yourself, therefore you will be charged £3 10s. for your accommodation in the county hospital&rdquo;.  If the patient says &ldquo;well, I would like to choose my own hospital, I would like to go up to one of the hospitals in Dublin&rdquo; the reply would be &ldquo;if you do we will pay a subvention&rdquo; and if they are going to pay more than £3 10s. look at the position.  This would mean getting into one of the wards of the big hospitals in Dublin at £5 12s., less what the local authority gives him, and so he gets off better by going to Dublin than by going to the county hospital.</P>

      <P>We cannot say that.  We cannot encourage people to choose a hospital in Dublin rather than a county hospital.  We must at least keep the county hospitals full.  The Dublin hospitals are full enough.  I think nobody will say that whatever charge we lay down here with regard to a person in the county hospital we could make any regulation that will give him better value financially by choosing his own hospital.</P>

      <P>But my suggestion was that the patients are not going to suggest that they should be sent to such-and-such a hospital.  If a doctor recommends a patient to a particular type of hospital then it is rather harsh that this doctor is not allowed to decide it, it has to go before the local authority and that sort of thing.  I quite <Col N="1708" /> see the Minister's point.  The case the Minister is making is that if a patient has a particular fancy to go to a Dublin hospital everybody will feel &ldquo;we want to go to Dublin&rdquo;, and nobody would go to the local hospital at all.  The suggestion is regarding doctor-patient relationship.  If the doctor recommends a patient to a particular type of hospital I really see no reason why there should be any difficulty.</P>

      <P>We are bringing in legislation for the future, not for to-day or to-morrow, and I am trying to give a precedent for the future that if the doctor is treating a patient surely he ought to be free to decide where that patient goes to get the best treatment without having it referred to the county manager.</P>

      <P>I want to point out that the law as it stands, as I pointed out a few moment ago, says that the local authority shall do so and so and so and so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite say that is the county manager.  It is actually not the county manager.  He is given certain duties by the local authority.  When the case is decided by the general practitioner, fortified by the county surgeon, this particular patient must go to a certain hospital in Dublin.  The county manager&mdash;usually it is one of his staff&mdash;makes the arrangements. That has been going on for years.  All the Acts say the county authority shall do so and so or the Minister shall do so and so, but it is actually done otherwise. <Col N="1709" /> In a medical case the Minister has his medical advisor and for administrative matters he has the officials.  I do not see any necessity to change the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are seven sub-sections in this proposed new section, and six of them are related back to sub-section (1) Sub-section (1) has to be determined by regulations to be made later under Section 21.  The type of person, apart altogether from the number of persons, to be entitled to benefit is to be determined by those regulations to be made by the Minister. We are asked to pass a new section in those circumstances.  That is what I object to&mdash;we do not know exactly what we are doing or the type of person or number of persons that will be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations are made under the Act, as the Deputy knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me back to what I object to.  Section 21 is completely sweeping.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations applicable to every health <Col N="1710" /> authority, every health authority of a particular class or a particular health authority...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It may operate over the whole of the country or only for one authority. That is to be determined by the Minister. Furthermore, the Minister may make regulations which govern entirely this new section we are discussing, as to the manner in which and the extent to which the services are to be made available.  I do not want to refer again to sub-section (2), as the Minister has promised to look at that again.</P>
    <P>When you relate this amendment No. 45 to the type and scope of the regulations to be made, and to the manner and extent to which the services shall be made available, which will be for the Minister to determine, and whether this is to be applicable to every health authority in the State or only to one, one can see the trouble there is about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some aspects of this that need to be discussed further.  The question has arisen as to the general implication of sub-section (4) of Section 14, which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where institutional services are made available under sub-section (1), in cases not governed by sub-section (3), there shall be charged such charges, not exceeding...&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It is 6/- a day now, for each day&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;...during which institutional services are availed of, as may be determined by the health authority...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that here we are dealing with the general class of the &ldquo;second 1,000,000,&rdquo; which implies that it is a rather general matter, in the case of that class, that they will be charged 6/- a day for institutional treatment, unless they can show that their financial situation leaves them unable to bear that charge.  The implication is there that normally 6/- a day is charged.  When you come to Section 15, the maternity services are provided free, that is, without any implication that there is to be a charge of 6/- a day.  When we come to the facilities provided for going to an institution of <Col N="1711" /> your own choice under the Minister's amendment No. 45 now before us, we see that the payment that is made on behalf of the person by the local authority is what they would normally make per person in respect of a person who normally came under Section 13, less the 6/- a day.  That may be understandable in relation to the ordinary person going for surgical or medical treatment to an institution of that kind.  But the same deduction of 6/- a day is made in the case of a person going for maternity treatment to an institution of her choice.</P>
    <P>The difference in the free treatment that is implied in Section 15 for a maternity case as distinct from an ordinary surgical or medical case under Section 14 is wiped out in the case of a woman who elects to go to a nursing home of her choice.  I would direct the Minister's attention to that as a special aspect of this matter.</P>
    <P>A question has been raised about the necessity for patients to look for a hospital of their choice.  It is suggested that in very many cases it is rather a hospital of the doctor's choice than a hospital chosen by the patient. I would agree that that is an important aspect of the matter and that it is a further extension of the doctor-patient relationship.  We have already stressed the importance, from a medical point of view and from the point of view of confidence and health, of the relationship and the confidence between a doctor and a patient.  When it comes to choosing a specialist or an institution I think that the doctor's choice of a specialist to deal with whatever additional work that requires to be done or of an institution to which to send the patient is a most important extension of the doctor-patient relationship.  That aspect of that relationship is very definitely maintained when the patient knows that he is being handed over to an institution or a specialist with whom the doctor himself has established that particular type of intimate relationship that inspires confidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll mentioned the question of the national health insurance person and the loss of <Col N="1712" /> two guineas a week as far as a person like that is concerned under the present scheme.  He makes the remark that it is not a very big point.  I think it is.  These questions of two guineas here and two guineas there make the marginal difference between a person being able to get the treatment of his choice and not being able to get it. When it comes to illness, and particularly a long drawn-out illness, two guineas a week makes a very material difference.</P>
    <P>I want to revert again to the maternity case.  I want the Minister to explain why, in the case of a nursing home and a maternity home, there is a stipulation that the period in respect of which payment will be made will be limited to six weeks in the case of a nursing home and two weeks in the case of a maternity home.  It does not seem that a restriction of that particular kind applies to a hospital or institution. Under Sub-sections (2) to (5), there does not seem to be a suggestion of a limit in period like that.  Why is it introduced in sub-section (6)?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the expression, &ldquo;hospitals or homes approved by the Minister,&rdquo; I should like to put this for consideration to Deputies.  The Minister always had that power with regard to the national health scheme. We did not want people going into what are not exactly private homes but places where people are kept, such as places beside the sea, and some of which are more of a boarding-house than a private home.  The line has to be drawn somewhere.  For that reason, it is necessary to have the expression, &ldquo;hospitals or homes approved by the Minister&rdquo;.  The regulations lay down the conditions necessary to qualify.  The same will be here, I expect.  There will not be a question of disqualifying any ordinary hospital or home.  That brings us to the point about the six weeks for the ordinary case and two weeks for the maternity case.  In some of these private homes, people are kept over a long period.  I myself have known fairly wealthy old people go into a private home and stay there for months and have a good rest, a good time and be well looked after.  We do not want the fairly wealthy person&mdash;I <Col N="1713" /> use the words &ldquo;fairly wealthy&rdquo;&mdash;to avail of our scheme, to get £3 10s. a week out of it, and help them to stay in a private home for many months. That is the reason for the limit which is put there.  However, Deputies will notice that it is subject to an extension where a case is made that an extension is necessary for medical reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out the difference between Section 15 where free institutional attention is given in a maternity case and Section 14 under which a person, say, of the middle income class is charged 6/- a day in respect of institutional treatment. Take, for instance, two women&mdash;one looking for treatment under Section 15 and the other looking for treatment under Section 14.  Let us assume that they take that treatment in the ordinary institutional way under the health authority.  One of them is charged 6/- a day&mdash;that is the non-maternity case&mdash;and the maternity case is not charged anything.  But if these two people elect to go to a nursing home then the maternity case loses the advantage that is assured to her under Section 15 and she is charged the 6/- a day as if she were an ordinary non-maternity case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Just that I do not think, as I said before, that local authorities should be asked to pay for the fancy of a person like that.  A local authority is providing the best possible service <Col N="1714" /> both in its own institutions and in the voluntary hospitals to which it sends its patients.  If local authorities send their patients to places where they can get the best possible treatment, then I think they are doing their duty.  If a patient, through some whim, says: &ldquo;I want to go to another hospital&mdash; one of my own choice&rdquo;, I think the local authority can say: &ldquo;Well, in that case, we cannot give you the subvention.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Withdraw the subvention, yes, but why withdraw the 6/- a day which is guaranteed to her under Section 15?  The Minister has had put before him very clearly the inadequacy of the number of beds in quite a very large number of our counties.  It has been made clear to him that the fact that a large number of maternity cases like to go to nursing establishments of their own choice is of very great convenience at the present moment to local authorities and is a very great help to the class of people under Section 13 who require institutional maternity treatment. Why should the Minister arrange that, say, financial facilities that are very definitely prepared for the maternity case under Section 15, as compared with the ordinary medical cases under Section 14, should be wiped out just because a woman requiring maternity treatment goes to a private nursing home?  I move to report progress.</P>
