      <P>The total number of agricultural holdings of ten statute acres and under in County Galway on 1st June, 1952, which is the latest date for which these statistics are available, was 5,864.  Particulars of the numbers of holdings of 20 statute acres and under have not been complied, but it may be of assistance to the Deputy to state that there were 8,313 holdings of 15 statute acres and under and 16,824 holdings of 30 statute acres and under in the county on 1st June 1952.</P>

      <P>The promoters of this project were informed on the 16th July, 1952, that certain facilities for the duty-free importation of certain semi-manufactured goods would not be granted inasmuch as existing manufacturers of the articles in question were carrying <Col N="1000" /> out a full manufacturing process and were not being afforded the facilities which the promoters were seeking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if his attention had been drawn to a statement made at the Irish Trade Union Congress on the 23rd July, 1953, that C.I.E. were importing 1,000 goods wagons, 100 carriage and under-frames, 200 carriage bolsters, 200 carriage bogeys and 12 diesel electric locomotives; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not correct that C.I.E. have arranged for the importation of goods wagons.  Certain components for 1,000 wagons were, I understand, ordered in 1951 and are now being imported as owing to supply difficulties at the time it was not possible to arrange for production at their own works, and with the aim of preventing the interruption of their wagon construction programme.</P>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to a similar question last week, C.I.E. have also arranged to import a number of steel castings for passenger-coach under frames, which could not be produced in this country.</P>
      <P>Twelve diesel electric locomotives are being imported as part of an order placed in 1948.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (a) the amount of interest paid by Bord na Móna for money advanced to it for the years 1951-52 and for 1952-53, and (b) the amount of capital repayments for each of the years mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Interest payments by Bord na Móna in the years referred to were as follows: 1951-52, £13,441 17s. 9d.; 1952-53, £48,121 16s. 10d.  For the first year mentioned the payment relates solely to interest on advances originally made to the Turf Development Board, Limited, the liability for which was assumed by Bord na Móna.  The payments made in 1952-53 include payments in respect of advances to Bord na Móna for their first development programme.</P>
      <P>The amounts of capital repaid in these years were as follows: 1951-52, Nil; 1952-53, £2,548 5s. 6d.  The payment made was in respect of advances made to the Turf Development Board, Limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is <Col N="1002" /> aware that some of the holders of higher executive positions, in some semi-State concerns, are guaranteed their remuneration, even if subsequently placed in minor positions, by means of contracts which they have made with the boards of directors; and, if so, if he will convey to his nominated directors the inadvisability of continuing these contracts or entering into similar new contracts in view of possible changes in State policy which would make it undesirable that the services of these employees should be retained in the positions to which they had been appointed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the amount of interest paid by harbour authorities in the Republic of Ireland (a) on money borrowed by way of bank overdraft, (b) on stock issue and (c) on money borrowed from other organisations for the years 1951-52 and 1952-53.</P>

      <P>C.I.E. were informed, on the occasion of the transfer of the Dun Aengus to them in July, 1951, of my desire that the vessel should be replaced.  The board have examined the position and have submitted certain proposals which are under consideration.</P>
      <P>The s.s. Dun Aengus was built in 1912.  The cost of repairs and overhauls in the last five years was approximately £28,000.  The losses sustained by the Galway Bay Steamboat Company in the running of the vessel between the 1st January, 1948, and 4th August, 1951, when the vessel was transferred to C.I.E. were as follows: 1948, £1,670; 1949, £2,446; 1950, £2,959; 1951, £2,385.

There are numerous grades of coal produced which are sold at widely differing prices according to the quality and source, and it is not possible to make a valid comparison between an overall average cost of production figure at the pit and the retail prices charged for different types of coal in Dublin or elsewhere, or to account for the difference between these unrelated figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The position apparently is that county rate warrants have gone out in some counties and not in others and there appears to be a general atmosphere of mystification in the country what the ultimate intention is. Will the Minister consider making a statement before the Dáil adjourns for the recess, as to whether the agricultural grant is to be distributed this year on the old basis or, if on the new basis, what that new basis is to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis on which the agricultural grant is to be distributed has been conveyed to each council and, on that circular, they are expected to prepare their demand notes.  It is a matter for the authorities themselves as to when these demand notes will be issued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is no different this year from what it has been all the years since the agricultural grant was introduced.  The demand notes were prepared at all times by county councils on the basis of a circular issued by my Department and this was later confirmed by legislation introduced into this House.  There is no departure from that procedure this year and the local authorities are not expected to believe anything other than what is conveyed to them in the circular of the 20th May.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that in recent years the circular from the Minister has been on precisely the same terms as the circular of the previous year and the legislation has been of a repetitive character. This year it is proposed to make a radical alteration in the method of distributing the grant, involving a substantial additional charge on the rate-payers. In those circumstances, perhaps, the Minister would appreciate the local authorities' difficulty and direct them.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister say why he has not given the reasons why the post office was changed and placed virtually at the end of the area which it serves so that some householders have to travel close on four miles to get to the post office?

What I said was that, in my view, the post office was placed in what is the genuine rural community centre of the district.  In a rural district <Col N="1036" /> there is no area which is literally perfect for a post office.  There are always pros and cons with regard to choice, particularly with regard to a rural area.

      <P>The post of principal conductor was not advertised.  Mr. Milan Horvat was appointed as principal conductor on the recommendation of the musical director and other officials who reviewed the work of the various conductors who had conducted the Radio Éireann Orchestra.  It will be understood that some of these conductors could not be considered as they were no longer available.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question on 25th June, 1953, for the other information which he requires regarding the principal conductor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The post of assistant conductor was advertised in the daily newspapers of Saturday, May 2nd, 1953, and announcements concerning the vacancy were made from Radio Éireann during the following fortnight.  Following a comparison of the experience and qualifications of the 12 applicants for the post seven of them were called for interview and conducting test by a selection board which consisted of the Director of Broadcasting, the music director, the new principal conductor, Mr. Milan Horvat, and Arthur Gruber, a distinguished German conductor who has frequently been guest conductor here.  On the unanimous recommendation of the selection board, Mr. Eimear Ó Broin has been appointed assistant conductor for a trial period as from August 25th, 1953.  He will be paid at the rate of £70 per month and his other conditions of service will be those generally applicable to unestablished civil servants.  Mr. Ó Broin secured his Bachelor of Music degree at U.C.D. in 1950 and subsequently studied at the Paris Conservatoire under the direction of Mr. Eugene Bigot.  By the unanimous decision of a jury of nine well-known conductors <Col N="1038" /> he was awarded 1st prize and 1st place in the final examinations in orchestral conducting there in 1952. Later, he studied the technique of conducting opera and ballet at the Munich State Opera.  In a competition for a research fellowship in the music section of Harvard University he was placed 2nd among the 14 successful competitors and was invited to attend a conducting session held under the auspices of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  Before his appointment as assistant conductor he had already conducted the Radio Éireann Symphony Orchestra, had also conducted orchestras in Switzerland in concerts of contemporary Irish music, and had contracted engagements to conduct concerts in Scandinavia in September and October next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the sum of £10 mentioned by the Deputy is that which will, from the 1st October next, be the annual rental for an exchange line payable by all business subscribers whether situated in urban or rural areas.  This figure is the minimum average contribution which, having regard to the greatly increased wages and materials costs to which I have referred elsewhere, is required of the subscriber towards the Department's annual outlay comprising interest, depreciation and maintenance charges on such lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take a considerable time to give an analysis of the telephone finances, but perhaps I <Col N="1039" /> can give the Deputy some idea of the cost of providing services in rural areas.  The construction of one mile of whole route costs roughly £170 on which it may be taken the annual charges, depreciation, interest and maintenance, etc., are about £17. This figure of £10 does not include the cost of actually making calls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Calculations made by my Department indicate that, in such a case, where the pig is bred by the feeder, there should be a margin of profit.  It would, of course, be very unusual to feed a pig entirely on purchased rations; the more normal and more profitable practice would be to produce on the farm a good proportion of the feeding stuffs required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>Litter recording of pigs is being carried out by over 80 per cent. of pedigree pig breeders in the country under a scheme introduced by my Department a few years ago.  The object of the scheme is to identify strains of high productivity, good maternal qualities and rapid growth rate to weaning stage.

      <P>I entirely agree with the Minister in failing to understand how there can be the impression that nothing is being done.  Perhaps the Minister's attention has been drawn <Col N="1041" /> to articles in the agricultural Press implying that this country compares unfavourably with Denmark and certain Scandinavian countries in that no litter testing is going on in this country, and, in view of this, would the Minister consider instructing the officers in his Department, in appropriate cases, where publicity is given to that misapprehension, to have a suitable communication addressed to them, pointing out that the work being done under our Department of Agriculture compares very favourably with what is done in Denmark or any other Scandinavian country?</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative. As the Deputy is aware the lorry service provided by the Dairy Disposals Company Limited to test the volume of milk supplies in the Cromane and Caragh Lake districts is of an experimental nature and, in fact, has only recently been extended to the Caragh Lake district.  If, after reasonable experience, the company finds that the present arrangements are not calculated to test effectively the milk supply in these areas they will, no doubt, make any necessary and feasible adjustments.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>A complete return on the lines indicated by the Deputy could not be given without an elaborate survey, requiring an unwarrantable expenditure of staff time.  A cursory examination of the matter <Col N="1043" /> shows, however, that there have been many cases throughout the country where the cost of reclamation, including intensive drainage and the provision of lime and phosphates, exceeded £70 an acre.  Such cases have, in fact, occurred in Counties Cavan, Cork, Donegal, Limerick, Louth, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Westmeath and Wexford.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach did not say there were any cases in which the land reclaimed was of a character that rendered it certain that, within a few years, it would be growing rushes again.  It is not possible to say with certainty whether or not rushes will recur since this depends largely on the methods of husbandry subsequently employed by the farmer. There are, however, cases where the land drained is low-lying and not subsequently cultivated and where rushes will, to some extent, persist.</P>

Surely the Minister and Eggsports know how much they are losing in the exports of cockerels and turkeys?  They cannot be running a business on the basis that nobody knows whether they are losing or gaining. Surely the Minister should let us know whether they are incurring heavy losses.

      <P>The trouble about the scheme is that it is not ready for execution. As the Deputy is, I am sure, aware a scheme was submitted to the Fisheries Branch by the Cork County Council last September.  That scheme was not adequate to the requirements of the fishing industry in Schull as visualised by the Fisheries Branch and a consultation was arranged between the county council officials, officials of the Board of Works and an officer of the Fisheries Branch and it was agreed by them there and then that the scheme was not sufficient.  A search is being made by the officials concerned for a suitable alternative site.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that, recognising the cost will run into something in the region of six figures, a great deal of care will have to be taken in the preparation of the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no harm to restate the position. There are two divisions, as it were, under which appeals were discussed on the Committee State.  The first is whether the person is or is not entitled to treatment.  That would arise, of course, principally on the grounds of means.  Secondly, there is the point as to whether, having qualified for treatment, the patient gets the treatment necessary for his particular ailment. With regard to treatment, there is power to investigate any complaint of negligence or neglect. Deputies will realise that the Minister cannot, of course, direct any particular treatment or interfere with medical staffs; whether it is the family doctor in the case of the lower income groups or hospitals staffs, he cannot interfere with the treatment recommended.  He can only intervene where there is negligence on the part of any particular officer.  The Deputy mentioned that the patient might feel that a particular treatment, because expensive, was withheld from him. There is plenty of power to cover that. The Minister has power under Section 83 of the Local Government Act, 1941, in relation to complaints of that kind.  Furthermore, he has power as Deputies are aware of dealing rather drastically by way of suspension with any officer who may be negligent in his duty or, after public inquiry, by way of dismissal if necessary.  I think Deputies need not have any anxiety at all as to the treatment that will be given.  There is ample power to deal with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say, as regards the fear that local authorities could not sanction expensive treatment, that the complaints I get from the voluntary hospitals very often are that they cannot <Col N="1053" /> afford to give the treatment which the local authority hospitals are giving, so that they anyway look on the local authority service as being very full in that respect.</P>
    <P>On the grounds of means, after the discussion here I came to the conclusion that we should have an appeal in certain cases, that is in the case of a certain category of people who might qualify for hospital and specialist treatment and whose family income was less than £600.  As I have pointed out, there could be no dispute as to whether a man was insured or not, or as to whether a farmer had land the valuation of which was £50.  The only dispute that could arise, possibly, is in the category of family incomes of £600.</P>
    <P>I am in this amendment providing an appeal in that case.  As I explained before, I also came to the conclusion that it is better to have one appeals officer because that will gradually tend to uniformity in all the counties in the interpretation of any problems that may be put to him. Even if it were to be left to the courts &mdash;leaving aside any other arguments that may be made against that&mdash;you would be likely to have one district justice perhaps being more lenient than another.  Therefore, you would have uneven administration as far as this was concerned.  As I say, I think that an officer appointed by the Minister is the better plan, and I move the amendment than an officer be appointed by the Minister.  The procedure, and so on, will be laid down by regulations.  As I have mentioned already, the regulations will follow very closely those that are already in operation for appeals under the Social Welfare Act.</P>

On the Committee Stage, the amendment would have the effect that a woman in the higher income group who desired to take advantage of the maternity scheme would be eligible by paying £1 per year.  That is how the Bill stood. The amendment submitted on the Committee Stage altered that somewhat by saying that after three years a survey would be undertaken, an estimate would be made of what the service was costing and a contribution would then be fixed for the woman coming into the scheme.  From that date it would aim at collecting about 50 per cent. of the cost from those participating in the scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputies had the fear that a Minister who was anxious to sabotage this scheme would be able to add to the cost and make it altogether unworkable&mdash;that is to add to the administration costs which would be rather vague. Although I pointed out that there was no intention of doing anything like that, I was pressed by every Party in the House to make more definite what the limit would be.  I am now submitting this amendment which leaves the machinery outlined on the Committee Stage but which puts a limit on the annual contribution of £2 a year. The contribution, therefore, will never exceed £2.  It may, although I do not think it is likely, on examination after three years, be reduced below the £1 that is already there.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, Section 16, to add the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> (5) Where a woman avails of services under this section for a confinement taking place otherwise than in a hospital or maternity home, the health authority shall make available, without charge, obstetrical requisites to such extent as may be specified by regulations.</P>
    <P>There is a desire, I think, amongst all Parties that we should encourage, as far as we can, domiciliary treatment for maternity because, if we were to make it more attractive for women to go into hospitals to have their babies, the hospitals would be overcrowded.  It is not easy to do that in any very positive way, but it did strike me on reading through this clause that it was more attractive for women to go into hospital than stay at home, because, although it would be true that a woman staying at home to have her baby would have free medical and midwifery services, she would have to pay if in the middle income group, but not in the lower income group, for medicines and for surgical dressings.  If she went into hospital, of course, she would get these free.  This amendment is put down in order to make it possible for the local authority to see that she gets her obstetrical requisites, which will be medicines and surgical dressings, etc., free of cost.</P>
    <P>That, of course, will have to be done by regulation because there are many things to be considered.  Take an extreme case.  We certainly will not supply a perambulator or a cot.  We will definitely supply any medicine, probably, that may be necessary at the time of childbirth.  We would, I am sure, supply certain dressings, surgical and obstetrical dressings.  There will always be certain things that will require a great deal of consideration. The question, for instance, of an aesthetics comes up.  The question of expensive medicines will arise. As the medical Deputies are aware, very expensive drugs are used if there is any suspicion of sepsis or anything like that.  We have to consider all these things and we must have time to draw up the necessary regulations. The aim is to see that the woman who stays at home to have her baby will be <Col N="1057" /> as well treated financially as the woman who goes into hospital, and in that way we hope to try to prevent the hospitals being overcrowded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister is yet in a position to say what action he proposes to take as regards expensive medicines.  Has the Minister any clear idea yet as to what extent he will make available medicines in the ordinary case?  There are also the cases to be considered of women who go into private nursing homes.  I am anxious to know if the Minister has clarified his mind on the point of making expensive medicines available without the danger of abuses arising. In the case of patients going into private nursing homes the practice is that they are expected to bring in their own requisites.  Has the Minister any idea whether he would allow that practice to go on or whether the fee charged would include all requirements? If a woman did bring them in, what would the position be as regards recoupment?  Possibly these are points that have not occurred to the Minister up to the present.  I want to prevent abuses arising so that a private nursing home would not be in a position to call on a local authority for payment in regard to unlimited supplies of obstetrical requisites which possibly they could use for non-local authority patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are three cases that we should keep in mind. There is first the case of the woman not, I should say, in the lower income group, who stays at home or who goes into hospital and for whom everything is paid.  There was a certain difficulty with the middle income group because, if this amendment was not put in, there would be no power to pay for medicines in the case of a middle income group woman who stayed at home.  I take the middle income group woman because that is the case we will be up against. She either stays at home or she goes to a hospital as directed by the local authority or she goes to a hospital of her own choice.  If she goes to a hospital as directed by the local authority it will be either the local authority hospital or a general hospital and <Col N="1058" /> medicines will be free.  So, she will get everything free&mdash;medical service free, midwifery services free, and all medicines free.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to be able to say to that woman: &ldquo;If you stay at home, financially, you will be just as well off.  You will get medical treatment free, midwifery treatment free and all medicines, dressings, etc., free, the same as you would in hospital.&rdquo; I think it will not be very difficult to draft the regulations as far as that is concerned because we will try to keep it in line with what the general hospital is giving.</P>
      <P>The third case is the woman who chooses her own hospital.  She goes to, say, a maternity private home.  I have not decided yet in her case.  I am inclined to say that she gets her subvention from the local authority for whatever number of days she may be in the home and that is the end of it; she pays everything else herself because, if she goes to a private home, it is presumed that she will employ a doctor&mdash; in fact I think she has to if she goes to a private home&mdash;and she pays the doctor.  If she employs a special midwife or if she avails of the service of the midwife in the home she has to pay for that.  All that the local authority is responsible for is the subvention that they pay and she pays the rest. Whether we should take into consideration or not that we should give her some set amount or some vouched expenses or some proportion of vouched expenses is a matter for consideration but I would not like to leave the members of the Dáil under the impression that I am favourably disposed to that.  I am quite prepared to listen to a case for that but my present opinion is that it would be better just to give her the subvention and say: &ldquo;Everything else is your responsibility and the local authority is out of it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;... make available&mdash;certain services&mdash;either as may be specified by the regulations, without charge or at charges approved of or directed by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This clause deals with dental and opthalmic services for children.  It is intended, of course, generally speaking that they should be free. Anything that may arise as a result of school inspection will be free.  It is always intended that defects, as they are called, discovered at these inspections should be treated free of charge. I had to admit that, as drafted, the Minister could make charges and perhaps make them fairly substantial. The only thing that was ever intended was to be able to deal with gross carelessness. If a child got a pair of spectacles, for instance, and came back after a few weeks and said they were broken and she wanted another pair, it might be excused that time but, if she came back again after another few weeks, it is well that the local authority should have the power to say: &ldquo;You will have to pay for them this time because you are not taking proper care&rdquo;.  Now it is made perfectly plain by this amendment that that is the only way a charge can be made.</P>

      <P>Again, this particular sub-section was viewed with a certain amount of anxiety by Deputies.  They held that a Minister who was not too favourable to the extension of the health services might avail of this to curtail the services. On examination, I came to the conclusion that that is a possibility.  As a matter of fact, I think the Bill can carry on without that sub-section at all.

    <P>There is a peculiar situation here. People who choose their own hospital may possibly on the advice of their own family doctor go to a certain hospital.  It may then occur to them that the local authority, even though they had chosen their own hospital, should make a certain contribution and that they would be entitled to make application for that contribution.  That is what we set out to cover in this section. But my attention was drawn to the fact that as the section was drafted, the local authority would have the obligation of looking for the people who are entitled to this contribution. That would be an impossible task to put on any local authority.  This amendment is brought in to provide that the local authority will be obliged <Col N="1061" /> to contribute if the application is made.</P>

The fact that they go into the hospital first will not in any way vitiate the scheme.</P>

      <P>Deputies will remember that this section puts an obligation on a person to notify a local authority if his financial circumstances have changed.  A person's income might be under £600 but it might happen that the income of a son or daughter living with him would be increased or that his own income might be increased.  As the section stands, he would be bound to notify the local authority of that fact.  It was put to me on the Committee Stage that a man might get into serious trouble with the local authority if, perhaps, through negligence or ignorance he did not notify them.  That was not intended, of course.  We only want to deal with the man who tries to defraud the local authority and I think the insertion of the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; before &ldquo;contravenes&rdquo; will cover that, so that he will not be guilty of an offence unless he is knowingly guilty of it.</P>

      <P>Yes, at the request of Deputy MacBride.  It simply endeavours to give back to the public representatives the power of interpreting and carrying out the wishes of the people and taking from the county manager powers vested in him other than the normal powers which are now considered executive functions under the County Management Act with regard to the employment and dismissal of servants.  This is an endeavour to give back to public representatives as much of the powers as possible and, at the same time, provide that the powers given back will not be used to do things which are not desirable in connection with the employment and dismissal of officials and the making of certain regulations for payments. The local committee can, if it so desires, under this amendment transfer to the county manager certain powers but the principle of having the powers invested in them will be preserved.  I am afraid that the Minister will find that this is a radical change from the general policy of the Bill, but I am putting it to the House in order to comply with the wishes of the person who put it down. It is not an amendment of mine, and, naturally, I cannot put forward the same views as the person responsible for the amendment could put forward, but I put it to the House for what it is worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I think it is hardly appropriate that we should amend the County Management Act through the medium of this Bill.  As I stated before, a Bill will be introduced to amend the County Management Act and to take certain powers from the county manager and hand them back to the local authority.  That Bill is being prepared and will, I am sure, be introduced after the summer recess. I think I can say without any great fear of going too far that the Bill will go further in the way of taking powers from the county manager than was proposed in the Bill brought in by the Coalition Government but which was not put through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point, however, which I would resist very strongly and that is with regard to the function of the <Col N="1064" /> county manager in dealing with individual cases.  I think that a person who applies for some service and whose means have to be disclosed in order to get that service would be very much happier to have his case investigated by a single person, rather than by the council or a number of people, especially if the council or the other people will be meeting in public.  Even if they are not meeting in public, I think some people would not like their private affairs to be discussed and investigated by a number of persons.  Therefore, I think the particular point at issue is the decision in individual cases.  As far as I am concerned, I would be very strongly in favour of leaving it to a single person to decide and, as matters stand, that person must be the county manager.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, however, in the matter of appointments I do not mind very much if the Government bring a Bill before the Dáil handing back the making of appointments to the local authority or, in the case of other matters, such as adoption schemes or the making of contracts or any of these other matters, I do not mind very much whether these powers are taken from the county manager and handed back to the county council. But I think it would be very much better to have the matter postponed until the Bill amending the County Management Act comes before the Dáil, which I think will be immediately after the summer recess.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 20, Section 50, to insert the following sub-section before sub-section (3):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  In making available the service referred to in sub-section (1) of this section so far as that service relates to the making of arrangements <Col N="1065" /> with employers for placing disabled persons in suitable employment, a health authority shall consult with such trade unions (if any) as appear to the health authority to be representative of persons employed in the relevant employments.</P>
    <P>When we discussed this matter the point arose that trade unions should be consulted with regard to this question of rehabilitation.  I understood that the only point which the members of the Labour Party would be interested in is the placing of a person in employment.  I therefore directed my attention to covering that point. On the general question of rehabilitation, there will be, as I explained, a national committee appointed and there will also be at least one committee and probably more than one committee, under each local authority. These will not be statutory committees; they will only be advisory committees. I am quite sure that no Minister with any sense would set up a national committee without having trade union representatives on it.  As far as the general scheme is concerned, the trade unions will have their say in regard to these regulations.  With regard to the local committees, in all probability the local authorities will take the same view and have labour or trade union representatives on these committees.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, I thought the only point as to which trade unions would be very interested and likely to be very much concerned would be where a person had been treated and pronounced fit to take up employment, whether partial or full employment.  At that particular point, the trade unions would be concerned that a person should not be put in employment which would displace a worker who had been there for many years.  Deputy Larkin made the position very clear on that. He said that a disabled person might not be altogether so important as a man with a wife and family; that a very enthusiastic and philanthropic committee in placing such a person might forget the rights of the ordinary working man with a wife and family. That was quite understandable and <Col N="1066" /> quite a sensible view on the part of Deputy Larkin.  It is in order to cover that point that I bring in this amendment and I think it should cover it.</P>

    <P>There was a good lot of talk on this particular clause and many suggestions were made, but I must admit I did not get a very satisfactory solution. The point was that it was expected that a brother or sister would maintain the invalid person under certain circumstances.  Of course, it must be remembered that&mdash;the words are here &mdash;that where the relatives are unable to provide maintenance that does not apply.  But it might happen that the local authority would have to say to the person: Your brother or your sister is well able to maintain you but he or she will not do it.  It was pointed out on the Committee Stage that the invalid might have a brother in America doing well but not taking any interest in the invalid at home. For that reason, I have now submitted an amendment which says it will only apply to the brother or sister where they are normally resident with that person.  I think that would be understandable. If you have a father, say, and mother and two brothers and sisters in a home and two of the brothers are working as well as the father, and the sister is an invalid to be maintained by them&mdash;in a case like that there is no difficulty about maintaining the invalid sister and nobody complains about it.  We want to be careful that in a case like that we do not remove that kind of family feeling that they should look after the invalid if they can do it.  At the same time we want to provide for the case where they are unable to do it.  It is difficult to word a clause so as to carry out our intention.  It is almost impossible, and I am afraid I may have leaned in the direction of letting the brother or sister out, but it is better to err on that side than the other. However, by this amendment, we can see that the invalid is looked after and if in certain cases a brother or sister who might be able to maintain an invalid get away&mdash;well, I suppose we cannot help it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, Section 54, to delete lines 33 to 45 and substitute &ldquo;home or similar institution who behaves in a disorderly manner in such home or institution, or causes unreasonable disturbance to other persons maintained in such home or institution or to persons employed therein&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This sub-section (5) of Section 54 deals with disorderly people who might come into a county home, and we had some discussion on it, and we had a division on this matter in the Dáil during the Committee Stage.  As I pointed out, there was no intention of aiming at the old people.  Some rather far-fetched examples were given.  It was said, for instance, an old person might refuse to take his dinner and might be held to have disobeyed a regulation and might be liable on conviction to a week or two weeks in jail.  The people we want to get are the casuals who come in and make trouble.  As the amendment is drafted, I think that is now clear.  The person who behaves in a disorderly manner in such home or institution or causes unreasonable disturbance to other persons maintained in such home or institution or to such persons employed therein&mdash;I think that covers everything, &ldquo;if a person behaves in a disorderly manner or causes unreasonable disturbance&rdquo;.  There is a slight difference.  I might be asked why I put in the second one.  A man might come in in a merry mood and start singing to the great discomfort of others and he is not disorderly.  Still, he is causing great disturbance to people who want to go asleep.  I think we have covered anything we want to cover by saying a person who behaves in a disorderly manner or creates disturbance.</P>

      <P>As far as this amendment is concerned, the important point is that we still find in the section &ldquo;shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 21 days&rdquo;.  Although this rose may have changed its name, I am afraid that it smells very much <Col N="1069" /> the same.  Surely this is still sectional legislation, legislation in respect of an institution under the jurisdiction of the community, the Dáil, the Government, and the people which has been singled out for the creation of specific crimes which are not related to the inmates of our other institutions.  We have county hospitals, county and regional sanatoria and various other hospitals, regional hospitals and we have all the inmates of those institutions and all the inmates of the general hospitals and the voluntary hospitals ; we have all sorts of other groups of human beings outside the health service, clubs, public-houses, cinemas, and 100 other things, but in none of them, so far as I am aware at any rate, is it found necessary to create this new situation or rather to perpetuate an old situation, yet a penal workhouse atmosphere has apparently to be maintained in respect of what we euphemistically call our county homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am one of those people who most fervently believe in the idea that whatever private people or private or-ganisations or institutions may do, the Oireachtas in a democracy should legislate equally for its people, whether in respect to health legislation, social amenities or any aspect of its activities and similarly in regard to education&mdash;right through the whole gamut of our life.  I personally do not think that we should legislate for any retention of the old privileges upon which the essence of this amendment is based.  An aged person can find himself locked up for 21 days because he spends 5/- or 10/- or the few dollars remittance that he may get from a son or daughter who has gone away, if he happens to get slightly excited and causes what is called an unreasonable disturbance to other persons maintained in such home or institution. Much as I appreciate the Minister's apparent intention to meet the wishes of many of us here, I believe that in essence this amendment retains the atmosphere of sectional legislation which I feel it is our duty to leave behind us.  One of the reasons, surely, why we had our revolution was in <Col N="1070" /> order to break with many of the old traditions.  I believe that this provision is in the worst of the old bad traditions.  I think it is unworthy of the House to retain it.  So far as I am concerned I am still opposed to it on general principles.</P>
    <P>In the past I have, against all opposition, and I hope I shall continue that attitude in the future, opposed the suggestion that there should be any differentiation concerning the treatment meted out to any section of our community in relation to health legislation. I feel equally strongly in relation to our social legislation concerning the aged, as I do about children, education, etc.  Consequently, I feel that the House should reject this section and this amendment.  I feel that it is, as I say, in the old bad tradition, in getting rid of which there is no doubt the Minister has done more than one man's part over the years.  He must be congratulated for the very formidable contribution he has made over the years towards ridding us of a suggestion such as this.</P>
    <P>I would ask the House to appreciate that there is a very serious principle involved here, the principle of legislating in an objectionable way against a section of our community whether they be casuals, vagrants as they were called, or the aged class.  It is quite obvious that &ldquo;the county home or similar institution&rdquo; is the one institution chosen by the Minister amongst all the institutions of local authorities in the country for this special treatment. I consider that the fact that specific legislation should be enacted in respect of these institutions is a retrograde and undesirable step.  So far as I am concerned it is a suggestion which conflicts with what I consider to be a point of principle&mdash;that all persons shall be equal before the law and that in the Oireachtas, as far as we possibly can, we should legislate towards treating all our people equally.  I am still opposed to this section.</P>

      <P>I with Deputy Dr. Browne regret very much that the Minister has not taken advantage of this stage to remove this section.  The Labour Party, Deputy Dr. Browne and those who voted with us on the <Col N="1071" /> previous stage showed clearly that this was a question of principle with us.  The Minister has unfortunately placed Deputies like members of the Labour Party and Deputy Dr. Browne in a very awkward position.  If this amendment does not go through the old section, which is more abominable in our opinion than the amended form, will be retained.  The only alternative left open to us then is to vote against the Bill, a Bill which we think we should support, because it is an improvement on the position as it existed heretofore.  I am quite sure that Deputy Dr. Browne and the members of the Labour Party do not desire to be put in that position.  We urge on the Minister to change his attitude in regard to this section and to this amendment.  Surely it is not necessary &mdash;the Minister does not suggest it is necessary&mdash;that a person should go into the district hospital under the cloud of this particular section.  If it is not necessary for a person to go into the district hospital under such a cloud, why should it be necessary to go into the county home under that cloud?  The one reason apparently is that you can immediately indicate to the type of people likely to go into the county home that a special law is necessary to deal with them.  You immediately brand the county home and all connected with it by the fact that a special law is required to deal with the inmates.  In the case of a hotel or a boarding house no special law is necessary to deal with a person who is disorderly there ; there is no law saying that if you are disorderly or abusive to the people or employees on that premises you are liable to be put in jail for 21 days.  We know the present law prevents people being disorderly but there is no special Act of Parliament making it a crime in relation to a particular place and a particular class of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection the Labour Party has to this section is that the law here applies only to a particular section of our people.  Deputy Dr. Browne has objected to this principle.  Is the ordinary law not enough?  People have <Col N="1072" /> been entering our county homes for years past.  The ordinary police force has always been able to deal with them.  The Army has never had to be called out.  For the past five or six years I have been a visitor to a county home.  I am a member of the board. I am chairman of the board.  I can see no reason why the existing law is not sufficient.  Is it that the official in the Department has his mind so fixed that he wants to bring us back again to the old days in which the people entering these institutions had branded on their backs their particular destination?  We must get away from that mentality.  I will fight against that mentality every time it lifts its ugly head.  I abhor this class distinction.  If people do wrong they will do wrong anywhere.  These people go to Church.  They go to Mass. Is there a special law to cover their behaviour?</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kyne says he opposes this clause as a member of the Labour Party.  As a socialist I cannot find the same grounds for objection.  One must have rules and regulations.  An ordered society is the whole basis and philosophy of socialism. I think the Minister should receive the congratulations of the House for the step he has taken at the request of the House as a result of the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1073" /> When this Bill came before us it included a clause providing punishment for a whole series of offences.  They were set out in sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the relevant section. Undoubtedly that section was objectionable. The Minister appreciated the objections raised and decided to bring in an amendment.  As originally drafted, there was a clause dealing with insubordination in relation to an officer of the home or institution.  We objected to that and the Minister deleted it.  It included a number of other matters dealing with intoxicating liquor, the inability of an inmate to conduct himself and so on.  The Minister responded to the wishes of the House.  All that is left now, after the removal of these objectionable clauses, is the simple clause that a person who is maintained in a county home or similar institution who behaves in a disorderly manner or causes unreasonable disturbance to other persons maintained in such home or institution or to persons therein shall be guilty of an offence.  My whole life has been devoted to sympathy and effort on behalf of unfortunate people.  I do not see anything in that section to which exception can be taken.  We have special rules and regulations governing our behaviour in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The section provides the greatest safeguards anyone could ask for.  It does not say that a disorderly person will be dealt with by the authorities in the institution or by an official of the local authority.  It says that if that offence is proved against him in the courts before a district justice he can be penalised to a maximum of 21 days' imprisonment in relation to the seriousness of his offence.</P>
    <P>We should be realistic in a matter such as this.  We have provided the safeguard that the offence can only be held to be an offence when it is established beyond reasonable doubt before a district justice sitting in a court of summary jurisdiction.</P>

He will be brought into the District Court and the charge must be proved against him there before the district justice.  The evidence against him will be given in open court.</P>
      <P>I have sufficient confidence in our district justices to know that they will deal with the case fairly and justly. They are not going to give a man 21 days' imprisonment, or one day's imprisonment, if there is a reasonable explanation, even though he did break the law.  Does not everyone know that in our District Courts our district justices, day after day, are dealing with the people who come before them in the most generous and sympathetic way?  Will anyone dare to say that our district justices are harsh in any respect?  They are not.  They only send the ruffian and the blackguard to jail.</P>

      <P>Justice under our Constitution is administered by the justices in our District Courts.  The <Col N="1075" /> great protection that I see in the section for the man alleged to be guilty of an offence is that the evidence to support it has to be established in open court before a district justice administering the laws of this State.</P>
      <P>I think that we ought to be fair to the Minister when he makes such a substantial amendment at the request of the House.  We ought to accept it. I can appreciate the point of view that says it would be harsh to send a man to prison.  Of course it would, but if he has been guilty of an offence, and if the district justice should send him to prison, I do not think anyone can complain.  We must maintain, and we do maintain, discipline in the Garda Síochána Force by our special laws and regulations.  One of the objections to what happens in the case of the Gardaí is that the law is administered by their own officers and not in the District Court.  The same thing applies in the case of the Army where we have summary punishments imposed by commanding officers.  I would prefer to see some of those cases dealt with in open court by a district justice.  I think that we have achieved a great deal in this section, and that we should pay generous tribute to the Minister and thank him sincerely for the amendment which he has brought in.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be unfair to the Minister or to anybody else.  I am not going to follow the line of argument adopted by Deputy Cowan, but I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne that there is a principle involved in this.  I think that, if anything, Deputy Cowan's speech was in favour of what Deputy Dr. Browne is asking to be done.  Are we to be told that the man who goes into a county home is different from the man who goes into any other hospital?  We all know that from time to time incidents take place even in the voluntary hospitals, due to the fact that someone comes in who may be under the influence of drink, and makes himself obnoxious.  If he persists in being disorderly, he is dealt with in the usual way.  What I object to is that we are putting a matter of this kind into our Health Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> We know that a certain amount of prejudice exists at the present time against our district hospitals and county homes.  That is because of the tradition that is associated with them. Let us not perpetuate that by putting a section like this into a Health Bill. If an inmate does become insubordinate or disorderly is the law not there to deal with him?  Would there be anything wrong in the hospital or county home authority sending for a Guard to deal with a disorderly person of that kind?  I do not think, however, that we should put that into a Health Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider the matter and cut out this provision.  He should be able to find some other way of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am not as good a socialist as Deputy Cowan pretends to be.  I do not want to speak on this matter from that angle at all, because I think it is only nonsense to bring in such a point in the debate.  For a long time past we have been trying to lift up and improve the atmosphere of our county homes.  A section like this is not going to help in that direction.  If patients in hospitals go out in public and take one or two drinks, then come back and become disorderly, there are ways under the law of dealing with them. There is no reason why the same thing should not apply in our county homes. I agree with Deputy Dr. Browne that this is something which should not be put into a Health Bill, and I hope the Minister will reconsider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In our approach to this matter we must remember that the county homes are places of last resort for some people who find themselves in distress through not being able to obtain shelter elsewhere.  If they seek accommodation in the county home, normally they are treated as ordinary citizens should be in such circumstances.  If they go to other places and are in a state that makes them objectionable to other people, they can be refused admission. In the case of the county home, they cannot be refused admission.  They must get admission for their own protection, if for no other reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> It is often necessary to get them in there off the public streets.  If, when they are admitted, they act in a manner that may cause distress to people who are ill in the institution they can only be dealt with in one or two ways.  Regulations are operated by institutions to deal with people who behave in an unruly way or they are dealt with according to the ordinary law.  In this case, a maximum penalty of 21 days' imprisonment is provided in certain circumstances for those who misbehave themselves.  Perhaps that might be reconsidered.  I am simply making that suggestion.  That, however, does not perhaps alter the principle underlying the arguments of Deputy Dr. Browne and the Labour members.  The whole point, however, is that the local authorities must have sufficient control to see that proper behaviour is observed by those who are admitted to the county homes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate fully the question of principle raised by Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy Kyne and Deputy Hickey.  I agree with their viewpoint in that respect.  Possibly the Minister could tell us what his real difficulty is.  Normally, in the case of a person who behaves in a disorderly fashion or causes undue annoyance to a person in that person's private house or to an innkeeper, he becomes a trespasser and can be dealt with as a trespasser under the ordinary law.  Is the Minister's difficulty that he is bound to receive and accommodate persons who seek shelter in county homes and that he has no power to <Col N="1078" /> eject them?  Normally the ordinary remedy that the hotel-keeper or publican adopts is to throw the fellow out. If a fellow is disorderly or drunk on the premises he puts him out.  If he cannot put him out himself he calls in a Guard who will put him out, or who may charge him with trespass or with committing a breach of the peace or of conduct calculated to lead to a breach of the peace.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister's difficulty in this case that he cannot do that in regard to the inmates of county homes by reason of the fact that he is by statute bound to receive them and keep them? If that is his difficulty could he get over it in this way?  Could he, instead of this section, which does in principle seem to establish a different class of people, put in a very short section providing that a person who is guilty of a breach of the peace or of conduct calculated to cause a breach of the peace may, notwithstanding anything else contained in the Act, be dealt with as a person guilty of the same conduct in a private house, hotel or elsewhere, can be dealt with, so that you will have the same law for them all?  That is, if that is the Minister's difficulty.</P>
      <P>Under the ordinary law, if it is not for the impediment that is contained in the Bill itself which compels the local authority to receive and keep persons in the county home, the Minister has all the powers he wants of dealing with them in the same way as anyone who comes into a house and starts assaulting somebody and breaking it up and remains until he is asked to get out can be dealt with.  That person is guilty of an offence against the ordinary law.  He becomes a trespasser and can be charged as a trespasser or as a person guilty of conduct calculated to lead to a breach of the peace.  It would not be very difficult to find some formula that would place the county homes in the same position as the occupier of any private house or hotel or club.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to the discussion on this particular amendment.  It strikes me that most of the Deputies who have contributed to the discussion have little experience <Col N="1079" /> of the running of a county home.  I am surprised at Deputy Kyne's attitude to it.  I take it that in County Waterford they have their quota of undesirables just as there is in every other district. I can sympathise with Deputy Dr. Browne's outlook on this matter.  I know from experience that for his short time in charge of these institutions, as Minister for Health, he brought about very considerable improvements. I feel that is due to be said for Deputy Dr. Browne.  I take a personal interest in the administration of these institutions.  I visit them occasionally.  Even if it is only directed towards the 1 per cent. of undesirables who avail occasionally of the shelter of these institutions, the Minister would be well advised to retain that section.  This is not directed towards the ordinary inmates of county homes, not by any means.  What I want the Minister to guard against is the type of bully who comes the way and of whom anyone associated with these institutions is well aware.  These are the people who should be kept in check.  For that reason I support the Minister in retaining this particular section in order to have that deterrent in respect of those people who visit the institutions.</P>

These are the people in whom I am interested, not the 1 per cent. who pass the way.  I am aware of the ordinary common law.

I think there definitely is inasmuch as a person who is in need of accommodation and cannot find it elsewhere has a statutory right to admission to a county home and to be maintained there.  Because of that he is not in the same position as a person who can be put out of an hotel if he is disorderly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>He must conduct himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  But if he misconducts himself in any of the other places he may be turned out, as Deputy MacBride pointed out, and there is no more about it.  If a person misconducts himself in an hotel, boarding-house or other place of that kind he may be forcibly removed.  But an inmate of a county home has a statutory right to remain there, and as he has that right he is in a different position from the many other types of persons who have been mentioned and because of that there is need for a special provision in this Bill.  That is the kernel of the matter.  If an inmate of a county home was in exactly the same position as a patient in a <Col N="1081" /> voluntary hospital or any other hospital, he could be dealt with in exactly the same way as a patient in a hospital. But because he has a special statutory right which these other people have not, it is necessary to make a special provision for him.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacBride suggested that there was an easy solution to the problem.  I do not think that there is. I am sure that the Minister must have turned this question over in various ways, and if the solution which Deputy MacBride suggests was adopted it might possibly carry with it an injustice to the inmates of county homes, inasmuch as on the pretence of that provision which Deputy MacBride suggests should be incorporated in the Bill that inmate could be turned out on the street at any time and he would lose, so to speak, his security of tenure in the county home.</P>
      <P>I think it is recognised by the House that we are dealing with a difficult situation and a very special type of case and for that reason a special provision is needed.  If the person who seeks admission to a county home had not the special rights which are guaranteed to him because of his destitution there would be no need for this special legislation.  But because he does possess these rights and because he cannot be refused admission or cannot be turned out on the streets it is necessary to have some means of ensuring that he will not do injury to the institution or to the other persons in the institution.</P>
      <P>We are all hoping that we will see the day when county homes will be an entirely different type of institutions and be confined solely to the aged and infirm, and when able-bodied persons who are destitute will be provided with accommodation in some other place. But until that reform is put into operation some means must be adopted to protect the aged and infirm inmates from able-bodied people who misbehave themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point, of course, is that a county home must admit anybody who is destitute and cannot get shelter elsewhere.  As the law stands now and until certain parts of the <Col N="1082" /> present legislation are repealed by this Bill, this applies to every institution under a local authority.  It is only being renewed for county homes because county homes must admit anybody who comes along and who is not able to get shelter elsewhere.  In that way, of course, a county home is different from a hospital, because a hospital need only admit sick persons, and it is also very different from an hotel or a boarding-house.  I do not know what the law is with regard to hotels, but I believe there is a certain obligation on hotels to admit persons.</P>
      <P>We all know, however, that the proprietor of an hotel or boarding-house can make the excuse for refusing to admit any person that there is no accommodation available.  If a person is admitted and does not conduct himself he can be thrown out.  The county home is therefore different from any other institution under a local authority or any institution under private management.</P>
      <P>Then there are casuals coming along. I do not want to be taken as saying that all these casuals are blackguards. A lot of them are unfortunate people. Some of them are quiet people and easy to manage.  Sometimes, however, there may be a few who will be inclined to make trouble and we have, therefore, to keep them in mind.  As long as casuals are admitted to such an institution we will have that problem. In Dublin they are making provision for putting casuals in a different institution from the county home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the proper solution, it is the solution which I am anxious for local authorities to adopt.  It may be difficult for them to adopt it, because the number of casuals which they have to deal with is not very large and it may be a very expensive business to achieve that fairly small object.  In the bigger centres like Dublin that will be adopted and then the county home will be in a very different position and this section will not be required at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, of course, this trouble also. Deputy MacBride raised the question of the ordinary law and the power of <Col N="1083" /> the Guards.  The Guards will not come into a county home.  I do not want to put anybody in the wrong.  I admit that if this power were not there it might be different.  But at present the Guards will not come into the county home because they say this is a domestic affair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Guards say it is not their business; they say it is a domestic matter.  Anyway, we appear to approach this in different ways.  It is all very fine for Deputy Kyne to say that the officials of the Department of Health are trying to bring back the old workhouse idea.  The officials of the Department of Health have just as much regard for people in county homes as Deputy Kyne has.  It was because of regard for them that this clause was put in as we want to protect the old people.  I have as much regard for people in county homes as Deputy Kyne and I say they must be protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all very fine for Deputy Hickey to get up in his usual way and oppose this.  But, has Deputy Hickey any regard for the old people in the county homes?  Does he say that they must be left at the mercy of anyone who makes noise and says: &ldquo;You can sleep to-morrow after I go out&rdquo;?  Is that <Col N="1084" /> the sort of regard he has?  Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Kyne I know approach this in a very humanitarian way and I give them credit for that. But will they give me credit also?  We are not drafting a Bill to go back to the old workhouse idea; we are drafting a Bill to protect the old people. I had the old people's interest in mind when I put in this clause and for their sake I want the clause to remain.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne or anybody else should not think that I am blaming all the casuals.  There is just a comparatively small proportion of rowdies amongst the people who go into county homes, just as you will have them amongst those going into publichouses or race meetings or theatres or anywhere else.  The whole thing is that that small proportion are going amongst people who are unable to take care of themselves.  The people at race meetings and the people in publichouses are able to take care of themselves.</P>

      <P>That may be, but we need not legislate for them.  It may be that we have a different way of approaching this, but I want Deputies to look at this from the humanitarian point of view that old people should be protected. Others, I am quite sure, as well as Deputy Kyne want to see the old people protected, but they are looking at it from a different point of view, that by putting that in we are promoting what might be regarded as class legislation.  It is not class legislation. It is a different position from any other, because the county homes, unlike any other places, are bound to take in anybody that comes along.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In pages 22 and 23, Section 54, to delete paragraph (a) of subsection (7) and substitute the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Where a person maintained by a health authority in a county home or similar institution does work on behalf of the authority, he shall be deemed, in relation to the doing of the work, to be for the purposes of the Workmen's Compensation Acts, 1934 and 1948, a workman in the employment of the authority, but, save as aforesaid, the doing of the work by such person shall not operate to create or imply the relation of master and servant or a contract of service between the authority and such person.</P>
      <P>On this section on the Committee Stage, there was a clause which gave power to the local authority to make a person work.  That was taken out but a person can work voluntarily.  I was doubtful whether it was necessary to have the Workmen's Compensation Act applied or not where a person offered services voluntarily.  I believe it is, and therefore this amendment is put in to cover cases of voluntary employment.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 24, Section 56, line 19 and line 25, to delete &ldquo;at their discretion&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was some discussion on the Committee Stage&mdash;in fact I think there was an amendment put down by Deputy Dr. Browne&mdash;that if a child is taken from the foster-parents without their consent, there should be an appeal. That was withdrawn on my undertaking to look into the matter.  I think &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; is better than an appeal to the courts, because the inspectors of the Department have a good knowledge in nearly all cases of the children and the homes they are in, and where they have not. <Col N="1087" /> they can pay a visit and investigate on the spot and then give advice to the Minister whether the proposal of the local authority should be accepted or not.</P>
    <P>Deputies will realise that there are nursed-out as well as boarded-out children.  Nursed-out children are usually sent out by religious societies and guilds of various kinds and the local authority is not responsible except for certain things like registration of homes and so.  But boarded-out children are entirely the charge of the local authority.  I would like to give some figures in this connection.  A sample eight counties were taken some years back and there were 19 children removed from 18 homes in that year.</P>
    <P>These counties that were taken would form about one-fifth of the country.  Eight children were removed at the request of the foster-parents. Naturally there would be no appeal there.  In two other cases, the children were claimed back by their own parents and there could be no opposition there, because the parents have prior right.  In five cases, the foster-parents with which the local authorities had contracted died and there was no alternative but to remove them.  The remaining four children were removed from the homes for reasons stated by the local authorities; so that there were only four cases really in 1952 where a question of appeal to the courts could possibly arise.</P>
    <P>In these four cases, there possibly would have been an appeal, but at least two of them were very well known to the inspectors of the Department and they would have been able to give advice straight away.  In the other two cases, inspections could take place and advice be given to the Minister, so that I think this amendment would cover the case better than an appeal to the courts.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that some of the points made by the speakers on the Opposition side are well taken and they are entitled to ask the questions that were asked by them. The first point was made by Deputy Sweetman when he inquired as to why it was not the Minister for Agriculture who was responsible for this particular scheme and for introducing the Bill that is now an Act which enabled the scheme to be undertaken.  I do not think it matters ultimately what Minister is nominally responsible for the Grass Meal Act as long as we can be assured that there is a good board of directors in charge of it and they will be able to employ competent technicians and efficient machinery and that they are imbued with the proper spirit and the proper approach to the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>You can take it that the Department of Agriculture is at the disposal of the directors of this company. As well as that I want to refer at this stage to the reference that was made by Deputy Collins to the membership of the board in which he said that only one member of it could be presumed to have some technical skill and that that was a member of the board who is the county engineer for Mayo.  I want to say that is quite wrong because there is a member of the board, Mr. Gahan, who is an acknowledged agricultural expert and is attached to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, and I am informed that his merit is well recognised by that very progressive company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be in any way uncharitable to that person. When I referred to technical skill I was not aware of his merit at that time, and I did not actually know that he is a consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the other members of the board are concerned I do not mind saying of them that I never met one of them until he was appointed, and I met another once, but I am absolutely convinced of their enthusiasm and their capacity for making a success of the work that they have taken in hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman inquired whether any examination had been made in advance of the protein content of the grass that it is hoped to have produced on this reclaimed bog.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out in the course of the passage of the Bill, on its Second Stage, it is impossible to tell what the protein content of any grass is until it is grown, but I believe that having regard to grass grown in similar circumstances in which it is proposed to grow the grass on the bog at Bangor-Erris that the protein content is very high; and having seen the grass grown under similar circumstances on Gowla Bog, where the Sugar Company are carrying out work of a similar nature, I can say for myself <Col N="1090" /> with my own limited knowledge that I never saw grass growing in such profusion or looking so green. Whether that is any indication or not of the value of growing grass on reclaimed bog I do not know, but to my untrained eye it was a good omen.</P>
    <P>The point was made that this scheme should be undertaken not only in Mayo, but in such places as West Cork and in Donegal.  First of all, I think everybody appreciates that this is purely an experimental scheme, and on its success will depend what further development of a similar nature will take place in other parts of the country.  The primary object is to make a success of the experiment, and to demonstrate the commercial possibilities of successful cultivation of bogland.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins made another point which I thought was worth while looking after and which, I think, I can meet not only in theory but on practical results achieved at Gowla.  First of all he accused me of what he described as precocious provocativeness, whatever he intended to convey. Whether I was guilty of what he thinks I was I do not know, but in any case to meet the point he makes&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Collins Mr. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is your delightful tantalising innocence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>To meet the point he makes as regards the desirability of commencing operations in September, as I indicated they probably would be commenced then, the Deputy knows and the House knows that at Gowla, where the Sugar Company took over something like 2,500 acres of bogland&mdash; the wettest bogland in Ireland I believe &mdash;in 1951, they commenced to drain 1,500 acres of it.  They segregated it into two parts and on the first part they started drainage in August, 1951, and on the second part in September, 1951.  To say that the results they achieved were successful, in my opinion, would be an understatement. I saw the place myself and I can truthfully describe what I saw as not only successful but inspiring.  Therefore, having regard to the calibre of the men who form the board, having regard to <Col N="1091" /> the technical advice which is available to them, and having regard to the results that have been achieved elsewhere, I have every hope and confidence that this scheme will be the success that every Deputy desires it to be.</P>

      <P>Any achievement which we make in agriculture will go a long way to solving many problems that are discussed here, for so much, as we all know, is dependent on the prosperity of farming in this country.  Now we are right up against the harvest and the outlook from the weather point of view is not too good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combine has given us something new in getting our harvest in quickly, but if it has solved that problem it has certainly created probably a greater one.  I wonder what arrangements are available for grain storage and the drying of the grain crops, and if sufficient facilities and plants are available to deal with the question.  With quite a lot of corn coming on to the market quickly there is an amount of congestion, and if this business of dealing with it could be improved it would make a tremendous difference.  That, I think, has caused different Ministers a headache&mdash;too much barley, particularly barley, and too much wheat and oats coming on to the market together. It has caused a drop in the prices.  I dealt with them to some small extent on the last day, but it is no harm to mention them again.  It is no harm to mention again that these prices have been much the same over the past few years and that they should be considerably improved owing to the greater cost of production.  I do not see why, when everybody got rises in wages, and so forth, the price of feeding barley, in particular, should remain the same.  I think there was an announcement the other day to the effect that <Col N="1092" /> a price of 48/- was fixed for it.  That is scarcely sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deering</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very necessary that we should have more feeding barley to offset the importation of maize and other feeding-stuffs.  It would make a great contribution to our prosperity if it could be grown more extensively.</P>
      <P>In addition to the other difficulties which farmers have to contend with, there is also the problem of bleak years.  That is particularly so in tillage farming.  You might have a bumper crop of wheat, worth probably £200 an acre, but we must not forget that there might be three or four years in between when you could not successfully grow wheat on the same land unless it is very good land indeed and, even then, there is a risk attached to it.</P>
      <P>The price of straw and hay has depreciated. These are the subsidiaries, with the crops in between.  The bottom seems to have fallen completely out of the market for straw.  It made a difference to the big tillage farmers. In reply to the contention that they should use the straw, we may be informed that nowadays quite a lot of people use artificials because of the labour difficulty involved in turning the straw into manure, and so forth.</P>
      <P>Any step which will help to arrest the drift of our people from the farms &mdash;which overshadows all other issues in Ireland to-day&mdash;is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of making a fairly general review of the situation in agriculture as it affects the people whom I represent, in the main.  While I am not going to indict the Minister with complete responsibility for what has occurred, one of the most significant features of the economic impact of falling prices in my constituency is the difficulty that has arisen owing to the bad price for turkeys last year, and the egg situation, <Col N="1093" /> and the dead fowl trade at the moment.  It may be that, when concluding, the Minister may be able to indicate that a brighter period is ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister is well aware of the fact that places such as West Cork and, indeed, some of the other Gaeltacht areas where the people went in extensively for fowl, are feeling the difficulties of the present situation.  I do not intend to involve myself in an argument as to responsibility.  It is sufficient for me to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that unless this uncertainty and this slump that has arisen in that particular industry is effectively arrested, and unless the Minister can show a way to a future in that particular trade, we are in danger that the rapid expansion we were able to get in that industry may be counteracted by an extraordinary contraction.  I am not saying that the Minister could have influenced in any way some of the circumstances that caused this slump.  It is possible that our costs of production could not enable Irish producers to compete against the surfeit of this commodity that appeared from other countries. However, if the poultry industry, as such, is to survive, I suppose the Minister realises as well as I do that unless there is some return by way of margin of profit for the effort that is put into the industry, it is not likely to remain a feature of our economy. It is a feature in our agricultural economy that is very germaine to the normal life of the smallholder such as I have the honour to represent.  It has been a significant part of the agricultural economy in West Cork over a long period.  When I talk of the difficulties in the poultry industry there, when I ask the Minister to prognosticate as to what the future for turkeys may be, I do not do so in a spirit of seeking political advantage or in an anxiety to create political difficulty.  I do so purely on the basis of trying to get the departmental view and the Minister's view as to the continuation of this particular branch of agriculture in a practical economic way in the future.  It is unfair that people who may be concentrating on this type of <Col N="1094" /> production should not be given due and ample warning and guidance from the Minister as to the alternative they might pursue rather than to allow them to run themselves into continuous difficulty in this particular trade if its future is fraught with difficulty.  I want the Minister to accept my anxiety with regard to this trade in the spirit of one who is anxious to preserve that particular adjunct to the economy common in my constituency at the present time so as to ensure that the people engaged in that particular branch of agriculture will have a reasonable return for their labour.</P>
    <P>Another important feature has occurred in the economy of West Cork. Again, I am not, at this particular stage, going to lay the responsibility at the door of the Minister.  Suffice to say that the present Minister was vociferous in his criticism, while he was in opposition, of his predecessor, in this particular regard.  There is quite a slump in the flax industry in West Cork.  It may not be of consequence, in general, to most constituencies in Ireland but in my constituency, apart from being a highly remunerative cash crop, it was also responsible for the giving of considerable employment.  We had a number of scutching mills in operation in my constituency that absorbed a considerable labour force over a long period of the year.  I know that the Minister can say that this matter is outside his control but I recollect that when his predecessor was in office and took the line that he would not allow the Northern spinners to dictate what the price of flax would be in this country, and when he told them that he would not accept a differential between a grower on one side of the Border and a grower on the other side of the Border, the present Minister for Agriculture, who was then a Deputy on the Opposition side of the House&mdash; as well as some of his colleagues&mdash; was vociferous in his criticism.  In the light of what has subsequently occurred, I think that that tempest of fury was very ill-advised.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for a moment that responsibility can be placed on any Minister for the present collapse but <Col N="1095" /> I do think it fair to say that, at least, there was no lack of responsibility in the action taken by the Minister's predecessor.  I feel the present Minister could again give guidance if the Minister feels&mdash;and he is the person who can assess the situation properly &mdash;that it is more advisable to direct these people in West Cork to get out of flax and to go in for the production of certain alternative crops.  I think he should have the courage to issue that type of directive and that type of appeal before the season arrives for getting the land ready for flax.</P>
    <P>I am not going to suggest, and I think it would be unreasonable for me to suggest, that the Minister can directly influence the price of flax in future seasons.  Whether it is possible to preserve the flax industry on an economic basis, outside periods of war or emergency, is a question, I would say, that needs far more careful analysis than can be provided by casual references in debate, but I do feel, involved as I was in the controversy that arose on the flax issue, that the attitude then adopted by the Minister's predecessor has shown in its ultimate result how right his conception was of the reliability to be placed on contact with the Northern spinners.</P>
    <P>The difficulty that confronts the flax industry is that when a man has his flax grown and dam retted, he is at the mercy of these people when it comes to the question of price and he is also at their mercy when it comes to grading.  Bearing in mind the sitution that has arisen in connection with linseed oil and linseed cake, and the experiments carried on by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, which have just been approved, I am wondering if the Minister might not experiment with the possibility of developing flax for seed purposes so as to leave us less dependent on outside supplies of linseed oil.  I know I have been told that the Department does not think this is feasible, but I would say, from the experience of some people in that area, particularly that of a former member from West Cork, now the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad, Senator O'Donovan, that <Col N="1096" /> it is possible to grow flax in West Cork, particularly in the more isolated areas, that has a very good seed content. I would urge on the Minister that in dealing with the flax problem he might experiment wisely with the possibility of developing our own natural resources for the supply of that very necessary commodity, linseed oil.</P>
    <P>I shall pass from flax and poultry, leaving the Minister, I hope, under no misapprehension that both of them from the point of view of my constituency are problems of considerable magnitude.  It may be that in the national picture they may not have the significance that I try to give them in this House, but the Minister will readily appreciate, representing as he does a farming community himself, that to people on the particular type of holdings and in the isolation in which the people of West Cork live, these problems are of major importance.</P>
    <P>We have difficulties&mdash;I find it difficult myself&mdash;to arrive at a conviction with regard to ceiling or shall I say, floor prices for cereal crops.  Pressure has been brought to bear on various occasions with the object of securing that a floor should be put under the price of oats.  In fact, it was a most vociferous demand of the Fianna Fáil Party, on the eve of a Donegal byelection, that the Government should buy oats at a certain price.  Subsequently some of the very people who availed of the Government purchase of oats had to pay an enhanced price to the Government to get it back.  To arrive at what might be regarded as the floor price for oats one has to try to estimate accurately the supply available and the potential shortage that may arise at the back end of the season.</P>
    <P>Barley is a sore problem, how sore the Minister has experienced, because he knows the cynicism of some farmers who listened to him explain the barley situation during the East Cork by-election on one Sunday morning when the Minister and myself had occasion to clash.  It was idle to talk to them of the price for barley when they had in their pockets&mdash;such of them as accepted the price&mdash;contracts from the <Col N="1097" /> maltsters at considerably reduced prices.  Possibly the difficulty which arose was not in the main the responsibility of the Minister himself, probably it arose in the main from an omission of the Minister rather than from any culpable act of his, because a situation had undoubtedly developed, fathered by his predecessor, in which you had an excellent feeding barley grown which, in quality, reached and rivalled barley of any other type grown in the country.  You had ymer barley of first quality produced in the country and commercial interests reaping a harvest at the expense of the producer. That difficulty has left a problem in relation to barley that will not prove easy of solution.  As well as that, it makes for a distinction between barleys that, in the light of what was bought by the maltsters and distillers in the past year, really should not exist.  Because an equal quality article is grown under contract it commands an infinitely higher price than the same quality article not grown under contract.  Such difficulties and distinctions have bred uneasiness and uncertainty in the minds of the barley growers and that position calls for immediate attention from the Department now.</P>
    <P>I have always subscribed to the belief that the basis of our agricultural economy is effectively epitomised in the adage of our late Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Paddy Hogan:&mdash;</P>
    <P>One more cow;</P>
    <P>One more sow;</P>
    <P>One more acre under the plough!</P>
    <P>If that particular agricultural economy is to find its logical conclusion it is essential that the Minister and his Department should by way of encouragement and price stimulant urge the farmer to grow more and more of the feeding stuffs we require in order to ultimately ship our beef on the hoof, our pork and our poultry into the markets they command.  It is now becoming more and more evident that we cannot have a capricious type of agricultural planning.  We can no longer have, as we have had in the past, the basis of our agricultural economy twisted in the political arena.  There is no doubt Irish land can produce infinitely more than it is producing at present. <Col N="1098" /> There is room for tremendous expansion.</P>
    <P>I charge the Minister with certain neglect in that respect.  One cannot conceive any sincerity in urging our farmers to increase production in a situation in which the agricultural community is being asked simultaneously to suffer the shock and strain of grossly increased costs of production, plus an increased burden of taxation.  Let us analyse the reality, if any, of the Minister's approach to our agricultural economy.  But for the wavering and uncertainty of some Deputies on the recent vote of confidence we would have had the farming community asked to bear a still further impact.  Though Deputies Cogan and Lehane may try to claim credit for arresting that impact that is not the case.  It was the arrival of Dick Barry and Mark Deering into Dáil Éireann that provided the real reason why the design to further bludgeon the agricultural community was blunted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not tell me you are trying to make capital for yourself again.  The position is that Deputy Cogan who cynically says: &ldquo;Are you trying to prevent it?&rdquo; is the very person who could have prevented the impact of the increase on tea, butter, bread, sugar and all the other essential foodstuffs.  The impact in connection with those is felt not only generally but specifically by the class he purports to represent and even more specifically by the class that is keeping him in residence here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While asking the farmer to pay more for the things he requires and to produce more of the things we require, the Minister for Agriculture voluntarily increases the price of fertilisers beyond the normal capacity of any farmer to pay.  At the same time that the Government is calling for increased production the farmer is bearing the impact of the Government's own actions.  Credit facilities are no longer available to give the farmer the necessary stimulus to produce more.  If the farmer wants to produce more he must first of all improve the heart and quality of his land.  The previous Minister <Col N="1099" /> for Agriculture initiated the ground limestone scheme.  The present Minister has developed that scheme and lime is being made available more abundantly to-day.  I would be grateful for the Minister's co-operation in ensuring that the outlying districts of my constituency, such as the Goleen Peninsula and the Beara Peninsula and Kilcroghane, have ground limestone readily available to them since the sea sand subsidy is coming to an end.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It will come to an end.  If the sea sand scheme is abandoned I want the Minister to ensure that it will be counteracted by making ground limestone readily available in the outlying districts of West Cork at the normal price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, where you have a drive by the Government for increased production on the farm it must be accompalined by an earnest of the Government's good will, and if our economy wants to be strengthened, as the Government say it does, then the main source from which that strength must flow is the land.  Therefore, I say without hesitation that it is into the land that there must flow rapidly and readily all the fertiliser, all the improvement in methods, whether by mechanical aid or otherwise, and all improvement possible in the quality of our seeds that can be made available. Fertiliser must be put within reach of every farmer no matter how difficult the question of credit may be.  I want to say to the Minister, in a deliberate way, that it would be far better for the quality, strength and usefulness of this fertiliser if it were to find its way into Irish land than be depreciating in congealed masses in stores, due to the fact that the price of it is prohibitive.  I have said to the Minister before, and I mean it, that it would be far better for the Government to write off as a dead loss all the fertiliser that they have now, virtually in a solidified form in stores, and to distribute it as a Government gesture to farmers so that <Col N="1100" /> it might rot in the land rather than in these stores.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been urged by many of his own people, and has been repeatedly urged by Deputies on this side, to deal with what is the main difficulty that is holding up progress, namely, that credit facilities are not being readily made available to the farmers to enable them to improve the quality of their land.  I know that the Minister has a difficult corner to fight in the Cabinet when it comes to a fight for his own Department.  If, however, we are in earnest about production, I would say, without hesitation, that every £1,000,000 poured out in aid, by way of fertiliser, machinery or in an improvement in the quality of our seeds, for the land, will give an infinitely better return than millions invested in funds, whether they be in liquid or other form, since the ultimate <Col N="1101" /> benefit of such investment is going to be felt by some other country.</P>
      <P>The Minister is in a strong position to follow the line of policy I suggest, especially in view of the fact that we have this problem of the flight from the land.  At times, when talking on this, we use fluent and imaginative language, but the Minister is perfectly well aware that there is that drift from the land.  We have even reached the stage where a difficulty is being experienced, in the case of some small holdings in my area, of getting the eldest son who is entitled to the farm to remain at home and take it over.</P>
      <P>I am not attempting to push the responsibility for that on to the shoulders of the Minister.  Anyone, however, acquainted with conditions in rural Ireland will understand the difficulties.  There may be commitments in regard to sisters, and so on, and these may not make the taking over of a holding terribly attractive to the eldest son.  That situation represents a significant change from the fierce burning ambition that was so much in evidence in previous generations of holding on to and having land.  It is that kind of change that must inevitably make any Government and any responsible person anxious about the future of agriculture pause and try to find a way to ameliorate conditions to such an extent that this tendency can not only be arrested but completely killed.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, that can be done by ensuring, as quickly as possible, that all the normal social amenities will be introduced into every home throughout the length and breadth of the country, the farmer's home and the farm worker's home.  I am urging the Minister to use his influence to ensure that all normal social adjuncts, such as electricity and other aids to the domestic situation in rural Ireland will be pressed for earnestly and constantly by his Department.  I say that because the contrast that exists at the moment between the cities and the country is not operating to the betterment of rural Ireland.  It is our duty sometimes to look around at other countries and take a lesson from them that can be rapidly learned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> In agricultural economy we can take many lessons from the lowlands of Europe.  One who pays even a casual visit to Denmark or parts of Belgium will find the design and plan there has always been to make the home conditions and the facilities in the homes of the farmers comparable with those of the very best in the land.</P>
    <P>I am not for one moment suggesting that that would not be the wish of the present Minister.  Anybody sincerely interested in the development of agriculture would wish to see the farming community and farm labourers housed as worthily as this State could house them.  When we talk about agriculture in this country we are inclined at times to forget that there is a great deal of drudgery, isolation, lack of social contact that must be as effectively dealt with as actual cultivation of the land.  Undoubtedly, a better response and a better effort will be obtained from the farming community as a whole when they feel that the Government are sufficiently interested in them and their particular contribution to our economy to ensure improvements in their normal welfare and domestic conditions.</P>
    <P>The scheme that was introduced to enable water to be brought into the dwelling-houses was excellent and the Minister is to be congratulated on continuing that scheme and extending its scope during his régime.  The inherent good in that scheme should be sufficient to commend its enlargement to the Minister.  Where difficulties of terrain and availability of water arise it should be possible to make more substantial grants available so as to ensure that every farmer will have running water in his home.</P>
    <P>My view is that we have never been bold enough in our schemes.  Where principles are sound, courage rather than finance should be the keynote of the scheme.  It has always been my belief that investment honestly made in Irish land and the homes of Irish farmers will reap the richest reward that any investment can reap in this country.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to try to keep a keen balance between the price of various cereals grown in this country <Col N="1103" /> and the cost of production.  It is the duty of the Department, no matter how they may try to offset it, to ensure that the farmer, who, in carrying out a general directive of the Department of Agriculture, gives time, labour, effort and care to the production of a crop, should be assured of some return for that effort in the ultimate disposal of the crop.  In present circumstances, no matter how difficult it might be, the Minister and his Department, having considered the cost of production of oats and barley and the difficulties that may arise in disposal, owing to a slump, particularly in the poultry industry, should consider putting a floor under the price of these particular cereals.  I am not saying that price fixation as a permanent policy is wholly commendable but, having regard to the experience of price fluctuation and of the degree of exploitation that barley growers suffered last year, the Minister should at least ensure that there will be a floor under the price of these commodities.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister has announced an increase in the price for wheat.  I hear airy accusations going around this House about there being something synonomous in anti-wheat and Fine Gael.  I have always been a very strong advocate of wheat growing in parts of the country but I have always felt, and still feel, that encouragement and price stimulant is an infinitely better way to get results than compulsion.  When the Minister talks of area under tillage, as he sometimes does in this House, it would be a good thing if he took the other side of the ledger and dealt with yields because the amazing fact emerged, in a year when the Minister stipulated that we cut tillage by a very large acreage, that the actual yield from the reduced acreage far exceeded the yield that was got, under compulsion, from debilitated land that was unfit and unsuited for wheat-growing.</P>

      <P>The situation with regard to wheat presents one difficulty. <Col N="1104" /> I would be glad to hear from the Minister what progress has been made by his Department in the matter of combating pest in wheat which has become prevalent, unfortunately, in recent years.  I would be glad to know how far experimentation has got in ensuring the minimum effect of the impact of midge.  I say that to the Minister. not in a spirit of criticism, but hoping that he may be able to allay unrest that may be growing in the minds of certain farmers about this particular pest.  I do not want farmers to go out of wheat production on the basis of that type of uncertainty when I feel sure that the Department would be able to give aid and assistance to offset the impact of midge. The Minister must be vigorous in his campaign to offset any apathy that the occurrence of this pest may have created.  If we can use the price stimulant in regard to wheat there must be a basis on which to found a price level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that the Minister should not go beyond putting a floor to prices because I think the normal law of supply and demand will operate to get a reasonable price level for the producer.  I am strongly inclined to the view that the farmer who produces more and more of his own feeding stuffs and feeds them to live stock is getting the best price of all for his cereals in the ultimate disposal of the live stock.  But, where cash crops are produced, the Minister should face up to the possibility of ensuring no more than this, that the producer genuinely producing a good quality article will not suffer any loss.  If we want the farmer to produce more oats, barley, wheat and grass, whether grass for feeding, grass for hay, or grass for ultimate ensilage, and if the Government are in earnest about that, the farmer must have all the facilities he needs with regard to artificial fertilisers. If it is necessary for the Government to introduce some credit scheme to enable the farmer to get all the fertilisers he needs, I urge the <Col N="1105" /> Minister to do it because I think the ultimate increase in production and the strengthening of the economy will more than offset what might be levied by way of interest.  The Minister can be assured that there is one voice in this House that will never be afraid to support such a project, and that is mine.</P>
      <P>I feel that the Department has already done an excellent job, but it should constantly keep the farmer alive to the importance of seeds and of better quality cereals.  Possibly the time has come for the Minister to do a little bit of investigation in regard to the distribution of seeds and certain seed monopolies which exist.  It is necessary for the Minister, who is the custodian of the farmers' rights, to ensure that as much as can legitimately be given by way of profit to the producer goes to him before anybody else.</P>
      <P>The Minister should continue, as he is doing, boosting his ground limestone scheme.  The Department, both under Deputy Dillon and now under the present Minister, has done a worth-while job in impressing the usefulness of lime on farmers generally.</P>

If there is such a thing as a dual purpose cow, we have to deal with the Minister's problem of replacing all the uneconomic cows, because this country suffers where milk is concerned, leaving out the specialist herds, in the main from an uneconomic cow.  If price alone were the answer to the problem it would not be as difficult as it is at present, because we must of necessity balance what the consumer pays for the finished product against the costs of production and what reasonable profit should be given to the producer.  To make milk economic at present might involve a staggering price increase, whereas a reasonable increase in the lactation of a cow even at the present price of milk might rapidly tend to make it fully economic.</P>
      <P>Therefore, when we are dealing with the matter of milk I want to put a few questions to the Minister.  First of all, I want to ask whether he is satisfied that there is such a thing as a dual purpose cow.  If he is satisfied that there is, can he indicate to the House what is the percentage of uneconomic cows in the country and, for the purpose of ultimate price fixation, what does he deem to be the reasonable average lactation to expect from a cow?  Will the Minister also indicate to the House, and through the House to the farmers, how it is proposed to replace uneconomic cows by economic cows?</P>
      <P>I should like to get a general picture from the Minister as to the success or otherwise of the Department's insemination plan, whether ther Department's efforts to make available as many high quality milk strain bulls as possible to the agricultural community have been a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> If the Minister is convinced that the dual purpose strain exists he could indicate to us the plans his Department have for generally improving the old standard of herds throughout the country.  On the issue of price, we are anxious to know from the Minister if he has conceived any plan either for the milk products or by-products earning very substantial profits to be used as a subvention in aid to keep down the price of butter to the consumer, at the same time ensuring a reasonable price for milk to the producer.  I want to know from the Minister whether his Department have plans to extend the uses of milk into lines other than butter and whether the Department have plans to bring the profits so earned back into an essential fund to boost the overall price of milk in the country without having to impose increased costs on the consumer.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know from the Minister in relation to milk whether there is any reality in expectations of a report of the Costings Commission; whether there is any real hope that we will arrive at an analysis of costs that will enable us to arrive at a reasonable price, because the general activity of this commission since it has been set up and&mdash;should one say&mdash;the tardiness of the Minister in reference thereto, and the veil of secrecy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The last observation I had from the Minister was that he was going to have two reports, one from one section and one from another and that there was&mdash;shall we say&mdash;an unbridgeable chasm between the two points of view.  With regard to milk and butter production I am anxious to know from the Minister what he considers would be a reasonable consumption of butter for the Irish people and what he thinks should be a reasonable <Col N="1108" /> price to ask the consumer to pay for butter, because we have had the infamous situation arising here that people have tried to divide country from town by making irresponsible statements about the price of milk in country districts and pointed criticism of the farmers in town districts because of the price of butter.  We have got to get the facts with regard to the economic value or otherwise of butter production clearly laid out for analysis by all sections of the people.  The Minister is as well aware as I am that unless there is a substantial increase in the price of milk as at present produced, it is not going to be an economic proposition, and the Minister will have to tell the House if that situation arises, in what way he is going to ensure butter at a reasonable price for the people and what alternative uses he will make of milk to ensure an adequate price is paid to the producer. It is a big problem and I am not putting it to the Minister as an easy one.</P>

      <P>I was not eating much butter then.  One must not talk as the Minister is talking, of 30 years ago.  We are not in that situation now.  I think the Minister will agree that there are readily available tremendous quantities of butter, and that we could not compete in a normal butter market to-day with our butter prices.  I think the situation is not quite analogous to that of 30 years ago on that basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but one must relate the price to the circumstances, and the circumstances that exist to-day are that, no matter what the root cause of it may be, the price for milk <Col N="1109" /> paid in the creameries is not a remunerative price to the producer.  The cause may not be, as I said initially, fundamentally laid at the Minister's door or may be not even a matter of price at all.  It may be in the quality, strain or yield of the cows.  I am prepared to concede that to the Minister, but what I am anxious to do&mdash; and believe me anxious to help in doing&mdash;is to find some way to equate all the problems of the dairying industry and arrive at a solutation, because I think the Minister will agree with me that the dairying industry is the foundation of our whole live-stock economy, and that in the ultimate analysis it is on our milch cows that even the highly valuable and successful trade depends.  If we cannot get the keystone and foundation-block of our agricultural economy sound in its reality we are going to run into tremendous difficulty in the pursuance of our present agricultural economy. When I say that I am anxious to help in the problem I am in earnest, because I am not suggesting that this problem is capable of solution by waving a wand or by some administrative act ; but I do think that the time has come for the Minister and his Department to tell us with their 30 years' experience of the operation of control as it has been operated whether they think first of all that the dual purpose cow has proved a success, secondly, what they can do to improve the milk yields of the dairy Shorthorns, and, thirdly, the general overall plan of disposal of milk and milk by-products and the utilisation of whatever profit can be gleaned from that type of trade to the subsidisation of milk prices generally to the milk producer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a problem that gives me considerable trouble.  I represent a very big milk-producing area.  We have got some of the finest creameries in the country in my area.  We are producing a quality of butter that I think the Minister will admit ranks excellent anywhere, and it is not easy for a person who is sincere about the development of his own country to be constantly in the position of meeting dairy farmers who put their case to <Col N="1110" /> you, going into provincial towns and villages in the constituency, where you feel in the actual circumstances of the present that the price of butter is a severe strain on those living on the side of the street.  There is an important real problem to be grappled with there, and to the solution of that problem we will have to bring all the good-will and all the co-operation that we can find here among people representing various interests.  I do not think that this problem is one that should be the gambit of political advantage.  I am saying that seriously because I think the problem is of such a major nature and is fundamentally so basic to our very agricultural industry that we must face up to it as rapidly as possible.  Where the equilibrium lies I do not know, and I candidly admit that, but I do say to the Minister in all earnestness that he should direct his mind irrespective of what commissions may be sitting to what are the root causes of decay in dairying and what are the true causes of the complaints about the uneconomic facet of dairying.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to know from the Minister, taking the situation generally, what is the position with regard to the position of the carcase meat trade.  We have heard much criticism in this House&mdash;I have heard many of my colleagues being very pointed in their criticism&mdash;in relation to hides and the price of hides and hide rings.  Whether there happen to be hide rings or not or what kind of rings they are, I am not sure, but I am anxious to know from the Minister, taking into consideration the development of the investment that has been in meat factories, what his prognosis of the future might be, particularly in view of the fact that the future might find ourselves in an open as distinct from a protected market.  I am as anxious as the Minister is to see that all facets of our beef trade remain strongly remunerative to the Irish farmer, but I do think that the difficulties experienced by the carcase meat trade, the difficulties experienced by these meat factories, warrant the Minister reviewing the situation and possibly giving the benefit of his guidance through technical advice to <Col N="1111" /> the people at present engaged in the trade or those contemplating development in it.</P>
    <P>I think the effort at expansion of our pig and bacon industry has proved its worth.  I am glad to see throughout all parts of this country the homely old sow becoming more and more evident, and I think that time should prove conclusively that we can produce and balance effectively in this country proper and adequate feed for pigs.  No matter what controversy may have arisen about maize and its qualities I feel that the development at home here in this country of the intelligent use of balanced feed growable at home is a very welcome feature of our present pig industry, and I think that the Minister might pursue the line of driving home even more forcibly to the Irish farmer that he can grow here at home and balance from the cereals grown at home a ration that will finish his pig as well as any foodstuffs grown anywhere in the country.  I am glad to see that for the present anyway this particular facet of our agricultural economy shows great potentiality. It has been a great relief in some ways to the strain that has been thrown on small farmers where poultry was a problem.  Fortunately, a good many of them have a limited number of sows or were fairly substantially in pigs, so that I do not want to distort the problem out of its reality.  I want the Minister when dealing with it to realise that nobody appreciates more readily than I do that you cannot take the economy of a holding and break it down into each individual facet and expect each facet to pay, but I do think that the Minister will have to give a lead and an explanation where the poultry industry is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 29, before Section 62, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> (1)  Where a college which awards any of the qualifying diplomas mentioned in the Second Schedule to the Medical Practitioners Act, 1927 (No. 25 of 1927), or a college of a university which awards any such diploma, requires facilities for the teaching of clinical medicine or for the conduct of medical research in a health institution&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the Minister, if he so thinks proper, may by Order declare the institution to be a teaching institution,</P>
    <P>(b) on the institution being declared to be a teaching institution&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it shall be the duty of the health authority by whom the institution is maintained to provide in the institution such facilities for the teaching of clinical medicine or for the conduct of medical research as the Minister may direct from time to time,</P>
    <P>(ii) in relation to the making of any appointment to the staff of the institution which is considered by the Minister to carry with it duties involving the teaching of clinical medicine or the conduct of medical research under the direction of one or more than one such college, any board constituted by the Local Appointments Commissioners in accordance with Section 9 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 (No. 39 of 1926), to interview candidates shall consist of a chairman nominated by the Minister and a number of other members, half of whom shall be nominated by such college or colleges.</P>
    <P>(2)  In this section &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; shall be construed as including surgery and midwifery, and &ldquo;medical&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage, I mentioned that I would be introducing an amendment dealing with the teaching bodies, the schools of medicine and their request for facilities for teaching hospitals. There has been a long time of negotiation between the Galway University <Col N="1113" /> College and the Department of Health and the County Hospital in Galway which is now becoming a regional hospital.  The position was that where an appointment was made by the Local Appointments Commission&mdash;let us say a surgeon to the county hospital, or a physician or a gynaecologist&mdash;University College, Galway, had no option but to accept the same man as their professor, and they considered that this rather handicapped them because they had no choice.</P>
    <P>We had protracted negotiations on this matter, and while I felt that we should not depart from the principle that the local authority would have the appointment of a man to their hospital, University College, Galway, thought that they should have some say in the appointment of their own professor.  Now after discussing the matter at length, both sides agreed that if they had an equal number on a selection board with a neutral chairman it would be the best solution. When we arrived at that stage, the college suggested that the Minister for Health should nominate the neutral chairman.  I would like to assure the Dáil that I did not look for this job of nominating a chairman, but there appeared to be no other way in which it could be done by which to give it a neutral character, so I am therefore introducing this amendment; and the position will be this, that where a college think that they want facilities for teaching in any local authority hospital they will apply to the Minister for Health for an Order, and if the Minister for Health agrees that these facilities are necessary then he makes an Order and the local authority will provide the facilities for teaching in that particular hospital.  Providing facilities means, of course, that they will permit their man to give clinical teaching to students of the college and provide for reasonable hours for those clinics and so on.  Then, when the appointment comes to be made&mdash;it would not interfere, of course, with appointments that are there at the moment&mdash;when new appointments come to be made where the college claims that they have an interest in the matter and it is fairly obvious to the Minister that the man <Col N="1114" /> appointed will, in all probability, be the professor in the college, then the Minister will make a second Order having this machinery put into motion under which the appointment will be made and the appointment will go to the Local Appointments Commission in the usual way.</P>
    <P>They will issue the advertisement, they will do the interviewing and so on, but in setting up their selection board they will have to follow the pattern laid down here in this amendment. They will accept a certain number of nominations from the college&mdash;let us say three&mdash;and they will appoint three themselves and then they will ask the Minister to appoint a chairman.  The selection board having made their selection, the procedure will follow the usual Local Appointments Commissioner procedure with regard to the appointment being made.  Of course, even with all this over there is no obligation on the college to appoint that man a professor, but at any rate they will have this machinery and we will have gone as far as possible to meet them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder will the Minister relate this in a rather ordered way to the position of the teaching bodies as far as medicine is concerned and their general position in relation to medical education.  The Minister is, of course, aware of the difficulties which have arisen with regard to doctors trained in our medical schools here in relation, say, to recognition in the United States and the question that is still pending of some visiting body from the United States coming here, I think next month, with a view to looking into the position of our medical schools here and seeing whether they cannot agree to have recognition of our medical degrees in the United States.  Some aspect of the difficulty might easily relate to the extent to which the teaching bodies were properly controlled by the universities or by the medical authorities in the universities.  The Minister's amendment, as he has indicated, is intended to cover situations in which teaching is carried on in some hospitals that are local authority hospitals and where the local authority wants to have at any rate a say in the appointment of the doctors there.  From the <Col N="1115" /> point of view of medical teaching the university, at least the medical authority in the university, want to be in the position of saying that they will control all such appointments in the hospital as are appointments that are carrying out teaching functions.  The Minister has indicated that in relation to Galway particularly some arrangement has been made with the university there.  I would like to ask the Minister what is the university authority, what is the body on the university side, that from the medical teaching point of view would be regarded as the authority controlling the appointments that were in any hospitals doing teaching.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the teaching hospitals in Dublin the position has now been arrived at that appointments made in the teaching hospitals in Dublin which are positions that have a teaching function are made with the co-operation, and to a certain extent with the control of the university authority.  Can the Minister make it clear whether any body in the National University as a whole such as the Senate is supposed to have any function in relation to the appointments for teaching positions, for professorial positions in the universities, and whether the matter has been discussed at the Senate level and, if not, what is the particular university level at which it is proper to have the matter decided and agreed to?  I take it according to the Minister's amendment that the provisions would apply equally to Cork, Galway or Dublin, as the case might be if the necessity arose in any of those places to have an arrangement made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had some experience of this problem myself, and I understand the Minister's difficulty. I am glad to see that he has been able to come to this compromise solution while at the same time I regret that the Local Appointments Commission machinery should be interfered with in any way because it has done a magnificent job.  In fact, the Local Appointments Commission machinery has been responsible more than anything else <Col N="1116" /> for the very high standard which at present obtains in relation to our State health services and our local authority health services.  I should be very averse indeed to any fundamental change in the machinery.</P>
      <P>However, in the circumstances, where there is to be a teaching school established, from our point of view, the advantages are very considerable, because there is no doubt the standard of medicine will rather tend to be improved by virtue of the fact that it will become a teaching hospital to a certain extent.</P>
      <P>Consequently, I am very much in favour of this development that the universities should become in some way associated with the local authority hospitals.  To a certain extent, it is badly needed.  Certain affiliation by one or other of the Dublin universities would be necessary in order to provide the additional beds required for the considerable number of students there and then there is the other effect of improving, as I think it will, the standard of medicine and moving a place like St. Kevin's away from the old workhouse, poor-law type of hospital. The standard of medicine will be upgraded to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I suggest that the Minister be very cautious to ensure that there will be no further dilution of his nominees, of our nominees, on any proposed board to be established by the Local Appointments Commission for the making of appointments to our local authority hospitals.  For instance, in St. Kevin's, the paramount consideration must be the quality of the individual to be appointed and the secondary consideration the association with the university and I ask the Minister to be particularly cautious with regard to giving way on the second to the detriment of the first. We should try to keep as far away as we can in the making of appointments to local authority hospitals from the system of appointments adopted by the voluntary hospitals, which, I think, has largely led to the very low general standard of medicine we find in most of our voluntary hospitals.  It is essential that the system of the Local Appointments Commission should not <Col N="1117" /> be weakened to any greater extent than is suggested here by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposition that &ldquo;half of the members of the commission shall be nominated by such college or colleges&rdquo;, in the event of University College, Dublin, Trinity College Dublin, and the College of Surgeons deciding to set up a joint training school or joint teaching facilities in a place like St. Kevin's, I wonder if the Minister could say whether it will be at his discretion, or will the Local Appointments Commission, or the separate boards of the teaching establishment, have the decision in making the allocation of members to the appointments board. Possibly that has not been considered by the Minister&mdash;I do not know whether it has been considered by the different teaching authorities&mdash;but, if it has, I wonder if the Minister has come to any decision.  I hope that each of these teaching establishments will have equal representation, if they are to take part in a joint effort to utilise the local authority hospitals as teaching establishments.  I welcome the proposed affiliation, which I hope will come to fruition, between the local authority hospitals and the universities, the teaching centres.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not think that the local authority should feel that they should go in any sense cap in hand to these people.  We are offering magnificent facilities in many cases which they have not got themselves and we should bear that in mind.  They are not bringing all the gifts&mdash;we have quite a lot to offer them in facilities which will help their undergraduates and in a number of cases postgraduates, and will help the teaching, enlarging and improving its standard, of their undergraduates in the universities and different medical schools.  The Minister should be particularly careful in his negotiations with these people to make them bear that in mind, that we here in the Oireachtas are particularly conscious of the advantages which we could offer to these people; that if there is any bargaining to be done it should be hard bargaining, on the basis that, while they have a certain amount to offer us, we have a lot to offer them; <Col N="1118" /> that what we would like to do is what would be in the best interests, first, of the patients in our institutions and, secondly, of the undergraduates and postgraduates and Irish medicine in general, and that under no circumstances should there be any retrograde step in relation to appointments.  The standard in the local authority hospitals generally is extremely high due to the mechanism of the Local Appointments Commission, which I believe is absolutely above criticism.  We can well understand that there is a special problem in Dublin, Galway and Cork, but we should not depart from the very high standards laid down by the Local Appointments Commission in the past, in the matter of the making of appointments, by which the best qualified candidate is appointed and afterwards the other considerations arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The American Medical Society are, I believe, sending some members over here towards the end of this year to examine the condition of the teaching of clinical medicine here, before deciding on the question of recognition of our degrees in the United States.  I think they are principally concerned that the college should control clinical teaching and I think this will cover the point, so far as they are concerned.  It is not done, however, entirely from the point of view of pleasing the American medical schools, because we have our own much bigger problem here of having proper medical teaching carried out to supply the country with medical men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, some of them must emigrate, but those who have emigrated to England up to this find no difficulty in getting proper recognition there.  I think, however, that, under this amendment and when the scheme is adopted, clinical teaching in the local authority hospitals under the colleges concerned, which are principally Galway and Cork, will make things right.  I cannot answer for the voluntary hospitals, but I suppose the colleges will make an endeavour to have appointments from the voluntary hospitals in line with the requirements of the American medical authorities <Col N="1119" /> which will give them some say in the appointments there.</P>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Mulcahy's question, I think the authority concerned is the governing body.  At least, any negotiations I had with the colleges of Galway, Cork and Dublin were almost all with the presidents.  As far as I know, they were speaking for their governing bodies.  I think the question came before the Senate of the National University and was referred back to that committee for negotiation on this point.</P>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Dr. Browne, if more than one college applies in Dublin&mdash;that cannot happen in Galway or Cork&mdash;for facilities in one local authority hospital, then it is the Local Appointments Commissioners who will decide on the representation of the board in accordance with this section. What they would do, in my opinion, if two applied would be to give them half the representation on the board.  If three applied they would give one to each college and three others, the Minister appointing a chairman.  It is the Local Appointments Commissioners who decide this under the Order.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as Deputy Dr. Browne pointed out, must naturally keep the interests of the local authority hospital in mind.  That is his principal duty and he would have regard to that provision when making any Order or giving any direction.  It is not his function actually to look after the university or the college.  They have their own governing body and their Senate as well.  As I interpret this, all the Minister is asked to do is to observe this section and keep the interest of the local authority hospital in mind before he makes an Order or gives a direction.  I think that would be the proper interpretation for a Minister for Health in carrying out his functions under this particular section if passed by the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> In some talks which I had with the Irish Medical Association, the Irish Medical Council and those representing or speaking in any way for the colleges, I agreed to certain amendments on the Committee Stage.  Afterwards, when I looked up my notes, I found that, although I had undertaken to put in these words, I had omitted to do so.  I thought it was only fair that I should put them in as I had given the undertaking.  I really want to make it perfectly plain that we do not mean to set up a medical school under this section.  We only mean to have postgraduate courses that would take place from time to time.  The postgraduate courses might be given for any subject.  It is perfectly obvious, as the section is drafted, that all I had in mind in drafting the section was that the local authority hospital could give a course if it had something of value to teach.  If the local authorities want to instruct their men on a particular method or a particular technique in regard to some new treatment or other they could give a course in a particular hospital and invite the members of their staffs to attend.  It is laid down, of course, that they cannot be compelled to attend.  That is what we had in mind.  I made it quite plain in my talks with the Irish Medical Association and those speaking for the medical schools that I had no more than that in mind and that I did not ever intend to turn this into a medical school.  I had undertaken to put in these words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; but, unfortunately, when the amendment was being drafted I omitted to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that the words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; are a sufficient safeguard?  I take it from the Minister's statement that the object of this is to permit local authority hospitals to instruct their medical officers on certain facts, and that they would then want to be in the position of establishing a teaching centre.  What exactly does &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; mean?  There seems to be a principle involved.  The words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; will really enable a Minister, whoever he may be, to allow teaching at any time he wishes in the local hospitals.  I think it would be far <Col N="1121" /> better if the Minister amended the wording and inserted the words &ldquo;in consultation with the teaching authority&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; mean that they can teach for years. There is no time limit.  If they decide to teach in local authority hospitals they can go on teaching for years. There is not any limit.  It is not limited to a few hours, a few weeks or a few months.  They can establish themselves as a permanent teaching establishment.  The Minister tells us that it is not his intention to do that, that the intention is to teach as the occasion arises.  It would be far easier to meet the situation by inserting the words &ldquo;in consultation with the teaching authorities&rdquo;.  If that suggestion is accepted it would meet the case and there would be no further argument about it.  Established teaching authorities would be safeguarded and the Minister or whoever is representing the local authority would be perfectly safeguarded.  I would ask the Minister to meet the case that way.</P>

      <P>The words are put in, of course, to make it impossible for a Minister to carry on a continuous course.  Some people purported to be afraid that that might be done by a Minister.  Let us say there is a course for the D.P.H., the M.D., or the M.Ch. I put in the words to show that these postgraduate courses would be single courses.  Then another one might be given on something else.  I think the words are perfectly plain.  There is no danger that a school can be carried on. We are going as far as can be expected.</P>

    <P>279A.  Where a decision taken in pursuance of paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 15 of the Health Act, 1953, as applied by this Act, is a decision that the yearly means of the adult person are not less than £600, an appeal shall lie from the decision to a person appointed by the Minister, and regulations made by the Minister may make provision with respect to the making and determination of appeals under this section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 34, after Section 71 to add a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, shall not apply to any action brought by any person for damages for breach of duty and/or negligence against a health authority (or officer, servant or agent thereof) in respect of any act of omission arising out of, or incidental to, the provision of any service, treatment or examination made available by virtue of the provisions of this Act and of the Health Act, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long, as this has already been discussed on the Committee Stage. The amendment is designed purely and simply to ensure that the public authority hospitals will be on the same footing as the voluntary hospitals in regard to any act of negligence or breach of duty which might give rise to a claim by a patient.  I think the Minister might well accept the amendment. I see no reason why the public authority hospitals should receive a <Col N="1123" /> special blanket protection as regards acts of negligence.</P>
    <P>I might put this additional consideration to the Minister.  Apart from the necessity of ensuring that the rights of anybody who suffers an injury, through the negligence of the hospital authorities or the staff, will be protected, I think that an occasional action of that kind is quite useful from the point of view of keeping everybody on their toes.  The mere danger that there will be an investigation, the mere risk of an investigation, acts as an extra safety device to ensure that there is no negligence in the running of the services.</P>
    <P>I do not think that this should be left over for the Bill introduced by Deputy Dillon.  We do not know how long that legislation may take and, in the meantime, it would be no harm to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that in principle I am against bringing matters of this kind into a Health Bill.  This is a matter that really should be dealt with under some other code.  As the Deputy knows, a Bill is being prepared by the Minister for Justice, a Bill which he undertook to prepare when Deputy Dillon introduced his Bill and did not proceed with it until the Minister would produce his Bill.  The Minister is definitely producing that Bill and it will be ready, I am told, after the summer recess.  I do not know how far it will go.  I do not think it will remove the limitation completely; it may only extend the period to 12 months or two years instead of six months.  I do not want to give the Deputy an undertaking that the Bill being brought in by the Minister for Justice will go as far as he wants to go here for the health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be rather anomalous if we passed this now and left other local authorities as they are.  For instance, you would have the sanitary authority, the housing authority, the mental authority and various other authorities with the employees under the disabilities they are under at the moment, whilst we would remove that disability to some extent, by putting in the <Col N="1124" /> amendment, for the health authority. I think it would be better to leave it until the Bill is introduced by the Minister for Justice and therefore I have to oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was introduced, we asked on Second Reading, in a motion, as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after the word &lsquo;That&rsquo; and substitute therefor the words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;Dáil Éireann, while of opinion that improvement and extension of the health services are necessary, declines to give a Second Reading to the Health Bill, 1952, until it receives a report on the Bill from a Joint Committee of the Dáil and Seanad having power to send for persons, papers and records.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our experience of dealing with health legislation in the House, apart altogether from the general lines of this Bill, dictated that there would be an examination of the Bill in circumstances where all the facts of the situation could be elicited from people who were competent, by reason of their experience and their position in the country, to give their representatives in the Dáil and Seanad the details that we felt it was necessary <Col N="1125" /> we should have before approving of a general Health Bill of any kind.  The Minister refused that and we have had a situation here in which we could say that the present Bill has been bulldozed through the Dáil on Committee without any reasonable chance, either by way of time or by way of opportunity, of discussing the general implications of the Bill.</P>
    <P>On the Fifth Stage, we are supposed to discuss what is in the Bill, but, even after the discussions there have been and even with the assistance of the discussions we have had, I doubt if very many in the Dáil would be capable of discussing what is in the Bill. It is intended that it will be put into operation by regulations and Orders made from time to time but the outstanding fact in relation to the Bill is contained in the statement issued by the Irish Medical Association, published in their journal of April, 1953, which states explicitly:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We unanimously reject the proposals contained in the Health Bill of 1952 and refuse to co-operate should the Bill become law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then they give the grounds.  I understand that their attitude was reiterated at a meeting held a month or so ago.  Therefore, we have the position that this Dáil has pushed through the Committee and Report Stages a Health Bill in relation to which the medical profession, as represented by the Irish Medical Association, say that they are unanimously rejecting the proposals in the Bill and that they will refuse to co-operate in its operation.</P>
    <P>Early in 1939, the Government at that time set up a committee of very representative people to inquire into vocational organisation.  That committee reported on the 4th November, 1943, and at paragraph 12 of the report they stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have taken, then, the general term &lsquo;the vocational organisation of society or of the community&rsquo; as meaning the ordering of the structures and activities of the various distinct vocationally organised bodies in the community in such a way as to promote the common good; <Col N="1126" /> this promotion to be secured by the co-operation of each vocationally organised body with the others in some intelligently controlled way for some clear aim or purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before the Minister produced this Bill, he declined to allow representatives of his Department and representatives of the Irish Medical Association to co-operate in reviewing the general position and in seeing whether they could agree to proposals for health legislation.</P>
    <P>Then he produces this Bill and he has simply bulldozed it through the House.  We are now finished with it here.  We have had to discuss it at a time when we ought to be discussing other very important matters in relation to the various Departments of State and in relation to our finances. In 90 days it becomes law.  It will be offered to the Seanad for consideration at a time of the year which it is inconceivable that anybody would plan as a reasonable time to ask the Seanad inside 90 days to examine this Bill. However, the Bill now passes from us. We are fundamentally opposed to the general principle upon which it is drawn.  According to the Minister, the present public assistance medical services cater at the present time for 1,000,000 of our population and the Bill forces the next 1,000,000 of our population in on top of these people with very inadequate provision.  Therefore, it will deprive those who got a fair amount of service from our public assistance health machinery of some of the facilities they had up to the present.  By reason of various pressures of one kind or another, including the burden of taxation and of rates, they will be forced to take advantage of the machinery provided making available to them machinery that will be neither adequate for them nor, in many cases, very suitable.</P>
    <P>There will be various repercussions as a result of these proposals as it affects the medical profession, as it affects the people who are supposed to be served, as it affects our voluntary hospitals&mdash;who, if they do not kow-tow to the proposals of this Bill, may find themselves out of existence <Col N="1127" />&mdash;and as it affects the medical teaching authorities.  All of these present aspects of the proposals which will become very live issues among these sections of our community straight away, that is, after the 90 days have passed.  We can only leave the Bill and its effects to pass then into the more realistic regions, among our professions, our hospitals, our people who bear the financial burden and our people who want the services.</P>
    <P>Certainly the manner in which the Minister has treated the Assembly here in dealing with this Bill has reduced this Dáil to a nullity.  It has taken away any realism from the suggestion that this is an Assembly where opinions can be exchanged, where facts can be produced and decisions taken in a reasonable way as a result of discussion here.  We object to the way in which this measure has been prepared, the way it has been dealt with in this House, and we are opposed to its general provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It was regrettable that this Bill was presented in the manner in which we first saw it.  We had a list of amendments.  Those of us who sought to amend the Bill found that the Minister had sent in a further list of amendments, amendments, it could be said, to amend the previous amendments. To say the least of it, it made the Bill difficult to follow from the start.  Notwithstanding that, I think the Bill finally emerged in somewhat better shape than it was in when introduced.  From the beginning the Labour Party took the line that while this Bill did not meet with all we wished for or desired, it was still a step in the right direction.  We decided we would co-operate with the Minister, that we would seek to improve the Bill in so far as we could by submitting various amendments.  I feel we can claim we have done something in that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of our amendments were ruled out by the Chair on the grounds that they imposed charges on the Exchequer.  Others were defeated in this House.  I regret very much that we were unable to secure completely <Col N="1128" /> the removal of Section 54, that obnoxious section from our point of view.  I also regret very much that the Minister saw fit on the Report Stage to make an attack on members of the Labour Party, especially in view of the fact that they were not in a position to reply at that stage having spoken once on it.  He suggested that the Labour Party members were motivated by the desire to protect blackguards in the county homes who came in to annoy and upset the ordinary people there. That certainly was not the motive of any member of the Labour Party in supporting the line taken by Deputy Dr. Browne.  Our argument was that there was a principle involved.</P>
    <P>I do not want to comment on Deputy Peadar Cowan's suggestion that he is an extreme socialist, that because he saw fit to accept this then all the Labour people in Ireland should immediately follow.  If his brand of socialism appeals to him we are quite prepared to leave it to him whether it is vanguard, rearguard or any other guard.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to discuss Deputy Peadar Cowan's socialism because I think it is non-existent now whatever it was in the past.  Tell me your company and I will tell you what you are.  Our opposition is based on principle.  We do not believe in merely giving lip service to the principle.  We hope that in regard to all sections of life, education, hospitalisation and everything else, there will be one law for all and that all, as wise citizens, will obey that law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made a remark on the Report Stage which, on reflection, I would like to modify or withdraw.  I suggested that the officials put this provision into the Bill and the Minister for Health automatically accepted it.  What I intended to say was that the attitude of officials to sections <Col N="1129" /> such as this has shown itself for a long number of years in previous Bills.  I admit that they are only doing their duty and that it is not their place to make revolutionary changes.  If that was taken as reflection on the officials concerned I would like to take this opportunity of withdrawing that and stating that I did not intend it in that manner.  It is not recognised as good policy to attack in any way people who are not here to defend themselves.  I want to make it clear that no personal reflection was intended.  What I wanted to convey was that the attitude of those who frame Bills is naturally a conservative one.  It is their duty to maintain established ideas and it is our duty to change that as we think proper.</P>
    <P>We feel that we have done good work in this Bill.  It is not a comprehensive Bill and we hope that the time is not far distant when it will be possible to introduce a Bill which will meet with the approval of all sections of the House.  I hope that when the Bill becomes law, the members of the medical profession whose duty it will be to implement it will give it their full co-operation.  Let us not have in case of any dispute between the Medical Association and the Minister, a situation in which the ordinary workers of this country will suffer. That would be regrettable.  Whatever disputes or arguments may arise, they can be settled but let me once again appeal to the parties concerned, to ensure that the people are not going to suffer as a result of any prolonged dispute there may be between these parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the patience he has displayed in the very difficult trial he has gone through in recent weeks.  I think Deputy Mulcahy has been unfair in suggesting that the Minister has bulldozed this measure through the House.  Quite honestly, I think that at times he would have been very well justified in trying to bulldoze the Bill through the House, and I admired his restraint in not doing so.  I think that politically and factually the charge is untrue because the records of the House will show <Col N="1130" /> that there was only one challenge to a vote.  Surely the Opposition have the right to challenge a vote if they wish.  There was, I think, only one vote on the Bill and it was I called that vote.  On the whole, there was no attempt to stop the Opposition from carrying out their ordinary function of criticising the Bill, of putting down amendments to the Bill or voting against the Bill.  So far as I can see the Labour Party, a number of Independent Deputies and to a certain extent the Clann na Poblachta, appeared to be on the side of the Bill. Consequently it is quite untrue for Deputy Mulcahy to say that the Minister bulldozed the Bill through the House, merely because it did not get the consent or the collaboration of the Fine Gael Party, who, in my view, spent their time, generally speaking &mdash;I think it is a fair charge&mdash;obstructing the Bill on behalf of vested medical interests, and the Medical Association.</P>
      <P>As to the suggestion that it is not right that the Bill should now go to the Seanad owing to the lateness of the year, the Seanad if they have any grievance can blame Deputy Mulcahy as being the person who directed most of the obstruction to the passage of the Bill through this House.  Quite honestly, from my short experience of seeing legislation carried through this House from the Department of Health, it has surprised me that there has been so much opposition to the simple proposition which is contained in part of this Bill, at any rate, and which has nothing to do with means tests or whether or not there should be means tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a phrase that is used in order to convey a certain impression in relation to health legislation in the country but the proposal in the Bill to which I refer is intended to ensure that no matter who a person is, no matter whether people are wealthy or are poor, they shall receive exactly the same treatment when they fall ill. That is the simple postulate which, so far as I am concerned, and I am sure so far as the Minister is concerned, was contained in this whole legislation. <Col N="1131" /> The idea of that was simply to provide equal opportunity for treatment in hospitals, in dispensaries and everywhere else for our patients&mdash;that when a person falls sick he or she should be treated according to the best medical advice and by the best health service available.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to realise after all that has been said here and a lot more that has been said outside, that that is the simple postulate, the simple principle at which we are aiming, at which certainly the Labour Party, the Minister and myself were aiming in trying to establish a no-means-test principle.  It was not from any doctrinaire, nomeans, socialist idea or anything else of that kind, that we supported these proposals.  The only consideration so far as I was concerned was that equal opportunity in our health services should be provided.  I am quite content, no matter what has been said here or elsewhere, that the seed of that idea is here in the maternity and child section of it.  There are two ways of proceeding&mdash;this way and the quicker way.  I do not mind which we go though, perhaps, I would prefer to go the faster way.  I am certain that under this Bill, in spite of any opposition, from whatever quarter it may come, there are those who will continue to work assiduously for the extension of the principle of equal opportunity in all our legislation but particularly in our health legislation. In so far as the Minister has so rigidly and valiantly, in my view&mdash;because few people know as well as I do from my own experience what he has had to put up with&mdash;fought for the Bill, we must congratulate him for his firm and rigid stand on the important principle he has included in the Bill.  That principle is retained.  It is from that principle there will spread out, through all our health legislation and I hope any other type of legislation, the ideal of so many people who have tried to make this a true democracy.  Consequently, I should like to congratulate the Minister for his firm stand in face of vested interests and to assure him that he will have in time, the full appreciation <Col N="1132" /> of the people of the country for his work in this legislation and in all the other social legislation for which he has been responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I am not able to extend to the Minister the same measure of congratulation as has been extended to him by Deputy Dr. Browne.  Frankly, I feel that in this debate all the advantages have been with the Minister.  Because of the limitation imposed by the Standing Orders of this House in respect to the imposition of charges on the public purse, a Minister bringing in a Bill of this type starts with a tremendous advantage, an advantage that the Minister for Health has enjoyed to the full throughout these discussions.  Consequently, the most basic parts of the Bill, those sections which, in fact, give the Bill its whole character have in the main not been subjected to the type of cut-thrust-and-parry debate which can only arise not merely on the basis of a general discussion of a section, but on the relative merits of the section as put down by the Minister and amendments tabled by somebody else other than the Minister.  For that reason, I feel, as I say, that the advantage has been with the Minister.  I grant that he has exercised a certain measure of patience.  On that aspect of the matter, it seems to me that in the course of the prolonged debate, the main contribution that has been made towards trying to improve the Bill, in all of its grave implications, has, in fact, come from the Labour Benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party, just as Labour or any other Party, is quite entitled to pursue any policy or tactics they consider best.  It does seem to me, however, that even from their own point of view it would have been much more effective, since they were so violently opposed to the principle of the Bill, had they fought it tooth and nail and utilised all the facilities at their disposal in this House to carry that particular tactic.  There were one or two occasions upon which we might have shaken the Minister a little more if we could have relied upon a few more votes.  But not only had the Minister the advantage of being relieved of pressure from certain quarters in which <Col N="1133" /> there was a fundamental change, but he also had the advantage of knowing that if any matter came to the test on division, even if Fine Gael were opposed to the Bill, they would afford him silence in so far as the Division Lobby was concerned.  That left the members of the Labour Party and Independent Deputies in a somewhat forlorn position in really utilising their votes to carry to the fullest extent the expression of the views they had implemented in the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not had a too unhappy time.  I can recollect other Ministers piloting Bills through this House who had a much more difficult time.  Indeed, it is regrettable that we have not been able to make things a little bit more difficult, not from the point of view of opposition but in the hope of improving the Bill still more. The Bill as it now leaves the House is not fundamentally very much different from what it was when it was first introduced. In respect of a number of points which it was possible to deal with on the basis of amendments, the Minister on a number of occasions sought to meet the points of view put forward.  To that extent the Bill has been tidied up and improved.</P>
    <P>I am in somewhat of a difficulty in following Deputy Dr. Browne in his search for the seed of this idea of equal opportunity in so far as medical needs are concerned.  If the seed is there it is buried very, very deep.  Of necessity it must be buried very deep so long as we try to operate under a system which denies equal opportunities not only in respect of health services but in respect of every other type of social service in a civilised community.  In our existing legislation we have enshrined this whole machinery of the means test and that of necessity operates, as we know only too well, to reverse the very idea with which we are concerned here, namely, equal opportunity.  Even where a citizen has got a statutory and a legal claim his poverty often denies him his rights.  It often denies him the treatment he should be accorded and nowwhere can we see that better than by going down and observing how an unemployed worker with a statutory claim to benefit under the Social <Col N="1134" /> Welfare Act is treated in our labour exchanges.  It is not his medical need or his social need that determines this attitude.  It is his poverty.  The position will be the same under this Bill because, whether we like it or not, we still have a poverty means test being applied and we still have a situation wherein those who are well equipped with the world's goods will get the preference.  Until we fundamentally change our attitude on social legislation that will continue.</P>
    <P>In so far as the Bill itself is concerned Deputy Kyne has made a plea, one that I think we will all support, that as the Bill is now far advanced in its progress towards the Statute Book, despite all its defects it still represents an advance in our health legislation.  It provides some improved services, however limited, which can be availed of in the interests of those people who require medical attention and medical services.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be the view of the medical profession in relation to the Bill, the most effective way in which the medical profession and all of us here who are concerned with the ultimate welfare of the ordinary people can show up the defects of the Bill is by making the fullest possible use of it.  If we do that we will very rapidly demonstrate that this Bill will have to come back before the House for a short period, and by the measure of our experience we will then be in a position to remedy the defects that appear in it in its present form.  The medical profession may be disinclined to follow that course or to accept any advice from us.  In the course of the Second Reading debate it was pointed out from these benches that, irrespective of views, as a professional organisation doctors have got not merely a medical duty to the people, but also a social duty.  However much they may dislike this legislation, this is still a democratic Assembly and, whatever may be our views and our decisions, whether they be right or whether they be wrong, they are still the decisions and the views of our people for the time being, and to that extent the medical profession, like any other large and important section of the <Col N="1135" /> community, must accept that point of view.  The best way in which to demonstrate the defects of the Bill, either from a social or a medical point of view, and to enlist the understanding and enlightened sympathy of the House and of citizens generally will be for the medical profession to operate the Bill in such a wholehearted fashion and in such complete form that they will rapidly prove the Bill requires further drastic amendment.  That will have to be done before much time passes.</P>
    <P>As the Bill leaves this House, those of us who have tried to improve it wish it well.  We hope it will be possible to make available the machinery, such as it is, provided under the Bill as quickly as possible.  We hope that that seed to which Deputy Dr. Browne has referred and which he seems to think is accepted and cherished by the Minister, namely, the seed of the idea of equal opportunity for all in relation to medical service needs and treatment will quickly germinate and grow a little stronger so that the next time we have health legislation here we will have a more enlightened, more Christian and more civilised approach to the problem, and will not be called upon to pass legislation which has in it this objectionable means test because, so long as we retain that in our legislation here, those who require effective and proper health services more than any other section of the community will be denied them merely because of their poverty: and poverty, whether we like it or not, is still the dividing line between many sections of our community.</P>

      <P>I think it is right that a few words should be said on this Bill before it leaves the House.  The Bill is an important Bill not only from the point of view of the provisions it contains, but also from the point of view of the approach made to the Bill and the mentality shown on the Bill. This Bill is an important and vital part of our social legislation and the majority of the Deputies support it as a progressive measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that it should be <Col N="1136" /> realised by the House, and by the country, that the Bill was strenuously opposed and strenuously fought by one of the major Parties in this House, the Fine Gael Party.  They opposed it on principle, on the principle of opposition to progressive measures.  I think that is important from the point of view of the country, and it is important from the point of view of the House.  It will be difficult, a little more difficult in the future, for the lamb to lie down with the Fine Gael wolf.</P>
    <P>There are means tests in this Bill. It is regrettable that there should be means tests in the Bill, but at least there is that seed of principle in the Bill to which Deputy Dr. Browne referred. It is well that we should have that expression of view from Deputy Dr. Browne, because he is the man who sacrificed himself on the principle of a no means test for our mothers and infants.  Speaking on this stage of this Health Bill, I feel proud to have stood with Deputy Dr. Browne on that issue. I feel more proud that my constituents supported me and supported him and supported those of us who went out in defiance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, but I say that I am proud of that.  I am proud of the support we got from our constituents when we stood for that issue.  Now, so far as any means test is concerned in this Bill, it is a small seed, but it will grow, and there is nothing going to stop it.  We have reached a certain distance.  The clamour and the appeal from every side of the House, as we go on from year to year, will be for improvements in this Bill, and for the bringing in of new sections.  I look on this Bill as a sort of bridgehead that has been secured.  We have got to advance from that first bridgehead, and advance we will.  The whole country will advance from that bridgehead, and the Minister, in securing that bridgehead, has assured progress in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been subjected to a terrific barrage of opposition: opposition from the medical profession, and opposition from the Fine Gael Party <Col N="1137" /> in this House, but it has been welcomed by the ordinary people, and it is welcomed by the ordinary people although I agree with what Deputy Larkin says, that there are defects in the Bill.  Those defects will be removed in the very near future.  I am confident of the future.  I have absolute confidence in the future.  I realise that this Bill gives us an opportunity to progress and advance, and I only hope that the pressure will come from what I may term all the progressive elements in the House on the Minister, such strong pressure that we will have an amending Bill in the near future which will advance us further towards the ideal of a free for all medical service for the entire people of this nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Dr. Esmonde Dr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The extensive discussions that we have had on this Bill definitely prove, I think, that it is impracticable. It was impracticable in the beginning, and all the amendments that have been introduced do not make it a practical Bill, We have maintained, and still maintain that, in this House.  We have always said, and we stick to it, that we wish to see improved medical services.  We feel that, as regards the maternity services, particularly for the middle income groups and some of the higher income groups, it is essential that they should be improved, but this Bill is not offering anything definite or tangible to the people.  We said in the beginning of these discussions that you would have too many queueing up for too few places.  The amendments introduced, and the discussions on the Bill, have brought it out that such is the position from beginning to end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies have stated that they would like to see a free for all&mdash;with no means tests whatever.  I do not object to them espousing those principles. We have to remember that, if you are going to have a free for all medical service, without a means test, somebody has to pay for it.  We have never had from the Minister, on any stage of the Bill, a statement indicating what it is going to cost.  In fact, he has been quite frank about it.  He says he does not know what it is going <Col N="1138" /> to cost.  Therein lies the weakness of the Bill.  No discussions have taken place with the parties who are going to implement it&mdash;with the medical profession. There have been no discussions with them other than discussions behind the scenes.  There have been no discussions with regard to the cost of the Bill, or as to the fees that are going to be paid to the doctors, or as to the implementation of the service.</P>
    <P>What seems to be standing out, right through all these discussions, is that the cost of the administration of these services is going to be enormous. There is no getting away from that. Where you introduce a medical service, and where the greater part of the finance is going to be used in the administration of the service, only proves what we have been arguing throughout when we told the people that this House is sending out a Bill purporting to offer them something which they are not going to get.  That is what we have been arguing from the beginning, and we stick to it. Therefore, when this Bill goes out of this House, it will not be long, as Deputy Larkin has very truly said, before there will be many amendments to it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

You are offering them a Bill which is of no great advantage to them.  The people throughout the country are puzzled.  They are puzzled in my constituency, which is the Minister's constituency, and they do not want this Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his courage in putting this Bill through the House. I suppose there was never so much political propaganda used against any Bill as there has been against this Bill.  There was continued obstruction here by the Fine Gael Party who after <Col N="1139" /> all the obstruction, never went into the Division Lobby to support any of their views.  There was intimidation on all sides used against the Minister on this Bill.  Every effort was made to direct and help the medical profession to object to working this Bill.  I suppose the delays and discussions of every little section of this Bill were unprecedented. There were three Fine Gael Deputies sitting over there and at times they did not know whose turn it was to get up and oppose a section and there was not another sinner of Fine Gael in the House.  There were discussions between the three of them as to whose turn it was to speak.  These were simply delaying tactics and obstruction.</P>
      <P>This Bill will give hope to many people who at present are afraid to go into hospital on account of the bills they would incur for hospital charges and doctors' fees.  They can now go in with an easy mind with the hope of being cured.</P>
      <P>I believe that ultimately this Bill will be a saving to the country. Already there are signs in Cork that T.B. is well in hand, that we are in a position to provide beds for our patients.  That is due to the Bill introduced by the Minister for Health, Dr. Ryan, in 1947, but I would say&mdash;and it is not because he is supporting this side of the House&mdash;it is due to a great extent to the energy of Deputy Dr. Browne, when Minister for Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this is really an extension of the 1947 Bill and I am pointing out all the good that was done by that Bill, despite the statements by other people.  I do not think any Cork Deputy of any Party would stand up here and talk on any Health Bill without offering that compliment to Deputy Dr. Browne.  His work in T.B. and in getting us thoracic specialists and orthopædic specialists will be remembered for many a year by the people of Cork.  I am looking forward to seeing just as great an improvement in the health of the people by means of this further extension of that Bill.  As I said before, even though there will be an expense for the time being, I think there will be an ultimate saving of life and money to the country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Larkin said here on Second Reading that the poor man was entitled to have his life saved as well as the rich man and, no matter what expense it would be to the country, expense should not count in the matter.  Deputy Costello said that he did not mind the expense at all; it was not the expense of the Bill that was worrying him at all; he would be prepared to give a lot more.  Then we had Deputy Dr. Esmonde and other people trying to tell us about the expense.</P>
      <P>We should do all we can to give the best health service possible to the people, especially the people that cannot afford it.  This Bill is heading in that direction.  Like Deputy Cowan and others, I believe there will be amendments to this Bill before very long.  The people will see the good that is in it.  I conclude by congratulating the Minister on his consistent defence of this Bill and on bringing it through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the somewhat worrying aspects of our democratic process is the complete self-confidence we seem to indulge in in this House when discussing any topic under the sun.  We all claim, apparently, to know everything that is to be known about every topic and to be omniscient about health services, the law, mineral development, industries, economics, <Col N="1141" /> banking and everything.  It is sometimes alarming that we should seem to have that degree of self-confidence.  It is a pity that we do not more often seek to have matters of this kind considered by committees.  Small Committees of the House representative of different Parties would at least have an opportunity of obtaining evidence and views from experts.  However, be that as it may, I think this Bill suffers from the main defect of having been introduced in the wrong type of atmosphere and not having received the objective consideration it should have received from different sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill, undoubtedly, is a step forward, a step forward that was needed for a long time but, I fear, a step forward that falls very far short of the step forward that could have been taken had we considered this whole question in a different atmosphere and more objectively.</P>
      <P>I do not propose at this stage to try to review the Bill in any detail.  I would like to urge one or two considerations on the Minister.  The principal one I want to urge upon him is&mdash; and this, I think goes to a certain extent to the fundamental error that seems to lie in the approach to our health services&mdash;this Bill is not worth the paper it is written on unless and until we provide the necessary accommodation and machinery to implement it.  I know of one case at the moment, a county hospital, County Cavan, where there are 120 surgical cases waiting for admission.  No Bill, no paper scheme, no speeches in this House will remedy that position.  The only thing that will remedy that position is the building of a hospital there.  The only thing that can deal with the overcrowding in our city hospitals at the moment is the building of additional hospitals, the provision of an adequate number of beds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think one of the errors of this Bill is that we are laying out on paper a grandiose scheme without having made available the physical facilities that will be necessary to implement any scheme.  At the moment we know that the maternity hospitals in the City of Dublin are completely inadequate, overcrowded.  How will this Bill remedy <Col N="1142" /> that position?  There is not one section in this Bill that enables the Government to build one more hospital or provide one more bed.  So that I should like to avail of the occasion to appeal to the Minister to concentrate in the first instance on ensuring that the physical requirements for the implementation of any health scheme are made available and that depends on the provision of money.  It is the Minister's responsibility, if he is to implement this Bill seriously, to ensure that a sufficiency of money will be made available for the provision of hospitals.  In many cases hospitals were planned as long as 15 years ago and have not been built yet, although the necessity for their provision is admitted by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that we have not been given any clear estimate of how much this Bill will cost to administer. I do not want to misquote the Minister, but I think that, tentatively, he mentioned a figure of £2,000,000.  I think he mentioned it with a good deal of reserve, probably realising that it would cost a good deal more.  One of the things which puzzles me about this Bill generally is that on going through it I do not see anything upon which the £2,000,000, £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 which it is going to cost to administer is to be spent other than by payments to doctors and civil servants.  This Bill does not contain any provision for the spending of money on hospitals.  It does contain provisions for payment for medicines, but that will be a very small percentage, I would say, of the total amount involved.  It also contains provisions for the payment of maternity benefits, which again will be a small percentage of the total amount. It also includes provisions for the payment of maintenance in hospitals, which would be a more substantial amount.  But I am willing to make this bet, that if this Bill costs £4,000,000 to administer, £2,000,000 of that will be spent on salaries and fees either to additional officials or to the medical profession.  If we are in a position to spend that amount of money, I would prefer to see that amount of money spent at first on the provision of hospitals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> The only principle involved, in my view, as regards medical services is to ensure that no persons, whether they have or have not money, will be deprived of the best medical services that we can make available, that no question of cost, no question of lack of means should prevent any citizen of the State from obtaining the best treatment possible.  To my mind, that is the only principle involved.  I think it is only a purely functional problem as to how you will achieve that.  You can only achieve that by making available the necessary facilities.</P>
    <P>I think we have been wasting a good deal of time and doing a good deal of damage to the whole concept of health services by engaging in many theoretical arguments which have little or no application to the realities of the problem with which we have to deal.  However, the Bill does contain some steps in the right direction and to that extent I welcome it.  I am sorry that it was not conceived in a better atmosphere. I am sorry it is not a better Bill.  I am sorry that we have started in this controversial way instead of doing the thing in the proper way by the provision of the necessary hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Kyne should have thought I made any attack on the Labour Party.  I certainly did not mean to.  I am very sorry if I said anything to offend Deputy Kyne because I did not mean to do any such thing.  Deputy Kyne has been a very straightforward debater in this House and he certainly never said anything personally offensive as far as I am concerned. If I said anything which he has taken up and which I did not mean, I am sorry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kyne, Deputy Larkin and other Deputies expressed the opinion that the Bill is by no means perfect. I am not including Fine Gael in that, because they have a different view of it.  I am speaking of Deputies who are genuinely anxious to make this a good Bill.  I agree, of course, that it is not a perfect Bill.  I do not think that any Minister could ever claim that he produced a perfect instrument here. <Col N="1144" /> But as far as some of the provisions in this Bill go, I think they are as good as we can afford at the moment financially.  Even if Deputy Larkin was in my place, I do not think he could implement a Bill which would go very much further.  I would say that for three or four years to come it will be as much as the local authorities can do to implement this Bill.  Deputy Larkin says he wants to see this Bill implemented to the full because it will show its defects.  He is probably right there and I am with him in that.  Then after three or four years we can see what the defects are and it will be possible for the Dáil to improve matters at that stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan and Deputy Dr. Browne expressed themselves as pleased that the Bill has gone through and also expressed themselves much on the lines of Deputy Larkin, that it is by no means a perfect instrument. They have given me their blessing for the future implementation of the Bill for which I am very grateful.  Deputy MacBride said that it was a step forward, but a step very much short of what is required.  I do not know what Deputy MacBride may have in mind, but I think that he is unaware of the division of functions under my Department as between hospital building and the implementation of these health schemes, because it would be altogether out of line with the general procedure to provide for hospital building in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Estimate for my Department this year of £4,500,000 for hospital building.  As well as that, it is expected that we may get over £1,000,000 from the sweepstakes fund.  That amounts to £5,500,000, which is a very big sum indeed for hospital building.  That is part of the £37,000,000 programme of hospital building which was started by my predecessor in 1948.</P>
    <P>I do not think we would be right in waiting to have hospitals before we do anything in the way of improving our services.  I am sure that if Deputy MacBride put it up to me to improve the services and I said I must wait until the hospitals are improved he would be the first to attack me and <Col N="1145" /> say that we should provide the services at the same time.  Now, it is the easiest thing in the world to make a case like that&mdash;build the hospitals first and then produce the services.  The same thing could be said about T.B. The T.B. business was tackled, but the sanatoria are not even built yet. But although the sanatoria are not even built yet, in the last month of June&mdash;for the first time, I think I might say&mdash;the waiting list is practically gone.  I do not want to be contradicted on that because any Deputy here might make inquiries from his own local authority and find that there are seven or eight or even 17 waiting, but I am saying that to all intents and purposes, the waiting list is gone.  If we had waited on T.B., and said we will tackle T.B. when the sanatoria are built&mdash;that is to say we would tackle it next year&mdash; then that waiting list would not be gone, perhaps, for the next ten years. It is ridiculous to say you must build the hospitals first and then produce the services.  It is only a thing that an Opposition man would say when he wants to find fault with the scheme and he could not say that for any other reason except to find fault.</P>
    <P>We are going on with this scheme. Again, what does Deputy MacBride think?  Take the man in the lower income group for whom we are going to provide free treatment.  He is not going to go to hospital unless there is some reason for it.  Suppose it is something like hernia that can wait for a while.  We produce this service and say to him: &ldquo;You are entitled to come in and get that dealt with in the county hospital.  You can get free treatment because your valuation is under £50, but you may have to wait a few weeks&rdquo;.  Is it better to do that now, even if he has to wait a few weeks to get in or should we adopt what Deputy MacBride says, and wait for ten years and then say to the man: &ldquo;Now go, and get your hernia dealt with&rdquo;?  Is it not better to go on now; is it not better to take a chance?</P>
    <P>Take the woman who is going to have a baby.  She cannot wait for ten years.</P>

In the most hospitalised countries in Europe, such as Denmark and Sweden and those other countries that we read about in the papers and that Deputy MacBride would quote at us, there are not any more maternity beds per head of the population than we have here and we are going to provide more.  Let Deputy MacBride have a little pride in his own country and let us try to remember that we are not so far behind those other countries at all.</P>

      <P>If we can provide in the hospitals for the women that must go to hospitals, either for the reason that their condition necessitates hospital treatment, or that their homes are not fit places to have babies, well and good, but let the women who have good homes, whose cases are normal cases&mdash;and that is 97 per cent.  of them&mdash;let them have their babies at home.</P>
      <P>I think on the whole, that we are doing much better in this way and I am quite sure that if we had adopted another attitude we might possibly have an attack from Deputy MacBride.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, as I said, has no provision, of course, for hospital building.  That is provided elsewhere.  It is quite true that I have given an estimate here that this Bill would possibly cost about £2,000,000 a year to implement, half of that to be met by the local authorities and half being contributed by the Department of Health.  It must be remembered what I said before.  I want this on record because I may have to quote it when unscrupulous T.D.s get up in five years' time and say: &ldquo;You said it would cost £2,000,000.&rdquo; There is a lot of expenditure yet to be incurred under present legislation apart from this altogether, so I am not saying the whole additional cost of health is going to be limited to £2,000,000.  So <Col N="1147" /> far as this Bill is concerned, it is going to be limited to £2,000,000.  That will all go on either maintenance in hospitals&mdash;there are two big items&mdash;maintenance in hospitals or provision of services, whether doctors or nurses, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, perhaps so.  Some Deputies say it is nearly all going into administration, and if you count medical staff, a lot of it will go into administration, but not on administration as we usually mean it in the Department of Health&mdash;or on local administration, that is, lay administration.</P>
      <P>Of course, Deputies opposite have painted a picture of the county manager and his staff losing time reading the medical records.  I do not think that is going to happen.  The staff will not be increased to any great extent. Deputy Esmonde said I did not tell him what the cost was going to be. I did, but I might as well be idle. When the Opposition Deputies go down the country&mdash;I read the papers &mdash;they put terror into the people, and they have the life frightened out of the people down the country about what this is going to cost.  If Fine Gael were anxiously looking for the figure and then going to go down the country and be very scrupulous and say: &ldquo;The Minister told us that this Bill is going to cost so much&rdquo;, and not exaggerate it, it would be all right.  But I suppose I cannot expect that from Fine Gael.  Then they say it is unworkable, that it is a fraud, and that it is against the teaching of the Catholic Church and all sorts of things that they have learned I do not know where.  They tell these things to the people all over the country and I suppose they consider it good politics.  Well, if they think that, I do not object.  I suppose it is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy said they had put down an amendment on the Second Reading which I did not accept and that it had led to a lot of trouble.  I did not accept that amendment&mdash;I may have been wrong or oversuspicious&mdash; because I looked on it as a political <Col N="1148" /> move.  It was the type of amendment that was patently drafted to try to bring the Labour Party and Clann na Talmham all in on the one wing. Naturally, I said we are not going to adopt that.  It did not altogether condemn the Bill, because if they did that then the Labour Party could not vote with them, but it was a device to have the Bill referred back for further consideration. However, it did not come off.  When it was put, Fine Gael voted and the others did not vote with them. Fine Gael said &ldquo;No&rdquo;, but nobody appeared to hear them at the time, not even the Official Reporter.</P>

      <P>The Official Report says that it was agreed.  Then Deputy Mulcahy said here this evening that I bulldozed this through the Dáil without giving an opportunity for discussion on the Bill itself.  I suppose a bulldozer is fairly slow-moving and we certainly took our time on this Bill, but it is rather funny to say we did not give much time for discussion.  I do not think any Bill in the history of this House ever lasted so long in Committee. The object of the Committee Stage is to give Deputies an opportunity of talking on every detail of the Bill, but Fine Gael did not confine themselves to the Bill.  They mostly talked on what was not there and in that sense Deputy Mulcahy may be right.  Deputy McGilligan spent two days alleging suppression by the Government of a document from the Hierarchy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy took about four days to vilify the county managers.  I suppose there are several other things I could mention, but certainly they were not things in the Bill.  The Committee Stage was spent in that way.  Deputy Mulcahy deplored the fact that I had not got agreement with the Irish Medical Association.  I met the Irish Medical Association.  They said that they would not co-operate.  What was I to do?  Would any Deputy on the Opposition side of the House&mdash;even Deputy Esmonde, who is a member of the Irish Medical Association&mdash;say now <Col N="1149" /> that a Minister for Health, no matter what Party he belonged to, who was told by the Irish Medical Association that they would not work the scheme or co-operate with it, should say: &ldquo;All right, boys.  I will bring in a Bill with which you will co-operate&rdquo;.  Was I to do that?  Was I to let this Legislature down by caving in to the Irish Medical Association and saying: &ldquo;If you will not work this scheme I will bring in one which you will work&rdquo;.  I know that Deputy J.A. Costello got round that by telling the Irish Medical Association to produce their own scheme. When I came into office I found these men in possession in the Custom House.  I told them to get out and I said that it was not their job but my job.  Of course, I said it very politely. I thanked them for their services, and so forth.  I do not think it was their job to produce a medical scheme because they have their own point of view about these things and I suppose we have our own point of view, too. Anyway, the Irish Medical Association have adopted the attitude of non-cooperation, all through.  It has been the same with Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Neither the Irish Medical Association nor Fine Gael have given the slightest help so far as this Bill is concerned. There may be defects in the Bill.  I quite admit that there are brains in the Fine Gael Party, and that there are brains in the Irish Medical Association that might possibly see defects in that Bill which I have not seen.  But, all through, I did not get the benefit of those brains either in the Fine Gael Party or in the Irish Medical Association. If there are defects in the Bill that the Irish Medical Association and Fine Gael can see, it is their own fault if they have not pointed them out to me.  They have not pointed out defects; they have only maintained the attitude that they are against the Bill in principle and that they will not co-operate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy says that I sort of threatened the voluntary hospitals.  I did not.  I remember the incident very well.  It was put to me by certain medical men who were talking to me on the subject of this Bill that if the voluntary <Col N="1150" /> hospitals did not co-operate with the local authority, what would they do: would they get no cases?  I said that I supposed not.  Then I was asked what would the voluntary hospitals do, and I said that I did not know what they could do if they got no cases except to close down.  The report of that conversation appeared in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> as a threat to the voluntary hospitals.  It was a mere statement of opinion on my part Can anybody contradict me when I say that?  If the voluntary hospitals refuse to co-operate and will not take patients from the local authority they will have no patients in their wards and then what can they do but close down?  What can I do about it?  But, because I gave that answer truthfully, as my opinion, I was accused in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i>&mdash;and the accusation was quoted here to-night by Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;of threatening the voluntary hospitals.  I am not threatening the voluntary hospitals.  I hope they will work this Bill, and I will do everything I can to get them to work it.  Surely, however, we are not going to be dictated to here either by the Irish Medical Association or by the voluntary hospitals or, indeed, by Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>We will go on and do what the country wants us to do.  It is quite obvious what the country wants in this case, because the great majority of the members of this House want the Bill. I am sure that some members of the Labour Party and some members of the Fine Gael Party and, indeed, some members of my own Party might like a better Bill.  So would I, if it were possible.  A big majority of this House are for this Bill and, therefore, we may assume that a big majority of the community want the Bill.  Why should we be dictated to by any section&mdash; either by the doctors, the voluntary hospitals, Fine Gael or anybody else?</P>

      <P>I am sure they will.  This Bill has had a peculiar history.  The Second Reading went through with very little discussion and no audible opposition.  Then the Committee Stage <Col N="1151" /> took days and days and days of the most merciless obstruction from Fine Gael.  The Fourth Stage went through to-day fairly easily and the Fifth Stage is now going through fairly well.  I hope that Fine Gael will raise their protests now.  I hope that, even now, on the Fifth Stage, they will make their position clear, so that in a month's time we shall not have them telling us that they said: &ldquo;No&rdquo; when the question was put or&mdash;above all&mdash; saying in two years' time, when the <Col N="1152" /> Bill is a success: &ldquo;We did not oppose the Health Bill&rdquo;.  For goodness' sake, let us know now, one way or another, how Fine Gael stand in relation to this Health Bill.  Do not say &ldquo;No&rdquo; behind your hand so that we will not know whether or not you are for the Bill.  Make your position clear now. If you do not vote against the Bill I will say that the Bill went through unanimously&mdash;and do not contradict that statement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Personally, in discussing this Estimate, I like to be able to help the Minister for Agriculture as much as possible, because I know that a Minister for Agriculture in this or any other Government has a difficult time, because he has to look after the agricultural interest against the urban interest in the Cabinet, and the difficulties of the Minister are thus greatly increased.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the trade agreement.  He has also done good work in extending the A.I. services in various parts of the country and he has provided extra grain storage, which is important; but I have a number of criticisms to make of the Minister's handling of his Department during the past 12 months. The Minister handled the milk situation last January very badly indeed.  I think that milk stoppage was brought about largely because of a letter sent by the Minister, giving the impression that he was not going to consider any demands by the milk producers until May of this year.  That letter was sent to various associations and it had the effect of bringing about the milk stoppage at the time it occurred.  The way in which it was handled afterwards was no credit to the Minister either.</P>
      <P>It is a very extraordinary thing that when the farmers, because they received a stupid letter from the Department, attempt to do a bit of peaceful picketing, they are sent off in droves to Mountjoy and given hard labour, while, on the other hand, we have gentlemen in this city to-day adopting Communist tactics, sitting down in the streets and holding up traffic, and then being treated in a completely different manner from the way in which decent farmers trying to make a dignified protest in a very peaceful manner are treated.  I criticise the Minister and the Government for their action in that manner and for the way in which they handled it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is also sticking on to the old idea of the dual purpose cow and the Live Stock Breeding Act.  So <Col N="1155" /> long as he does that, we will not have increased milk production.  The Minister is also, through Eggsports Ltd., putting a heavy tax on all dead hens exported from this country.  I asked the Minister recently the price which Eggsports Ltd. were paying for hens and the Minister said it was 1/- per lb.  On the same day, I asked a question of the Taoiseach as to the f.o.b. export value per lb. of old dead poultry exported and his reply was that in the past three or four months it averaged from 2/6 to ? per lb., but the producer of these hens gets from Eggsports Ltd. 1/- per lb. and the balance is taken as a levy by Eggsports Ltd. about which the Minister pretends to know nothing.  That is a bad policy and a bad system because the person who has the old hens for sale is the ordinary egg producer throughout the country and if you take 1/- or ½ per lb. off these old hens, it is 6/- or 8/- on every old hen and represents a considerable reduction in the price of eggs, if you equate it with the 6/- or 8/- deducted from the price of the old hen on the average yearly production of a hen. It is a hidden form of taxation which is affecting the farmer, the cottier and everybody trying to maintain the poultry industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very difficult in his replies to questions regarding the price of feeding barley.  He has been asked on numerous occasions to fix the price of feeding barley, and if he said he would or would not, we would know where we were, but he will not say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and he will not say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  On the 4th March last, in reply to a question by Deputy Esmonde, he said it was not proposed to fix a price for feeding barley of the 1953 crop.  Deputy Esmonde asked: &ldquo;Am I right in assuming that there will be no fixed price for feeding barley this year as there was last year?&rdquo; To which the Minister replied: &ldquo;The Deputy has no right to assume that&rdquo;. I think I understand the English language, but I do not understand that reply.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Minister should take adequate steps to see that barley going into the mills, as it is <Col N="1156" /> going into the mills in Cork at the moment, is bought at a reasonable price.  Last year, before the price was fixed, the price offered by the millers in Cork for barley was very low.  The Minister seems to be under the impression that cheques were issued to the suppliers of that barley to bring their price up to the fixed price afterwards, but I have a large number of cases in which no such refunds were made.  A number of mills bought this barley cheaply before the price was fixed last year, when the farmer had to get rid of it.  The farmer had cut it with a combine, and, having no storage facilities, had to take it to the mills where he had to sell it for what he could get for it.  He did not get any cheque to make up the difference between the price he got and the fixed price.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that the producer is not exploited.  In arranging a price for barley consideration should be had to the increased cost of production that occurred this year as against last year.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Minister's attitude towards the Faculties of Agriculture and Dairy Science in the universities.  I understand that the Minister has communicated with the universities and practically ordered them to throw those two faculties out of the universities.  It is intended to place those faculties under some form of State institute.  It is suggested, I think, that this State institute should have some sort of external association with the universities in the form of a recognised college.  Nevertheless, it is throwing the Faculties of Agriculture and Dairy Science out of the universities when the tendency all over the world is to bring agricultural education and agricultural scientific investigation under the control of universities and independent authorities as distinct from State or semi-State controlled bodies.  Marshall Aid will not in any way compensate for the loss of our independence in regard to agricultural education and agricultural scientific investigation by passing them over to a State or semi-State body.

      <P>I have here a quotation from the <i>Evening Herald</i> of the 20th of November last in which it is stated that there was a gentleman named Mr. Crawford Scott caught smuggling raw hides across the Border.

      <P>On the other hand, we have the Minister for Industry and Commerce going down to a firm of tanners appropriately named Plunder and Pollok.  The Minister said that he had discussed this matter of warble flies in hides with the Minister for Agriculture.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the warble fly could be eliminated with the co-operation of the farming interests in all areas.  The farmers have not the slightest intention of co-operating with Deputy Lemass, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, with Plunder and Pollok or with the Minister for Agriculture if they are going to be compelled to sell their hides at an artificially depressed price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point I wanted to mention was one in relation to the duties on fertilisers.  I think the Minister is wasting a good deal of money in putting large advertisements in the newspapers telling the farmers that their lands are starved for phosphates while at the same time he puts <Col N="1159" /> a duty of 20 per cent. on superphosphate, ground phosphates and other manufactured phosphates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That is wrong.  There is not any duty on ground phosphates. There is no duty on basic slag, manures or nitrogen.  There is no duty on compounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is 20 per cent. on superphosphate of lime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Single my foot! There is a tariff of 20 per cent. levied on superphosphate.  You will not be let take it off.  You are kicked about like an old shoe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Granulated phosphate was wanted this year and it was only late in the season that sufficient quantities could be got.  If the Minister wants to encourage the use of fertilisers he should take all the restrictions off the fertilisers and encourage farmers to put them out as plentiful and as often as possible.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of credit, it seems to me to be fairly generally accepted that the farmers are rolling in wealth and that the banks are bulging with their deposits.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  Practically every farmer is suffering from lack of credit facilities, and the credit facilities provided by the Agricultural Credit Corporation do not seem to fill the want that exists at all.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation will give facilities to a person who can get all the facilities he wants from the joint stock banks.  I think the Minister should consider this question of credit and devise some simple way of extending short-term credit at cheap rates for special purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sugar Company, I think, operated a scheme of that kind very successfully by supplying manures against the beet crop.  I think that in itself has had the effect of increasing the yields of the beet crop and also increasing the <Col N="1160" /> acreage.  If a scheme similar to that could be extended to some other lines it would have the advantage of increasing production in many spheres.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Collins was speaking a while ago, the Minister said that on the Milk Costings Committee the producers had a majority.  As far as I know, there are nine people on that committee&mdash;one is the chairman; there is a representative of the Department of Agriculture and a representative of the statistics office; there are two representatives of the Prices Advisory Body. I do not think any of those five could be described as a producer; and that leaves only four.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>You have no reason to assume they are opposed to the milk producers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>No; but what the Minister said was that the producers had a majority.  Is Professor Smiddy a producer? Are the two representatives of the Prices Advisory Body milk producers? Is the representative of the Department a milk producer?  Is Professor McCarthy a milk producer?  The Minister spoke of a majority.  I have named five out of the nine.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the producers had a majority.  I can count five out of the nine who are not milk producers and I find it difficult to understand the Minister's statement.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made also to the proposed alteration in the agricultural grant.  The Minister probably noticed from the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance that he was of the opinion that taxation lay lightly on the land.  I can assure the Minister that the land is paying all sorts of direct and indirect taxation.  He should do everything possible to see that the Government does not inflict any further burdens on the land, as any further burdens on the agricultural industry would have the effect of reducing production. If the Minister wants to increase production, he should do everything in his power to encourage the Government to give as much relief as possible to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> We find the Taoiseach starting on a campaign to give relief to industry and business.  He has announced relief from rates on new buildings.  Something similar should apply to agriculture and if the Minister wants increased production he will have to bring it about by some such means.</P>
    <P>These are the few points I wanted to make and I appeal to the Minister to consider them.  I hope that on some occasion I will be able to come into the House on the Vote for Agriculture and be all one with the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder will I be forgiven if I confront the House once more with the question of agricultural labourers.  I am prompted to do this by the memory of a statement made, it must be two years ago now, by the present Minister for Agriculture when he had achieved office in this House. Speaking to some of his own constituents in Kilkenny, most of whom I assume were agricultural workers, he assured them that he would put them in the position that they would be happy and contented in their lives and with their conditions of work and he would also secure for them a rate of wages which would be 10/- in excess of the weekly wage paid to unskilled building trade workers.  I took occasion shortly after that to ask the Minister when he proposed putting that promise into effect.  I reminded him that in County Dublin&mdash;the constituency which I have the honour to represent and which is represented also by the Minister's colleague, Deputy Burke, and by Deputy Rooney &mdash;that would mean that agricultural labourers would be paid £7 10s. per week.  That promise was made, but apparently its implementation remains in abeyance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to many Deputies on Estimates for Agriculture and I have noticed that references to agricultural labourers have been few and far between. I wonder if farmer Deputies, or those who come from predominantly farming areas, recognise the importance of agricultural work.  Apart from election time when they seek their votes, do they recognise, in between <Col N="1162" /> elections, how important these men are to the welfare of Irish agriculture?  I often doubt it.  It is true that, to use a hackneyed phrase, agriculture is our main industry; if the farmer is not prosperous, the country cannot be said to be prosperous.  Yet, how little thought is given to the vast body of people who number over 100,000 wage workers on the land?  How little thought is given in this House, which is supposedly representative of the entire nation, to the welfare of this group of people?  The remarks which I wish to make, as in other years, will be devoted to their plight.</P>
    <P>I think the efforts of the present Minister for Agriculture have been entirely inadequate&mdash;I charge the same to his predecessor&mdash;if they have been made at all, to improve the lot of the agricultural labourer.  If you examine the history of the departure of agricultural workers from the land and the influx of those workers into the towns and big cities over the past 20 or 25 years, you will find that there has been a decimation of agricultural workers over that period.  The agricultural labourers, particularly the younger ones, are flying as fast as they can go into the cities and towns.  That has been deplored time out of number by the sociologists, by members of this House, by Ministers of State, by all people who take an interest in the welfare of our people; but little or nothing has been done about it.</P>
    <P>It can be reasonably said that, by and large, compared with 15 or 20 years ago, the farmers&mdash;I refer to those who live as a class on reasonably big farms &mdash;are doing relatively well at the present time.  They owe more to those whom they employ than they are giving them.  I do not think that those whom they employ are getting a very full reward for the amount of work they are doing on behalf of their employers.</P>
    <P>In this matter the Minister for Agriculture who was elected by this Dáil has a duty, not alone to serve those who own land but also to serve those who work for wages on the land.  I have not yet seen any evidence that the present Minister is extremely or exceptionally anxious to serve this particular <Col N="1163" /> group of people.  The whole history of the fight for the land of this country, which goes back, as we know, to the days of Davitt and before him, to Fintan Lalor, to Parnell and the Plan of Campaign and down through the years until we finally achieved what some described as independence, has been one of dependence on the part of the farmer upon the agricultural worker for help to win for him economic independence and what I refer to as the three Fs.  The agricultural worker has been ill-repaid for the work and the effort he has put in on behalf of his employers over that long period of struggle.</P>
    <P>I want to know from the Minister&mdash; and I would ask him to refer to it in his reply not in any manner of escaping or trying to escape the responsibility of office or in any manner of seeking votes in any election that may be imminent&mdash;what plans he has to lift the agricultural worker of this country from his present lowly position, and lowly it is.  Everybody is complaining about the size of the population in Dublin, about the fact that every day that goes by we have thousands of young men coming into this city from the land, farmers' sons, agricultural labourers and the sons of agricultural labourers, seeking out the lodging houses, finding rooms in tenements, working on buildings where they can get work and finally winding up on the labour exchange or possibly sitting on O'Connell Bridge.</P>
    <P>Nobody seems to have come forward yet with any great policy as to how that development can be ended.  It is quite a common experiencs for all of us to travel from, say, Dublin to Galway or Dublin to Cork.  If you go in the early morning train from here to Cork or from here to Galway, along the main roads, you will seldom see any more than half a dozen or a dozen people on the land.  The Minister has a very grave responsibility in this regard.  I want to ask him what he proposes to do about it?  No policy of expediency and no foolish promises such as those he made two years ago will bring about a solution.  There must be a <Col N="1164" /> long-term view taken and there must be a definite plan laid down whereby those engaged in Irish agriculture and particularly those whom I have the honour to represent, agricultural labourers, will be encouraged to stay where they are.</P>
    <P>The main factor in the lives of most people is an economic factor.  No matter how much people love their country&mdash;and Irish people are said to love their country very dearly&mdash;unless they can live in it in reasonable comfort they must go somewhere else. Every day that goes by we see these workers travelling away to factories in Coventry, Birmingham, London and elsewhere and being lost for ever.  If they come back they have a new outlook on life and it is impossible to retain them here.  That is due entirely to the fact that although they have been propagandised by political Parties for 30 years or followed different political banners and although many of them have gone out of their way to work and fight to secure the election of different political Parties, at the end of all, in spite of all their efforts, they have been forced to leave the land, go to Dublin, the half-way house until they eventually end up working for some big combine in England and probably worse off than they were at the beginning.</P>
    <P>What has the Minister to say on these things?  What solution has he for that?  Apart entirely from putting Irish agriculture in a better position than it is, the Minister should take steps to see that such prosperity as Irish agriculture has developed over the last few years will benefit the workers on the land.  No matter what may be said by Fianna Fáil, there is no doubt that the late Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, did bring a degree of prosperity to Irish agriculture.</P>

      <P>That prosperity has been developed and has been continuing, but it is for those who own land. It has not been continued for those who work on the land.  On the one hand, we see high prices for those who <Col N="1165" /> produce different products on the land; on the other hand, if the agricultural labourer gets 2/6, 3/- or 4/- of a rise in the week, there is a cry to high Heaven, and we are told that revolution is imminent, that the end and the collapse of the agricultural industry is at hand.  The Minister has a duty and the Dáil has a duty to force the hand of the Minister to see that the farm workers&mdash;who have latterly won such minimum rights as a weekly half-holiday through the efforts entirely of this Party which we in these benches represent, and also one week's holiday&mdash; are given a fair way of living and that they are not to be kept, as they are now being kept, in a position of economic subjection which eventuates in their being forced to get away entirely from the land upon which they were naturally born to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the Agricultural Wages Board, this board which masquerades as a tribunal to determine the minimum wages and conditions of agricultural labourers.  Is it not time that some steps were taken to reconstitute this board?  Is it not time that the Minister examined in detail the <i>bona fides</i> of the members of this body?  It may interest the House to hear that this board has a very peculiar history. The method by which members are appointed to the Agricultural Wages Board is, to say the least of it, bizarre. I recall some years ago, before the inter-Party Government was returned to power, we had on the regional committee catering for the Dublin and Leinster Counties generally, representing the 10,000 wage workers on the land of County Dublin a gentleman who was a political nominee.  For the three years during which he was alleged to represent the agricultural workers of County Dublin he was working in a factory in Coventry&mdash;never attended a meeting, never expressed any view as to what were the rights or the responsibilities of the wages board in relation to farm labourers.  Yet that gentleman was reappointed when the time came, as representing agricultural workers.  I am quite sure that is a matter of little moment to many members of this House but it is of very great moment <Col N="1166" /> to the farm workers of my constituency and many thousands of them throughout the country because outside of Counties Dublin, Meath and Wicklow, where their working conditions and wages are determined as a result of negotiations between the trade union representing farm labourers and the employers, the living conditions of agricultural workers, their wages and the standard of life they are going to have, is determined by this body known as the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also a direct function in this matter.  I have on other occasions appealed to him and to his predecessor to review the whole position in relation to the wages board&mdash; to consider for a few moments, not how high he is going to put prices for farmers or how he is going to fit agricultural policy and trim his sails to suit Cabinet decisions and strategy, but to think in terms of humanitarianism of these men who, with their families, constitute the backbone of this country. I have often heard apologists for the Fianna Fáil Party, and other Parties too, at various times outside chapel gates appealing for the votes of farm labourers, telling them how much they admire them and what great men they were, particularly during the war years.  They were the men in the gap then.  They were in the front line of our country's defence.  They were saving us from disaster but, unfortunately, when it came to the turn of many of these public representatives, whether they were members of county committees of agriculture or members of the Dáil, to do something for these farm labourers, they seemed to have forgotten all about it.</P>
    <P>There was a motion in this House, shortly after the present Dáil assembled, to provide a minimum wage of £4 per week for farm workers, and it was defeated by an overwhelming majority.  Does that show any evidence of good faith on the part of Deputies generally in making these remarks?  I do not confine that to the Government side.  I think these remarks embrace all sides with exceptions, of course, on every side.  Is it fair to these men that they should be treated in such a fashion, that they should be made political pawns at election times to secure <Col N="1167" /> political ends or to secure that this Party or that Party would get on top? It may seem a legitimate political manoeuvre but, to my mind, it is immoral, it is wrong, it is unjust and it is completely against the current of tradition in this country.</P>
    <P>I feel that, if we are to stem in any degree the flight from the land, we must decide upon a fair balance as between those who employ labour and those who are employed.  Of course, it is an accepted fact that this question is largely determined by political considerations. It is true that for every wage earner on the land there are four persons who either own land or have a direct or indirect interest in owning land.  The figures are approximately 600,000 owners and their families and 100,000 to 150,000 wage earners. Thereby hangs the whole story.  Political Parties playing for votes seek to placate the farmers and are not very much interested in those who are in the minority.  While that may appear, as I say, to Parties and the people who govern Parties, as good politics, it is not just or right, and somebody must take it upon himself to raise his voice against it.</P>
    <P>In my area of County Dublin we have an intensively cultivated agricultural district.  I think it can be fairly said that we have some, indeed many, of the most efficient farmers in Ireland. These farmers have admitted many times, in consultation with the trade union representing workers that, so far as they are concerned, they acknowledge the fact that they have some, indeed many, of the ablest agricultural labourers.  If we can secure in some degree in the principal county of this country a balance between the agricultural employer and the agricultural labourer, surely it is possible to secure that balance elsewhere throughout the country.  I do not suggest that agricultural labourers in County Dublin are adequately paid; the farmers in my constituency know very well my opinions in that matter.  I think they are badly paid.  I think the farm labourers in County Dublin, being, as they are, skilled operatives, are entitled to much more than even the <Col N="1168" /> Minister promised them two years ago and which he failed to give them&mdash;10/-more than the building trade worker. The agricultural worker, unlike the unskilled labourer who has to work with pick and shovel and whose only asset consists of the strength he can command, is a skilled man, a highly skilled man.  The agricultural labourer is learning all his life, but the return which he is getting for his skill is deplorable. I think it is a scandal and a reflection on the capacity of Governments which have been in control of this country.</P>
    <P>I do not assume for a moment that the remarks which I am making, and which I have made over a number of years in this House, will have any great effect.  I recognise as well as other Deputies that in political life these other considerations to which I have referred&mdash;the considerations of the big vote, the desirability of winning elections, the need for getting power&mdash; override, as far as political Parties generally are concerned, humanitarianism and human feelings.  Is it not scandalous that that consideration of political power should result in vast masses of our people&mdash;I do not think it incorrect to describe over 100,000 workers on our land as vast masses in this island of ours&mdash;living, as they are, without sufficient to provide for themselves and their families, living very often under the worst housing conditions that can be found in Europe?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>At question time to-day, I had three questions tabled to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs relative to the change of the post office in the townland of Tagheen, Claremorris.  Perhaps, I should say something, at first, with regard to the history and background of that post office, and as to what led up to the change.  The post office had been located on a particular site which was fairly centrally situated.  It was most convenient to the people in the area it served in this postal sub-district.  It had been located on that site for at least 50 years, if not more.  There is a fairly large population in that area, and it served the people living there. The post office there had come to be regarded as the very centre of the place.</P>
      <P>Some time ago the owner of the post office and of the adjoining holding of land that went with it, decided for his own private reasons to sell it.  It was purchased by a young man who lived near this particular locality.  This young man, by the exercise of his brains and brawn, had earned sufficient money to enable him to purchase that particular holding and the post office.  In view of the fact that some years ago, during the term of the inter-Party Government, a select committee was set up to select suitable applicants for vacant sub-postmasterships this young man, who had purchased the place, felt sure that the selection committee in regard to a place like this, would not select any person other than himself for the vacancy and that it would not go to all the trouble and expense of changing the post office from the old site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In due course, the previous postmaster sold the place and tendered his resignation.  The duty then devolved on the Minister of appointing a successor. Naturally, everybody in the locality thought that this young man would be appointed.  He had purchased the place without any assistance whatever from State sources or from anybody else.  He is the son of a small farmer, and by hard work and industry <Col N="1170" /> had earned enough money to make the purchase.  He is a young man of excellent character.  His family are well known throughout the length and breadth of Mayo, and naturally, everybody felt that he would be selected. The post office was there with all the necessary fittings, telephone facilities and the rest.  It was situated practically in the centre of the area which it served.  But in fact that did not happen.</P>
    <P>A short time after it became known that the former postmaster had resigned, a deputation came to see the Minister.  We do not know what took place behind the closed doors in the Minister's office, but at any rate, on that evening, the members of the deputation were able to say, to use their own words, &ldquo;that the job was in the bag&rdquo;, meaning that the particular applicant whom they were sponsoring was getting the appointment.  I am basing this whole matter, first, on the fact that the man who had purchased the post office from the outgoing postmaster was fully qualified for the position, and, secondly, that the old post office was centrally situated, coupled with the fact that there was no need to incur any expense in changing the post office to a new site.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply to my question to-day, stated that, &ldquo;the new sub-post office is situated in the community centre of the rural district close to the church and school&rdquo;.  It is reasonably close to the church and school, but I did not put that question to the Minister.  The suggestion that I put to the Minister was that the present post office is not centrally situated as regards the area it serves.  If the new site is the best one from the community point of view, then, obviously, the old one should long ago have been removed as not being suitably located.  That, of course, was not done.  Either the Minister was wrong in leaving the old one where it was or in not having it removed long ago to the present site.  But he cannot have it both ways.  I was foolish enough to think that the Minister, like his predecessor, would allow the selection committee, set up to make such appointments, to do so.  It is quite <Col N="1171" /> clear, however, from the words used by the deputation which waited on the Minister, that their tongues outran their wisdom.  Immediately they came out from the Minister they gave the whole game away.  If the selection committee had been allowed to do their work, and if the appointment had not been made at that particular time, the deputation would not be in a position to boast that they had the job in the bag.  I take it, therefore, from their talk, that the Minister gave them an assurance that, regardless of what the selection committee might do, he was going to appoint the person whom they had recommended to him.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this to which I should like to refer.  Lately, we have been hearing a lot of talk about the need for economy in the Civil Service, in public administration and in practically every branch in life.  The Taoiseach has told use that we have been living beyond our means.  The present Government deem it wise and expedient, as the best means of running the country at the present time, to have an austerity drive, so that if a person happens to have an extra three-penny bit in his pocket, an inspector will probably be paid to snipe it from him.  The Minister gave some figures to-day indicating the cost of changing this post office.  The new site is on the edge of the area, with the result that the people are being greatly inconvenienced&mdash;at least 150 families and their households, to my own personal knowledge.  In spite of all this talk from the Government about the need for an austerity drive and for economy in public administration, the Minister is prepared to spend £7 10s. on the removal of the letter-box, including the reinstatement of the old premises.  He is prepared to spend £10 11s. on the removal of the telephone, and to incur an additional £20 annual cost in regard to mail conveyance.  That is because the new site is situated much farther than the old one from Claremorris, which is the central office where the mails come from.  He also told me, in his reply, that there is no loss of revenue in regard to telephone subscribers. Will he tell us whether one telephone subscriber in this area was <Col N="1172" /> paying for his telephone, or had he it free?  I am at a loss to know how it is that there will be no loss of income from this particular telephone subscriber. If the Minister's statement is correct, did that subscriber always have the service free?</P>
    <P>Will that particular telephone subscriber still have to pay a rental for a phone that does not now exist?  Seeing the telephone is under his roof in his own post office, it is quite obvious that he will not have a phone from his own house.  I have a telephone and it is costing me almost £50 a year although it is used very little.  I presume this telephone will cost about the same.  I am not saying that the Minister and his Department are charging me more than any other user, and presume I am only paying at the same rate as every other person who uses a telephone.  Possibly this telephone subscriber, because he had a flourishing business, was using-the telephone more than I use mine, and with the amount of the rental and the price of telephone calls and the extra 25 per cent. added recently I presume his bill could not have been much less than £50 a year.  Possibly I am safe in saying it was much more than £50 a year, judging by my own. I doubt the accuracy of the Minister's reply to me when he said there was no loss of revenue in regard to telephone subscribers.  If the Minister says I am wrong, I will withdraw the remark.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister told us he had need to increase postage charges. The modest 2½d. stamp hitherto required to post a letter was increased to 3d.  Telephone and telegraph charges were increased as part of a general plan to economise in Government expenditure.  Yet, the Minister takes and moves a phone that has been located for over 50 years at a particular site and he planks it down at the edge of the area it is supposed to serve, with the result that some of the people will now have to travel four miles to transact whatever postal business they have, let it be old age pensions or anything else.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department are tardy enough in the matter of erecting <Col N="1173" /> pillar boxes for the convenience of people in the rural areas.  In this particular area he is now putting an additional burden on the people.  I have no option but to believe that the selection committee was not allowed to function.  If that committee had been allowed to function I do not believe the Department and the Government and the taxpayers would have been put to the expense of moving this post office.</P>
    <P>While I have nothing to say as to the qualifications of the present applicant, I would like the Minister to tell us in what way the other applicant failed to measure up.  I understand only two in the area applied.  I want to make it clear that, if the Minister can give me even one small reason why the person who purchased the old post office site was not considered a fit or suitable person or failed to qualify because of record, education, character or in some other way, I will withdraw every single word I have said and the question I put down also.  That is a fair challenge to the Minister.</P>
    <P>This has undermined the confidence of the people in the Government.  We hear a good deal of empty talk from the Government Benches about the need to maintain law and order and the necessity for inculcating into the people a respect for the laws we make here.  When the people find political pull working to such an extent as this, it is very hard to expect the ordinary people, who are indeed very law-abiding, to have any respect for the laws we make here.</P>

      <P>I would like to hear the Minister give his reasons for this expenditure. In particular, I would like to know why he overrode the selection committee, as he must have done.  No selection could have been made at the time this deputation interviewed the Minister, and I am sure the deputation was not so foolish as to go bragging they had the job in the bag on that particular evening unless they got an assurance from the Minister that he was going to make the appointment they suggested.  If the Minister made such a promise to the deputation he clearly was regarding the selection committee as a humbug and he was determined to override it.</P>

      <P>I do not think Deputy Blowick has told the whole story.  In the first place, he must be aware that this post office was originally located in the village of Cahermore, to which it has now gone back.  It was taken out of that village and moved to the site to which Deputy Blowick has referred many years ago, and Deputy Blowick is well aware that over the last 50 years there has been an agitation in the parish to get the post office back <Col N="1175" /> to where it was originally and where it now stands.</P>

      <P>I think that Deputy Moran has stated the case better than I can.  All I have done is to take the advice made available to me and to restore the post office to the parish community centre of the particular district.  So long as I hold this position, if there is a rural district of that kind where there is quite clearly a community centre I shall, as far as in me lies, make arrangements that the post office will be in that community centre.</P>
      <P>So far as this matter is concerned generally, I am amused at the way in which members of the Opposition apparently try to make some kind of political capital out of the appointments to the Post Office.  They cannot do it very often because I have appointed well over 100 sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses and out of that number they have managed in some way or other to extract a mere handful of two or three with the object of trying to discredit me politically. They will not get away with that.  Since June, 1951, I have not had a single complaint of a responsible kind from any person living in any parish where sub-postmasters or sub-postmistresses have been appointed.  So far as I know, all these persons now working for the Post Office are giving satisfactory service.  To my knowledge, not one has been the subject of any serious complaint.</P>

      <P>In regard to their suitability and efficiency, there is the extraordinary fact that over 100 have been appointed, and out of that number the Opposition now and then picks a mere handful.  The Opposition seems to get aroused for some reason or another and starts making representations here and raising the matter on the Adjournment, trying to discredit me and my work, work which I have every reason to believe, from the comment I hear, I am doing as well as anyone else and at least to the satisfaction of the people in the districts where these post offices are situated.</P>

I believe I am doing a fairly good job.</P>

      <P>In regard to some of the points raised by the Deputy, no one was given any guarantee of appointment before this appointment was made.  I have been long enough in political life not to start giving people who happen to come to me guarantees in advance as to whether or not they will have the privilege of working for the Post Office.  It would be a very foolish man who would indulge in that kind of thing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blowick spoke as if one of the applicants had purchased the premises where the old post office was with some element of goodwill attaching to the premises.  He was a foolish person if he did that, because one of the strictest rules of the Post Office is that premises which formerly held a post office may not be purchased for a sum which includes goodwill.  If a person does that, he does it knowing that he is liable not to be selected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered the Deputy in regard to that. The applicant did not qualify because I decided the post office should be put back again into the community centre of the parish.  That is no reflection on the character of any of the applicants.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may interrupt me as much as he likes.  His interruptions will not trouble me.  I have made it clear that there is nothing against the character of the other applicants so far as I am aware. The post office was simply moved back to the community centre.  That is the natural and proper place for it.  No matter what representations I receive from Deputies, whether Opposition or Fianna Fáil, I will ensure that in cases of a similar kind the post offices are placed in the community centre.</P>
      <P>So far as the cost of moving the post office is concerned, we are accustomed to incurring certain small costs in moving post offices.  The cost is very small compared with what has to be incurred on some occasions.  We spend such large capital sums in improving postal services and increasing output and efficiency generally that I do not think we need worry about the very small costs involved in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

      <P>So far as the telephone service is concerned, there will be no loss of revenue.  There was no telephone call office in the post office originally.  There is a telephone in the new post office.  It is unlikely that anybody else will take a telephone and we will therefore save the capital cost of putting a telephone in and bringing the wires all the way from the nearest main exchange.  The savings on the capital cost will far offset any trifling expenses we have incurred in moving the post office.</P>
