    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state (1)  the number of years spent in carrying out meteorological tests at Farmer's Cross and Ahenesk, Midleton, with a view to selecting the most suitable site for Cork airport; (2)  the total cost to the State of such tests, and (3) the result of the tests; further, if he will state the other considerations apart from suitability of site to which he alluded in his statement in the Dáil on 4th November, 1953, and whether it is now intended to select a site to which no meteorological tests have been applied or a site which has already been condemned due to the incidence of fog as stated by him in the Dáil in July, 1952, in respect to Farmer's Cross (Dáil Debates, Volume 133, column 1047).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>(1)  The meteorological tests in relation to Cork Airport were carried out at Ballygarvan and at Ahenesk.  Observations were taken at both sites from 16th September, 1946, to 15th July, 1947.  The station at Ahenesk was retained as a reporting station for general meteorological purposes and still exists.</P>
      <P>(2)  The total cost of operating the two stations from 16th September, 1946, to 15th July, 1947, was approximately £2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2031" /> (3)  The results of the observations showed that meteorological conditions at Ballygarvan were less favourable for airline operations than those at Ahenesk.</P>
    <P>Since 1947, as I explained to the House on the 4th November, 1953, navigational and landing aids have reached an advanced stage of development, and meteorological disadvantages can be overcome with their assistance to a greater extent than was the case in 1947.  Other considerations which have to be taken into account in selecting an airport site are the distance of the site from Cork City, which is the main traffic centre in the area, suitability of ground for runways, clearness of approaches, and feasibility of installing lights and radio aids.  The report of the Government, to which I referred in reply to a question by the Deputy on 21st October, will take into account all these considerations.  Pending a decision by the Government, I am not <Col N="2032" /> in a position to say where the airport will be located.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the Government has considered the observation in paragraph 18, page 17, of the Report of the Central Bank of Ireland for the year ended 31st March, 1953, that agricultural and industrial prices are inflated beyond economic levels by means of guarantees, subsidies, quotas, tariffs and other arrangements; and, if so, if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>

      <P>As the House has been informed on several occasions, the Central Bank is an independent institution with specific statutory duties, the board of which is entitled to express its views on economic and financial matters.  These views are worthy of serious public attention since they come from a body charged with the duty of taking such steps as it may &ldquo;from time to time deem appropriate and advisable towards safeguarding the integrity of the currency and ensuring that, in what pertains to the control of credit, the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.&rdquo;  The Government, however, are under no obligation to offer comments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The paragraph, as the Deputy will see, deals with the question of the balance of payments. It is true that we keep agricultural produce here, from time to time, at a higher price than we could get it from other countries.  The Government and this Dáil have supported the policy of giving more for agricultural produce&mdash; for wheat, say, and sugar&mdash;than the price at which we could get them from other countries.  The Government and the Dáil in doing so take into consideration the general social and security advantages to be derived. They cannot concentrate purely on <Col N="2035" /> the narrow financial point of view. The fact is that it is true that we do that but we do it with our eyes open, and for very good reasons.</P>

      <P>No representations of the nature referred to in the question were received by the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the Corrib-Clare drainage scheme following its recent exhibition under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  I might mention, however, that a suggestion made in 1950 by a particular individual that the waters from Lough Cahier, which is in the River Moy catchment, should be diverted into the Corrib catchment, was examined in the course of the survey and design of the Corrib-Clare scheme but was not considered suitable for adoption.</P>

My question does not indicate that representations were made by Deputies of this House, but representations were made by certain individuals, of whom he knows.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state what progress has been made towards the rearrangement of the townland of Cushinsheeaun, Westport; whether it is likely that the rearrangement will be completed this coming spring and if it is contemplated migrating tenants from this townland; and, if so, the number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The holdings in Cushinsheeaun, with one exception, were rearranged where possible and vested in the tenants some 30 years ago.  The tenant of the remaining holding refused to agree to rearrangement and his case has been noted for attention when circumstances permit.  There are no proposals for migrating tenants from the townland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it from the Minister's reply that the Land Commission do not propose to improve that village further, either by way of buildings or rearrangement or enlargement of holdings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to see what can be done.  The inspector is considering what can be done in the particular case to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the holdings of these tenants have only £3 valuations?  I am not asking anything unreasonable when I request the Minister to take this matter up with the commissioners.  The policy they seem to follow is that so long as holdings were rearranged by the Congested Districts Board 30 years ago, they can vest them and wash their hands of all responsibility.  They are leaving the tenants as badly off if not <Col N="2044" /> worse off than they were in the landlords' time.  Would the Minister take that question up with the commissioners, as it is a matter of Government policy, and it should not be left to the commissioners to decide these things for themselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to agree with what the Deputy says. There is a limit to what even the Land Commission can undertake.  They are doing their best to proceed with rearrangement generally, and it is a very slow process.  If it is possible, I will try to get the Land Commissioners to look into this question again.  I would like to be convinced that it deserves priority over the other cases which the inspectors have been dealing with, both during the Deputy's time and during my time as Minister.  Are they to put aside the cases they are dealing with and to which we are pressing them urgently to find a solution, to take up new cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask for priority.  There is nothing about priority either in the original question or in my supplementary.  What I am complaining about is the way the Land Commission are, in my opinion, trying to side-step their responsibility.  They are a State Department established by law and voted money by this House each year for a very specific job of work necessary in the congested areas. In my opinion&mdash;and I am sure the Minister in his heart agrees with me &mdash;they should not act like this.  All I am asking the Minister to do is to take the matter up with the commissioners and give them a direction, even though the tenants may have got a slipshod settlement in time gone by from the Congested Districts Board.  It is very difficult to deal with these cases, but the commissioners should deal with them until the holdings are brought up to a reasonable valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows very well it is quite impossible to bring all the holdings of this kind up to a decent valuation.  There is not enough land for them.  It would be necessary to bring thousands instead of scores out of the West of Ireland if we were to <Col N="2045" /> attempt to do that, even with the cases we have in hands at the moment.</P>

The selection of schemes to be executed in the area with the aid of the allocation from the Employment Schemes Vote is a matter in the first instance for the Sligo County Council, who were informed that consideration would be given to any proposals for carrying out works, other than road works, with a high unskilled labour content.  They have submitted a scheme for the provision of footpaths in the town of Tubbercurry: this scheme, which is at present under examination, would absorb the portion of the county allocation available for the Tubbercurry area.</P>

Is the Parliamentary Secretary further aware that that disappointment was intensified when they discovered that after the rock had been removed and the bridges underpinned the only thing they saw happen was that the archaeological experts came down to carry out a survey for the Arts Museum? Would it not be much more appropriate if that scheme were enlarged and brought to a conclusion by the cleaning of the rivers flowing into Lough Gara and hence on to the Shannon?  When does he propose to supply the money, either through his Department or through the Board of Works?  Are the people to wait another 100 years?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last night I was dealing with the question of the vesting of county council cottages.  I find that quite apart from the social advantages&mdash;and there are great social advantages involved in people owning their own houses&mdash;I find it difficult to see how the local authorities are going to be <Col N="2054" /> able to keep their cottages in repair at present day costs unless they adopt a wide system of purchasing schemes and vesting of cottages thereunder. Many of these cottages are old ones held now at rates, which even if all the rent were allocated for repairs it would not be sufficient with repairs costing as much as they do to-day, to meet the cost of such repairs.  It seems, therefore, that the only feasible way of dealing with the situation is for local authorities to make an effort to bring all their cottages now into good repair and when they have been put into repair to encourage the tenants to purchase those cottages for the social advantages concerned and so obviate what might otherwise be the difficult task of county councils to equate rents to existing costs in modern times.</P>
      <P>In looking at the figures of the cottages that have been vested throughout the country, I was particularly struck to note the very high proportion that were vested in County Cavan.  The Minister may perhaps have some little knowledge of that situation and when replying I would like to hear from him if he could give any explanation of why there is such a high proportion vested in Cavan and why at the other end of the scale North Cork and Kilkenny have not made any use at all, apparently, of the Cottage Purchase Act; and why Wicklow has made such insignificant and trifling use of it, as indeed also has Laois.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was speaking last night I found it difficult to believe that I could have interpreted correctly that part of his speech dealing with the existing programme that was before local authorities.  I felt at the time that in the hurry of considering it while he was speaking I must be missing something and therefore I did not comment on that aspect of it last night.  But having studied it since I am quite clear that my first impression was quite correct.  The Minister in dealing with the progress that has been made by local authorities seems to have taken far too complacent a view of the situation.  In the comparison he gave of the number of houses built out of the total of 70,000 visualised in 1947 as <Col N="2055" /> being immediately necessary, he has brought into it a figure of 10,000 sites which have been acquired but in respect of which a spade has not been put in the land and in respect of which there has not been the slightest effort made at site development.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talks of the 70,000 houses that were needed and mentioned 52,000 dwellings that are built, in course of construction, or being contracted for or to be commenced in a reasonable time, I do not think it is proper for the Minister to take that figure of 10,000 into consideration at all.  There is one very simple reason why he should not do so from one aspect of that particular matter.  When local authorities are buying sites, whether by agreement or otherwise&mdash;mostly I am talking of cases where sites are procured by agreement&mdash;if they happen to want a site for 40 houses in a particular area and a field is offered upon which there are sites for perhaps 50 or 55 houses, with proper foresight they naturally buy the whole field believing they will require the additional sites at some time in the future.  I know from personal experience of two cases where that was done in County Kildare. There is no question whatsoever of commencing the building of houses on these additional sites within any reasonable time but the sites are counted in the figures that are presented to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the town of Droichead Nua and in the village of Leixlip we were advised by our local technical officers that there is at the moment no need for additional houses but when we were buying the sites for the houses now in course of erection we did not pare our cloth down to such an extent that if we wanted a few houses more in the future we would not have any sites upon which to erect them, and we included those according to the plan of the architect and according to the site offered to us by the vendor, and these figures are now apparently included in the figure of 10,000 which the Minister has thrown in for the purpose of bolstering up the case he <Col N="2056" /> put before the House last night.  It is true, as he said, that the number of houses completed by local authorities last year showed an increase of almost 300 over the previous year but it is equally true that the number of houses built by local authorities last year showed a decrease of approximately 300 on the figures for the last year in which Deputy Keyes was Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>When one considers that and considers the figures for unemployment in the building industry it is difficult to understand the complacency of the Minister in dealing with these problems. The figures I quoted last night in respect of unemployment were 1952 figures.  Anyone who has any knowledge of the position to-day must agree with me when I say that the position in respect of 1953 is worse than that in 1952.  Quite apart from local authority housing, I was last night endeavouring to deal with the necessity for encouraging the building of houses by the speculative builder.  One of the points I omitted to make last night when dealing with the National Housing Authority schemes in Canada was the fact that they have there a scheme by virtue of which the National Housing Authority guarantees to take over from private builders houses that the private builder has built for ordinary sale at a certain figure if that private or speculative builder is unable to dispose of his houses to private customers within a certain period of time.  That, naturally, has the effect that so long as the speculative builder builds to previously approved plans he knows he will not be at a substantial loss.  I need hardly say that the figure at which these houses are taken over does not show, and should not show, the same margin of profit as there would be if the houses were disposed of by private treaty, but it does mean that the speculative builder can go out and build houses knowing that he will not be at a serious financial loss and that his capital will not be tied up for a long period of time so long as he does his job properly.  The result of that system is that there has been widespread development of the private building industry in Canada, and I <Col N="2057" /> think that system is well worth consideration here.</P>
    <P>Complaints about delay in relation to the operation of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts arise annually in the discussion on this Estimate.  The position in certain local authorities in Dublin County is appalling.  I must confess that in previous years I have been given cases by individual builders who said they did not want the matter taken up because there might be victimisation of them at a later date.  I find it difficult to believe that the facts are as they stated them to be, but during the past 12 months I have had personal experience of a case which leads me to believe that the complaints I previously received are not without foundation.  It seems ridiculous that in the first instance an authority allocates loans under the Acts only if an individual has no other savings. Where a particular individual wants to put aside a small sum just prior to marriage for the purpose of having a little nest-egg to meet certain expenses that will obviously arise through the birth of children, or something of that kind, the amount of the loan allocated to him under the Act is reduced by the amount of the £200 or £300 he has saved.  In one case it took from the 30th October, 1952, to the 8th March, 1953, to get approval from the Dublin County Council of a loan justified on the figures of valuation put forward by their own valuer.  It is difficult to understand how there could be a liberal approach by builders who are waiting for their money and obviously anxious to get funds in as soon as possible if, on the other hand, there is that type of niggardliness and delay in dealing with cases such as those I have mentioned. If the Minister likes I will give him details privately of that particular case of which I have personal experience.</P>

Quite apart from any actual legal responsibility the Minister <Col N="2058" /> obviously has a duty to encourage local authorities to get their work done in a proper and satisfactory way.</P>

      <P>It is the Minister's function and his Department sticks its finger into the affairs of local authorities quite a lot in places where it should not do so.  I am suggesting that one of the places in which it is justified in sticking its finger in is in ensuring that the permanent officials of local authorities do not adopt the attitude of endeavouring to ensure that where people have put by a small sum to meet the expenses likely to arise after marriage that is taken into consideration in order to effect a reduction in the grant allocated under the Acts.</P>

      <P>The Minister is presumably interested in promoting private building, and he could quite well ensure that that situation would not arise.  If the Minister is not sufficiently interested and is as complacent about the housing situation as his speech would lead us to believe he is, it is only natural that he should run for cover behind the technical line he has now suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in the Canadian system also an arrangement by which the Government, through the national housing authority, puts up part of the funds that are lent by lending institutions on private buildings.  The equivalent in this country would be that not merely would there be a direct loan under the Small Dwellings Act from the Local Loans Fund, but that the Local Loans Fund might make some moneys available to lending institutions subject to overriding control and the overriding provision that the lending institution in question will reduce its interest in <Col N="2059" /> respect of the proportion that it receives from the central institution. With interest rates as they are at present, building society loans are expensive.  That is a matter that might be worth while considering.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks of doing anything like that, I hope he will add a stipulation that such lending institutions will not do as one society does, namely, provide that under no circumstances can the borrower who is obtaining financial accommodation from it for the building of a house insure with an Irish insurance company, that he must insure with a non-Irish company.  That seems a peculiar provision for an Irish building society to operate but it is, unfortunately, in operation in one case.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Department is directly responsible&mdash;the Minister cannot shed responsibility for this&mdash;for the determination of town planning appeals.  I fail to understand why it is necessary to take three to four months to determine an appeal under the Town Planning Act.  In my experience that is a pretty standard period.  It should be possible to determine an appeal under the Town Planning Act, in the average run of cases, in a much shorter time.  Of course, there may be difficult cases.  There was one case of which I had personal knowledge where there was a delay of something like nine months, but I admit that that was a very difficult and unique case.  The ordinary time taken in the Department of Local Government for the determination of town planning appeals is three or four months.  There does not appear to me to be either necessity or reason for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister exercises control over the auditors that he sends to audit the affairs of local authorities although not perhaps in the same way as he exercises control over the ordinary officers of his Department.  The position as regards the completion of audits within a reasonable time has not been very satisfactory.  I would like the Minister to tell us whether that has now been rectified.  Will we find the same pin-pricking in audits <Col N="2060" /> to which I referred on this Estimate last year because, if so, it will be very difficult for auditors to overtake the work.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to let us know whether or not he considers it right and proper for local authorities to put advertisements that are clearly political in character in periodicals and newspapers.  It does not seem to me that it is proper for a local authority to use the public funds given to them by the ratepayers for the purpose of what can only be described as a political advertisement. If the Minister looks at page 19 of the issue of <i>The Statist</i> of 24th October, 1953, he will find there an advertisement by the Dublin Corporation, for which, apparently, they paid.  I do not know what they paid but they must have paid a substantial sum for a half-page advertisement.  The wording of that advertisement is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Realising the marked progress achieved in Irish economic developments during the past two years...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not see how anybody can consider that as anything other than a political advertisement.  I understand that it is the custom to send marked copies of the appropriate debates on Estimates in this House to the offices and Departments concerned.  I trust that my remarks in that respect will be sent to the auditor who will come to audit the affairs of Dublin Corporation. In case there is any doubt of its reaching him I, as a ratepayer, shall take steps to see that a political advertisement such as that, paid for out of public funds, is brought to his attention so that the Minister through the auditor, can judge whether it is a proper thing to do or not.</P>
    <P>I dealt last night with the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the way in which that Act had been slashed and sabotaged by the Minister.  I do not want to go over it again to-day.  The position in that respect is too painfully known to the people throughout the country who witness rural unemployment of a type that could easily be relieved and to the people who are suffering from unnecessary flooding which could be relieved by works under that Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2061" /> Quite apart from the question of the niggardly amounts of grants under that Act, the manner in which the grants are being held up so that work cannot be carried out except at most unsuitable times of the year, is causing considerable concern throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I come to a point that impinges on legislation.  It is not in respect of legislative proposals that I wish to make any observations.  The manner in which the Minister informed local authorities of the proposals in connection with the agricultural grant in relief of rates this year leaves everything to be desired.  The fact that the Minister allowed local authorities to be uncertain, as many of them were, as to the legal position in respect of the striking of their rates is to be deplored. The Minister knows perfectly well that because he was so late in notifying county councils of his intentions almost every council had already made out their rate demands, and as far as I am aware every county council had to scrap the demands and to make out new demands according to the directions issued by the Minister.  The cost of that bungle to the ratepayers has varied in the counties concerned between £200 and £600.  It is a cost that could have been easily avoided if the Minister had made up his mind at the proper time as to the proposals he would put before them.  Even now, the Bill that he has introduced differs from the proposals which he indicated in his directions to the county councils, and therefore, there will be further unnecessary cost and further waste if and when the Bill is passed by the fact that each county council will have to issue credit notes and again readjust certain of the rate demand notes already issued.</P>
    <P>It is as undesirable as it can be that the Minister should leave county councils in the position of being completely unable to determine whether or not the demand for rates that they were asked to strike was a legal demand or not.  That matter could have been put beyond doubt if the Minister had taken time by the forelock <Col N="2062" /> and dealt with the matter at the proper time.  If the Minister was not personally responsible, he must take responsibility as a member of the Government.  It may be that the proposals were held up by the Department of Finance.  Be that as it may, local authorities throughout the country were involved in a great deal of unnecessary trouble and expense.  In that respect the administration of the Minister's Department during the first few months of this financial year leaves a great deal to be desired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker, I was struck by the complacency and contentment with the general position displayed by the Minister's speech introducing his Estimate last night.  I would consider that I should participate in that complacency if I found that there was the slightest foundation for it, but I think that a close examination of the position would indicate that everything was not so rosy in the garden and that there was not really such justification or grounds for the complacency displayed by the Minister on the operation of his Department for the period under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with various Estimates in this House, one point has come up with practically every Minister.  That was the question of unemployment, which is so rife in the country at the moment.  There is scarcely a Department in the State that is not able to make some contribution, more or less, to the solution of that national evil. Some Departments, perhaps, have a negligible contribution to make and some have a greater one, but I do not think that there is a Department in the range of the State by which so useful a contribution could be made to the relief of unemployment as the Department of Local Government, because they have the means not alone of fostering and promoting employment but of promoting employment of a particularly useful character, work of national benefit that would scarcely offend even against that oracle of conservatism, the Central Bank.  Whatever about the outlook or views of the Central Bank, I hold to the view that the work entrusted to the Minister for <Col N="2063" /> Local Government is one of the best contributions of work which could be utilised or developed for the spending of Irish money, and the building of homes and houses as long as the need persists for the building of those houses and the rescue of our people from the hovels and insanitary slums where we are creating T.B. and trying to cure them by very costly means.  I believe that the Minister for Local Government must occupy a dual capacity.  He is, in effect, Minister for Health in advance, and every effort should be made with all possible speed to try to rescue those people at the first moment from the conditions in which they are suffering.  Any money spent in that direction is money well spent.  Quite apart from the employment it gives it is an investment in the health and happiness and contentment of our people.</P>
    <P>Having regard to that, the Minister's figures for the completion of houses indicates in effect a slowing down.  The Minister tells us that the problem as it stood in 1947 was for 70,000 houses. I find it difficult to understand that figure, because whatever about 1947, I have a distinct recollection that in 1948 the problem before the country was 100,000, and then making allowance for obsolescence the estimate was of an additional 10 per cent., so that roughly speaking, the problem facing the country was not 70,000 houses but nearer to 110,000 houses.  That being so, the country buckled down to the task and to provide the machinery and organisation which at that time were dislocated following the period of emergency, the possibility of materials being in short supply, and general dislocation. The task of getting that machinery together was tackled and the machinery was put back with commendable speed.  We find that in 1950 there was 12,118 houses completed. The co-operation of every local authority in the country was readily forthcoming.  There was a grand wave of enthusiasm in the urban and rural districts and in the cities to join hands with the Department in order to try to get down to the solution of that problem with the least possible delay. Twelve thousand houses in 1950, 7,787 <Col N="2064" /> in 1950-51, 7,195 in 1951-52 and 7,476 in 1952-53&mdash;that indicates what appears to be a sort of studied drop.  There is a sameness in the figures which suggests that it is a studied policy of the Minister and the Government, that they decided they were going up too fast and that houses must not be built at that speed, that we must settle at a lower pace and arrive at a later stage.  If that is so, we ought to be told that.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with it myself because I believe that the greatest possible pace ought to have been maintained in view of the existing circumstances.  We have no right to delay, in taking all our people out of their slums and hovels, one hour longer than we can build in order to rescue them from that position.  Apart from that we had mobilised a very fine force of skilled building workers.  Skilled building workers are not to be picked up very easily off the road.  If they have employment they are not available.  If they have not got it here they will get it elsewhere.  They will find a ready market across the Channel if we disperse our building force here.  We cannot expect them to sit down or to be going to the labour exchange indefinitely. They are always welcome in Britain to help build up Britain.  Some of them had come back here, and there was an actual guarantee given to them that having regard to the programme of work set out and the determination of the Government to get on with the job, they had a guarantee of at least 20 years' continuous employment for building operatives who would come here to work on housing and hospital programmes.  At that time, practically no other types of building were being permitted.  Luxury buildings were completely eschewed and a monopoly was held of the materials so as to concentrate on houses and hospitals.  Because of the drop shown by the Minister's figures the completions show a marked slowing down in the housing programme.  In the last 12 months ended 1st August nearly 6,900 were completed, but completions to the end of the previous August were 7,750.  At the end of August, 1953, there were 6,925 houses in progress as against 9,892 in progress <Col N="2065" /> in August, 1951; 2,894 houses were in tender in August, 1953, as against 3,354 in August, 1951.  That reduction has been reflected in the steep drop in employment. We find in Dublin County Borough in August, 1951, 2,720; in August, 1953, 2,419; other urban areas 4,503 in 1951 against 1,640 in 1953; and rural areas 4,189 in 1951 as against 3,303 in 1953.  In short, there was a total in 1951 of 11,412 employed in building as against 7,362 in August, 1953.</P>
    <P>It is a natural corollary to expect that when the number of houses has dropped, and dropped from the high level of 12,000 to what appears to be the set level figure of the 7,000 mark, there was bound to be a corresponding reduction in employment.  A lot of those men have gone from here.  They are not going to be recalled.  Evidently they are not going to be asked to come back because there is a lesser force maintained to carry on that programme at a reduced scale.</P>
    <P>In a reply given to a parliamentary question on the 5th August, the Minister for Local Government stated that the estimated housing needs of local authorities at June last was 42,822, of which 21,342 were needed in Dublin. At the same time there were 1,555 skilled building workers registered unemployed on 17th October, 1953, as compared with only 585 on the corresponding date in 1951.</P>
    <P>What is wrong with the housing programme that it is necessary to build down to this low level?  The dismissal of those building operatives causes the loss of their services to our country, to which they could give valuable service and where their services are required. There is a warm welcome for them in Britain.  The slowing down was not for want of material.  The emergency has passed and materials are readily available. There was no lack of willingness as far as I know in the local authorities throughout the country.  You had the operatives, the need and the willingness of the local authorities, and where, then, did the step down take place?  Was it calculated deliberate policy on the part of the Government to restrict activities of that Department? I am dealing with public authority building.  I am aware, and it <Col N="2066" /> is general knowledge, that the stepping down in private building was attributable not to the Minister for Local Government but to his colleague the Minister for Finance in the increased charges on loans which has put building out of the reach of a lot of people who contemplated building their own homes and were put to the pin of their collar to get their houses together and to face up to their eventual responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>The lack of private building has contributed to the drop in the employment of building workers and it has also caused a very serious setback to the type of people who are inclined to build their own homes.  These people are, you might say, on the borderline: as some Deputy said, they are nobody's children.  Many of them are not particularly suited to be housed by the local authorities.  These people make an effort to do their own job and every citizen who attempts to build his own house and to fend for himself and his family ought to be commended.  These people are beholden to nobody and set about providing themselves with a home and, in my opinion, that is one of the grandest efforts that one can see. Anything that militates against the housing efforts of people of such spirit must surely be deprecated.</P>
    <P>The increase in loan charges has had a very serious and depressing effect on people who require to borrow for housing purposes.  Though the Minister for Local Government is not directly responsible in this connection. I believe that these increased loan charges have been an important factor in stemming or preventing the continuance of the house building activity which was in evidence prior to the imposition of these higher loan charges.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that a considerable amount of unnecessary unemployment in house building has occurred. In my view, the figure of 70,000, which the Minister mentioned, is capable of challenge.  I maintain that our demands are greater than that and, even if they are not, it means that we are only about 50 per cent. along the road to the completion of our programme. Local authorities and others must not, <Col N="2067" /> however, lose sight of the fact that a lot of the older houses in this country to-day&mdash;houses which were built 200 years ago or 150 years ago&mdash;are giving notice that they are about to chuck in. In fact, some of them are not giving notice at all but are just tumbling down.  Every local authority, particularly in our cities and towns, must bear in mind the imminence of the collapse of some of our older houses and make provision in advance for that situation.  Therefore, not only have we got to grapple with the current problem in regard to the provision of houses for our people but, according as that problem diminishes, we must still face a continuous house-building programme&mdash;on a lesser scale, naturally &mdash;to replace the older houses which are falling into an unmanageable state of disrepair.  When we have completed the huge housing drive on which we are now engaged, and which has been years overdue, to rescue our people from the slums and hovels and bad housing conditions, we shall not walk into an open field of inactivity and be immune from further house-building activities because, as the years go by, all of those older houses of which I have been speaking will have to be replaced.  Therefore, I do not see that there is any justification for slowing down the pace in the building of houses.</P>
    <P>I regret that I cannot congratulate the Minister in regard to the dismissal of building workers which has resulted from a slowing down in our house-building drive.  These workers either register at the employment exchange or go across to Great Britain in order to get employment there.  I hold that the Minister should have striven, by every effort possible, to maintain the highest pace and speed in our house-building programme so as to put all our people requiring rehousing into new and modern houses as quickly as possible and to take them out of the misery and the slums and the hovels where they have been forced to live for such a long and dreary time.  If the Minister had maintained that high rate of activity we should not have <Col N="2068" /> such an enormous number of building workers idle to-day.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Sweetman has already said, an effort ought to be made to reduce the cost of building.  We recognise that difficulties are there. Materials are costly and labour must be paid and everything is costly about the building of a house.  The trouble is that these high costs are reflected in the amount of money which the tenant must pay.  Anything that the Minister can do to reduce these high costs of materials should be done.  In my view, the time is overdue for an investigation into the cost of building materials.  I understand that that matter will be the subject of investigation by a tribunal in the near future and I welcome that news.  Having regard to the profits which we are informed suppliers of building materials make, though everything may be all right, I think the matter calls for investigation and examination.  You cannot continue indefinitely without a check-up.  If an investigation is made now, I think there will be ample evidence to show the tribunal that they are justified in recommending a reduction in the costs of materials for house-building.  We have all seen the reports of some public companies. Those reports which have been available to us indicate clearly that, to say the least of it, the profits are extraordinary.  I have no information as to private companies but the profits, as published by public companies engaged in the supply of building materials, give cause for furious thought.  Bonus shares are handed out and the original capital is trebled in a few years.  All that will eventually have to be paid for by the tenants who can ill afford the money and, for that reason, I think the matter deserves an examination to see if anything can be done to alleviate these high costs on people who have great difficulty in meeting them.</P>
    <P>I strongly advocate that there should be no reduction in the standard of the houses which are being built. The Minister should ensure that the housing standard will be maintained. We are building, in this year of 1953, houses which we hope will last for 100 <Col N="2069" /> years or, at any rate, that will have a lifetime of from 80 to 100 years.  In my view, the Minister should make a point of ensuring that any houses which are put up will be properly built and he should not favour a lower standard.  Many of our people are being rescued from conditions which should not exist in any Christian or civilised community.  They are now receiving amenities which they have not hitherto enjoyed and which are more in keeping with the requirements of a Christian and civilised society. Despite the cost, our people should be put into houses of a good standard. Let us try and make reductions where we can but let us not reduce the standard.</P>
    <P>I want to express disagreement with the statement made by Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll last evening in connection with an effort to reduce building costs.  I sincerely trust that his suggestion will not be taken seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll suggested, as a way of reducing building costs, the roofing of houses with felt, tar and bitumen.  I do not want to pose as an authority on this matter but I might point out that I have laid roofs and I have put roofs on various types of buildings.  I suggest that the only roofing materials we ought to consider for our people are slates&mdash;either natural slates or asbestos slates&mdash;and tiles.  Felt and tar are quite all right for factories and sheds but they involve costly maintenance year after year and in my view they are utterly unsuitable where the housing of human beings is concerned.  We have some excellent slate deposits in our country but unfortunately they are not developed to the extent to which they might be developed.  Take, for instance, the Killaloe slate.  Though it has been exported to various countries, it is difficult to obtain the Killaloe slate here.  For years, the Glasgow Corporation covered their housing schemes with nothing but Killaloe slates and, in fact, special cranes were erected at Limerick docks to lift cargoes of these slates week after week for delivery to Glasgow.  The Glasgow <Col N="2070" /> Corporation were not as particular as our architects here.  The Glasgow Corporation took the smaller slate which, in my opinion, is not a bad slate at all.  If it is properly laid, it can make a very fine roofing.</P>
      <P>What our architects here would not sanction was welcomed by the architects and engineers of the Glasgow Corporation.  They took all the small slate from Killaloe&mdash;and Killaloe did not bother about taking out the big slate.  Natural slate, asbestos slate or tiles are, I think, the only three proper roofing materials suitable for the housing of our people.  The houses are being built in mass concrete, in block concrete, in solid walls or in cavity walls.  Whatever it may be, these walls are capable of holding and deserving of carrying a decent roof, particularly having regard to the fact that families will live in these houses for years to come.  I trust that whatever efforts in the way of economy are made we will not fall for the proposal of Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll or anybody with a similar suggestion, to turn our houses into cattle-sheds or factories with cheap felt and tar roofs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of it which may be worth looking into&mdash;the question of professional fees.  It is a delicate question to talk about because these professional people are very jealous of their interests, but I regard these professional fees in relation to housing as pretty onerous.  I wonder if there would be any possibility of working out a simplification which would enable transfers from one occupier to another, from X to Y, or from Y to Z, on something more like a reasonable basis than exists at present. These fees are too onerous and I have seen many instances in which they were totally unjustifiable.  I am a layman, but many of these charges are unjustifiable, in my opinion, and, having regard to the fact that we are engaged in a national housing drive, while I do not want anybody to work for nothing or below the standards of his profession, I feel that a gesture could be made in this connection by some lowering of the fees, some simplification of the legal costs of transfers, without any loss of prestige on <Col N="2071" /> the part of the professions but with great gain to the country and to the tenants in particular.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of the cost of houses I have spoken about the prices charged for materials by builders' suppliers.  I feel also that the builders themselves could be subjected to some small examination. Anybody will be inclined to make as good a profit as he can, but I think the operation of the direct labour system has served a fairly useful purpose in acting as a check upon prices charged by building contractors. They have their job of work to do, but, if they have a free rein, without any competition, there may be a tendency to look for excessive profits.  I am not making any charge but the suspicion and the suggestion are always there. The operation of the direct labour system is in itself a check on prices going too high.  That system has not been operated to any considerable extent in this country, but for the past few years it has come into its own, to a certain extent but a very limited extent.  The direct labour contribution was not very great, having regard to the total building in the country, but in many cases it has been very successful. I cannot say that it has been 100 per cent successful, but I know that considerable savings have been effected to local authorities in some areas by the operation of that system.  That perhaps, may be some reason for the unwarranted hostility being shown by the Builders' Federation to the direct labour system.  I see nothing wrong with a local authority which is appointed to run the affairs of a city or county in the best interest of the citizens trying to do the best it can, and embarking through its own engineering staffs, on a direct labour scheme of building in the knowledge that it will result in a saving financially and in at least as good, if not a better, job.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the cost of direct labour, it did a very good job.  The materials are the property of the local authority, so that they put in only the best and the finish given to houses by <Col N="2072" /> direct labour has in all cases been better than that given by contractors. The houses are well built, with good materials and good finish, which means that there will be lower maintenance costs upon them.  If all that can be secured at the same time as making a saving as against the building contractors' costs, I do not see any justification or reason for opposition.  There may be some justification for the builders not liking it, but surely it is an encroachment on the rights of local authorities to attempt to prevent or interfere with the operation of direct labour where a local authority has the machinery and the engineers at its disposal to carry out this work.  I trust that the direct labour system will continue to operate so that we may have a check on any tendency towards rapacity in the prices of building and building materials.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act, here again the Minister was in a position to provide employment and very useful employment.  I regard the employment being provided under that Act as employment of a national character.  It was promoted by the county councils, the elected representatives throughout the country, who put forward schemes from their own localities for the prevention of flooding and any work which tends to reduce such flooding while, at the same time, co-operating with agriculture in preventing crops being washed away, must be regarded as a national investment. I do not think that even the Central Bank could crib about the utilisation of money so spent.</P>
    <P>In the first year of operation of the Act, I have a distinct recollection of some rivers in my own county and in adjoining counties which were relieved permanently from the flooding which had taken place for years and if we had had to wait for the Arterial Drainage Act, it would not be an unreasonable estimate to say that it would have got down there in ten or 15 years' time.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, this flooding was taking place.  I remember a deputation from Counties Tipperary and Limerick waiting on the Minister when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister <Col N="2073" /> for Finance to tell him of the plight of the people living beside the Newport river and the Bilbo river. The Newport river had burst its banks and for miles around there was nothing but flood water to be seen.  There were no boreens going into the houses &mdash;they were all canals, as in Venice&mdash; and the people had to use boats to get to their houses.  One can imagine the condition of those houses after that flooding.  Turf banks were swept completely away, and every bit of tillage and crops they had were gone.  It is very hard to estimate what the loss sustained by these people was on the occasion of that flooding in 1946, and I am aware that some of these people have not yet recovered from the losses of that kind.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Bilbo river decided to take a hand in the game, and it swept through its banks, flooding houses and lands in Cappamore. Other rivers such as the Morning Star river did the same, but in the first year of operation of the Act, two of these rivers were brought under control and, in the second year, the problem was cured.  In two seasons, the Newport river and the Bilbo river were cured.  The Morning Star river is up in the Golden Vale where the finest land in the entire country is, and this land had also suffered from flooding. There was little incentive to the people to till or to work their land, knowing what was going to happen when the river burst its banks.  In one year, that was cured, and that is only one small sample of the work done on some of the rivers I know.</P>
    <P>I know the rivérs in West Limerick equally well&mdash;the Maigue and the Deal &mdash;and these, too, have been cured. There is still some work to be done, but very good headway was made in two years, because these were submitted by the local authority for the approval of their engineers and eventually the approval of the Local Government engineers.  There was no question of any overlapping or wasting of money because they were so framed as to fit in with the eventual operation of the Arterial Drainage Act, whenever that would come about.</P>
    <P>As I say, it would be difficult to estimate <Col N="2074" /> the value to the country of the work done under the Act to prevent flooding.  The trenches which were constructed along the roadways provided an outfall to take away the water from lands on which work was carried out under the land rehabilitation scheme put into execution by the Department of Agriculture.  Why the Act has fallen into disfavour I find it difficult to understand, but that it has fallen into disfavour is certain.  It was not even referred to by the Minister in his speech and the figures are very eloquent.  The advances shown in the Book of Estimates for the execution of works under this Act for the last four years were as follows:-1950-51, £1,750,000; 1951-52, £1,220,000; 1952-53, £650,000 and 1953-54, £400,000.  The average number of men employed on works under the Act in 1952-53 was 1,840 as compared with 4,751 in 1951-52. But in March, 1950, there were as many as 13,850 men employed on such works. The very big decline in expenditure and in the number of men employed is indicative of the fact that the Minister and the Government are not in love with, or are not in favour of, the Local Authorities (Works) Act, that they are inclined to cut it out entirely.</P>
    <P>The drop in the figures I have quoted occurred at a time when there was increased unemployment in the rural areas.  Works provided under this Act were very useful inasmuch as they provided employment for men at a time when they were not wanted for agricultural work.  The fact that they were employed during idle periods on the land and that they were kept available for farm work when it again offered was a great benefit in my opinion for the countryside.</P>
    <P>They were having their houses built and work was provided for them in the rural areas through the medium of this free grant from the Government without any contribution from the rates.  It was an incentive to people to remain on the land and, as I say, it kept them in the rural districts during idle periods on the land, so that they were available for tillage work in spring and harvest when they were required for such work.  Rural <Col N="2075" /> workers cannot live on their fat in between the time that they are wanted for spring and harvest work.  Some work must be provided to maintain them in employment in between seasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given considerable grants from the Road Fund for the maintenance of main and county roads for which I give him all credit. In that respect I should like to pay tribute to the magnificent work done by the county authorities on the main roads of the country.  They are doing a very meritorious job with the assistance of the grants they are getting from the Minister.  I have nothing but commendation for the work done on the main roads but when you come to the rural areas, there is a vast gap left and figures recently supplied show that 22,000 men departed from the lands of Ireland in one 12 months. There was a drop of 22,000 in the number of workers on the land from June of last year to June of this year. That condition of affairs to my mind was contributed to very considerably by the failure to operate the Local Authorities (Works) Act to the extent to which it should be operated.  Many of these men would have got employment on these useful schemes at the same rate of wages as county council workers&mdash;a condition making for their happiness and contentment and which would have prevented them drifting from the land into the cities in this country or migrating to cities across the water.</P>
    <P>We are all the time told that we should aim at a balanced economy and that we should try to keep a reasonable number of people on the land. We should try to get a balanced community on the land, and that can be done only by providing for continuous employment in rural districts so far as it is possible to do so.  I believe that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was a very useful instrument for that purpose. I am sorry it has not found favour with the Minister or the present Government, because it is perfectly evident that they are trying to slide it from their programme with results that are not going to be happy for the <Col N="2076" /> rural community.  I would ask the Minister seriously to reconsider his attitude towards this Act.  The schemes of work are still there.  They have been prepared by the various county councils and submitted by their engineers. They are on the files in the archives of the Custom House in Dublin, and if we want to get ready work for our people these schemes are waiting there to be utilised.  There is very little engineering content in them; the work is mainly of labour content and they could be a most beneficial asset to the countryside if the schemes were restored to anything like the position which they held up to recent times.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of cottage purchase.  I should like to suggest to the Minister that he should do everything possible to try and promote the purchase of cottages by tenants.  Cottage purchase has been an old and a vexed question in this country for many years.  In fact, the agitation for the purchase of cottages has gone on for over 50 years.  Associations were formed many years ago by rural labourers for that purpose. When I was a mere schoolboy they were agitating for the right to own their own roof-trees.  Eventually, after years, a Bill was introduced in 1936, under which a scheme was prepared, but there was an objection raised to that.  Deputy Sweetman asked last night in this connection why so many cottages had been vested in tenants in Cavan as compared with other parts of the country.  The scheme under which these cottages were purchased was based on a 75 per cent. purchased of the current rents.  I can say that there was a definits hostility to that scheme throughout the greater part of the country, and I was one of those who created that hostility.</P>
    <P>The scheme, as I say, was based on 75 per cent. of the current rents.  It was the time of the economic war and we were proposing to give farmers a 50 per cent. reduction in their annuities.  As cottage rents were held in the same suspense account as annuities, it seemed unfair to give the farmers a 50 per cent. reduction while tenants of cottages were expected to purchase their cottages on a scheme <Col N="2077" /> based on 75 per cent. of their rents. Since that time it has been made possible for county councils to sell to cottiers at a figure based on 50 per cent. of the current rents, and I think everything possible should be done to encourage and to speed up the purchase of cottages on these terms.</P>
    <P>I have seen one suggestion that the county councils might dispose of cottages built at a certain date and hold those of another date.  I think we should sell the whole lot, lock, stock and barrel.  If the old cottages are going to be bought, they would have to be put into proper repair by the local authority before they are offered to the tenants.  If the local authority does a competent job on the houses, I am sure most tenants would be prepared to purchase.  If the tenant does not like the work which has been done he is entitled to an appeal.  I think that if the county council were prepared to carry out repairs and to sell the cottages at 50 per cent of the current rents it would be a good job. It would be a good job for the councils themselves, because it would save them the cost of recurring repairs and other heavy costs.  It will put the responsibility on the tenant to maintain his little home.</P>
    <P>I believe that the majority of these tenants will not be wasters and that the experiment of establishing themselves as owners of their own homes is one that is worth trying.  It gives a tenant a spirit of independence once he feels that his house is his own.  I, therefore, urge on the Minister to try to get purchase schemes prepared with all possible speed by the county councils and then, when it comes to his own end in the Department, to give sanction to these schemes with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <P>Already, I think, a fairly good spurt has taken place in this matter but it is not as swift as it might be.  The sooner the cottages are transferred to the tenants the better.  It would make for more harmony and stop the unseemly scramble.  As the people want more houses, we will have to build more houses and the people with cottages ought to have them vested in themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2078" /> In conclusion, I ask the Minister to give his benediction to that and to help in every way he possibly can to put through the county councils purchase schemes under the new 50 per cent. terms and sanction them with the least possible delay.  I congratulate the Minister once more on the splendid work which is being done on the main roads.  A grand job is being done and the money which is being spent will be reflected in fewer traffic accidents, fewer lives being lost, and more comfort and convenience for the travelling public.  The money is being very well spent by the county councils under the Minister's jurisdiction.  I only regret that he has not gone as fact as I would like in regard to house building and the employment of people under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very surprised that Deputy Keyes should think that this Government are not as anxious to speed up housing as the last Government. No one knows better than Deputy Keys the encouragement which the Fianna Fáil Government has given, the Acts they brought in and the grants they made available to local authorities to house our people. He stated that in 1950 there were more houses built than have been built in any year since.  Perhaps the building which took place in 1950 was due to the fact that the sites and plans were ready before he came into office.  I think it is generally agreed, as has been stated here and elsewhere, that the delay in building houses in Dublin City was due to the holding up of plans and sewerage schemes so that the corporation were not in a position to go ahead.</P>
      <P>My experience as a member of the Cork Corporation is that every encouragement has been given to us since Fianna Fáil came back into power. Last year in Cork we built practically three times the number of houses built in the previous years.  We hope to build more than that.  I do not think there is any doubt that we will build 400 houses in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not blaming the previous Government for any delay in housing. I am blaming the local authority and <Col N="2079" /> the officers of the local authority for not pushing on with the housing programme as they should have done.  We had a lot of talk in Cork during the past year about finance not being available for going ahead with our housing programme.  Discussions took place at the corporation meetings month after month, and when we sent a deputation representative of all Parties to the Minister we were told in very plain language that no matter how fast we built houses, as long as he was Minister he would see that we were not short of money, that money would not stop us at whatever speed we built the houses.  We went back very happy.  We were asked were we ever held up for money and we admitted that we were not, but that we were held up in regard to the development of sites.</P>
    <P>We had a lot of talk in the past two months about the sanctioning of a direct labour scheme for the building of 174 houses.  We had protests at the corporation and the workers' council about the delay in sanctioning that scheme.  The scheme was sanctioned nearly five weeks ago but it has not started yet because the development of the site was not finished.  Men had to be laid off, not because the Local Government Department did not sanction the scheme, but because the local officials had not had the site sufficiently developed to allow the direct labour men to carry on according as they were completing the programme they were engaged on.  The result was that men were laid off who could be usefully employed now at the building of houses which are very urgently needed in Cork.</P>
    <P>At the present time, we have contracts for some 500 houses and we have plans for 1,000 houses.  We have acquired the ground.  It took us over 12 months to get extra staff taken on in the architect's office to go ahead with the plans for the schemes, and it was not the Department of Local Government who delayed the appointment of this extra staff.  Now that we have sufficient staff, we believe that we will be able to go ahead with housing in <Col N="2080" /> Cork City at a faster rate than ever before.  We are in a position to build 400 houses a year and we have plans ready for that, but we hope to improve on that in future.  We are also undertaking the clearing out of the slum sites from which we had previously taken the people and accommodated them in new houses, some of which are outside the borough boundary. We are now clearing these sites and have some of them cleared, and we hope to be building on them within a few months.</P>
    <P>Cork Corporation at present own about 4,000 houses.  We have a population of about 80,000 and, taking an average of five or six in each family, the corporation must be housing 20 or 25 per cent. of the population.  I do not know whether that is a good or a bad thing, or why private enterprise should not go ahead as it did before. At any rate, while our people are living in very bad conditions, the corporation and the Government will have to undertake the job.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the previous Minister for Local Government, who should know all the facts, should say that it was this Government which was holding up the housing programme. I think nobody can deny that Fianna Fáil led the way and pushed on with the housing programme from 1932 onwards.  Were it not for the intervention of the war, I think the job would have been completed by Fianna Fáil before this.  However, we all realise the conditions under which our people were living when the British left this country.</P>
    <P>We know that you had ten or 12 families in one house with one lavatory. They had to draw water up ten or 12 flights of stairs and more.  We know the position that existed of late years.  A lot of people are still living under those conditions.  Newly-weds are not allowed to leave prams in the hall.  All those things will have to be remedied.</P>
    <P>I was certainly encouraged very much when the Minister made the statement to the deputation that as fast as we could build houses he would see we were not short of money while he was Minister.  I hope Deputy Keyes <Col N="2081" /> will believe that that is the policy of the Government as it was the policy of the last Government.  I think everybody is anxious that our people should live in comfortable and healthy houses.  I do not think there should be any quarrel between one Government and another about that matter.</P>
    <P>There was a lot of talk about the quality of houses.  From what I hear we are building the best houses in Europe and that the standard of the houses we build is second to none.  I agree with that.  In a city like Cork we should build at least 400 or 500 houses of the smaller type for old couples and newly-weds.  I do not personally object to building houses in terraces.  In the first place, they would be cheaper for the old couples and newly-weds.  In the second place they could be built quicker.</P>
    <P>In Cork at the present time we have over 3,000 people still looking for houses and at least half of them have families with two children.  These are people who are not too long married. It is a terrible problem for those people but, with God's help, we will overcome it.  If anything could be done to speed up the building of houses in Cork I certainly would welcome it very much.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost of building, for the last 12 months we in Cork Corporation have got real competition in regard to tenders for building.  Recently there has certainly been a big reduction in the cost of houses.  On the average the tenders received were less by £100 to £150, and in some cases even more, than those received a couple of years ago.  That is only to be expected as the price of cement, timber and a lot of other things has gone down.  There is competition amongst builders such as never before existed.  I do not know whether it is because there has been a change but that is a matter that I could not go into at the moment.  In that connection, however, I see no reason why, when the corporation has a big direct labour contract for 174 houses, the manufacturers should not supply them direct with a lot of things such as baths.  It seems strange that the corporation are not able to buy them direct from the manufacturers.  Some <Col N="2082" /> of those baths are manufactured here. I cannot understand why they should be bought through builders' providers who collect the profit for which the tenant has to pay.</P>
    <P>I addressed a question to the Minister yesterday about the extension of the borough boundary.  I would appeal to him to expedite that matter.  It is hard on a body like the Cork Corporation to have to build houses outside the city and pay rates to the county council without getting the same type of service as would be got within the county borough.  As I pointed out to the Minister, there are people in receipt of different benefits losing heavily as a result.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister will do anything about this or not, but there certainly is a great drawback in building under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act as far as the county council area is concerned.  The applicant for a loan has to provide two sureties to the county manager before he can get his loan.  I fail to understand why the applicant cannot get his loan the same as he would get it from the city manager in Cork Corporation area without any security except the deeds of the house.  Some people are very reluctant to even approach their greatest friends and ask them to go security for the loan on a house which would extend over a period of up to 30 years.  It seems extraordinary that the county manager should look for that surety.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in the Act to ask for the surety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems extraordinary to me that such an impediment should be put on a person who wants to build in the suburbs or any part of Cork.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to that question, because several people have approached me about the difficulty of getting sureties and their reluctance to ask people to go security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has any control over the Guards making allowance for people crossing the street.  In this connection I put a question down yesterday to the Minister who said he would bring in legislation <Col N="2083" /> as soon as possible.  It is extraordinary that there is no safeguard for people crossing the street.  Even at the official crossings where there are signs, you would have to run for your life.  My experience is that in most cases the traffic policeman takes no notice at all of the pedestrians.  Of course, he has enough to do to control the cars.  I am one of the few pedestrian Deputies in this House.  It seems strange to me that there should be any delay in the matter of protecting pedestrians as they are protected across Channel.  A motorist should be compelled, whether by traffic lights or by legislation, to allow pedestrians to cross the street at recognised crossings.  I could be told in February, 1952, that legislation was being considered, and yet no advance has been made.</P>
    <P>There is also the trouble of parking in a city like Cork.  The position there is impossible.  In some of the streets the cars lie two and three deep. People cannot get into their business premises.  Others cannot pull in to deliver goods.  If the situation is allowed to develop, I do not know where it will stop.  There are plenty of places in Cork which could be utilised for parking.  The river could be covered over.  That would provide a lot of parking space but the Cork Corporation, I am afraid, would not have the funds to do that.  If there are any grants going in a big way, I think this would be useful work on which to expend them.  Work of the kind which I suggest would case congestion considerably in the streets of the city.</P>
    <P>Another of our problems in Cork is a main sewerage scheme.  Those who know the city are aware that all the sewers there empty into the open river.  I do not think that, from any point of view, that is a good thing.  If there is any talk about the relief of unemployment, I think that the execution of schemes such as I have mentioned would be a great help.  I think, too, that money could be usefully spent on the provision of ball alleys, swimming pools and playing fields.  It would be a very useful thing, in my <Col N="2084" /> opinion, to have works of this kind carried out so as to provide employment for those who are drawing the dole at present.  It would be a good thing, too, for the country, if they were employed.  It would be good for the men themselves, so that they would not be getting into the habit of idleness or into such a condition that they are not able to work when they get it.  An addition could be made to the sum which they receive in the form of the dole so as to bring their wages up to the required standard.</P>
    <P>There is not anything else that I have to say except to thank the Minister for the encouragement which he has given to us especially this year, in the building of houses for our people.  As I have said, we still have 3,000 families in Cork who are in need of houses, and in very bad need of them.  I would ask the Minister to speed up the giving of sanction for the development of sites locally.  I again thank him, and say to him that this has been our best year in Cork so far as housing is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister covered two main items in his introductory speech, housing and roads.  Housing is divided into two categories, local authority housing and private housing. Speaking as a member of the Dublin Corporation, I feel that the requirements of the city are not yet near completion. In 1947, it was reckoned that 30,000 dwellings would be required to satisfy the needs of the citizens of Dublin.  In the six years subsequent to the making of that survey, that figure of 30,000 was considerably reduced by local authority and private building.  It was reduced by private building inasmuch as cheap money was available for the purchase of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the early part of the period from 1947 to 1951, there was a steady increase in the cost of building, and subsequent to that there was a sharp rise in the cost of the money required to provide loans under the Small Dwellings Acts.  The result was that great numbers of people requiring houses were again thrown back on the lists of the local authorities.  I suggest that the Dublin Corporation still <Col N="2085" /> require approximately 30,000 houses to be built in the Dublin area.  When one considers that such a number of houses is required one can get a good idea of the magnitude of the problem that confronts the local authority.  To put such a scheme into operation, there is first of all the problem of town-planning which in this country is really in its infancy.  In fact, there are very few local authorities which have considered the subject at all.  The fact is known to the Dublin Corporation, to the Dun Laoghaire Corporation and, outside the jurisdiction of this House, to the Belfast Corporation, that planning schools are held each year.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should advise borough corporations and borough councils throughout the country to send their representatives to these town-planning schools which are held each year in various parts of England and Scotland.</P>
    <P>We, in the Dublin area, are concerned with town-planning on a very large scale because in the case of any large building scheme that is to be carried out, it must be planned by men of experience, and these men, I may say, have set themselves a very high standard.  I would say that the standard of building in the City of Dublin is higher than that under any other local authority in the country.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, too, to the Minister that he should seriously consider the Gavan Duffy Report which, I think, in 1938 put forward the idea of establishing a Dublin Municipal Council to cater for all the Dublin area.  This may sound very far-fetched and a number of Dublin County representatives might at first glance be opposed to any such idea; but when it is considered that the only authority which provides water and sewerage services in the area around this capital city&mdash;that is, the fringe area of County Dublin, the Bray district and Dun Laoghaire&mdash;is the Dublin Corporation, then I think the suggestion is worthy of very serious consideration. All these bodies which I have just mentioned are completely dependent on the Dublin Corporation for their supplies of water and sewerage services.  An authority having control <Col N="2086" /> of all this area which I have mentioned would, I suggest, be able to cater for the public in a far better fashion than it is being catered for at the moment. The problems of road extensions and road widenings could also be dealt with more capably, and I think, too. that traffic problems could be dealt with more satisfactorily than they are at the moment.  Public parks and public playgrounds could be planned and located to far better advantage than is being done at present.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of town-planning, I want to suggest to the Minister that there is something which is very badly needed in any built-up area, particularly where a new church or chapel has been erected.  I refer to the need for a car park in the vicinity of these churches or chapels.</P>
    <P>I live quite close to Killester Church. If the Minister wanted to be there on a Sunday morning at 10 o'clock he would have to make a detour because he would not be able to get through the number of cars parked there.  The road at that spot is about 20 to 22 feet wide at the most, and you have two lines of cars parked along each side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>A very poor parish.  At Glasthule and Blackrock car parks have been provided.  I do not know whether the local authority there had sufficient initiative to suggest it in the beginning, but when plans are being proposed for the erection of a church or chapel, the authorities concerned should be advised that car park facilities are necessary in 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister also that where new local authority or private housing schemes are being considered he should, without interfering with the density, consider the advisability of insisting upon semi-detached houses and semi-detached houses only. From my experience as a builder, having built both types of houses, terraced and semi-detached houses, I believe that the proper type of house in which to accommodate our people is a semi-detached house.  In spite of the fact that the house itself would cost a <Col N="2087" /> little more to build, when everything has been taken into account the saving on constructing a back entrance, a back lane, would outweigh any little extra cost there might be in the construction of the house.</P>
    <P>Building regulations at the moment require that where the construction of a back lane at the rear of a house is involved, it would have to be serviced with surface water drainage.  Therefore, semi-detached houses would not be any dearer than the terraced type of house.  Local authorities now in the Dublin area will not consider plans for more than eight houses to the acre.  I am not suggesting that that should be increased or decreased, but that the Minister should advise local authoriites to plan for semi-detached houses.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to the Minister what has been referred to by previous speakers, that there is still certain dissatisfaction over slowness in paying small dwellings loans, and I particularly mention Dublin County Council.  Several complaints have been made to me during the last couple of months that delays still occur.  I agree that these complaints are out of the control of the Department of Local Government.  I suppose there are various reasons for delays of which the complainants will not inform us public representatives.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath stressed very strongly the fact that the Minister informed him that as long as he was in office Cork Corporation would not suffer from lack of money in the construction of any of their housing schemes.  I compliment the Minister on that statement, but Deputy McGrath inferred that this came only from a Minister of the Fianna Fáil Government. That was the position before the Fianna Fáil Government came into office.  There is just one difference and to me a very considerable difference, that is, in the cost of the unlimited supply of money that would be made available to the local authorities for housing.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that terms which will attract the public to invest must be given, but it is very strange that subsequent to the floating of the two national loans and those of the two corporations, the New Zealand Government floated a national loan at just over 4 per cent. and the Birmingham Corporation floated a loan of £5,000,000 at just over 4 per cent.  The fact that money became so dear helped to increase the cost of housing. It is obvious to everybody that where the requirements of a local authority are still to be fulfilled and money is available or made available by the local authority or by the Government, irrespective of what that money costs, these schemes can go on, but a true barometer is shown in the private house building industry where the man in the street has to find the money, has to borrow money and repay principal and interest&mdash;and interest at a higher rate.  The higher rate of interest increases the outgoings on his house by 12/6, 15/- or £1 per week.  These people now find <Col N="2089" /> the burden too great and they are thrown on the list of local authorities for housing.</P>
      <P>Apart from these costs, which have created concern in the building trade, there is not a trade in Dublin that has not its halls full&mdash;the Carpenters' Hall, the Bricklayers' Hall, the Plasterers' Hall, they are all full of unemployed tradesmen, first-class skilled men who a couple of years ago could find work in any part of the country. They now cannot get work at all.  The building trade in the City of Dublin is at its lowest since 1932.  Deputy McGrath mentioned the good work Fianna Fáil did for housing from 1932 on.  I agree with him that great work was done and great strides were made. but any native Government would have made the same strides.  Deputy McGrath inferred that for the previous years from the time native Government was established there was very little done in housing.  I suggest that the 10 years previous to 1932 were far different from the subsequent seven or eight years, all peace-time years, that we had after 1932.  The new State had to be built up, moneys had to be found, the whole structure of this nation had to be erected and conditions were completely different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a matter that I wish to mention, though I do not know what impact it will have on the house-building industry, that is, the new house-building regulations that will come into force.  I gather from correspondence I have had that from the 1st January, 1954, all house building will have to be done either with bricks or hollow blocks.  In other words, no building contractor from 1st January, 1954, may make his own concrete blocks to build his houses.  This is a matter that must be considered by the people concerned. As far as I know, there are not many concerns capable of supplying these materials to such an extent as will keep men in full employment.  Apart from the local authorities, the requirements of private builders will be, I think, more than can be met by these concerns that produce machine-made blocks under great pressure.  I suppose it is something that must be introduced to improve the standard of dwellings, <Col N="2090" /> but the houses built in the last 25 years have been built under the supervision of qualified engineers, architects and building surveyors.  Is it the feeling of the authorities that those houses are not sufficiently good and that these new regulations must be brought in? When we have four or five concerns producing goods which will be in great demand from 1st January, we all know that the first thing that will happen is that a ring will be formed and the price of these materials will go up, resulting in a further increase in the cost of building.  Is there any way of controlling this?</P>

      <P>When the Deputy is making his contribution I would like to hear his remarks about these house-building regulations.  The regulations also say that the joinery to be used&mdash; for doors, for example&mdash;must be at least 1? inch.  Many first-class local authority houses and luxury houses were built throughout the country with four-panel 1½-inch doors that were every bit as good as the 1?-inch doors. This will tend to increase the cost of building.  I do not for a moment suggest there should be any deterioration in the quality of materials used, but insistence on materials of a certain type &mdash;such as these machine-made blocks and joinery of a certain thickness&mdash; where in certain circumstances lighter materials might be preferable, will increase the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to mention the cost of supplying water to a new house in the City of Dublin.  I do not want to deal with this matter in detail here, as it is one that I, personally, am concerned in directly, but for the Minister's own information I would like him to make inquiries.  The water charge on a new house is something colossal.  People want to know how a house can cost over £2,000.  To be selling at £2,200 with a reasonable amount of profit, it would cost a builder about £1,400 to build.  People think the profit on it would be fabulous.  The other charges the builder has to meet are so fabulous that it keeps the price at the level of £2,200.  The Dublin Gas Company can <Col N="2091" /> put in their pipes and services free of charge to any contractor and the tenant then has no charges in that respect.  To get an ordinary water taping on to the main costs £6, and the laying of the main, with the cutting for it opened by the contractor, will cost nearly £2 per foot.  If you consider that the average house is over 30 feet wide, you know what the water charge is.  The average water charge for a scheme of 50 houses would not be much short of £100 per house.  Of course, that is not the cost of the materials used at all.</P>
    <P>Another point that is on the tip of everybody's tongue, though half the people in public life are loth to mention it, is the question of car-parking. I am not asking the Minister to request the local authority to provide more space, but I am asking him to use his good offices with the Minister for Justice or the local authority concerned to regularise the position of car park attendants.  If a man doing business in the city has to make five calls, it will cost him nearly 5/-.  In the City of Belfast, the British Legion have a system which has been lauded throughout the world.  It is a wonderful system under which an attendant works for the association to which he belongs; he works so many hours a day and gets a weekly salary.  A 1/- ticket is stuck on any motorist's car and he can park his car free on payment of that 1/- in any car park or any place in the City of Belfast for that day.  If he does not desire to do that, he pays a fee of 6d. each time he parks his car.</P>
    <P>If the Minister could see his way to favour something like that, perhaps the Old I.R.A. organisation would take control of it here in the City of Dublin. I am not suggesting that any present car park attendant should be interfered with, but that no new ones should get these caps or get any authority that allows them to take over a spot in the City of Dublin and collect money from motorists.  You cannot go even to a suburban picture-house without meeting them, and, in fact, you have to pay now going into <Col N="2092" /> Mass because there are car park attendants outside.</P>
    <P>Another point that I want to bring to the notice of the Minister is road widths.  A main road is, under the new regulations, I think, supposed to be at least 25 feet.  Link roads, roads connecting two main roads, can be approximately 22 feet, but a road was constructed between Raheny and a newly-proposed road coming down from Coolock to Vernon Avenue, and it was insisted upon by the local authorities&mdash;and I believe an appeal made to the Minister&mdash;that this road should be 24 feet wide.  It is a short strip of road.  You could really say a &ldquo;back road&rdquo;, but it was insisted that it be put in as a new concrete road 24 feet wide.  The people buying houses on this road must pay for that extra four feet of concrete, while roads leading on to this road require to be only 20 feet wide.</P>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity of congratulating the various county councils who have done wonderful work in improving the main roads from the West into Dublin, from Limerick and Cork into Dublin, but I would like to point out that it strikes me as being very odd that sometimes when these roads are being repaired and a detour has to be made, you very often see them repairing the detour road while all the main traffic is upon it.  That occurred when the Limerick-Dublin road was closed a few months back and it was necessary to go, I think, through Borrisokane and Shinrone. I was held up for about 15 minutes one day because they were repairing the detour road.  Would it not be better to have the detour road repaired before the main road was closed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point that I forgot when speaking about the municipal council being established for the Dublin area was that I think something should be done&mdash;and the Minister's Department should throw out a hint to the authorities concerned&mdash;to provide better seaside facilities for the <Col N="2093" /> citizens of Dublin.  I have particularly in mind the inadequacy of the approach to Portmarnock strand where on certain fine week-ends as many as 20,000 to 30,000 people from Dublin go out to enjoy the few hours of sunshine they have.  It is impossible to bring even a bicycle down on the strand. The width of the road is very bad. There are no car parking facilities between Portmarnock and Malahide except along the roadside and it is as bad as Clonliffe Road on the day of an all-Ireland football final to see the cars parked along the road between Portmarnock and Malahide.</P>
      <P>There are various spots around Howth, Sutton and that area that could be improved if one local authority was concerned, but the position at the moment is that the Dublin County Council do not want to spend their ratepayers' money on such work because it is the citizens of another local authority who are using these places.  The Dublin Corporation does not want to spend money on them because they are in the county council area.  I think that the more this position is examined the more the Minister will agree, I would say, that these two local authorities and Dun Laoghaire Borough Council should be added together as one local authority to deal with the problems of Dublin and its environs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points that I would like to bring to the Minister's notice in connection with this Estimate.  The first one I would like to deal with is the question of roads.  I think there is need for a comprehensive plan to co-ordinate the efforts that are being made to-day to improve our road system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself has the biggest responsibility with regard to roads. All I am going to say at this stage in connection with roads is that the present efforts being made by local authorities and other responsible bodies should be integrated because, to a great extent, there is a waste of money under the present system.  I am not so concerned at the moment with the question of arterial roads or the main roads of the country.  I am more <Col N="2094" /> concerned with what Deputy Belton has described as link roads, county roads and cul-de-sac roads.  As far as I can see we have the position at the moment of three bodies dealing with roads, the Department of Local Government, local authorities and county councils, and the special employment schemes office.  I am convinced that with regard to the repair and maintenance of the third-class roads in rural areas there is overlapping of work by these Departments.  You have the position where there is the engineering staff of the Department of Local Government dealing with the question of main roads and with the improvement of county roads, and they are more or less in a supervisory category. Then you have the engineering staff attached to the various local authorities who again deal with the same roads.  In addition you have the engineering staff in the special employment schemes office dealing with by-roads, cul-de-sac roads and bog roads. There are times when the activities of the county councils and the special employment schemes office clash, and at the present time the situation is very unsatisfactory from the road point of view.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister was very reasonable in this House and I congratulated him at that time on the step he took in allowing a Private Members' Bill through here that for the first time gave authority to county councils to take over the repair of cul-de-sac and by-roads.  That action of the Minister's has indeed been deeply appreciated by the people who live on these by-roads.  It was really the first chance they got of having justice. They are all ratepayers and they have to pay substantial rates for the upkeep of main and county roads.  When, however, a road leading into a village was in need of repairs they had to pay a large portion of the cost in order to get the work done under a rural improvements scheme.  The Minister's action has had the effect of giving authority to the county councils to do that work in future.  Up to the time of the passing of that Act, local authorities had no power to do these roads.  If, at times, they did repair some of them the auditor subsequently <Col N="2095" /> surcharged the different county councils for carrying out this very urgent and important work.</P>
    <P>The passing of that Bill has brought matters to a head especially in County Roscommon.  The local authority there is very anxious to embark on a scheme which will have the result of bringing an extensive mileage in relation to by-roads into a good state of repair.  The money necessary to carry out this work will be raised from the rates but there is one difficulty that will have to be surmounted.  In the past a number of these roads have been repaired by the special employment schemes office and at the present time that office has a number of roads in Roscommon on their repairs list.  We cannot get a decision as to what roads should be left to the employment schemes office and what roads should not.  I do not wish to go into this in any detail because the question of bog roads and so forth enters into it.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like the Minister to arrange a conference between the representatives of the various county councils, the special employment schemes office and his own Department so that a plan might be worked out under which responsibility would be placed on the different authorities for the different types of roads and their repair.  He may not at the moment be aware of the fact that the Roscommon County Council has made an approach to his Department under the special employment schemes office to have such a conference.  I merely mention that here so that the Minister may be aware of the request of the Roscommon County Council.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Local Authorities (Works) Act, I take it there is no use at this stage asking for an increase in the allocation under that heading in the present financial year.  The amount has been allocated. Certain moneys have been sanctioned. I suppose there is no more money left in the kitty.  There is one point that worries me in connection with this allocation.  The sum allocated to County Roscommon under the Act this year is £8,000.  Anybody who knows County Roscommon realises that a sum <Col N="2096" /> of £8,000 is of very little use for expenditure on drainage work.  Roscommon is one of the longest counties in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesReidy" hpid="Mr. Reidy Mr. Reidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is wrong in that.  Galway is the longest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said one of the longest.  I do not dispute the fact that Galway is the longest.  Roscommon is bounded on one side by the River Suck, on the other side by the River Shannon, and on the northern end by two rivers dividing it from Sligo and Mayo respectively.  It is surrounded by water, but it is not an island.  There is dire need for drainage work in that county.  From that point of view, and from the point of view of the number of rivers in the county and around it, I think we should get a much larger allocation.  This year, counties in the Gaeltacht areas have received substantial grants towards the improvement of roads.</P>
      <P>While I thoroughly approve of road improvement, I hope that this is not a case of putting a hand into one pocket to take out this extra money to the detriment of the money allocated for drainage.  When we heard that a large amount of money would be made available for the improvement of roads, we took it that that money would be over and above the ordinary allocations for roads and drainage purposes but I am afraid that the extra allocation for the improvement of roads has resulted in our getting less for drainage.  From that point of view it looks to me as if we are robbing Peter to pay Paul.  I hope the Minister will comment on that in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister for the reduction that has taken place in the allocation under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Having studied the list I have here, I know that the allocation is worked on a percentage basis.  That percentage is based on the original request made by the county council, and I blame <i>in toto</i> the Roscommon County Council for failing in the first instance to demand a reasonable allocation.  In 1950, Leitrim got £62,000; Meath got £94,000; Wexford got £68,000; Wicklow £70,000, and a large county like Roscommon got only £50,000.  When I <Col N="2097" /> observe that, I can only lay the blame at the door of the Roscommon County Council, since they did not ask for a sum commensurate with their needs. It was left to the various county councils, after the passing of the Act, to ask for whatever sum they required provided they could expend the money in a productive and useful manner. Unfortunately, I was not a member of the county council at that time.  Had I been, I would have ensured a request for a much larger allocation.  I mention this because members of the county council and others have been inclined to blame the Department of Local Government and different Governments for the reductions for which they themselves are really responsible. When the allocations are being made next year, I appeal to the Minister to make available a much larger allocation under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  A tremendous amount of good work has been done under that Act and that, together with the work under the land project, has brought back into productivity many thousands of acres of land, especially in the poorer districts.  I need not tell the Minister what the value of one acre of reclaimed land is to a poor man.</P>
    <P>One acre of good land is of more importance to a smallholder and more precious in his eyes than perhaps 50 acres of land are in the eyes of the large rancher in the Midlands and possibly far more useful work will be done by the smallholder.</P>
    <P>I would support Deputy Belton on the question of car park attendants. This matter has become a real menace in Dublin.  It is impossible to park a car in any part of the city without having to hand over within two minutes.  I do not know whether these attendants look after a car or not but their demands are rather painful and annoying.  People shopping in Dublin may have to make calls in five or six streets.  If they bring their car into a street to collect parcels there is a demand made on them every time they stop.  Some of these attendants have brought the thing to a fine art.  I read recently the experience of a person who was a big game hunter in Africa. He described the technique of stalking <Col N="2098" /> game.  He said that when he came to Dublin and tried to get to his car without the attention of the car park attendant, the car park attendant was there before him.  They have become really skilful in extracting their pound of flesh.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister knows that proposals have been made for the erection in Athlone of a concrete permanent structure to replace the present bridge.  The existing bridge is a drawbridge and it is possible to swing it back to allow the passage of boats up and down the river.  There is a rumour afoot that the new bridge will be a permanent structure, the cost of which, presumably, would be only about one-fifth of the cost of a movable bridge.</P>
    <P>We should take into consideration more than actual cost.  The bridge in Athlone is the gateway to the West of Ireland.  Therefore, the charges in respect of the new structure should be borne by the central authority.  It is not fair that the local authority should have to bear the cost of this very necessary work.  Before the local authorities are allowed to go ahead with any scheme, I hope the whole question will be carefully examined by the Minister and his advisers.</P>
    <P>Many people believe that we are on the threshold of great developments in tourism.  Very little attention has been paid to tourism in inland districts.  The Shannon Valley cannot be excelled in this country as a tourist attraction, but as yet has not received due consideration.</P>
    <P>If steps are taken to develop the Shannon river and lakes as tourist centres, no doubt many sailing boats will be going to the upper reaches of the Shannon.  If the proposed new bridge takes the form of a fixed structure it will be impossible for craft to pass up and down.  These matters should be taken into consideration when the new bridge is being planned. Those responsible for the planning and erection of the bridge should realise their responsibility to those who come after them.  It would be tragic if a short-sighted view were taken and the matter was dealt with purely on the basis of saving money.  Future generations will not thank those who make a <Col N="2099" /> decision on such parsimonious grounds. I do not think that any decision has yet been made on the question as to whether the bridge will be a fixed or a movable structure.  That is why I mention the matter to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before referring to specific items some of which have been dealt with by previous speakers, I wish to refer to the over-all question of local government as it exists to-day.  The volume of public administration which is being canalised through local authorities is growing year by year, and it is doubtful if some reorganisation of the present system is not eminently necessary in order that the work may be carried out efficiently.  When local authorities were first established it was not contemplated that they would have to administer all the various schemes coming from different Departments with which they have to deal with now.  Local authorities deal, not merely with the Department of Local Government, but with the Department of Health, the Department of Social Welfare, marine works, harbour authorities and a thousand and one other things.  There is an increasing burden on the organisation.</P>
      <P>Since the first Local Government Act was passed we have had the Managerial Act, which very few Deputies will condemn as a failure, but most Deputies will agree that the time has come for an amendment of that Act in the light of experience of its operation.  Those are some of the broader points to which we would like the Minister to apply himself in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the question of housing, which seems to be one of the most important, if not the most important, problems under fire in this debate, I would like at the outset to congratulate the Minister on the increased contributions to local authorities under the various Housing Acts.  Those increases are indicative of his desire to press ahead with local authority housing as fast as possible, but no doubt we are bound to reach saturation point in that respect sooner or later, and the sooner the better.  The impact will be felt in the lack of employment when we reach <Col N="2100" /> the stage where we have fulfilled our requirements in so far as local authority housing is concerned.  We in Donegal have completed 407 houses. For a poor county like ours that is no mean achievement, and we have either in progress at the moment or under planning or consideration another 372. We are proud of our record in that respect. We have embarked on a system which I think is the most important housing system that we have yet embarked on, and one which I would recommend to the Minister that should be encouraged in all congested counties or in the poorer counties particularly. I refer to the scheme which we know as the specific instances scheme or procedure, under which we propose to build houses for persons who offer a site to the local authority free of charge or at a nominal figure.  It is really a continuation of the old representation system that existed under the board of health in days gone by when such houses were built under Section 29 of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1906.</P>
    <P>The houses then were built in specific instances for tenants who indicated to the local authority that they required a house and were not in a position to build that house themselves; and provided that their income or valuation was under a certain figure the local authority was empowered to build a house for them. Local authorities to-day have those powers under the 1948 Act.  We propose in Donegal at the moment to build some 148 houses under that scheme and in fact plans are ready. Applications for more than twice that number, I think, are in hand.  These houses for the moment are confined to persons on small holdings of a valuation of £5 or under but I think it is a most commendable scheme in that instead of building terraces or rows of houses in the villages and towns it permits a smallholder to have a local authority house built on his own small holding and enables him to remain there to pursue his ordinary work without moving in to become perhaps a burden on the local authority in a town or village where there might not be sufficient work for him.  Nearing the end of our requirements in local authority housing in the larger towns <Col N="2101" /> and villages we will find increasing demands for this type of house which we are building under the scheme known as specific instances procedure. I would like to have the Minister's views on what he contemplates to be the future of that scheme, and if he will give it every possible encouragement, since I believe that this type of housing is most suited to the rural areas, particularly in the congested areas and the poorer counties.  It is a scheme that will go a long way towards solving the rural slum problem eventually.</P>
    <P>It is important that when those houses are built, and in fact any houses, that the purchase scheme should be enforced or encouraged at the earliest possible date.  If new houses are allowed to remain too long before a purchase scheme is prepared repairs become necessary and you have an extra burden on the local authority to carry out those repairs; but if the purchase scheme is put into effect when the house is in a good state, when it is still new, the local authority will be spared that added burden of having to spend some thousands of pounds on these houses before finally a vesting order is signed. I think that most county managers and local authorities are alive to the importance of that particular problem. but it would be no harm if the Minister and his Department would give every encouragement to ensure that vesting takes place as soon as possible when the houses are new after occupation.</P>
    <P>Complaints with regard to the expense of costly houses were made by some Deputies here at the start of the debate.  I do not know whether it would be wise to embark on the cheaper type of house or not.  When I say the cheaper type, I mean one where you economise in materials and quality.  The better type of house pays in the long run.  I am sure that all counties have experience of the jerry-building done some years ago by the board of health in the various counties.  Sometimes the necessary attention was not paid to supervision of the work.  Houses were built then, in some cases, for a matter of £90 or <Col N="2102" /> £100, but as soon as they were built the local authority had to pay for costly repairs.  We had figures some years ago which I think would go to prove that it would have paid the local authority to hand such a house over free to the tenant at the time it was built.  It is a shortsighted policy to economise in the type of house, particularly in quality, when one is building. If we are to build houses let them be the best we can build, and in the long run they will justify being that type.</P>
    <P>I would like, in common with other Deputies, to make reference to the delay in payment of loans by local authorities under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  It is very easy for local government or county council officials to justify their action in this respect.  I have frequently drawn attention to it at meetings of the county council, but these people are always able to point out that they are handling public money and they were not prepared to hand it out <i>ad lib.</i> to anybody unless the necessary security was forthcoming, unless they were doubly secured that repayment of the loan with interest was assured.  They go on to point out that a first charge on the house alone is not sufficient, because if a tenant fails to repay the loan and if action has to be taken, local sympathy is aroused and people fail to come in and purchase the house and the local authority is left holding the baby.  I think we have passed from those days.  Any person building a house has no intention of defaulting, and I believe now, as I did always, that a first charge on the property is sufficient security for the local authority for the tenant to secure a loan.</P>
    <P>Not merely does the local authority require two personal securities in addition to a first charge on a house but they make all sorts of private inquiries regarding the <i>bona fides</i> of these people.  In fact, they are prepared to go to any limit to find out what their bank balances are like.  They must have bank references and, although they may be people who are large property owners, that does not justify their being taken as security.  The result is that the question of security is <Col N="2103" /> made so difficult that the average man of small means will not attempt to apply for a loan at all.  As has already been said here, the only person to whom a loan is given is the person who can do without it.  In addition to the generous grants available, these loans should be more easily procurable if we are to speed up private building.  I think that no local authority has any difficulty in ascertaining the type of person the applicant is or what likelihood there is of his repaying the loan.  I think the local authority has difficulty in ascertaining the standard of integrity of the applicant for a loan. All that information can be easily secured.  The local authority could then use its own discretion as to whether or not the person would require an additional personal security as well as a first charge on the property.</P>
    <P>Passing now from the question of loans, I should like to deal for a moment with the question of grants. Last year, we had serious complaints with regard to the delay in the payment of grants.  I want to compliment the Minister on his action in appointing to our county a separate inspector who has undoubtedly succeeded in expediting the payment of grants generally.  It is questionable whether he has yet sufficiently caught up with the arrears of work which were there when he took over.</P>
    <P>At that time, one inspector was dealing with three or four counties, and it was an impossibility for him to keep up to date.  As we pointed out at the time, delay in the payment of grants nullifies the effect of these grants in so far as few builders can obtain the material from the builders' providers for such a long term as a year or more unless they are paid portion of the grant.  I think we have overcome that difficulty to a great extent.  I find that the Minister and his Department are willing, whenever it is necessary, to have the grant paid to the provider and that a certificate will be issued saying that the grant will be paid to the provider where it would be otherwise impossible for the builder to <Col N="2104" /> secure the material on credit.  There is just this difficulty cropping up with regard to the 1952 Act where a supplementary grant is obtainable from the local authority.  There is, as you know, a means test, with regard to certain applicants under that Act.  In order to enforce this means test, in order to administer this scheme properly, it is necessary to carry out prolonged investigations into the means and the income of the different applicants.  That procedure is both humiliating and discouraging to the people concerned.  I think that if the managers or officials of the various local authorities could come together and arrive at some general system whereby applicants would be accepted as being entitled to this supplementary grant, it might help to cut a lot of the red tape or it might help to short-circuit the slow system on which they are proceeding at the moment.  Farmers whose valuation is under the statutory limit&mdash;I forget what the statutory limit is at the moment, but I think it is in the neighbourhood of £30&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy's train of thought, but is it not a fact that if a person is entitled to something under the law of the land he is entitled to get it and, that being so, why should he submit himself to a county manager&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One would expect that a man who is held to be in the category of an agricultural labourer or a farmer under the statutory valuation would be entitled to a supplementary grant without any further investigation. Yet the local authority proceed to find out his income and the income of his wife, if any, and the income of any members of his family who may be working.  They consider his income over the past year.  That procedure would lead one to think that the applicant does not come within the category specified in the Act&mdash;a farmer under a specified poor law valuation or an agricultural labourer&mdash;and is not entitled to benefit under the Act in relation to the supplementary county council <Col N="2105" /> grant.  I should like the Minister to initiate some means of short-circuiting the prolonged investigation that must go on in order to ascertain whether or not a person is entitled to that supplementary grant, and in order to ascertain whether his income is above the limit specified to entitle him to all or part of the grant which is available.</P>

      <P>I have a case in point which I should like to mention to the Minister.  Take, for instance, an inshore fisherman who applies to have a supplementary grant paid in respect of the reconstruction of his house or in respect of the building of a new house.  The local authority send him a query to find out his landings and his earnings from fishing in the previous year and the amount of unemployment assistance he received during those periods when he was unemployed. He would, further, have to state whatever income his wife earned, if any, and the income of any members of his family who might have been employed during the period.  The home assistance officer makes inquiries. The rate collector makes discreet inquiries and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>You ought to be able to clear that up yourselves now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2106" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have the backing of the Minister in our efforts to do that.  I should also like to recommend that the Minister should encourage the building of more houses under the economic rents system.  There are white collar workers in every area who are not in a financial position to build houses for themselves.  I readily admit that houses are being provided under the economic rents system in many cases but the number so provided is not sufficient to meet the requirements of all those people who are just as entitled to a house as any other person. The fact that economic rents can be secured for these houses means that the local authority would not be involved in any loss.  I think more of those houses should be built.</P>
      <P>Another point I want to stress is the importance of repairs to certain cul-de-sac roads&mdash;roads which, in coastal counties, lead to the sea and which are possibly not regarded as cul-de-sac roads.  There is scarcely a coastal town in Ireland that has not one or two outlets from the main road, or from the town itself, to the sea, and very often one finds the main road in a perfect state of repair while the road to the sea is in a very bad condition. They are in some cases not even in a proper state of repair for use by farmers bringing sea-weed, gravel, or sand from the sea.  Yet these are the roads that are used by tourists in the summer and they create a very bad impression. These roads are sometimes perhaps half a mile or 100 yards in length, but the fact remains that they give a very poor impression to the people using them.  These outlets from coastal towns to the sea are very important, but our engineering staffs are not so worried about these roads so long as the main arteries from one town to another are kept in a proper state of repair.  I have heard other Deputies commending the good work being done on main roads, and I am thoroughly in agreement with them, but I must remind the House that the back roads, the second-class roads and particularly these little outlets to the sea, are just as important as, and in some cases more important than, the main road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2107" /> I should like to conclude on the note on which I commenced with regard to the overall position of local government generally.  We often had demands in the past that such matters as responsibility for mental hospitals should be a direct charge on the Exchequer. People say that everything in regard to public administration is centralised in Dublin City, so that if we are to conduct so much of our public work through the local authorities, that, in itself, is a form of decentralised administration. I think the machinery to deal with it should be reorganised, and the time is overdue for a complete reorganisation of the system of local government so as to gear up the machinery of local authorities sufficiently to enable them to deal with the increasing volume of work which is being foisted on them year after year.</P>
    <P>If the Minister contemplates an amendment of the managerial system, I suggest that his keynote should be more reliance on the elected member of the local authority and more dependence on what advice he is capable of giving to the administrative staff in each county.  By that means, he would decentralise a good deal of public administration and show these people who are entrusted with the onerous work of carrying on local affairs that he has a certain confidence in their work.  They will then undoubtedly feel a greater responsibility on their shoulders and will discharge their duties even more efficiently than they are doing at present.</P>

It would, indeed, be very interesting if we had in this Vote the amount of money paid by local authorities during the past 12 months to these professional gentlemen.  I had occasion at a recent meeting of my local authority to refer to these people, and I had no hesitation in stating that they appear to me to have a stranglehold on the local authorities in this country.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked me if I was referring to Youghal Bridge and I was answering him.  I believe the system should be changed and various members of local authorities believe that it should be changed. There is no justification whatever for paying these people, first, on a percentage basis&mdash;quantity surveyors, architects, consulting engineers and so on.  Of the total cost of any big jobs carried through, they get, on the average, 10 per cent., and, into the bargain, the higher they make the estimates, the more cash they have out of them.  That is a system which could be reviewed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, we could.  If we look at the Book of Estimates, we will see what the Department is paying to what I feel sure are very competent men.  We find that, in the engineering services section, the <Col N="2109" /> chief engineering adviser to the Department is on a salary scale of £1,465 to £1,800 maximum; in the roads and sanitary services section, the assistant chief engineering adviser has a maximum salary of £1,465; the senior architectural inspector employed by the Department is on a salary scale of £965 to £1,215; and the senior architectural or engineering inspector has a maximum salary of £965.  These are the sums paid to men who are competent in engineering and architectural works. How does that rate of remuneration compare with that of some of the people employed as consultants by local authorities?</P>
      <P>When we got some information as to the figures which we in the Cork County Council were paying consultants some two or three years ago, we found that some of these gentlemen, in the course of a number of years, have got not only a five figure sum of money from the county council but a sum bordering on six figures, for advice which they gave to that council. Surely it is time to put an end to these people imposing on local authorities.  I know very well that they are able and capable men, but they have not a monopoly of capabilities in that particular line, and I feel sure that the Minister could devise a system whereby we would have some architects employed in the Department who could be lent to the different local authorities who may have schemes to prepare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is about time that these private architects and consulting engineers throughout the country were brought to their senses and that an end was put to some of their tactics.  It is not so long <Col N="2110" /> since the county council of which I am a member were discussing the erection of two court-houses in County Cork.  It was made very clear that if these court-houses were erected, the work in each case, so far as the structure was concerned, at all events, would be similar in all respects, and there could not be much difference as far as the site was concerned.  Yet the architects were to get paid on a double scale, they were to get a double set of fees for the one design, and on every building built to a similar design they were to be paid as well.  I do not want to reflect on these professional people unduly, but I think it is about time that the State aided local authorities to offset the methods adopted by these people.  So far as sanitary services and the fees paid to consulting engineers are concerned, I think the people of the country would be amazed if they got the figures.  I sought the figures for our own county here in the Dáil some time ago, and I am sure the Minister was ashamed to tell me what they were.  Instead, he advised me to seek the information through the local council.</P>
      <P>To my mind this is a very big question, one to which the Minister and his advisers should address their attention without delay.  It is a position that needs rectification.  It is a scandalous state of affairs that these people should get away with fees of thousands upon thousands of pounds for work which men of equal capabilities in the Department of Local Government carry out for £1,300 or £1,400 a year.  I think I am right in stating that if an architect designs a certain building, that design is submitted to the Custom House for approval, that the senior architectural inspector there will see to that design and that it is within his competence to decide whether the design should be approved or not.  If he is capable of carrying out that work at a salary of £1,400 a year, surely he ought to be capable of drawing up the plan himself?  If he is capable of examining the plan which is submitted to him, he should be capable of drawing up the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy MacCarthy mentioned a <Col N="2111" /> while ago we could employ 12 or 13 architects for what one of these boys get out of schemes down the country. I do not want to say too much on that point.  In this line of life, we have to say unpleasant things at times, much as we dislike it, but I do say that the time is at hand when the system of payment of fees to these people should be reviewed and that, so far as the Local Government Department is concerned, there is a responsibility on the Minister to see that the position is reviewed.  I might mention before leaving this question that the position worsened so much in Cork that we took it on ourselves recently to appoint a county architect to deal with all building problems in the county.  That, I think, was a step in the right direction and I believe that, as a result, Cork County Council will save a good deal of money that they were paying hitherto to private architects.  I think it would be a good line if the Minister were to advise other counties to take similar action.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that, so far as sanitary services are concerned, we have not yet adopted a similar step. That work is left to private consulting engineers and the fees demanded of us&mdash;and I am sure the same happened in other counties&mdash;some few years ago were frightful.  I think the county council paid out £40,000 or £50,000 to a consulting engineer&mdash;a sum that the average individual would scarcely earn in a lifetime.  I hope that when this Vote comes before the House in 12 months' time, this system will have been changed and that we shall not be obliged in local authorities throughout the country to pay the exorbitant fees that we are at present compelled to pay.  I suppose they are quite entitled to avail of the opportunity to demand such fees when they are getting them so &ldquo;soft&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As mentioned by a number of Deputies, the question of housing is one of the most important that arises on this Estimate.  I am quite satisfied with the housing position at the present time because I believe that the Minister has very wisely adopted <Col N="2112" /> the policy of his two immediate predecessors in office.  I believe that while he is not putting the same push behind the housing drive as they did, at the same time he is following their very good example to a certain degree. So long as he follows their example I feel sure that in time our housing problems will be adjusted.</P>
    <P>This question of providing local authority houses is probably one which concerns members of this House and members of local authorities more than any other.  We all know that a decent house is the first essential for any family but unfortunately the position at the present time is that it costs a lot of money to provide a decent house.  Local authorities are faced with a very big problem, some of them at any rate, in meeting the housing requirements of the people. It is a problem that they cannot escape because there is a definite obligation on local authorities to provide houses for people who have not the wherewithal themselves to do so.  Mention was made by the previous Minister for Local Government, Deputy Keyes, of the cost of house building at the present time.  I represent a constituency where local authority houses in some districts cost more, I would say, than in any other district in the country.  In some cases we paid for the building of an ordinary non-municipal house a sum of £1,600 or £1,700.  I think that is an exorbitant figure.</P>
    <P>When discussing the Estimate 12 months ago, I remember mentioning that these high costs were due to the fact, in my opinion, that there is a ring so far as building contractors in that particular area are concerned. There are a few contractors so well favoured by the local authority that irrespective of what tender they put in, we get the recommendation: &ldquo;Give him the contract; he will give you a decent house.&rdquo;  I very much regret to have to speak in these terms in regard to matters happening in my own constituency, but when we have that ring amongst builders&mdash;and Deputies from different parts of the country have mentioned that the same conditions apply in their area&mdash;we <Col N="2113" /> must try to rectify the position.  I believe the only way we can do that is by adopting the direct labour system of building, and examine the prices at which we can build houses under that system side by side with the prices tendered for by private contractors.</P>
    <P>In advocating the direct labour system of building, I may say that I am one of those who believe in private enterprise.  Unfortunately, however, I know very well that that system can be abused and is being abused in a particular way by many building contractors. If it were not abused, I would be satisfied with the system, because I like very much to see young people or others who have a little capital and who have the initiative trying to do their best to develop their business.  I like that system very much but, so far as building is concerned, the idea is to wipe the small man out of business by endeavouring in some cases to get responsible officials to report that his work would be likely to be unsatisfactory. That has happened in a few cases in West Cork and probably in other places.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are building many houses at present and I think there is no need for them to farm out their work to some other person.  Is it not only natural that the other person will only accept that work if he believes he will have a reasonable profit out of it?  Taxation and rates are high enough at present without giving a third party a profit which there is no need for.  Surely every local authority is well equipped with engineering advisers, who are, or should be, quite competent to design houses&mdash;and I do not see why a general specification would not suffice in most districts&mdash;and to see that the proper people will be appointed to supervise the building of the houses and that the work will be carried out in as economic a fashion as is possible.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Minister and on every local authority to build a good type of house at the lowest possible price.  I have read statements in the Press in various parts of the country with regard to this direct labour system and I have had <Col N="2114" /> experience of it in West Cork.  There is no doubt that the results were most beneficial so far as public funds are concerned.  At the minimum, there was a saving of well over £100 on every house built by the direct labour system. With these good results from that system in almost every county&mdash; we have had them in Waterford, Limerick, Wicklow and Wexford&mdash;I cannot see why that system cannot be availed of to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Local Government also spoke about the undesirability of importing foreign roofing materials for houses.  He mentioned that that had a bearing on the cost of construction and that there was no need for this importation because we have plenty of housing materials in this country if they were properly developed.  Slates are one of the principal items so far as house building is concerned.  I have mentioned on a few occasions already in this House the peculiar position existing in West Cork, where we have extensive slate deposits, that houses are being built by local authorities which are roofed with foreign material.  We hear a lot about the extra cost of houses, about unemployment, about emigration, and I think it is a shame in this little country of ours that when we have the raw material right under our feet we do not avail of it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to use his influence with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, who, apparently, is in charge of industrial development in the congested districts, to try and develop these mineral resources of ours.  There is no need for me to elaborate on the advantages of that.  It is peculiar that in my constituency at least we are importing foreign roofing for houses, while everyone knows that we have plenty of slates available at home.  The unfortunate position with regard to these slate quarries, especially a few of the bigger ones, is that private enterprise has more or less failed to develop them, not because they were uneconomic but, as everybody knows, as a result of mismanagement.  If <Col N="2115" /> private enterprise fails to develop our slate industry, it is a matter for the State to do it.  If these people fail in their obligation to develop the resources of our country, the State should compensate them and carry out the work.</P>
    <P>The big question confronting wouldbe-tenants of houses is how they will be able to meet the local authority demands so far as rents and rates are concerned.  As houses, unfortunately, are costing a lot of money to build, it is only natural that the rents of these houses must be fairly substantial having regard to the general income of the people of this country.  In many districts it is difficult for a local authority to provide houses and to get an economic rent for them.  To my mind, there is an obligation on them to try to do the best they possibly can. I believe that the only system under which that obligation can be honoured to the fullest extent possible is the differential rent system.  I am in entire agreement with that system.  I know that in a few towns and villages in West Cork a number of people, owing to circumstances beyond their control, have to live on public assistance or very meagre incomes.  It is impossible for them to pay more than a nominal rent for a house.  This differential rent system would be a great benefit to these people.  I have no doubt that no taxpayer or ratepayer would object to such persons, many of them suffering from some physical infirmity, getting houses at a nominal rent.</P>
    <P>There are, however, other people in some of these houses with fairly substantial incomes.  If their incomes are fairly substantial, I cannot see why their neighbours or the local authority should be asked to subsidise them.  If the Minister or a local authority thinks that the people occupying these houses are able to pay an economic rent, then there should be an economic rent put on the houses.  It is as reasonable to make that statement as it is to say that people who are not in a position to pay any more than a nominal rent should be given these houses at 1/- or 2/- a week.  That is the most satisfactory <Col N="2116" /> and the fairest and best solution for this problem.  Unfortunately, in many parts of the country a number of people who are living under wretched housing conditions cannot avail of houses built mainly for them because of the excessive rents.  When that happens, other people see their opportunity and become the tenants of these houses.  Many of these people could very well afford to pay an economic rent.  I have no objection to any Minister or local authority seeking to get economic rents from that type of people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government is an exceptionally busy man of late. He is in Carlow one day, Cork another day and Donegal the next day opening new housing schemes.  I have no fault to find with the system.  I think it is a desirable practice.  As I mentioned at the outset, the Minister has wisely followed to some degree the footsteps of his predecessors in other lines, and I think he has followed their footsteps in that particular line as well.  It is rather peculiar for the present Minister and, indeed, for the members of the Government Party to adopt the system which they so strongly condemned when they were in opposition. When the present Minister was in opposition, he termed more or less as a racket the idea of a Minister, with a host of officials, going around the country opening new housing schemes.  If it was not a commendable practice then, surely it is not any more commendable to-day.  The fact that the Minister and his colleagues on the Fianna Fáil Benches did not know what they were talking about at that time is clearly illustrated as they are now adopting that system on a far greater scale.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the question of helping in so far as it is possible people who are desirous of providing their own homes.  I think that is a commendable idea.  By doing so, not only are we saving local authorities from the expense of providing the people with homes&mdash;some of them would come within the scope of our housing activities&mdash;but we are giving these people a certain sense of independence to enable them to build <Col N="2117" /> houses for themselves.  The loans made available by local authorities under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts were chiefly designed for that purpose but, as mentioned by the Deputy from Donegal, this system is not working smoothly because, as he said, you must make it clear to the local authority that you scarcely want a loan at all and that you must be a person of independent means before your application will be considered.</P>
    <P>I think some direction from the Local Government Department should be given to the local authorities so far as that particular measure is concerned. Most&mdash;not all, I believe&mdash;local authorities demand that along with having a first charge on the house they must get two solvent sureties before they will advance a loan.  I believe that a man who can provide two solvent sureties to the extent of £1,400 or £1,500 to get a loan from the council to build his house is a man who has sufficient resources to build one himself. I know very well that in Cork County a fair number of the people who avail of the loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts are people of independent means&mdash;people who, if this Act were never in existence, could build houses and have sufficient capital to do so.  Their main reason for applying for the loan is that they do not want to disturb capital. Probably it is also beneficial in so far as income-tax and surtax are concerned.</P>
    <P>That is the type of person who avails of this scheme.  Members of local authorities get a list of the people who avail of the scheme in a district.  I know some of the people and they are quite well off.  The honest worker, the honest small farmer and the honest small businessman cannot get guarantors for the loan.  It has been said by county managers and by departmental officials that there is no reason why an honest man should not be able to get sureties.</P>
    <P>Take the case of a worker earning £6 or £7 a week, a small farmer whose income may not be that amount at all or a businessman.  They go to their nearest friends to get them to go security for a loan from the council. <Col N="2118" /> These people are faced with the prospect that they cannot see what is going to happen within the next 35 years. The applicant for the loan might die in a year's time or he might meet with some family misfortune.  The guarantor would be liable for the loan.  The result is that he would not like to go security as it would be unwise having regard to family responsibilities.  Consequently, in County Cork&mdash;I am sure it is the same in other counties&mdash;many honest people of small means cannot avail of the loan.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in the loans that are made available under that scheme by reason of the fact that so many people have approached me with a view to getting some modification. The Minister or the county manager may say that there is no obligation on a county council to loan money without getting the same security for it as a bank or any private concern.  I think the position is somewhat different.  The local authorities are playing with public money. When I say that I believe there is an obligation on the local authorities to be just as careful about this money and its expenditure an any private individual.  If the local authority are satisfied, after making inquiries, that the character of an applicant for a loan is all right, that his financial standing is reasonable, I think that should be quite sufficient.  So far as my information goes that system is in operation in some counties and is working smoothly.</P>
    <P>I advocate that local authorities should be allowed to build cottages for small farmers.  There is no rigid rule at present but local authorities are very reluctant to build a cottage for a man with a valuation of more than £5 or £6.  I believe that sum should be raised.  In the southern and western parts of the country there are a number of small farmers living in wretched conditions so far as housing is concerned.</P>

      <P>We have a peculiar position obtaining in that people from whom land has been acquired by local authorities find it very difficult to get paid for that land. I know a number of people who had no objection whatsoever to giving their land, having regard to the fact that the local authorities required their land for useful purposes.  They handed over the land to the local authority without any need of an inquiry.  In a number of these cases&mdash;it appears to be widespread&mdash;there is some question of title involved and in many of them no payment is made or is likely to be made for years to come, and probably never.  I know a few people who gave land willingly to the local authority and they have not so far been paid. Their legal adviser told them that he could do nothing more than he had done to trace their title.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When such a case arises I believe that if the local authority had the permission of the Department it could meet the position in this way: if no proper title is forthcoming from the owner or reputed owner, why not have a notice published in the local newspapers stating that such a person is to be paid for a particular parcel of land within 21 days of the publication of the notice unless objections are received from other people claiming that they are the owners?  I think that should meet the situation in regard to all these cases where a question of title arises.  I believe that if that practice were adopted it would mean that in scarcely any of these cases would you have any objections.  I think that the present position is very unfair to some of those people&mdash;I am sure that they are to be found in every part of the country&mdash;who were considerate in <Col N="2120" /> giving land, in many cases without any objection whatever, to find that they now cannot get one penny for it and are not likely to get payment in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not intend saying too much on the question of roads and road maintenance. I agree, in the main, with the remarks of Deputy Brennan when he said that too much money is being made available for the main roads in comparison to the sums allocated for the county roads.  We all know of the obligation there is on every local authority to see that its main roads are maintained up to a good standard. I believe that is being done at present. During the past five or six years, local authorities in general have given close and careful consideration to the improvement of the main roads, and very good work is being done throughout the country.  However, as far as the county roads are concerned, those of us who have a knowledge of the rural districts, cannot appreciate very much either the efforts of the local authorities or of the Department. Many people who live in isolated districts claim, with a certain amount of justification, that the county councils or the Department are only concerned with the main roads, or with roads contiguous to big towns and cities.  I think that the people in the isolated districts are entitled to some consideration.</P>
    <P>I see here from a document that, on the average, it is estimated that it costs £156 a mile to maintain the roads of the country.  I know roads in my own district, and I am sure other Deputies can say the same of their districts, on which not even £3 a mile is being expended.  Of course, these roads have not the same public utility value as the other roads I speak of, but I think that the people who live on them are entitled to more consideration.</P>
    <P>So far as the road grants are concerned. I know that some Deputies appreciate very much the fact that increases are being made available this year.  We know very well, of course, where the money to meet these increases is coming from.  While we are thankful that the grants are <Col N="2121" /> being increased, I think we need feel no appreciation, so far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned, because we know where the Minister got this money.  He got it from increased taxation on such people as hackney and taxi drivers, from people who require motors for their business and from many struggling lorry owners, during the past year.  I think that he is keeping a little of it in reserve for himself and is not making available in these grant increases the full amount that he got by way of the increased taxation.  He is not giving all of it to the local authority for road improvement.  I hope, however, that more attention will be paid to the county roads improvement scheme, and that, possibly in the near future, the Department may adopt the system they have adopted in regard to the main roads, that is, by providing the county councils with 40 per cent. of the maintenance charges for these county roads.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the Local Authorities (Works) Act which has already been mentioned by various Deputies.  I think it is quite clear that irrespective of the side of the House on which a rural Deputy sits, all of them are of the same opinion&mdash;some of them, of course, cannot express their opinion&mdash;that the rejection of this measure, to a great extent, by the present Minister for Local Government was a retrograde step.  I think that point of view is generally accepted. Everyone knows the dual benefit which it conferred on the people in the rural areas.  Not only was it of great benefit to farmers and others, but it provided our workers with productive employment. Deputy Keyes, I think, mentioned that when he was Minister for Local Government in March, 1950, we had almost 14,000 people employed as a result of the passing of that Act. To-day, as a result of the present Minister's rejection of the scheme which was so beneficial to the rural areas, we have only 1,500 or 1,600 employed.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention that the Minister, when replying on this Estimate, 12 months ago, gave as one <Col N="2122" /> of his reasons for cutting down the money that had been voted for this scheme in previous years, the fact that the engineers had been quite careless so far as their inspection of works under it was concerned.  Indeed, he made the case that some of the county engineers were so careless that they never even examined the works, and that the money expended on them was, according to the Minister, wantonly wasted.  As I mentioned at the time to the Minister, if that was the position then there was a definite obligation on him to make the fullest inquiries, and to bring to justice those county engineers who, according to him, had wantonly wasted public funds by their failure to make a proper inspection of a number of these schemes under the Act.  I should like to know from the Minister whether, since making that statement a year ago, he has taken the steps which, as Minister for Local Government, he should take, to bring these people to justice.  Money is scarce enough in this country without having these gentlemen, who are fairly well paid, wantonly wasting it, as the Minister alleged.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McQuillan that there is no use in appealing to any Fianna Fáil Minister to make an increase in the grants under that particular scheme.  I believe that we will have to wait in patience until the next general election when, I am of opinion, a different Minister will be in power.  Deputies who are particularly interested in these schemes can then stand up here and address a Minister who will be fully in favour of restoring the sums formerly allocated under the Act during that period that the inter-Party Government was in power.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by asking the Minister, in so far as he possibly can, to examine the question that I raised in regard to guarantees for loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts. I would also ask him to examine this question as to the likelihood of giving maintenance grants to local authorities for the upkeep of county roads.  In common with other Deputies who have referred to this subject, I believe that if some more money were made available for county roads it would be a <Col N="2123" /> marked advantage to the unfortunate people who have to live in isolated parts of the country.  We cannot all live in Dublin; some people must live in remote areas.  I would make a particular appeal for some more assistance for the county road system.  There is so much money being expended at the present time that county roads are deserving of more than they get.</P>

      <P>In view of the very comprehensive speech delivered here by Deputy Sweetman and the contributions made by other Deputies which have covered all the ground and because it is rather boring to be listening to repetitive statements, I intend to be very brief.  In fact, I do not think I would have intervened in this debate if it had not been for the matters dealt with by Deputy Murphy in connection with the reduction in the Estimate under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not know if the Government realise the mistake that has been made in this connection.  Regardless of politics, everybody in this country recognises the valuable work that has been done under that scheme.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister has any better right to know than ordinary people throughout the country who can see with their own eyes what has been done.  They will admit that no matter what their political convictions are and no matter how they vote.  I have no hesitation in saying that never in my own memory was there legislation introduced in this native Parliament that conferred such benefit on the agricultural and rural community in general&mdash;including the young working man&mdash;as the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It was the most judicious form of Government investment ever made in Ireland simply because you were bringing back into full production the land that for years had been lying unproductive.  This work was being <Col N="2124" /> carried out in conjunction with the land rehabilitation scheme and you cannot successfully operate the land rehabilitation scheme until you create the outfall to take off the water. The land rehabilitation scheme inspectors know that just as well as I do, and they are telling tenants throughout the country the same tale day in and day out: &ldquo;We know that we could do a good job for you but we must wait for the county council to make the outfall.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This scheme was also providing employment on a very large scale for the young men of this country.  I cannot understand how the present Government, recognising the popularity of that scheme&mdash;and they must recognise it&mdash;could agree to cut down that Estimate.  I think it was politically suicidal and I know there are Fianna Fáil supporters in my own constituency who share the views I am expressing now.  The sooner the Government realise the mistake that has been made and rectify it the better it will be for themselves and for the country.</P>

      <P>It may be true that in the Minister's constituency in Cavan work was ill-done but it was not under the Local Authorities (Works) Act that certain county council schemes have been ill-done and were glossed over.  I do agree with the Minister that there may be some engineers who do not wish to go off the road to inspect field drainage.  He is perfectly right there but where you have proper supervision the scheme will work smoothly.  In some instances, of course, supervision was not necessary because the men working on these jobs were benefiting directly themselves by the carrying out of the work and they took an interest in it.  In such cases it was money well spent.  The sooner we get back to that stage the better, although I do not think there is any indication that the present Government intends to retrace its steps in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2125" /> I spoke at such length on a motion in connection with this matter that I do not want to repeat what I have said, but I am sincere and quite serious in asking the Government to examine that question again to see if they cannot make substantial grants available to the local authorities for the carrying out of these drainage works. There is no sense in increasing the grants being made available under the land rehabilitation scheme and cutting down on those under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  The two schemes are interdependent and the successful operation of the one depends on the successful operation of the other.</P>
    <P>Can anyone imagine for one moment that conditions in regard to rural employment would be as they are if it were not for the drastic reduction in that Estimate?  Do the Minister and the Government not realise that the present conditions with regard to rural employment are terrifying?  On one small scheme in my constituency where there is an expenditure of about £2,500 or £3,000, the supervisor has applications from 150 men and all he can take on is 20.  I made an appeal to the county engineer to try to introduce rotational employment so that all the workers would get a slice.  What I am saying applies in every part of my constituency.  That situation would not exist if you had the drainage carried out under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>It is true that this debate has concentrated itself more or less on housing.  I am glad to hear the Minister say that many local authorities see the solution of that problem in sight.  That does apply in my own constituency with regard to urban housing.  We are nearly at the end of the problem in that direction but in regard to rural housing practically nothing has been done.  I submit that there is a great necessity for rural housing.  The towns have had a pretty good time of it for many years past, but in the rural areas the people are living under shocking conditions. Notwithstanding generous grants from the Government and local authorities, those people cannot attempt to build <Col N="2126" /> their houses.  Something will have to be done in that matter.  I cannot offer a solution myself.  You see townlands with small thatched cottages clustered together, where the means are very meagre and the income is very small. That is a problem that it will take a lot of finance to remedy.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act will cure the problem. Many people do not want to go into debt: they have an ancient traditional horror of debt.  The Department should give serious thought to the provision of a scheme for them.  I do not think that within our lifetime we will be able to say we have solved the rural housing problem.</P>
    <P>I heard comments here on the operation of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act.  In my constituency I have received no complaints about it.  It is true that guarantors are required for an applicant.  People responsible for the administration of public money&mdash;such as the county council or the Agricultural Credit Corporation&mdash;have an obligation to the public and the taxpayer and they are entitled to take all reasonable measures to ensure that the borrower will be able to repay or, if he fails, that there will be someone else who will pay.</P>
    <P>That is common sense.  If a man cannot get two of his neighbours to sign a guarantee for him he is not very creditworthy and it would be difficult to get an ordinary individual to lend his money to him.  Why then should a local authority, handling the taxpayers' money, take the risk? I would not find any fault at all with the operation of that particular scheme.  However, although in the long run it does not affect the finances of the local authority, it is putting a strain on them to finance all the applicants.  When you add the grants given by the local authority for housing generally, you see they are taking on a big responsibility.  They would need to keep an eye on their accounts to make sure they are not outstepping safe ground.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the increased road grants&mdash;substantial increases for main roads and for <Col N="2127" /> county road improvement-but he would be making a mistake if he thinks that all those increases go to additional employment of men.  They do not.  A very substantial proportion of that money will go to the purchase of material, particularly tar, which will not give any direct employment at all. The results of the increased road grants, from the employment end, are not very appreciable.</P>
    <P>I agree with those who say we are giving too much attention to main roads.  For years and years the main roads have been the baby of every county council and have been well-nursed. The ordinary county roads have not had the same attention. This aspect is aggravated very seriously by the fact that you have now a type of traffic travelling over those roads which they were never intended to bear.  Having regard to the very heavy vehicular traffic, the upkeep of county roads in the future will be a very heavy burden on the rates.  I made a suggestion here before and I repeat it, that there should be a limitation on the weight of vehicles operating on the different county roads.  The really heavy traffic should be prevented from using many of those roads at all, although it might be inconvenient for vehicles to go a few miles round by the main road. You have ten ton lorries at present, sometimes with a ten ton trailer, travelling over roads with bog foundations. No amount of money expended on such roads will keep them in repair.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Murphy dealt at length with architects' fees.  I hope the Minister, who was listening to him attentively, will bear in mind what he said.  I consider it a scandal that public money should be raked in from local authorities in such architects' fees.  Last year, I made an appeal to the Minister not to insist on an architect's opinion on any job for a council under £5,000.  I wonder if Deputies realise the racket that is going on in this connection.  In the case of one doctor's residence being erected by a local authority at a cost of £8,000, <Col N="2128" /> before one brick or stone went into it the architect had raked in £1,900&mdash;for that one building.  That is typical of what is going on throughout the country every week.  Primarily, the Department of Local Government is responsible, because it insists that the architect have a hand in it.  We could have got a decent house built for a land steward in Castlerea but for the insistence on the architect's entry into the business.  An ordinary house, and to my mind, an ugly looking house, was erected for £3,225.  If we had been left to our own discretion, with our own staff we could have erected as good a house, if not a better one, for £2,000. It is absurd that in every little thing like this the architect or the consulting engineer must be brought in, to pile on unnecessary expense and for no other purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the same Deputy that a lot of economy could be made by erecting county council houses by direct labour.  I was under that impression and so were several of my colleagues on Roscommon County Council. We thought that tenders by private builders were exorbitant and decided to have one scheme in Boyle done by direct labour.  When we had the development work done and the houses complete, I can assure you there was very little difference between the cost to us and the tender by the private builder.  I was astonished to find that out myself, but it was so&mdash;the difference was negligible.  I cannot understand how it is, but if any local authorities intend to erect their houses by direct labour they will need to provide constant supervision.  Even then it is doubtful if they can make a very big saving on them.</P>
    <P>The cost of housing of all types to-day is really the most regrettable feature of this whole problem.  It does seem impossible that a cottage or an ordinary dwelling that the county council will erect must cost £1,500 or £1,600.  You would wonder where the money goes to.  I am afraid we have a long time to wait before there is any appreciable decrease in that.</P>
    <P>The question of the rate of interest has been mentioned by Deputy Sweetman <Col N="2129" /> in connection with the cost of housing.  It may not form a very important factor; but it is a factor; and in view of the fact that interest rates are being reduced, I would appeal to the Minister in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to give those who contemplate borrowing money for the erection of houses the benefit of that decrease.  There are, I know, in my county a number of people who did contemplate building houses before the change in the rate of interest.  In the country, unlike the city, written contracts are not a common feature.  You go to a contractor and ask him if he will build a house for you.  He says he will, and you give him an idea of the kind of house you require.  In very few cases have you a written contract at all, and I think the Department are insisting that only on the evidence of a written contract will they give people the benefit of the lower rate of interest.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask them to bear in mind the custom that exists in the country as distinct from the city of not having written contracts, and if there is any indication that a man intended to build a house when the rate was £3 15s. per £100, or if he had taken any steps to build that house, that should be taken as sufficient evidence that he did intend to build and he should be entitled to the lower rate of interest on his loan.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to learn in one scheme in Roscommon town that the change in the rate of interest from £3 15s. over to the new rate meant a difference of £240 in the cost of the house.  That is an important figure for the man who is getting the house and probably investing all the capital he has accumulated in it.  It is an important amount of money over the period.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister in that connection where there was any evidence at all that people intended to build that such people would get the benefit of loans at the lower rate of interest.  I would make a final appeal to him on that matter which is for me at any rate the most important matter <Col N="2130" /> coming within the sphere of his activity, and that is the Local Authorities (Works) Act, to see if he can induce the Department of Finance to let him restore the grants which were cut.  I think he will find that in doing that he is making a wise move for himself and for his Government. Let me frankly say I wish his Government good luck.  I want to see them do a good day's work while they are in office.  As far as I am concerned anything they do to their credit I will give them credit for it with pleasure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister was too complacent in his introductory speech about the rate of housing progress. While a good deal has been achieved since the end of the war, the more recent figures which were given by the Minister would indicate that the same rate of progress is not being maintained every year.  A reply by the Minister to a parliamentary question in December, 1952, Volume 135, No. 8, reported in column 1163, sets out the figures for the number of houses in progress, the numbers for which tenders had been invited and the number of men employed in each of the years 1950, 1951 and 1952.  A recent parliamentary question got the figures for this year up to August, and taking August in each of the four years it appears&mdash;taking first of all the number of houses in progress&mdash;in August, 1950, the figure was 10,211; in August, 1951, it was 9,892; in 1952 it was 8,760, and in 1953, 6,925.</P>
      <P>The number of men employed had dropped from 12,913, in 1950, to 11,412 in 1951; 10,300 in 1952, and in August this year it had dropped to 7,362.  That indicates a substantial drop in the number of persons employed and what is probably even more significant is the drop in the number of sites on which development work was in progress.  In August, 1950, there were 3,475 sites; in 1951, 2,237; in 1952, 2,583; in 1953, 1,140.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that in cases where local authorities have gone some distance towards completing their housing programme that they cannot be developing sites which they may not require, but that only applies in a very limited <Col N="2131" /> number of cases and the significant figures, I think, are those showing the substantial drop in the number of sites on which development work was in progress, and also the large drop in the number of persons employed.  That round figure includes skilled and unskilled labour and it applies to all local authority housing.</P>
    <P>While a great deal has been accomplished, the fact that so many local authorities are still faced with difficulties in providing houses should prompt the Minister to inquire into the rate of development and the anticipated period of time which will elapse before these local authorities have completed their programmes.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are no figures available for the number of persons employed on private housing schemes and I want to draw particular attention to that aspect of the matter, especially as it applies in Dublin County and the fringe of the city in respect of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  Everybody who is familiar with the workings of those Acts, and particularly builders or persons seeking houses, realises that the demand is as great as ever in Dublin County and parts of Dublin City and Dún Laoghaire for housing under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts&mdash; in other words, what are commonly known as &ldquo;subsidy houses.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But over the last 12 months there has been an extraordinary slump. There is an extraordinary slump in the building industry in Dublin, leaving aside the work of the Dublin Corporation, the Dublin County Council or the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  That slump can be attributed to two or three factors: the general tightness of credit, or the restriction of credit; the high deposit or down payment required; and the high interest rates charged.  This time last year the rate of interest was increased by 2 per cent. and that increase had a very material effect on the position for a great number of people.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted some figures relative to the number of grants allocated. In his speech, he said the <Col N="2132" /> number of new house grants allocated under the Acts in 1952-1953 was 4,910 as compared with 6,093 in the preceding year.  He also said that for the first six months of the present financial year the number of new house grants allocated was 2,702 representing a slight increase over the corresponding 1952-53 figures.  It may not be possible to deduce from those figures an altogether accurate picture because of the delays inherent in the actual system, and I want to direct the Minister's attention to that position.  Under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts, the Dublin Corporation require that a person applying for a grant must have a salary of £8, or more, per week.  The Dublin County Council require a minimum of £9 per week.  I think that requirement, taking into account the demands of the applicant, is reasonable enough.  The corporation and the county council assess what they consider is the minimum wage upon which a person may be expected to meet the ordinary demands of himself and his family and, over and above that, have available sufficient to repay the loan charges.</P>
    <P>Last year I had some figures when we debated this matter.  Recently I was looking through some figures compiled on the same subject and from those it is obvious that the effect on an individual of an increase in the loan charges may be very considerable.  In some cases it is as low as 3/10.  I have figures here which show that on a loan charged at 3 per cent. the weekly demand for interest is 6/3; where the loan is charged at 4 per cent. it is 10/1.  At the present time the interest charged is 5¾ per cent. as far as small dwellings loans are concerned.  That is an increase, as Deputies are aware, of 2 per cent. from 3¾ per cent. to 5¾ per cent.  That rise of 2 per cent. is a substantial one.  The existing slump has a twofold effect.  First of all it means a delay in housing people who are anxious to house themselves and to contribute as far as possible towards meeting their own needs. Secondly, there has been a terrific slump in the building industry with consequent unemployment and emigation. <Col N="2133" /> That slump is particularly acute in Dublin City and County.  I need not labour the point.  The figures themselves prove the fact.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should endeavour to effect an alteration in the rate of interest.  I know that when he met the representatives of the building industry and when he was dealing with the matter here he said it was not his function to fix the rate of interest: on the one hand the local authority has the responsibility of laying down what they consider is the minimum weekly income and, on the other hand, the rate of interest fixed is governed by the ordinary rate which applies in respect of bank loans, and housing loans follow suit.</P>
    <P>The position is that recently the bank rate has been reduced slightly but so far no consequential reduction has followed in respect of Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts loans.  It would not amount to a great deal, but it would be something.  The Minister has a general responsibility for housing.  The vast majority of the people are prepared to avail of the facilities of these Acts and these people should be encouraged.  They are anxious by their own initiative to acquire houses for themselves and they are prepared to risk a certain amount of their own money in providing for themselves and their families. They are thrifty people.</P>
    <P>They are the people who are referred to very often as the white-collar section of the community.  Few sections have been hit as hard by rising prices, the cost of living and the various increases in taxation.  They are a section who are prepared to go a long way towards providing houses for themselves and their families if given adequate encouragement.</P>
    <P>There is another problem associated with all that.  I refer to the inevitable delays which occur in the making of grants.  There has been an improvement so far as Dublin County Council is concerned but, by and large, quite unwarrantable delays occur.  I think that is true of nearly all local authorities but I can only speak from personal knowledge of Dublin Corporation, Dun <Col N="2134" /> Laoghaire Borough Council and Dublin County Council.  First of all, plans have to be lodged.  They have to be passed.  They may have to be altered with consequential re-examination or relodgment.  From the time they are lodged until they are passed, the foundations laid, the house constructed and the various inspections carried out, as much as 12 months may elapse before the final payment is made.  The applicant is lucky if the house is completed and he is paid the final instalment within eight or ten months.  In some cases it is not paid until 15 months have elapsed.</P>
    <P>On the fringe of the city a number of builders have developed estates. They have built block schemes of subsidy houses.  Where a builder undertakes work of that kind, involving considerable capital expenditure, it is unreasonable to expect him to remain without his money for that length of time and considerable difficulties have been caused to a great number of builders, to say nothing of the delay occasioned to the people anxious to take up residence in their new houses, because until the person actually occupies the house the Department does not issue the grant; it certainly does not issue the final instalment.</P>
    <P>There is another problem that has presented very considerable difficulties for residents in some of these schemes. When these schemes are developed, roads provided, sewers and water laid down, the county council will not take over the roads until they are completed satisfactorily.  In all cases, the roads and the plans were approved by the local authority concerned before construction work began.  They are inspected periodically during construction and when completed a considerable length of time elapses before the roads are taken over.  In some cases where schemes have been completed for a number of years the roads have not yet been taken over.  In cases where the entire housing programme on a particular road has not been completed, the stretch of road on which houses have been completed is not provided with the ordinary services for which the ratepayers contribute.  This <Col N="2135" /> applies in part of Mount Merrion, Clonskea, and very acutely in Kilmacud and Stillorgan.  The schemes have been virtually completed, houses have been erected, roads have been constructed, but the local authority has not taken them over.</P>
    <P>As I understand the position, the local authority has no power to compel the developer to put the roads into a proper state of repair.  On the other hand, the developer may have completed the roads and there is unnecessary delay in acquisition by the local authority.  The sufferers are the residents on the roads.  A great number of people have made representations to me and, I am sure, to other Deputies, about the lack of ordinary facilities such as scavenging and the various other services ordinarily provided by the local authority.  These services are not provided because the roads have not been taken over.</P>
    <P>The Minister should investigate this matter and devise a scheme whereby the roads will be completed and acquired so that they may come under the care of the local authority when people go to reside in the houses that have been built.  It is not fair to people who are paying rates that they should be deprived of the ordinary services. In all these cases people are paying rates.  In some cases they have been resident in the houses up to three or four years.  Deputies may consider that to be an extraordinary statement but I know various roads in a number of schemes on the fringe of the city where persons have been in occupation of the houses and the roads have not been taken over by the local authority, with the result that the ordinary services to which people are entitled have not been provided.</P>
    <P>The references to the roads Estimate dealt mainly with the fact that a considerable amount of money is being spent on main roads, and not sufficient money is being spent on county roads. While substantial improvements have been made to the main roads&mdash;and most people agree on the necessity for surface improvements and also widening and straightening&mdash;there is a danger that we are going to extremes <Col N="2136" /> in this matter.  Having regard to some of the stretches of certain main roads which are being widened at present, it would appear to me that main roads are being constructed without any relation to the size of the country or to the speed of traffic.  I do not think it is reasonable to construct in this country roads similar to the continental autobahns.  We require roads that are up to first-class standard from the point of view of surface and reasonable width but in many parts of the country vast tracts of good agricultural land are being acquired for the purpose, in some cases, of widening bends that do not appear to be very dangerous, and certainly do not require widening to the extent that is being carried out.</P>
    <P>We ought to have a sense of proportion in this matter.  I do not know whether or not set standards are laid down.  Some counties appear to adopt different standards from others in regard to the width of roads and the widening of bends.  There should be a sense of proportion and a reasonable approach to the requirements, bearing in mind that in many cases much valuable land is acquired merely for the purpose of making a road straight where a reasonable turn would do no harm.  On the other hand, the removal of old bridges over canals or railways is long overdue.  It is gratifying that the matter is being pressed forward as vigorously as possible.</P>
    <P>The other matter that I wish to refer to in connection with this Vote is the alteration in the grant for the relief of rates on agricultural land.  It is entirely unreasonable that an added burden of from £250,000 to £500,000 should be placed on agricultural ratepayers. Excessive as that burden is, the changes in the demand notes and the general muddle and confusion have been to the detriment of the ratepayers and have caused the issue of unnecessary demand notes and unnecessary expense on local authorities.  The most recent change which has been made will require a further alteration in the final assessment notice.  A reply given by the Minister recently shows that there has been an increase of anything up to 2/6 in the average rate throughout the country.  That, together <Col N="2137" /> with the impost resulting from the alteration in the grant for the relief of rates on agricultural land, represents a burden which presses heavily on farmers, especially in a year in which many other burdens have been placed upon them.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I want to refer as it applies to Dublin, that is the delay in payment of compensation where compulsory acquisition orders are made.  Many parts of Dublin City and some parts of the county are the subject of compulsory acquisition orders under the Housing Acts.  In a number of cases where the local authority has completed a housing scheme and where persons are moved from derelict houses to the new houses, persons owing business or private property in the area have their premises acquired for subsequent clearance and rebuilding.  In a great number of cases the delay in making payment is excessive.  The persons concerned, particularly business people, are involved in a two-fold loss.  First of all, people are removed from houses in the area to new houses.  Everyone, of course, is glad of that.  In most cases the business premises are the last to be acquired.  If they are acquired or if a new premises is provided, the difficulty may not be so serious but where a person is being compensated because of the acquisition of his property delay in payment means considerable loss and in some cases hardship on the individual concerned.</P>
    <P>I do suggest that there should be a speeding up in the decisions in respect of compulsory purchase orders and in the furnishing of reports where these orders are made, because the delays which are inevitably associated with these matters mean loss to the persons concerned.  They have in any case the problem of finding suitable alternative accommodation, and if they are waiting for payment of compensation it will affect their prospects of getting alternative accommodation as well as entailing loss in the actual transaction of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I look upon this Estimate as the most important which could come before the House for consideration, because the success or failure of local government affects the lives of the people in city, town or rural parish through the length and breadth of the administrative area over which it has charge.  It is a test also of the working of the democratic system of government in combination with the administration of what is now known as the managerial system, and the success or failure of the whole scheme as it has become so intricate affects the most important thing in a man's life &mdash;the conditions under which he lives, the amenities to be provided, and in great measure, too, a balance between the amenities in town and country and the attractions that are provided for the people to remain in their own particular spheres of life.</P>
      <P>When we are considering local problems and all the rest, it would be well, now and again, to look at these fundamental things, because the whole system of public representation is so important that sometimes there are needs for change in that, too, to meet changing circumstances; and whatever criticisms may be offered against public representatives now and again, I think we can all say from our experiences in public life that many people with problems of various kinds would have them unsolved or a great delay occasioned in getting the benefits they deserve were it not for the activities of the public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, our democratic system works pretty well.  The public representatives are in great measure unselfish in their efforts, and work with the desire to improve the conditions of the people they represent and the general course of life in this land of ours, and I think that, without any exaggeration whatever, I can compliment the present Minister on what he is doing to preserve a link between his administration here and the local authorities, not only by his very intimate contact with the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, but by the manner in which he attends to requests from local authorities, and <Col N="2139" /> receives deputations when the need for such things arises.  I can say, too, that he has been most helpful in allowing the augmentation of staff dealing with housing and public administration where delays have been shown and where it has been proved that extra staff would speed up the preparatory work on town planning, in housing and in the general administration under his control.  His whole approach has been very critical.  We all, from time to time, have problems where the Minister may take a different view, and that is all to the good; but when he is convinced he goes wholeheartedly then into the meeting of the case which has been presented to him, and he has done that with general advantage to his Department and to the needs of the country.</P>
    <P>The last speaker has referred to the slowing down of building, and he has quoted some figures relating to that particular matter, but I think that everybody who examines the problem impartially will have to agree that even two or three years ago many of the urban authorities had their housing problems completed except for a few odd houses here and there and that the tempo of building has, no doubt, been altered by that fundamental fact.  There are other places where building was slow.  My own city is one of them.  It was hard to get proper co-operation from the city administration, who were looking at the thing on a long-term basis, saying that if they went ahead too fast now it would result in unemployment in a certain number of years and that it was better to go slowly and steadily than to push on now, even though the need was great.  The public authority did not agree with that, but for years the local administration could not be got to see that viewpoint, even though there were 4,000 applicants in small dwellings and in awful conditions waiting for proper housing conditions. However, that position has now, to some extent at any rate, been remedied and we have the hope that the position which has been created will be maintained. I am sure that, as far as the Minister goes, his whole strength will be behind a move in that direction until the problem is near solution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /> In dealing with that problem the corporation set out to provide a balance between private enterprise and direct labour building schemes. That has been all to the good, because the Minister has insisted that where the direct labour schemes are put up to his Department for approval, costings have to be provided and the comparative estimates have to be submitted for his approval before the direct labour is allowed to operate on any particular scheme.  The tenders we got in recent years have been very close and very competitive, and the fact that we have a fairly big direct labour unit working in the city is preserving a balance in costs which will be ultimately to the advantage of the people who occupy these houses.</P>
    <P>One of the other matters in which we have found the administration particularly slow is in the acquisition of sizable derelict sites for rebuilding in the heart of the city.  Surely that is a problem which ought to be faced enthusiastically and urgently.  Roads are already provided and the usual sewerage and water facilities are at hand.  So is electricity and so are the schools and churches.  The effect that it will have on the household income is an important consideration for many other people in our midst who, if they go now into the suburbs, have to pay 14/- or 15/- per week out of their income for bus fares to take them to their work and to take their children to the schools.  It also entails the building of new churches and schools while, at the same time, those in the heart of the city are almost empty.  Furthermore, these sites are left there derelict.  If they were put to use and built upon they would provide rates which would help to keep down the general rates and would remove eyesores in cities and towns which give an appearance sometimes of decay and neglect.  I do not blame the Minister because in his circulars he has recommended that these things be done but I hope that if any public authority lag behind in that regard they will be spurred into action.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is something in the complaint that has been made that building in the rural areas has not <Col N="2141" /> kept pace with building in the urban areas and in the cities.  However, that is a matter where the local authorities have the reins more or less in their own hands.  As has been said here to-day, the inspection of sites, getting them by consent, and all the other planning that is necessary in dealing with rural problems, particularly in isolated areas, renders the process far slower than if one were able to take a particular site and develop it.  However, in some areas I think more progress may be made in that regard than is at present being done.</P>
    <P>It has been said that private building is in a condition of slump and that as much of it as was being done is not being done now.  As far as I can observe, utility societies here and there are being formed and building societies of various kinds are developing sites and giving them to tenants on a monthly purchase basis.  That is all to the good, because individuals find it difficult in the present day&mdash;even public authorities find it difficult&mdash;to get suitable sites where they can build houses at a place convenient to themselves and in general conformity with their desires.  The Cork Corporation have a system of providing a certain number of sites in the vicinity of various building schemes.  That has a double advantage.  In the first place, it gives those who desire to build for themselves easy access to a site without all the legal formalities, and so forth, that would be difficult for them. Secondly, it provides a variety of building which makes the building sites more attractive.</P>
    <P>It was said by the last speaker, and also by Deputy Finan, that the rates of interest are somewhat responsible for the fact that private building is not being pushed ahead as vigorously as it was before.  We should not forget that in the regime of Cumann na nGaedheal the rate of interest chargeable for housing was 5¾ per cent. and that the price of money fluctuates on the market just the same as the price of every other utility and commodity.  I think it is not quite fair to attack the Government over the present rates of interest when, in the 1930s, a Cumann na nGaedheal Government were charging 5¾ per cent. <Col N="2142" /> to the local authorities.  Furthermore, it took some activity from the Labour Benches to make the Local Loans Fund available to the housing authorities at all.  On one occasion, a Labour Deputy stated that there were local loans and Grants-in-Aid for other services, including £600,000 annually to the British Treasury for local loans said to be due to them, but that there was a reduction from £500,000 to £142,000 for Grants-in-Aid to local authorities in Ireland. I think it very unjust and unfair when people come here and criticise this Government and, all the while, these other things are in their own background.</P>
    <P>The question of private building and the question of purchase schemes are, I think, inter-related.  Some of the members here advocated the sale of rural cottages and non-municipal houses to the tenants.  I think that that is something that should be encouraged. When the Act came in, I think the tenants were discouraged from purchasing by reason of the fact that the repairs would subsequently be their responsibility and that, only for that attitude, many of those people now occupying cottages and municipal houses would own their own houses, which they are just as entitled to do as the farmer is to own his holding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking when a house is a man's own property he looks after it well.  Before he purchases the house it has to be put into proper repair and, consequently, all that devolves upon him subsequently is to keep it in good repair and condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, the rural houses are a credit to the occupants and the manner in which they attend to the little plot and use it to provide vegetables, and so forth, for the home is to be admired.  On the other hand, I think that near cities and towns, where many members of the family work in industry, smaller plots may serve the purpose&mdash;a half acre or even a quarter acre being quite sufficient.  Some people say it would be well not to build labourers' cottages at all near <Col N="2143" /> towns and cities and that it would be better to build the non-municipal type of house.  I think that the view of the South Cork Board is that it would be better to build a cottage type of house on a small plot.  It can be let at a cheaper rent and, at the same time, it provides the family with a decent home.  Every encouragement is going to be given to that aspect and I am sure the Minister will agree with me.</P>
    <P>I think that one of the problems in regard to local government administration at the moment is the position of small local authorities, urban councils and town commissioners.  They find it difficult to provide a county council demand and, as well as that, to provide the local amenities.  It is a pity that the increased road grants for county roads are not shared with the urban authorities.  We all know that they are encouraged to improve the roads and that present circumstances will make it necessary for them to do so.  Places which, some time ago, were by-passed in cities, towns and villages are now fairly good public roads and it takes much more money to maintain those roads in a proper state than was the case from the time they were just laneways, alleys, and so forth.  The incidence of traffic on the county roads generally applies also to towns and villages because the traffic passes through them.  For the purpose of providing employment in urban areas, I appeal to the Minister to consider giving the urban authorities some advantage from the increased grants which he is giving for the county roads.</P>
    <P>We heard a good deal to-day about the Local Authorities (Works) Act of 1949.  I had the pleasure and the advantage of being on the same local authority, Cork County Council, as the late Deputy Murphy&mdash;trocaire Dé dá ainm&mdash;when this problem was being considered by the council before it was dealt with in this House and there was a big volume of opinion in all Parties in support of the viewpoint that further provision should be made for such works as were envisaged under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  If we look at what the late Deputy Murphy <Col N="2144" />&mdash;beannacht De air&mdash;said himself when he introduced the Bill we will see exactly what the position was.  At column 2139 of the Official Debates of 21st March, 1949, moving the Second Reading of the Bill, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Bill is intended to serve two purposes.  It is designed to remove a disability which precluded local authorities from protecting public property in the past.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That shows that he knew he was not making new legislation but removing a disability from existing legislation, making provision for it, which was a good thing.  Further on he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Bill is designed to enable local authorities to execute such works as they consider reasonable for the protection or relief from flooding, landslide, subsidence or other similar occurence of any land owned by them, or any permanent construction, that is, a road, bridge, building, wall or embankment which was constructed by them or which they are required by law to maintain.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the second provision of that legislation.  The then Minister went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But it goes somewhat further and it proposes to provide against or remove the cause of flooding in any lands within the functional area of a local authority which are not owned by them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the purpose of that Act. For years, every member of a local authority saw a stream flooding at certain times on to the roadway and carrying away portion of its surface. There was no provision to enable the local authority to go into that stream and remedy that condition.  The Act provided for that.  Then, where a road was being flooded, it was not possible to go inside the fence to clear the drain and let the water flow away.  Provision was made for that also.  Sometimes bridges were endangered and provision was made in that regard also.  The problem arose, however, as to how far, when you went inside the fence, you were to follow the stream or drain and whether, in doing so, you would not <Col N="2145" /> be stopped by the next farmer saying that the water which trickled down previously would now come down in a flood and make a swamp of some of his fields and from that point of view, as Deputy Finan rightly said, general drainage or land rehabilitation&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;and these schemes had to be combined.  That was the sensible way to do it.  Otherwise, you might relieve one farmer and flood his neighbour.</P>
    <P>It was said that this Government cut down the money allocated for this purpose.  Surely everybody on the benches opposite knows that the inter-Party Government cut it down considerably and said that the main portion of the work had been done and the main part of the damage repaired.  To my mind, political life has reached a very low ebb when speeches are not based on facts that are well known to the men who make them and when they try, for political advantage, to draw a veil over their own past and attack those who are trying to do what Deputy Finan suggested, to combine the two schemes.  If less is given for the Local Authorities (Works) Act more is given for roads and the drainage of land.</P>
    <P>I need say no more.  I have put to the Minister the problems which I think confront the local authorities.  I have stated the position, a position which is well known to the Opposition, and I ask them, in the interests of public life itself, to be fair to themselves, because, in our way through life, whether in our private or public capacities, we have our successes and our failures.  Let us admit the one and try to improve on the other; let us give credit where credit is due; let us try to co-operate when co-operation is necessary and criticise when faults are evident.  In this House and outside it, however, let us be fair to ourselves, fair to our country and fair to the Administration, and let all our efforts be devoted to the improvement of the conditions under which the people live and the securing of the amenities which we are trying to provide for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister <Col N="2146" /> who has to sit throughout the whole of this debate and listen to the repetition of the various points being made during the past couple of hours.  I have heard practically every speaker from every side repeat the same points, but, in case the Minister should have any hopes.  I do not propose to omit them, and may I add that it is perhaps essential that that should be so in order that the Minister will get an idea of what strikes the majority of Deputies as being the important points in relation to his Department which affect the people.  I shall endeavour, in so far as I can, to touch very lightly on the points which I have heard repeated so often during the past two or three hours.</P>
      <P>I agree practically completely with what the last speaker, Deputy MacCarthy, said.  Housing, so far as I know, is the principal worry of the people of the country at the present moment.  I heard the Minister's statement in which he indicated that in his opinion the reduction in the number of houses being built&mdash;he has not admitted a slowing-down&mdash;was due to the fact that a number of authorities had completed their programme.</P>
      <P>That may be so, but significantly enough&mdash;and I challenge any of the Waterford Deputies to contradict this &mdash;there appears to be, not a diminution, but a magnifying of the problem in my constituency.  Difficult as it was to get a house in Waterford three years ago, it appears twice as difficult at the present moment to get a house there.  Anyone who can promise to get houses for the hundreds of people who are looking for houses in Waterford will be pretty sure of a certain amount of support at the next election. These remarks apply equally to the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps Waterford City and County are exceptions, but I still think the Minister has to establish the case he tried to make.  The figures for people employed by local authorities on housing alone show that in August last there were 4,050 fewer employed than in August, 1951.  These figures do not give any room for complacency.  The very latest figures made available <Col N="2147" /> to-day show that there were 3,852 fewer people employed on housing schemes in September last than were employed in September, 1951.  Unless some new system of building houses without labour has been devised, I am afraid that all we can conclude from these figures is that the housing drive has been slowed down.  From the Minister's own figures of 1947, over 40,000 houses required to be built, of which 20,000 were required in Dublin. In Dublin there are 1,500 skilled men unemployed at present.  Unlimited quantities of material are available and there are 20,000 houses to be built. Surely there is no reason for unemployment in the building trade with that problem to be faced?  I am aware that there are difficulties.  Plans have to be prepared and sites secured but I do believe that if a state of emergency were declared in Dublin to-morrow by the Government in regard to the housing drive, these unemployed men could be put to work and the necessary houses could be made available.</P>
    <P>I would further suggest that if you take the other cities of the country and the rather big towns of the country, you will find that an acute housing problem still exists.  It is in these very places also that the figures for unemployment are so high.  I should like the Minister, concluding, to give us some idea of the position by naming the local authorities that have in any way completed their housing drive. They may be there; if the Minister says he knows of some I accept that but I would be interested to know the names and the districts of local authorities that can say that they have completed even their 1947 requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very glad to look it up.  I was not aware of it but if the Minister can say when replying where it is to be found, there is no need to repeat the information.  Even if the assertion is correct, I would say that the 1947 programme was mapped out on a standard which was comparatively <Col N="2148" /> low.  Because of the magnitude of the problem then, a target was set for the immediate future that did not envisage the requirements of the present day or that was not up to the standard required at the present day.  If a new survey is now made of the problem the Minister will find that, not only in Dublin and the larger cities but pretty well throughout the whole country, the problem is almost of as great a magnitude as that which existed in 1947.  Unless I am completely out of touch&mdash;and it is pretty difficult for any honest-to-God Deputy or county councillor to be completely out of touch&mdash;with the housing problem, the demands for houses are almost as insistent as ever.  I meet them in my own county.  I hear about them from constituents of mine who have friends and relatives in other counties and who are appealing to us to use our influence with Deputies and councillors in other areas to try to secure accommodation for these relatives at any cost.  There must, therefore, be a problem that leaves very little room for complacency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that a certain amount of the delays in planning schemes are due to the local authorities.  Some local authorities are not as progressive as others.  We in the Labour Party like to think that that is because there are not sufficient Labour councillors.  Be that as it may, there is no doubt that some local authorities have a good deal of the blame laid on them and they must accept it.  I would say also&mdash;I am not saying it because Fianna Fáil is in office; I said it when the inter-Party Government was in office&mdash;that a good deal of the delay has to be attributed to the red tape of the Minister's Department.  Perhaps it is essential, but they have a knack&mdash;when they make up their minds, as apparently they do make up their minds, to delay things&mdash;of being able to trace the omission of something or other from a scheme to a local authority, and they send it back again to the local authority to have it rectified. In that way, not only do they delay a scheme but they get local authorities to agree that they themselves were responsible for the delay <Col N="2149" /> in the first instance.  They are pretty expert at that, and if the Minister could in any way devise some method of short circuiting the difficulties that appear to arise, then irrespective of what Party he comes from, I for one, shall be very glad to say that he is doing a good job as Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy said he wanted to see derelict sites developed.  I agree that the development of areas cleared of condemned houses is absolutely essential.  Pretty well in every town and city, gaps appear that could be likened to cleared sites in towns that were bombed across the water during the war.  There is also the fact that the development of these sites will lead to a reduction in rents.  We all know that if you develop a field and build on it, and then charge an economic rent, the development of the site has an important bearing on the rent fixed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree, but some are very suitable.  I could instance in my own town an ideal site that has been cleared and which has now slipped into private hands.  At the same time, our new development work will have to extend a mile or even two miles away from the place of employment of the majority of the people.  As the Minister says, perhaps a good number are not suitable, but certainly, if they are not suitable for building, they would be, at least, suitable as playing fields or green patches.  As they are left in a deplorable condition in many towns, perhaps some instruction from the Minister's Department would help to make local authorities realise the disfiguring appearance which these sites, which are useless for building, give to a town.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly&mdash;the county manager, I suggest.  The high rents <Col N="2150" /> which have to be charged by local authorities constitute a problem that will develop within a very short time. I suggest that that needs the attention of the House and of the Minister. Many factors enter into it, some of which are completely outside the control of the Minister, and some of which, I suggest, if not within his control, are certainly within the control of the Government.  One of the solutions I suggest is that if suitable sites near a water supply and drainage were developed it would take something off the excessive rents which must now be charged.  A number of Deputies mentioned professional fees and the simplifying of the procedure with regard to titles.</P>
      <P>To my mind, there is one very important factor which I want to deal with in rather greater detail than I have done so far and that is the exorbitant prices charged for building materials.  Some three or four years ago I quoted in this House, on the Estimate for this Department, a statement that I had secured from the manager of a builders' provider's establishment.  Like all such statements, it is quite true that that was only got after he had left his employment, probably because he had a disagreement with his employer.  Nevertheless, that statement is perfectly correct.  He indicated that on each of the many things that go into the building of a house, over 100 per cent. profit was being secured by that particular firm.  It seems almost impossible to believe it and the Minister at the time, not the present Minister, denied that it was so and promised to investigate the matter.  It was very strange that, even though he was an inter-Party Government Minister, he never came to look for any proof of it.  I was prepared to give, and did give in confidence, the name of the person who had made the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, however, I came across a report of the annual meetings of two of the largest builders' providers in Dublin.  I do not propose to give the names of these firms, but they can be secured as they are available.  I will quote from <i>Trade Union Information</i> of June, 1953, page 10, and October, <Col N="2151" /> 1953, page 11, in regard to one of these firms.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The ordinary capital of the company was £50,000 in 1936.  In the following year a capital bonus of 50 per cent. was paid and the capital increased to £75,000.  A further capital bonus of 100 per cent. was paid in 1950, thereby increasing the ordinary capital to £150,000.  Thus the originally subscribed capital of £50,000 has been trebled by the issue of bonus shares.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Every pound put in has been trebled. These people can cash-in on the present stock market every pound's worth of shares they have for 35s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister for Local Government any responsibility in connection with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The inference I was trying to draw from that is that if this company&mdash;I can quote others with an equally beautiful record&mdash;can issue bonus shares, somebody must be making money out of house building. These two firms must be making a fortune.  I think it is the duty of any Government to see that the housing of the working classes will not be the means of making a group of people in this country rich at the expense of the ordinary people.  If building costs could be reduced even by 10 or 15 per cent., it would make an enormous difference to the ordinary people, to the local authority, and in regard to the money needed by the Government to finance houses, and thus bring down the present high charges.  I am aware that some steps to investigate that position are at present being taken.  That will be of the greatest interest to us and, I am sure, to the Minister and his Department.  I hope that, as a result, we will have some immediate benefit in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor in the high rents at present being charged, as well as the fact that the rates have gone up&mdash; although, as Deputy MacCarthy said, perhaps that is inevitable anyway&mdash;is that interest rates have gone up.  I am aware that the Trade Union Congress has made suggestions to the Minister <Col N="2152" /> dealing with that and have pointed out that a further grant of £250,000 to local authorities and to people availing of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts would reduce the interest rate from the present 5 per cent to the former rate.  I think that is worthy of consideration and that the Minister should examine that matter.  The Trade Union Congress have made such a recommendation and have sent a memorandum to him for consideration, and I hope that the points made by them will be considered by the Government when they get a suitable opportunity.</P>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I regret that the direct labour system of building houses is not more generally availed of.  I regret that it has been dropped in my county.  One scheme of direct labour house building was carried out in the town of Dungarvan at Abbeyside and the houses were let at a maximum rent of 20s., graded down to a minimum of 10s. 8d.  That scheme compared most favourably in construction and in outlay with the houses built in Dr. Caseyville area which bear rents from 30s. down to 15s.  They are better constructed and cheaper from the point of view of rent.  I am also aware that we would have built the Dr. Caseyville houses by direct labour were it not for the fact that the contract price was cheaper than the estimated cost.  It appears absurd to claim that direct labour could help to reduce the cost of rents when the contract price was lower than the estimate, but this will be understood when we realise that the contractors formed an organisation. They paid a certain amount of money into a pool and used the pool money to subsidise the profits of contractors who contracted under the estimates in areas where direct labour was known to exist.  Having regard to that fact, direct labour must be doing a good job when such drastic steps were taken to defeat it.  I feel that the Minister should encourage in every way possible any local authority that has the common sense to keep in operation direct labour schemes in regard to housing.</P>
    <P>In common with the other rural Deputies, I would advocate an extension of the cottage purchase scheme. <Col N="2153" /> The Minister may be aware that during the past week or two I put down a number of questions, looking for guidance on that very subject.  The substance of my questions was to find out whether or not a local authority could compel a county manager to institute a cottage purchase scheme or whether the county manager, having got the views of the council, should be compelled to go on with it.  I understand from the replies I received that it is an executive function.</P>
    <P>In other words, the county council can make a recommendation and if the county manager so wishes he is not compelled to implement it.  No matter what scheme the county council puts forward the county manager may in his rôle as the senior executive officer order that scheme not to be proceeded with. It is regettable that the views of the members of local authorities can be altered at the whim of one individual.</P>
    <P>I would suggest the Minister should restore to local authorities in the coming County Managerial Bill the power to make their cottage purchase schemes.  Irrespective of what the manager thinks it should be mandatory upon him to implement those schemes.  You have these schemes in quite a number of different counties. Some county managers think that the circular letter giving permission to draw up a new scheme at 50 per cent. of the rent instead of at 75 per cent. should apply only to houses built since 1936.  Other county managers have seen fit to hold that that applied to any cottage built irrespective of the date of building provided it came within the scope of the scheme.  I believe there is a good deal of confusion. Certainly there has been confusion in the minds of the people in Waterford on that very point.  The Minister would do well if he could get the county managers to come to some final decision.  Naturally, I would recommend that the 50 per cent. should be given to all cottages irrespective of when they were built so long as they came within the scheme.  I understand that is done in some places.</P>
    <P>May I take an opportunity on this <Col N="2154" /> Estimate of making an appeal to the Minister to reconsider a decision which, I think, he has made already? We have a scheme in Lismore-Cappoquin. There is a suggestion that we should have an extension to cover an area known as Affane.  The Minister does not require the names of these districts because it would be very difficult for him to remember them.  As I said, a new extension is proposed.  All the engineers and the people employed in Dublin believe it would be very advantageous to us to include the whole scheme instead of going ahead with one part of it now and later extending it.  The Department have refused to sanction it.</P>
    <P>They instructed us to go on with the major portion of the scheme and told us that in time they would have a look at the extension and see what could be done.  It is the unanimous view of the council, the county manager and all the officials who have examined it that the scheme should be carried out in its entirety by the one contractor. If the Minister could see his way to re-examine the matter he would have the support and the good wishes not only of all the people on the local authorities in question but of all the representatives in the Dáil from the constituency of Waterford.</P>
    <P>I should like to raise a point that has not been raised up to this, I think, by any of the speakers.  I would appeal to the Minister to co-operate with the other Government Departments in asking that some form of arbitration for local authority employees be set up.  The Minister is aware that all employees of his Department and of any local authority are forbidden the use of the Labour Court as a means of settling any differences they have. County councils and local authorities have become one of the biggest employers of labour.  Naturally, difference of opinion and disputes as regards wages will take place between employers and workers irrespective of whether the employers happen to be local authorities or private individuals.</P>
    <P>Under the laws of this country if the worker to whom I refer decides to <Col N="2155" /> take strike action against a local authority, he is deprived of his right to superannuation.  It may be restored at a later date by the Minister.  There is a need to protect those workers by some form of arbitration just as civil servants, teachers and other people in Government employment are protected.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to join with his colleagues in other Departments and endeavour to set up some form of arbitration and conciliation for the people they employ.  That would act as a safety valve.  I am quite sure that no Government wishes to victimise people because they exercise their rights.  I am sure the whole House will join with me in advocating some such system of arbitration.</P>
    <P>I also appeal to the Minister to consider an increase in respect of local authority pensioners.  I have in mind such people as rate collectors and other employees who went out on pension ten or 15 years ago.  That pension has declined in purchasing power as a result of increases in the cost of living.  I submit to the Minister that these people deserve the consideration of the Government.  During their time they gave good and faithful service.  If something were done for them, I think that the Minister would gain not only their gratitude but the gratitude of the people generally, because they are very much in need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The main items on this Estimate would seem to be housing and roads.  There are parts of the country where housing needs have been met almost 100 per cent, but they are far from being met in the poorer areas, particularly in the case of small farmers with big families whose income is derived mainly from working on relief schemes and on the roads. Had it not been for the scheme sanctioned by the Department, which allows local authorities to supplement grants for the erection of houses, I can say from my experience that quite a big percentage of the new houses that we have through the country would not have been built at all during the last <Col N="2156" /> three to five years.  It is the local authority grant which has encouraged so many people to build houses for themselves.</P>
      <P>At the present time, it costs anything from £700 to £800 to build an ordinary five-roomed farmer's house. It is the local authority grant that has enabled so many people to undertake the building of houses for themselves, because without it they could not possibly hope to get credit for the purchase of the necessary materials.  It has been mainly responsible for advancing the housing position to the point it has reached to-day.  Of course, while that is so, generally speaking, it is true to say that in many of the poorer areas it will be many years before the people living there will be able to undertake the building of a house for themselves.</P>
      <P>As far as cottages are concerned, it has been mentioned that it would, perhaps, be better if a cheaper type of cottage were built.  I am of opinion that the cottage recommended by the Department, the type that is being built to-day, is going to give the best value.  Those of us who come from the rural areas are aware that it is far superior to the cottages which were built 25, 30 or 40 years ago.  That fact is borne out by the experience of local authorities which have to incur enormous cost in repairing these old cottages, particularly those built 40 years ago.  In fact, the repair of them is costing so much that, from the ratepayers' point of view, it would be cheaper really if the local authority were to make a present of these cottages to the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the only way of providing enough cottages to accommodate the different sections of people who require them is by the application of a means test.  If, as well as the father of a family, you have three or four other members of it earning money, with the consequent result that the weekly income is fairly substantial, I think that, in the case of such houses, the economic rent should be paid.  Of course, that principle should not be applied in the case of a poor man who had nothing but his week's wages, or of old people who had only a small <Col N="2157" /> income.  I think that in the case of cottages built in the vicinity of a town where there is a water supply and sewerage service, these services should be installed in them.  As a rule, these cottages are occupied by people who have been evacuated out of the nearby town, and so I suggest that the amenities I speak of should be provided.</P>
    <P>I see in practically every town in my county, and in towns in other counties through which I pass, a number of condemned houses.  The former tenants have been removed and given new cottages outside the town.  Some of those houses were perhaps condemned before the tenants were evacuated, and others after they had been evacuated.  You see these condemned houses in the centre of very good towns and in fine streets leading off it.  They present a very dilapidated appearance.  I think it was last year I suggested on this Estimate that something should be done about those derelict sites.  In my opinion, provision should be made by the Department to have these derelict sites removed and new houses erected on them, either by the owners of the sites or by the local authority.  At present, those derelict sites are an eyesore and something should be done about them. I imagine that, if a good type of house was built on them, there would be no difficulty in getting people who would be able to pay an economic rent for them.  I certainly do not like to see those derelict sites in so many of our rural towns, some of them fairly big towns.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the roads are concerned it <Col N="2158" /> is true that local authorities are receiving a good grant from the Government for main roads and a reasonable proportion for the county roads.  They are the principal roads to receive consideration, but you also have the cul-de-sac roads which represent a very big mileage in the country and which accommodate a large percentage of people living in the rural areas. Perhaps there would be a mile, a half mile or a quarter of a mile of such a road connecting with the main road. It is not under contract and if it is located in an area where you have no registered unemployed it will not qualify for a relief grant under the special employment schemes.</P>
    <P>There is another type of road especially near the seaboard and leading from the main road.  The main road is well looked after and in firstclass condition but the road leading from it to the sea, into a village or to a big river, is neglected.  Certain improvements have been carried out under the relief schemes where you have the requisite number of registered unemployed in the area, but the roads I mention outside such areas are also deserving of attention.  Some day some Department will have to take the responsibility of making available a decent road for the inhabitants of these areas.  They are as much entitled to having that section of the road leading into their village put into good repair as those living adjacent to main and county roads.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act which has been mentioned by every member of the Dáil, it is true that this money was usefully spent and gave a good return.  I cannot understand why the decision was arrived at to withdraw these grants from local authorities.  Take my own county where we have a very large number of registered unemployed, where you have land flooded, and so on.  This money was very well spent in draining some of these areas in the ordinary way.  Over a period of two or three years, in 1948 and 1949, we were allocated in our county a grant of £80,000 a year to administer under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  That grant was reduced first of all from £80,000 to £51,000.  The previous Minister allocated £80,000 in each of three years and it was at a later stage that it was reduced to £51,000 and then to £23,000.  I do not know what this year's grant will be but the possibility is that it may not be any more than half what it was last year.  That money was spent to relieve flooding on the main and county roads and other roads under the control of the council <Col N="2161" /> and to relieve flooding on land.  It was generally spent on head drains that were intended to take away water from small drains.  The work I saw carried out had the advantage of making land available to qualify under the land project, by reason of the fact that there was a head drain. But for that head drain provided under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the outlet for the water, the inspector would not pass the land for reclamation.</P>
    <P>Another advantage of it was that it divided the money all through the county.  Money spent on main roads is earned by direct labour.  A big percentage of the money spent on county roads is given to private contractors, which is the old system and which, in my opinion, cannot be improved on.  This money under the Local Authorities (Works) Act was spent all over the county in different villages.  It brought a certain amount of revenue to the local people, it gave them the advantage of work near their own houses where they could have breakfast at a reasonable time, come home to dinner and get back to tea.  It came to the farmer's house to one or two sons and eventually found its way to the business people in the rural area or in the nearest town. When the grants were so considerably reduced we went back to the old system of flooded roads which were relieved of flooding while land which needs draining is left undrained.  The farmer who needs a day's wages where the work was originally operated loses now the advantage of that additional revenue.  The business people in the rural area or small town lose the advantage of the money which used to circulate amongst them. The money spent under that Act was well spent.  It gave a constructive return and it repaid itself in three to five years.  The people of that area obtained a living and had the opportunity of a week's wages to enable them to meet the ordinary commitments of the house.</P>
    <P>Complaints reach me every other day about delays in payment of the county council grants and supplementary grants.  In a lot of those <Col N="2162" /> cases where the Department is concerned there is bound to be delay. Some of the complaints I hear are due to the people themselves not going the right way about notifying the Department that the house is finished. I am given to understand that a local authority will not pay the grant until the final Government payment is made.  Then, when the local authority will pay its grant in full. To improve the position, when the final payment is made by the Department the Department should immediately notify the authority that such a man has received a housing grant value so much and that the final payment was made on such a date.  If the Department sent that notification to the local authority it would help the house builder to get the advantage of the Government grant and then the county council grant.</P>
    <P>In regard to the relief of rates, I cannot agree with the Minister, as I cannot see how it will benefit any section of the people living on the land.  In my opinion, even with the grants allowed for an increase in the number of employees, it will be found at the end of a year that the owner of the land or the man depending on it for his living will not have got much benefit from the relief.  In my opinion, it is the Exchequer that will reap the benefit.  The cry of the farmer, of the man on the land and of the people in the towns, is about the heavy rates. They say the rates have gone far in excess of what they can afford. Deputies here who are also members of local authorities know the feeling of the people as far as the rates are concerned.  Every member of a local authority at present is determined to see that the rates will go no higher. They are all trying to see what can be done to make them lower, as they have reached a point far in excess of what the people can afford.  I remember when they were 4/- in the £; now they are 36/- &mdash;nine times higher. People living on the land are getting a bit more out of it, but the rates have reached the limit.  For the farmers, the other day is coming; the war and the war scares are over; prices have <Col N="2163" /> reached the top and are coming down. We see what is happening in the case of many commodities produced on the land.  Our export markets, which were able to accommodate any surplus we had, have reached the stage when the profits are becoming smaller and smaller.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking for a few minutes last night on this Bill when I reported progress.  I was saying it was an important measure so far as it refers to a problem which interests every single Deputy, every member of a local authority, and practically every citizen of this country. That means we can gauge the importance of the question of the volume of work behind the bringing in of legislation of a suitable type to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>While the Bill provides certain limitations and stabilises valuations to some extent, it does not in any way strike at the root of this problem.  In fact, not only does it not strike at the root of the problem so far as people are aggrieved at present, but it tends to rub salt into the sores of those who are aggrieved by the inequitable system operated so haphazardly in the past. As time goes on and if rates tend to rise, those who have been revalued under the old system will continue to bear increasingly heavy burdens in comparison with their neighbours who have not been victims of this disproportionate code as it operated in the past.  Therefore, I think it would be a serious thing for this House to pass a half-measure that would perpetuate a grievance&mdash;a most fundamental grievance&mdash;which is involved in this whole question of revaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies pointed out that if a general revaluation were carried out, the burden would fall equitably <Col N="2164" /> on all.  That is the happy position we would all visualise, and unless some sort of legislation can be brought in that will envisage that state of affairs and that will tend towards relieving those people who are aggrieved under the old system, then I think we should be better not to bring in any legislation of this type.  The present system presents problems which very few people, if anybody, can fully understand. We are told it is based on letting value of premises.  In some cases it is based on the capital cost and the contractor's valuation of the premises, or it is based on the profits which derive from the business in the premises.  Whether based on one or on all three of these, I cannot very easily see how either test can be applied in a general way to the areas concerned. What might be a true basis for valuation in Meath would certainly not apply in Donegal.  What would apply in Dublin City would not apply in Connemara, and local conditions would have to be taken into consideration at all times.  I know what it is for an auctioneer and valuer to go around and value premises and property for probate.  He is guided by one particular rule and that is local valuation.  While he takes into consideration the outgoings on the property, its rateable valuation, ground rent or head rent, its location and the district, the main thing he takes into consideration is its comparison with properties of a similar type that were disposed of within recent times in the same area&mdash;which is really the only proper test.</P>
    <P>But you have people coming out from the valuation office in Dublin and I have known them to take a cursory glance at buildings extended and in course of time notification is given of a huge increase in valuation.  Sometimes I think in spite of all the regulations which govern their procedure, and in spite of the basis it is held they are bound to go on, I think they just think of a number and double it and the valuation is struck.  I think until we get some decent code whereby an equitable system will evolve and whereby we may have some&mdash;one could hardly hope for a perfect system&mdash; more equitable system than that <Col N="2165" /> operating at the present time, I do not think we should venture with a Bill like this to rub salt into the wounds of those people who were aggrieved under the disproportionate and inequitable system that has been operating. It would be very unfair for people whose valuations have been trebled, say, within the last year, and who are carrying a disproportionate share of the local rates&mdash;it would be very unfair for those people to stabilise valuations at this stage and to allow those people to go on, and if rates tend to rise, to have them continuing to carry disproportionate burdens.  I do not think anybody in this House would support legislation which would allow that state of affairs to exist, and if we have to wait for a few months until we have fundamental legislation which will tend to resolve these grievances, then I think we will be justified in waiting until that legislation is put before us and until we have an opportunity of criticising its every proposal and amending it at every stage so that we will have a piece of legislation that will settle this outstanding grievance of the people in regard to valuations and the inequitable manner in which they were operated throughout the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this Bill.  I cannot understand the attitude of some Deputies in opposing it.  I do not believe that the Bill is perfect, but the Deputies who introduced it have not claimed that it is perfect.  But it is at least going some way towards relieving some of the injustices that exist at the moment.  I believe with Deputy Cowan that probably the best way to deal with the matter would be to abolish rates completely.  After all, central taxation has gone to such a level now that if we added the local taxation on to it we might get a better scheme in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment there are very serious injustices occurring under the present system and this Bill proposes to give relief in certain respects.  We have at present going around the country a number of health inspectors and they are instructing or compelling people to make certain alterations in their premises and immediately these <Col N="2166" /> alterations are made the valuation officer comes along and increases the valuation.  We have the same in the agricultural field.  A person wants to be registered under the Milk and Dairies Act and a veterinary inspector comes out and says: &ldquo;You must build a stall here of certain dimensions.  You must build a new dairy.&rdquo;  When the farmer has done that the valuation officer comes along and increases the valuation.</P>
    <P>There is a story told of two gentlemen that came to a butcher's shop. The first man said: &ldquo;I am an inspector from the Department of Health.  I have come here to tell you to make certain improvements in your premises.  And this is my friend from the valuation office who is coming to increase your valuation when you have the improvements made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have that actually happening in the country at the moment.  This whole system is having the effect of hindering progress.  Everybody who travels in rural Ireland can see the deplorable condition of our farm buildings and the outmoded state of our agriculture as compared with other countries.  The people are afraid to modernise their buildings, to produce more efficiently and in a more up-to-date manner because of this bogey of increased valuations.  The present system is somewhat similar to that which existed in the old landlord and tenant days.  Unless some relief is given in the directions indicated in the Bill improvements will not be carried out.  We will not have the increased production for which all of us are clamouring.  We will not have premises in our cities and towns brightened up as we would like to see them brightened up for events such as An Tóstal.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the county manager comes in each year with an estimate to his local authority and he tells that body that he wants so much in the £&mdash; 33/- or 35/- in the £.  When the local authority reduces the estimate the county manager straightway sends up a list of premises to the valuation office to have the valuations increased and in that way he gets his estimate. That has the result of making the system utterly ridiculous, and it is <Col N="2167" /> a serious injustice on certain people.</P>
    <P>The rates generally are a very heavy burden throughout the country.  Increased valuations have the effect of increasing the rates.  In the case of licensed premises, there is also the effect from the owners' point of view &mdash;an advantage from the Minister for Finance's point of view&mdash;that increased valuations mean an increase in the cost of licences.  Increased valuations mean increased revenue to the E.S.B. and a heavier burden on the owners of these premises.  Indeed, this is a device to impose concealed taxation on the people.</P>
    <P>I have very great pleasure in supporting this measure.  While I agree it is not sufficiently comprehensive, because it does not go far enough, it will at least have the effect of removing some of the injustices that exist at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Government has not received this Bill with open arms.  This Bill is badly needed at the present time and the gratitude of the country is due to Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Morrissey and the other Deputies responsible for introducing this measure.  Apparently when they had the foresight to bring it in the Taoiseach agreed that it was a very good Bill.  How can the Government now oppose the Bill?  This is one measure for which the country is crying out.  There is unemployment in the building trade; this Bill is just the antidote we want for that unemployment. This Bill will create employment. Is the Government anxious to foster unemployment?  Deputies protest that they want to see the people in the country provided with work.  The one industry which is down and out at the present time is the building industry, and this Bill, if passed, will give that industry the greatest fillip it has ever had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that at the present time people are afraid to carry out even essential repairs to their premises because they believe that when the valuation officer goes in, it is not alone the repairs that he will examine, but he will examine the whole premises and revalue it from <Col N="2168" /> roof to foundation.  This Bill has been introduced at a very opportune time to allay the fears of those people who have a certain amount of capital and are anxious not to have their property, or their landlords' property, as the case may be, fall into disrepair.  They are not afraid to spend £500 or £1,000 on putting their premises into proper condition, but they are afraid of the results that that expenditure may have because they may find themselves burdened with an extra £100 or £150 per year which they will have to carry, and their children, and their children's children after them.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Government's attitude.  Two Deputies have introduced this excellent measure which is welcomed by everyone in the country and particularly by the builders who hope to get a lot of contracts straightway when the Bill passes into law.  I cannot understand why the Government will not accept it.  Are they afraid Deputy O'Higgins or Deputy Morrissey will get some well-deserved kudos?  Is that the reason?  If that is the reason, then it is a very petty one.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane adverted to the new health regulations under which people have been requested to reconstruct their premises.  Whether that reconstruction will mean more business, or whether it will not, I do not know, but I do know that once the premises are reconstructed the valuations will go up and these people may have to chuck in altogether.  Under the present system it might be as well for them to give up because otherwise they will be bled white with rates.  If these people carry out these reconstructions they will have to pay through the nose.</P>
    <P>Deputies supporting the Government, who are familiar with business, or who are associated with chambers of commerce, must know what the present burden of rates means to business people as a whole.  I think the Government will be doing a great disservice to the country if they do not accept this Bill.  If it passes into law and is put into operation immediately, thousands of unemployed builders' labourers and tradesmen who are at <Col N="2169" /> present idle will find remunerative employment.  They are hoping that if this Bill is accepted they will find themselves in work again this side of Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crotty and Deputy Lehane made the point that if this Bill goes through it will have the effect of reducing unemployment in the building industry and that it will put into remunerative employment certain of our skilled workers and labourers who are idle at the moment.  On the other hand, if this Bill is put into operation and the business community outlined in the Bill is saved and exempted from any further increases in valuations because of extensions or improvements to their premises, surely it is clear to everybody that it is the builders' labourers and building operatives who will have to carry the additional burden of rates on their own houses to pay for the people who, we are now told, will make work for them.  This question of valuation is not new.  It is because it is so old that it causes so much trouble.  Our valuation system is based on an Act brought into operation over 100 years ago.  The greatest cause of grievance to-day is not the revaluing of new premises or of premises which have been improved or extended but the fact that a number of valuations are out of date and premises are not bearing the rates that they should carry.</P>
      <P>Take, for instance, the case of a business premises to which some small addition was made which resulted in the valuation of, say, £50 being increased to £100.  In my opinion the owner of the premises has no cause for complaint.  If he maintains that the addition to his premises warrants only a 25 per cent. increase in valuation, which would bring his valuation to £62 10s., I maintain that the person was for many years getting away with a lower valuation than his premises should carry.  When he carries out some alteration and the premises are revalued, he has no grouse because he has been getting away with less than his true valuation for 10 to 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the case of a private house in a <Col N="2170" /> terrace of houses in which the owner started a little shop for the sale of tobacco, confectionery or minerals.  No notice may have been taken of that business venture at the start.  Perhaps due to the owner's initiative or to increased prosperity in the area the business became really lucrative.  The grouse is not with the shopkeeper in that dwelling-house if he finds his valuation increased, but with his nextdoor neighbour who is paying rates on the same valuation.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if passed, would perpetuate that type of grievance.  We can only get rid of the grievances that arise as a result of our valuation code by a complete revaluation of the whole country.  It is true that a Minister of this House was about to bring in such a Bill for revaluation.  I was not a member of the House at that time but from what I have heard I consider that the Minister was lucky in not being run out of the country for proposing such a terrible thing.  Yet we all know that the only hope is in complete revaluation.  The damage is not being done by the present valuation code but by the manner in which it is administered.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any better system, the system of valuing premises and property on letting value is as fair as possible.  Many of the grievances in connection with the code have been created by the fact that individual persons were reported by, possibly, the rate collector who was instructed by the local authority to report cases of improvements being carried out.  In many cases that has resulted in increased valuations.  The grievance is not so much that the valuation has been increased in that case but that the valuation of the premises next door has not been increased.  If the valuation of all premises were brought up to date the result would be a lower rate per £ in every county and everybody would be on an equal footing.</P>
    <P>There may be other solutions&mdash;they have not been suggested in this House &mdash;but in my opinion the only solution is to retain the present system of valuing property according to the letting value, relating it to the locality and the district.  If that were done and the <Col N="2171" /> whole country were revalued according to present-day values we would have a fairly satisfactory system.  To say that this Bill should be welcomed because it will relieve a certain group of the disabilities inherent in the present system is a very wrong approach to this question.  Unless it is done for some ulterior motive, I cannot see why anybody should try to press such a Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Bill has had the effect of getting all Parties talking on the subject.  If the Bill was introduced for that purpose, it was not a bad idea.  If they are genuinely behind this measure I certainly would have no time for it and could not possibly see it do any of the things that are claimed for it by its sponsors.  Instead, for instance, of improving the situation generally, would not this matter of relieving certain business premises of any increase in valuation due to improvements or extensions have the effect of further increasing the disparities that already exist as between one premises and another?  If a house or a building is being used for a business and that business is improving and increasing, surely no matter what business it is that house as a result of this increased business is a better letting proposition to-day than it was last year, and if there is an increase in valuation because of that, I think it is quite a fair way to do the matter, but our whole problem is that all those places are not being done and kept up to date.  If we can by any further legislation in the near future bring about some measure that will see to it that the country as a whole is revalued from the North to the South and from the East to the West and that none of the new valuations so struck will be put into operation until the last is finished&mdash;in other words, if they start this month in County Dublin and they do not finish in Donegal or Kerry until this time two years&mdash;then I would say that the various valuations should be suspended until such time as the last tenement or property should have got its new valuation, and then all should go on together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2172" /> One way at the moment that is open to anybody under the present code of valuation, or to any county, to bring about revision or revaluation of its county is that by the request of the local authority duly furnished to the Valuation Commissioners here in Dublin a valuation revision, if you like, but really in effect a revaluation of that county or rating authority, can be carried out.  So far as I understand, there is in operation, or at least a precedent for, such a measure to go through this House so as to relieve those who are revalued within the county of certain property taxes and income-tax legislation.  I understand that something of this nature occurred in Waterford some years ago and, to my mind, it could be applied possibly with good effect to all the other counties as they saw fit to apply for revision or revaluation.  To say this and to make that claim and that statement in a local authority is rather dangerous for anybody in public life, because of the fact that so much confusion can be created in the minds of ratepayers and so much misrepresentation can be made out of such a statement.  But if we look at it with reason and without trying to confuse we will see that without really putting any new valuation code through this House in any way any local authorities in the counties throughout the Twenty-Six Counties can, in effect, bring about that revision and that revaluation on the entire country without having to have new legislation at all.  I think myself, and I have said it in my own county council some time ago, that it would be a good thing, and a most disirable thing.  When I come to mention my own county council, I think that it would not only be a good thing and a most desirable thing that in my own county particularly such a revaluation should be requested because, as this House knows and people throughout the country know, we have a valution crisis, if you like to call it that, existing at the moment in a town in our county, and that is, Buncrana. Buncrana revaluation was brought about by the self-same means as I have now suggested all county councils may use, when the local urban council by <Col N="2173" /> vote of such council asked for a revaluation.</P>
    <P>In asking for that revaluation they apparently only saw the good side of asking.  They only saw that dwelling-houses which had grown into shops over the years were only paying the old dwelling-house valuation like their next door neighbours who were still living in them as dwelling-houses. They saw things like this, and that what were originally dwelling-houses had enhanced so much in value due to business carried on in them without any structural alteration.  When they saw these things in Buncrana, which has flourished and prospered very well under recent law, the disparity in the actual valuations and the old valuations of different premises, although the buildings were originally the same, and in actual structural effect are still the same, was very noticeable.  They put this through their local urban council with a view to remedying that situation of where a person was living in a house valued 20 years ago as a dwelling-house at £7 or £10, and another had meantime started up and succeeded very well in running a shop in the house next door. They thought it was time those people next door should carry a fair share of valuation on premises used as business premises, although built as dwelling-houses. Therefore, they asked for and they got very promptly a revaluation of the town.  But, as I say, in asking for that apparently they only saw the good side of this manner of equating the different valuations in this town.  They did not realise one very fundamental thing, and that was that Buncrana, although a local authority exists there and controls the destinies of that town, is at the same time only part of a rating unit; and, instead of only having to strike a rate to carry the costs of their own town which would work out all right no matter whether it was under the old valuation or the new, where they have been really badly hit is that they must pay the county rate as well as the town.  In the town their valuations have been increased by almost 50 per cent.  Outside, in the areas of the rating unit in the county, the valuations have not <Col N="2174" /> been so increased, and the result is that, the rest of the county being a much greater part of the rating unit than Buncrana, an amount has been demanded on that town on a new increased valuation which is in a much greater proportion to what they should be paying all the way through.</P>
    <P>They did not apparently see that sang when they were putting this through, and although they saw it very quickly afterwards, and made all efforts to try and stop this being put into effect, it was of no avail, because once the Commissioners of Valuation get hold of a request issued in proper order by a local authority that request must and will be carried through by them, and that new valuation will be struck and enforced irrespective of what other actions that local authority may afterwards decide to take or why they acted.</P>
    <P>As I say, in each county or in any county it is now a desirable thing to ask for a revaluation of the entire rating unit.  I think that is a good thing in any county, but at the moment it is not only a good thing in our county for the town of Buncrana but it is very essential for that town that some such effort should be made by our local authority for a kick-off in Donegal, so as to relieve Buncrana of an unjust and undue load which they are now carrying because of the revaluation asked for by their own urban council under the misapprehension that it could only bring about good.</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (2) of Section 3 of this Bill it is suggested that &ldquo;Where an increase in the valuation of the tenement including such building is made on an application for the revision of such valuation by reason solely of such enlargement or improvement, such increase shall not have effect until the expiration of a period of seven years from the date of such increase.&rdquo; I cannot see why that particular case should be made for the business community.  It is fairly true to say that if a businessman is improving his premises, if he adds to the size of his premises, if he improves their structural layout, it is fairly certain that he is a successful businessman, <Col N="2175" /> and if he is a successful businessman he must also be a sensible one, so I take it then that if he adds to his premises in that way and expends money on it he is doing it from a purely business point of view, from a point of view of commercial gain. Surely if he can see that by extending his premises and improving them he could make more money and make a greater success of his business, the rest of the ratepayers in the rating unit or in the county should not allow him to go on for seven years without having any return from him by way of rates on that improved and increased business house, because during those same seven years, I take it, he will be reaping the rewards of his efforts. He will be reaping the benefit of the gain which he hoped to get as a result of his improved business house.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, a businessman is a sensible man as, otherwise, he would not be long in business.  If he decided to add to his house he is quite sure, before doing so, that it will add to his profits.  That being so, surely the community in his particular county can expect part of that profit which is taken from the people as a whole in the same county and surely part of that profit should not be grudged to the community in general in the way of rates when the valuation is increased.  I can see no reason for making an exception in this particular case.  Neither can I see any particular reason why any part of this Bill should go through, because I can only see its effects in one way.  If the effects of this Bill are to make more obvious the disparities that already exist and to increase the grievances and grouses that we all know of throughout the country at the moment due to the inequitable system of valuation&mdash;if the Bill can only add to all that, and I can see it achieving nothing else&mdash;then no good case can be made for it and we should, with all haste, turn it down and, if possible, bring in some measure in the future which will cater not merely for a particular section of the community but which will try to remedy the grievances which are in existence in all sections at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we are coming towards the end of the discussion on this stage of the Bill, we can look back and say that at least it has provided this House with a forum to discuss all aspects of valuation. There is no doubt that, because of the attention which the Bill has received by way of support and opposition, the problem must be a very serious one throughout the country.</P>
      <P>There is tacit admission by most of the speakers on the Government side that the system of valuation as it exists to-day, and the effects which it has, are detrimental to the increased production which is the expressed desire of all Parties in this House, causing to a certain extent a deterioration in employment in the building trade.  It is regrettable that the Government will not accept this Bill in the spirit in which it is offered as a measure at least to relieve some of the hardships caused by the immediate revaluation of all premises in respect of which, in many instances, immediate financial return does not accrue to the person carrying out the improvements. On many occasions it is possible that, through ill-health or some other peculiar circumstances, the people who occupied and owned the premises may not have had the incentive or the wherewithal to improve them, and they may have left them as an inheritance to other members of the family.  The new owners would feel, in taking over the premises, that it was incumbent upon them to make up for the deficiencies of the past.  It might take the most of a lifetime before they would recover the expense involved&mdash;and, to-day, the expense is considerable in that respect.  We feel, therefore, that such people would be encouraged if they were not called upon to meet commitments so soon after effecting the improvement works.  The condition of the valuation system, as it exists at present, has been described by Government Deputies as &ldquo;a festering sore&rdquo; and even as &ldquo;a cancerous growth,&rdquo; and they have said that nothing short of a severe operation by the Government would save the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the patient's condition is as bad <Col N="2177" /> as all that, surely the Government cannot complain because some remedial measure has been taken by the Opposition in the form of this private Bill which has been presented to the House.  We, therefore, ask Government Deputies to accept the Bill in that spirit and, if it can be improved later on, well and good.  It was at least time that the spotlight of the opinion of this House was directed to this matter of providing an inducement to people to go ahead and improve their premises and brighten up the places where we go to secure the services we require.</P>
    <P>Often in this House, on various measures, we pay tribute to the importance of our tourist industry.  The Government very quickly accepted the possibility that improvements for the Tóstal might entail increased valuation which would, perhaps, deter many people from incurring the relatively small expenditure that would be involved to brighten up their premises for that event.  That was an acceptance by the Government of that state of affairs.  People who wish to improve their premises are in dread of increased valuation and, still more so, according as the rates increase.  People throughout the country to-day often pose us this question: If we apply for a grant to improve our premises, how soon will we be called upon to pay an increased rate?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that exists. Perhaps it is a legacy from the days when the landlords operated this system and that very same threat has been handed down to us, that, if a man improves his place, he will have to pay for it in the long run.</P>
    <P>We must remember that many of the people affected by this are already subject to several means tests in relation to social welfare and many other services and it is unfair to heap upon them the additional burden of increased rates.  Is it not a fact that the person who allows his premises or his farm to go into ruin will be immediately compensated by the State? People get the old age pension and possibly that man's widow may get the widow's pension and so on.  Is it not only right that we should <Col N="2178" /> encourage those who will take over such a place, who will engage labour and give valuable employment in providing a place where people can get food or any of the services that they require under proper conditions?  Is it not a fact that, particularly in these days when self-driving has increased so considerably, we require an improvement in the premises along our main routes where meals will be available and that these places should conform to the regulations under the Health Act?  These places are called on to go to considerable expense in providing amenities, but the moment they do so they get a visit from the valuation officer.  There are people in the country who are waiting for the results of this debate with considerable interest and I suggest that, even if the Bill has defects, the House should accept it as something long overdue and, perhaps, in the future it might be possible to go a little further and wipe out injustices which have been admitted by many Deputies to exist in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the speeches made from both sides of the House, it is clear that both sides agree that there is need for legislation to deal with this matter of valuation.  I am inclined to believe, however, that it is purely a matter of Party politics that we have not arrived at a decision long ago.  While the Bill is effective in many ways, there is no reason why we should not improve it and bring it nearer to our heart's desire.  We are supporting the principle of this Bill, but we definitely intend to make it a Bill which can be regarded as satisfactory. Deputies have advocated that it should be an agreed Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks why, but I am not going to waste the time of the House telling him.  Briefly, it <Col N="2179" /> was because it was not popular. Neither side was prepared to face it because it was too unpopular to pass. Numbers of people have approached me with regard to this matter of valuation and, even down in Killarney this year, people connected with hotels I was in told me about certain changes they wanted to make, but they said to me: &ldquo;What is the good of doing it when our rates will go up?&rdquo;  I believe that there is a lot of that type of work being held up for that reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to allow Deputy Briscoe to sidetrack me. If we get this Bill to Committee Stage, all sides can agree on amending it in such a way as to make it suit the interests we have in mind.  There is no reason why the Bill should not be supported and then, in Committee Stage, made the Bill the people want.  The time has arrived when many of these things are necessary and it is about time we gave up playing Party politics. Let us get down to dealing with these matters in the interests of the people rather than play Party politics.  We are not satisfied that the Bill is what it should be, but we have in mind making it the Bill we want.  If we do not succeed in that, we will not vote for the passing of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is no new problem.  Deputy Corry taunted me last night with regard to this matter of valuation in Cork, but Deputies from Cork know that some of the valuations there are as old as 100 years.  They know also that there are new shops, erected following the burning of Cork, which are paying rates on new valuations as against premises the valuations of which have not been increased for over 100 years.  The reason these valuations were not increased is that it was felt then that if we raised the valuations, we were doing so in the interests of the British Government.  Deputies should know that 1d. rate in Cork City to-day&mdash;this is an answer to Deputy Corry, who tried to put me in a wrong light&mdash;cannot yet bring in £1,000, <Col N="2180" /> which shows that there is something wrong.  Is it any wonder that our rate is 38/6 in the £?</P>
    <P>This Bill may have its defects, as all Bills have when introduced.  The Health Bill was not everything we wanted when it was introduced, but we accepted the principle of it and did everything we could to make a perfect Bill of it.  The same applies to the Workmen's Compensation Bill.  We were promised that the compensation code was to be greatly changed in the near future, but when it came to a question of supporting the Bill, we found many of the defects we were anxious to get rid of steamrolled through by a Party vote.  That is why I urge both sides on this occasion to stop the Party politics.  Let us have the Bill, and let us amend and improve it.  So far as we are concerned, it will not be passed by our vote, if it is not a satisfactory Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">

      <P>There is this to be said for the Bill, that it has opened up an opportunity for all of us to have a full and frank discussion and exchange of views on this matter.  We all realise that this matter of valuations is very complex.  The system in operation in this country has been in operation for 101 years, but, having looked at the Bill and studied it I cannot see anything in it, even from the Fine Gael point of view about which one can be laudatory.  Its main provision is designed to assist the well-to-do who might in some cases improve their premises for one reason or another.  It has often been the case that up-to-date, well-established business premises have been extended with a consequent saving to the owner or occupier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I do not like about this Bill is that the movers of it seek to cover up its main principle by telling us that the farmers can get an exemption in respect of any farm buildings they erect which add to the amenities or value of their farms.  Speaking subject to correction, I take it that any farm buildings renovated or reconstructed within the past seven or eight years have been allowed a two-thirds remission of rates.  I have a very open <Col N="2181" /> mind on this matter of valuation, but it is a matter to which I have given a great amount of thought and study. Naturally, any of us who have associations with local bodies, find ourselves confronted with problems of rating and valuation every day, but the one thing which struck me on reading the Bill was that it is sectional, in so far as it is intended to apply, and to apply very beneficially, only to the well-to-do class of the community.  I do not give it full marks for any provision it makes in relation to the giving of relief to farmers for the reconstruction of dwelling-houses or renovation of out-offices.</P>
    <P>Another thing that struck me very forcibly during the debate is the fact that we have had very little contribution from the Labour benches.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, before I was interrupted, the point I wish to make is that I was really amazed and surprised by the silence of the Labour Party in relation to this Bill.  Their contribution, if any, has <Col N="2182" /> been negligible.  While I appreciate the Fine Gael point of view that this is another effort to assist the conservative elements in whom they have a very special interest, I say that it is just a smoke-screen, a well thought out subterfuge which is being exploited to suggest that the main principles of the Bill will give certain, concessions to farmers who have already derived benefits under the various housing Acts. With other speakers I agree that now, 100 years or more since the Griffith Valuation Act of 1852 was enacted, it is time that this whole question of valuation and revaluation should be tackled.  The system as we know it to-day is outworn and outdated.  Notwithstanding the assurances Deputy O'Higgins has given us that on the Committee Stage, if we are prepared to do so, we can embody in the Bill certain provisions that are not in it at the moment, I do not know why Labour Deputies, if they have the interests of the labourers of the country at heart, should wait for the Committee Stage to make this Bill the measure they would like it to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind Deputy Hickey or any other Labour Deputy that if and when the question of a comprehensive Valuation Bill is under consideration, cognisance should be taken of the fact that, as was mentioned by the Minister for Local Government in introducing his Estimate, the 1947 housing census showed that we needed 72,000 houses in this country and that, as indicated in the report which he presented to this House and was published in the Press, 52,000 people have been housed in this country&mdash;artisans in our cities and towns.  Is it not the clear, naked fact, known to Labour Deputies and to every other Deputy in the House, that <Col N="2183" /> when tenants for these houses are selected by local authorities, they get no remission of rates?  According to the present system operated by the Commissioners of Valuation, a valuation as high as £7 is placed on rural cottages and the incoming tenant must pay the full rate in the £ on that valuation from the day he enters into possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there anything to prevent you amending the Bill to bring about a change in that system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The same thing applies to labourers, artisans, tradesmen or others who are given houses in our towns.  Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Morrissey, who introduced this Bill, tell us that there is a principle enshrined in the Bill that should be accepted.  I shall give them credit for going part of the way, so far as their lights, their political affiliations and their intelligence permit them to go, to seek an amendment in the present system but, surely to goodness, something that is outworn and outdated, having been 101 years in existence, is not good enough to offer to the people.  Even if we were free from the Party Whips, I would not support this Bill, because I believe it is tinkering with a matter that requires careful consideration.  It requires the calculation and calm deliberation of all sections of this House to devise a measure sufficiently comprehensive to meet present day conditions.</P>
      <P>I should like to support the viewpoint of Deputies from this side of the House, and from the other side, who said that the valuation authorities would be well advised to suspend the operation of the system at present in force.  I heard Deputy Blaney speak of the situation which operates in Buncrana.  I know of several cases myself in West Limerick where valuations were raised on houses that were not even reconstructed or renovated. These houses had their valuations increased in the last five years by at least 300 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember an occasion in this House when the then Deputy Kissane, <Col N="2184" /> Deputy McEllistrim and myself tabled a question to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, asking if it were not a fact that during his term of office as Minister for Finance a circular marked, &ldquo;Private and confidential&rdquo;, was sent from the Revenue Commissioners to the Commissioners of Valuation and to all city and county managers, asking them to go through their rate books and to list therefrom premises with a per-1914 valuation, special emphasis being laid on the fact that licensed premises should get priority of place in such lists, which they were asked to submit for revaluation to the Commissioners of Valuation in Dublin.  In a supplementary to the then Minister for Finance I repeated that question but he did not answer me.  I wonder will it be challenged now by the promoters of this Bill that I am stating the truth when I say that a secret, private and confidential circular was sent out in 1948 to local authorities to list pre-1914 ratings, whether the premises were renovated or not?  They were to be listed on the grounds, of course, that their letting value at that time was much greater than it had been prior to 1914.  I say the whole system is wrong.  In so far as this Bill focuses attention on the question of valuation, I think I can say that Deputy O'Higgins has done a good day's work in introducing it and that he is deserving of credit from all sides of the House to that extent.  We have had unanimity amongst Deputies generally that some comprehensive measure will have to be introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure that if Deputy McGrath and Deputy Collins were free men they would act according to their conscience and support the Bill.  The Bill was opposed by the Minister for Finance some weeks ago <Col N="2187" /> when it was introduced.  He described it in his own provocative way as being a half-backed proposal.  I do not want to be hard on the Minister for that particular phrase, but he did so describe it.  It is a half-baked proposal, according to the Minister, that in the last four months has done extraordinary things.  It was introduced into this House in the month of June of this year, and it was followed shortly afterwards by a panicky announcement by the Minister for Local Government that he proposed to introduce certain remission of rates proposals.  The introduction of the Bill was followed by a sort of leap-frogging by Fianna Fáil Deputies and members of the Dublin Corporation who were anxious to assure the citizens of Dublin that they were going to introduce some measure of rate relief.  That half-baked proposal has certainly achieved that extraordinary result in the last three or four months.  There has not been a measure within recent years&mdash;and it is a compliment to the House&mdash;that has aroused so much discussion as this Bill has aroused in this House.  Some 33 Deputies have spoken on it, a tribute again to the intelligence and wisdom of this House.  The only regret is that more Deputies are not free to vote as they have been free to speak.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go over again the case made for this Bill.  In introducing it, I said that it was not intended to be a comprehensive measure.  It was an effort made by private Deputies to remedy in some small way a burning grievance felt by the people of this country.  It has been introduced at a time of economic depression, at a time when throughout the country the people are feeling the brunt of bad times.  I would have thought that any measure which helped to provide employment, to increase domestic capital and, generally, to set going again even in a small way the wheels of business would receive general acceptance in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure would tend to do that. It would tend to provide employment, to increase business and, in a small way, help to dispel the clouds of <Col N="2188" /> economic depression which are at present gathered over the country.  Of course, it would be accepted by every Deputy in this House, if they were free to vote according to their conscience. But the Minister for Finance has opposed it and, because he has opposed it, every Fianna Fáil Deputy, new and old, must act in accordance with the particular programme laid down.</P>
    <P>Three months ago, Deputy Cogan would have been the first Deputy to applaud this Bill.  Deputy Cogan, as a free farmer from Wicklow, promoted a ratepayers' organisation and stumped the country from Wicklow to Cork and up to Donegal, fighting the ratepayers' battle before he joined the man whom he had described as &ldquo;the senile delinquent in the Fianna Fáil Party&rdquo;.  Now, like so many other Deputies who are not free, he must do what he is told to do.</P>

      <P>I want to refer, Sir, to the songs put on the card by the Minister for Finance.  They have been sung by Fianna Fáil Deputies since, with one exception because, even in a bad chorus, there is occasionally a good voice.  I am glad to say that in the bad chorus of Fianna Fáil there was one good voice in the person of Deputy Seán Flanagan.  We welcomed <Col N="2189" /> the very fine approach he made to this Bill, but the songs that the Minister for Finance ordained should be sung were numerous.  Many of them would not be acceptable in this House because of our strict censorship rules, but I suppose some of them should be dealt with here.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance said that this was a bit of class legislation.  I do not know whether that was intended to be taken seriously.  He said it was class legislation.  That may be a good debating point.  I do not know whether it makes good sense either to Deputies here or to the people outside. I suppose, when the Tourist Traffic Act was introduced last year providing for grants for hotels, it would have been fair to describe that as class legislation.</P>

      <P>I am sure, when Deputy Briscoe is Minister for Finance and introduces legislation providing for the reduction of the dance tax, that that could be described as class legislation. I am certain in the same way that when we in this Bill provide for the general body of ratepayers, as we undoubtedly do, it is a good debating point for the Minister for Finance to describe that as class legislation.</P>
      <P>The fact is that under this Bill we hope to help not the better-off section &mdash;they are no concern of ours&mdash;but the ordinary struggling shopkeepers of this country, the people who have a small business and who find it difficult to pay their way, to make ends meet, and who are anxious at times to expand and improve their premises for the business they are doing.  Those people dare not at the moment put a drop of paint on the smallest brush for fear of the visit of the rate collector and a revaluation of their premises.  Those are the people we are endeavouring to help and if that is class legislation I am proud of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that every Deputy opposite recognises the good sense of what we are endeavouring to do.  If this Bill became law&mdash;I am certain this Bill either in its present form or in some similar form will become law&mdash;it will <Col N="2190" /> be possible then to encourage the decent kind of business conditions that we would all like to see obtaining in this country.  Mind you, deliberately in this Bill we did not, as we might have done&mdash;and the Government apparently propose doing it&mdash;merely try to bring about a remission in rates.  Quite deliberately we did not do that.  We sought to bring about a postponement of valuation because we know well that if the owner of a business house proceeds to expend capital on reconstructing or enlarging it, his valuation is substantially increased.</P>
    <P>There is very little use saying to him: &ldquo;We will give you two-thirds remission rates for a number of years&rdquo; when his income-tax doubles or trebles; when, if he is a publican, his excise duty is increased and when his charges for electric light and water are substantially increased because the valuation has gone up, although the charge on valuation for poor rate is not collected.  It is for that precise purpose that in this Bill we proposed to give a postponement of valuation, not a remission of rates, so that every businessman could be encouraged if necessary to borrow money from the bank or somebody else and invest it in improving his business in the knowledge that he would not have to meet, in addition to bank charges and other charges, new taxes for rates and valuation, excise duty and various things of that kind.  That is why this Bill is introduced, not as a remission of rates Bill, but as a Valuation Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister and, of course, other Deputies also suggested that the Bill proposes to stabilise valuations.  Under Section 2 of the Bill we propose that no valuation may be increased unless there has been some form of improvement or structural alteration.  That does not mean that valuations may not be reduced.  We had in mind in that section many examples of wholesale general valuations in particular areas. We had particularly in mind the case of Buncrana and other areas throughout the country where a general revaluation took place and the valuation of particular houses was increased although, in fact, no alteration whatsoever took place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2191" /> We also had in mind what is happening at the moment in the Store Street area of the city which is represented by Deputy Cowan.  I have no doubt Deputy Cowan will support this Bill.  Merely because a large building has been built within 20 or 30 yards of business premises these premises are scheduled for revision.  The people who own these premises may have done nothing whatsoever in the way of alteration or anything of that kind, but the mere fact that the Store Street palace for civil servants and refuge for passenger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will deal with Deputy Briscoe in a moment, but if, in fact, reconstruction does take place, then, under Section 3, we propose that the increase in valuation shall not operate for a period of seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made one reference to Section 2 which was quite sound, again in theory.  He imagined the case of an ordinary residence which ceased to be used as a residence and which it was proposed to use for the purpose of offices or something of that kind.  He had to indulge in considerable mental exercises to imagine how that change <Col N="2192" /> of user could be effected without any structural alteration whatever.  He apparently did think that was possible, but it certainly is not intended by me, or by any other Deputy supporting this Bill, where such a change of user takes place, without any alteration whatever, that there should not be an alteration in the valuation.  That is a matter of detail and can be dealt with on a later stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to farm buildings.  I want to say a word about them.  It is very easy for the Minister for Finance, or for anybody else, to point to a section in the Act of 1852 which provides that where a farmer erects a farm building or an outhouse he will have two-thirds remission of rates for a period of years.  It is easy for the Minister to say that that concession is already there.  If it were there already, we would not be inserting Section 3 in this Bill.  It is because of my experience, and the experience of many other country Deputies, that where an existing farm building is reconstructed&mdash;where, for example, an old shed is turned into a machine house and something more substantial is put in its place&mdash;there is a revaluation of that building, and the valuation is increased.  It is because of that, that in Section 3 we are providing for farmers, as we do for business people, that if any farmer wants to carry out reconstruction or to improve a building on his farm, he will have the assurance that the increase in valuation will not take place for a period of seven years. We are there providing something what is not there at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am very glad and very grateful to Deputies in the Labour Party and to some other Deputies who referred to what they called omissions in this Bill. There is no Deputy here who could imagine himself sufficiently competent in a short Bill of this kind, to deal with all the things that all of us would like to deal with.  It was not due to an oversight, for instance, that dwelling-houses were not provided for in this Bill.  Any person who at the moment reconstructs or alters a dwelling-house is entitled to a two-thirds remission of rates under an Act passed in 1940, and <Col N="2193" /> continued a number of times since.  It is for that reason that the Bill does not set out to deal with dwelling-houses. I am conscious, and we were conscious at the time, that people might say: &ldquo;Well, why should not the owner of a dwelling-house get a postponement of valuation instead of a remission of rates?&rdquo;  We thought not. We thought, with regard to the reconstruction of dwelling-houses, that the position there is covered amply at the moment.</P>
    <P>A different case arises with regard to labourers' cottages.  At the moment, in many counties, purchase schemes are coming into operation, and quite a number of tenants to local authorities will, in the near future, purchase out their cottages.  The cottages which they will purchase out under the first schemes will, to a large extent, be the older cottages.  Most of them who will buy out these houses will do so with the intention of expending money immediately on reconstruction or improvement. We have considered carefully, and had considered carefully, whether or not those cottages could then be regarded as cottages provided under the Labourers' Acts.  If they cannot be so regarded, then a full remission of rates is already provided for and will apply, but in case there should be a doubt in the mind of any Deputy with regard to this matter, we shall certainly take steps on the next stage of the Bill adequately to provide for labourers's cottages, and for any other doubts that Deputies may have as to what is covered by the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House unduly, but in so far as it has been possible to diagnose from the speeches made on the opposite side, a line of logical opposition to this Bill, it seems to be based on a demand for a general revaluation throughout the country. The Minister for Finance is the father of the idea of revaluation.  It was he who introduced the Bill designed to that end in 1938.  In this debate, his views in that regard were repeated by Deputy Briscoe, and by quite a number of other Deputies.  Now that is a point of view.  A general revaluation is, apparently, the aim and policy of the Government at the moment.  I do not <Col N="2194" /> know whether those who talk about it consider what is likely to happen.  Of course, it could immediately be said, as the Minister for Finance said, that the poundage rate will drop.  That is perfectly obvious, and I give no one any marks for that.  If, at the moment, the house that any one of us lives in could be let at, say, £200 a year, and if there was to be a general revaluation, the poor law valuation of that house, subject to some obvious deductions, should be £200 a year.  We may take it that if, in every part of Ireland, a general revaluation took place, valuations would be increased some ten or 12 times.</P>

      <P>The important thing that has emerged from this debate is this idea of a general revaluation.  I want to warn the Government and Deputies who are inclined to be affected by that kind of policy that they are starting something extremely dangerous. The idea of valuation, the idea of the poor rate, is something that was put upon this country 100 years ago.  We are the only part of the United Kingdom that has still retained it as it is retained here, and in this House the only Party that is concerned to see it maintained and, in fact, increased, is the Fianna Fáil Party, the most conservative Party in Ireland.  In England, in the North of Ireland, in any part of the United Kingdom that was then affected by this idea of valuation and poor rate, adaptations have been made, but in this country in 1953, 101 years later, when two or three private Deputies <Col N="2195" /> produce a small, humble measure, they are termed as class legislators by the Government Party.</P>
      <P>There is great danger in a general revaluation.  I know it will never happen because, if it does, local taxation will succeed in destroying all initiative.  I am astounded to see Deputy Cogan quiescent and calm behind the Party that proposes a general revaluation.  I am astounded to see Dublin Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party calmly accepting a demand for a general revaluation as made by the Minister, by Deputy Briscoe and other Deputies over there.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been discussed extremely well here subject to the limitations imposed on Fianna Fáil Deputies.  Whether or not it is accepted by the House this proposal or something similar has been accepted by the people.  The Government need not think that coming in here in a month's time with a tiny little mouse called a Remission of Rates Bill will suffice.  It will not.  What the people require if business is to expand, if employment is to be made available, is something far more than a proposal to remit rates for any period.  I am glad we have had an opportunity of proposing the Bill, and I am glad that Deputies on all sides of the House who have moaned about the ratepayer, who have inveighed against the rate collector, who have sneered at the Valuation Office and at all those persons and officials who are countenanced by the present state of the law, will have an opportunity now to vote according to their conscience, if they are free men.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cafferky has given notice that he wished to raise the subject-matter of Questions Nos. 27 and 28 in to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>This afternoon I addressed Questions Nos. 27 and 28 to the Minister for Agriculture and I have seen the replies from the Parliamentary Secretary.  My reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment&mdash;which is a thing I do not like doing, to be quite frank, to be holding Deputies or Ministers or officials over and above their ordinary time&mdash;is that I feel it is of importance, and judging by the replies I received to-day I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister consider that it is of importance.</P>
      <P>The whole of East Mayo and West Roscommon is subject to flooding for well-nigh 100 years and the people have waited patiently for the day when some relief would be forthcoming. In 1948-49 they felt that relief was at hand, when the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, was generous enough to provide out of his Estimate a sum of something like £60,000 with a view to removing the main obstacle that prevented the carrying out of the work of drainage that I referred to in the two questions I addressed to the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of East Mayo and West Roscommon consider that the action of the then Minister for Agriculture in providing that substantial sum of money, £60,000, was an act that they appreciated very much.  Away back when Deputy Dillon's father was a Member of Parliament in the British House of Commons, he, in his day, also played a very important part in trying to bring about an easement of the flooding that took place in that area, but, due to powers totally outside his scope and outside the influence of any Irish Member of Parliament in <Col N="2199" /> those days, his efforts did not come to fruition.  But we did hope, and we did think, that an Irish Parliament, not subject to any outside influence, direct or indirect, would make available the essential funds and machinery to have this drainage carried out.</P>
    <P>You, Sir, may not be aware that in East Mayo and West Roscommon we are very small farmers of £3 to £10 valuation and we depend on every perch of land in order to eke out a livelihood, and then it is only a miserable livelihood.  But in most cases two-thirds of the holdings of those smallholders are subject to flooding and only one-third is available for cultivation.  The Parliamentary Secretary would like me to accept it and to believe what he tells me that he can do nothing there and can hold out no promise because of the arterial drainage scheme.  I do not accept that.  This arterial drainage scheme, which became an Act away back in 1945, almost ten years ago, is being used very frequently to cover up the delays of the Board of Works and to cover up the failure of the Minister for Finance to provide essential funds to initiate a scheme such as I have in mind at the moment.  I do not believe for one moment that this could be coupled with a catchment area.  I am now, Sir, through you, going to ask the Parliamentary Secretary for what purpose was the bed of rock removed? Why were the bridges underpinned? Was it just for exhibition; so that people could go and see an engineering feat?  Was it just for the sake of giving employment?  For what purpose was this work done?  To reduce the amount of water in Lough Gara, to provide a fall for the waters from the rivers I have in mind?</P>
    <P>That is the purpose for which it was removed and no matter what clearance is carried out to-day in any of the rivers known to Deputies Finan and Seán Flanagan, who are here in the House, it will not mean one pound's worth more of water will flow into Lough Gara than is flowing at the moment.  Lough Gara is well able to take it.  It could rain for three weeks, day and night, and it would make no <Col N="2200" /> difference to Lough Gara at the present moment owing to the removal of the bed of rock.  I want to make it known that it is essential to take into consideration the Boyle river.  I want to say very clearly that I have been asked by the people of East Mayo to raise this matter in the Dáil over the past two years.  I waited patiently because I do not get any kudos out of raising a matter of this kind here.  I do not want to make any political capital out of it either.  I want to make it clear that every Deputy in the area is interested in the drainage of that area.  I have been forced by the apathy of the Department of Finance, the Department of Agriculture and the Board of Works in not providing funds to bring this drainage to completion to take this action.</P>
    <P>There is, I understand, arising out of the removal of this rock and the underpinning of the bridges, a fall of from ten to 20 feet at the present moment, and we are asking neither more nor less from the Government, the Board of Works or the Department of Agriculture than the provision of the essential machinery, the labour and money to clean up these rivers and let the water get through.  That is all we are asking.</P>
    <P>I asked, I think in one of the questions, if the Minister for Agriculture had received from the inspectors of his Department recommendations regarding the draining of the rivers connecting with Lough Gara from East Mayo and West Roscommon so as to enable the farmers to avail of the land rehabilitation scheme and, if so, what action he proposes to take in the matter?  I do not know whether they have made representations at all to the Department.  The Minister did not say so.  He did not reply to that part of the question, but from what I understand, they have made such representations, and I want the Parliamentary Secretary to understand that there is not one small farmer in East Mayo able to avail of the land rehabilitation scheme because there is no fall for the water and they cannot put in French drains as requested under the land rehabilitation scheme.  Are all these farmers to continue to go without <Col N="2201" /> facilities and help and aid which they would get under this rehabilitation scheme?  Are they to sit back and suffer the loss of being unable to avail of a scheme of that kind because the Government has failed to give the matter attention when all the obstacles have been removed?</P>
    <P>I could well understand, and appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's and the Department's and the Board of Works' attitude if the groundwork were not done, but the groundwork has been done, thanks to Deputy Dillon.  Whether we agree with his politics or not, we must give him credit for providing this sum of money.  I asked what was the motive behind the provision of this £60,000?  It has served no purpose so far.</P>
    <P>Unless the drainage of the River Lung and its tributaries is brought to its ultimate conclusion the spending of this £60,000 is just a waste of money. The farmers in East and West Mayo thought the machinery that was there would be kept there and utilised to the full.  They thought that some day they would read in the Press or hear over the radio that a sum of money was being voted for the completion of the scheme.  All they got, however, was a lot of claptrap about the crannógs and experts from the Museum going down to carry out research work.  Was it for the purpose of unearthing these crannógs and facilitating the experts in the Museum that the initial £60,000 was spent or was it for the purpose of having these rivers cleaned and opened so that water-logged lands would be drained.  There never was and never will be any necessity for compulsory tillage to be applied there.  There never was, or will be, any necessity for tillage inspectors visiting the farms there for the farmers there have always done their bit.  They would do more if the land was available.</P>
    <P>Thousands of acres of land are water-logged ever year.  These thousands of acres if properly drained could be utilised and cultivated by the farmers. I am sure my colleagues are just as much interested in this matter as I am and I want to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the necessity for ensuring that this scheme is proceeded with and concluded as quickly <Col N="2202" /> as possible.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to approach the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture to see if something can be done in the early Spring of next year.  Another £60,000 would go a long way towards completing the work.  I do not believe the Parliamentary Secretary would begrudge that £60,000. He knows what it is to be a small tenant farmer and how difficult it is to make a living out of the land.  He knows what every perch of ground means to the small tenant farmer.  I hope that in the early Spring the necessary moneys will be provided to enable this work to be completed.  If that is done I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary the people will appreciate it.</P>

      <P>The first thing I want to make clear is that I have had no conversation of any kind with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture or with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance arising out of the questions asked to-day by Deputy Cafferky.  I am very interested in the suggestions put forward by Deputy Cafferky and I confirm that I have been behind them, too. It is only recently that I have come to realise precisely what was done by Deputy Dillon when he made provision for a sum of £60,000 for the drainage of Lough Gara.  He caused to be published in the national newspapers at the time an advertisement to the effect that £40,000,000 would be spent on land rehabilitation.  He changed the name so as to disguise the fact that all he was doing was taking a scheme already initiated by Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">

      <P>Deputy Dillon, according to Deputy Cafferky, caused £60,000 to be devoted to the drainage of portion of Lough Gara under the land project.  I have only recently discovered that that was just another Coalition political ramp and that that boast of Deputy Dillon's that he would spend £40,000,000 was as idle as the event proved it to be.  He discovered in the end that he had to make some sort of stunt and <Col N="2203" /> he decided he would do this and a couple of other jobs and advertised this as a much vaunted land rehabilitation project.  I have not spoken to the Parliamentary Secretary, and perhaps he will contradict me later in this, but I am inclined to think now that much as I am interested in the eventual drainage of this part of East Mayo, Deputy Dillon knew very well that the drainage could not be continued for the simple reason that there is so much flooding, and I agree with Deputy Cafferky that if the waters were in fact released Lough Gara would not be able to hold them and there would be as much flooding further down as would be relieved on our side of the county.  That is the conclusion I have come to.  This was just another political stunt just as Deputy Donnellan when he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan should not ramble around like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;dumped everything down in Galway for his own political purpose.  That was another political stunt.  I do not want to hold up the House or prevent Deputy Finan from expressing his views and I do not think that anything I have said is irrelevant to this debate.  I am in the hands of the Parliamentary Secretary who will give the official considered view on the matter.  The only thing I want to say is that the work that is being done and continued by Fianna Fáil was initiated by them by means of the Arterial Drainage Act and the land reclamation scheme and the only reason this work was undertaken in 1949 by Deputy Dillon was in order that he might make some semblance of keeping his promise of spending £40,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, therefore, to be honest with the people of East Mayo, it would be better to tell them that it would not be feasible for the reasons I have stated to continue with this project for the time being.  I will be very disappointed to have to convey that news to them because these people are <Col N="2204" /> my own neighbours and there is nothing I would like to see better than these people being able to avail of every possible scheme to improve their lands and of being able to use all their lands with greater productivity for their own comfort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFinan" hpid="Mr. Finan Mr. Finan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Flanagan has made the approach he has made to this debate.  It is true that for years the people in that area have been anxious to have this work done.  It is also true that vested interests have stepped in every time for the purpose of preserving certain social amenities.  It is equally true that the work now being carried out is conferring no benefit on the farming community.</P>
      <P>I would not ask the Parliamentary Secretary to embark on a comprehensive scheme but some provision to remove obstacles in the river would not cost anything like £60,000.  We had a survey carried out of that particular portion of the river and the estimated cost was £21,000.  That included the tributaries.  But I would not even ask for that.  I would ask that a sum of money be provided to remove obstacles in the Lung River to allow the overflow of water into Lough Gara.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan mentioned one point that I want to contradict.  It was argued by those vested interests for years that if that rock was removed the country below it would be submerged. The Board of Works engineers have disproved that.  The rock has been removed and Lough Gara has been practically empty.  There is no danger whatever of flooding.  If a reasonable sum of money &mdash; as a layman, I would estimate a sum of £15,000 &mdash;were provided, either under the land project or by the Board of Works or somebody else, for the removal of the obstacles in the river, the people would be satisfied and valuable work would be carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only objection I can take to anything that has been said is to the suggestion underlying Deputy Cafferky's remarks that we lack sympathy with the people who are the victims of this flooding.  Nothing could be farther <Col N="2205" /> from the truth.  The statement I made to-day cannot be improved upon, that is, that this scheme has been adjudged, by the people best able to judge, a scheme that can only be carried out as part of the Boyle river catchment area arterial drainage scheme.  Neither is Deputy Caffertry nor am I permitted to challenge the opinion of these people.</P>
      <P>I do not want to detract from the credit Deputy Cafferky has given to Deputy Dillon but let me pursue that subject to illustrate my point.  I am prepared to concede to Deputy Cafferky that Deputy Dillon would also have done this.  In pursuance of the objective mentioned by Deputy Flanagan to spend this £40,000,000, he would also have gone ahead and done this and found another £60,000 or whatever was the amount required, seeing that he had this £40,000,000.  I want Deputy Cafferky to ask himself why was it not done.  If he asks himself that question and answers it frankly and honestly he will find that it is indefensible to put the land reclamation administration on the spot.</P>
      <P>I am sure that Deputy Cafferky, who is a member of the same Party as Deputy Donnellan, who was in charge of the Office of Public Works for three years, will be prepared to accept Deputy Donnellan's words before mine.  It is on the records of the Department of Agriculture that Deputy Donnellan, in his official capacity, intimated that the work which Deputy Cafferky is advocating in respect of the Rivers Lung and Breedogue was at that time &mdash; and it still is &mdash; work which must be carried out as part and parcel of the Boyle river catchment area arterial drainage programme.  I do not think any new factor has arisen since Deputy Donnellan left the Board of Works to change the technical reasons for that opinion.  Deputy Cafferky knows the locality.  I do not think he could indicate any change in the situation in respect of those rivers since Deputy Donnellan left office.</P>

      <P>There is this change that, since Deputy Donnellan left office, the cutting of the rock and the underpinning of the bridges has been completed.  I agree that it is part of the Boyle catchment area and that in a comprehensive scheme the Lung River and the Breedogue River would have to be part of that scheme.  We are asking for something temporary to ease the position.  If the Parliamentary Secretary realised the position and could see the conditions he would be a partner to the request.  I am sure his engineers will agree that there is no use in removing the rock or underpinning the bridges unless it is intended to bring about some other change, namely, the clearing of the Lung River.  It would be idiotic to do that unless they intended to follow it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mixing matters.  I am not challenging the strength of the case he is making to have this work done but that does not make a solution of it any easier.  Let me make a distinction between what has been done and what Deputy Cafferky now wants done.  Deputy Cafferky knows the work that has been done on Tinnecarra Rock, which was a cutting of the rock.  Deputy Cafferky does not require to be an engineer to know that no maintenance arises from an operation of that sort.  The main difference, I take it, between that scheme and the scheme now proposed is that this work on the Lung and Breedogue Rivers will require maintenance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DominickCafferky" hpid="Mr. Cafferky Mr. Cafferky">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>No, no, no.  That is the easy way out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the opinion supplied, again, by the people who are adjudged best able to give an opinion. The reclamation scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture does not provide for maintenance and, for that technical reason, the scheme does not come within the purview of the Department of Agriculture's land reclamation scheme.  If Deputy Cafferky will not accept my word.  I can assure him that Deputy Donnellan <Col N="2207" /> is on the files of the Department of Agriculture as indicating that the scheme is not one for land reclamation and that it is to be dealt with as part of the arterial drainage scheme for <Col N="2208" /> that area.  I do not think there is anything I can add to what I have said.</P>
