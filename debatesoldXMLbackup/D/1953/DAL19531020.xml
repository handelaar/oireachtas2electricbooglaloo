      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will protest against the interference in the domestic affairs of this country by the British Prime Minister when he sent greetings to the Six County Prime Minister on keeping Ulster strong and prosperous and free within the United Kingdom; and, further, if he will state whether a protest has been conveyed to the British Government against this action, or if on his recent visit to London he was informed by the British Prime Minister that he proposed to send such a message to the Northern Ireland Premier; and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>On the occasion to which the Deputy refers, Sir Winston Churchill appears to have been speaking as the leader of the Conservative Party in Britain, addressing an election message to the Conservative Party in the Six Counties.  I was not informed of his intention to send such a message, and I do not think that a protest would serve any useful purpose.</P>
      <P>The attitude of the Government and of all Parties in this House towards the unjust partition of our country, against the declared will of the vast majority of our people, is well known to the British Government.  We shall continue, as hitherto, to avail ourselves of every appropriate opportunity to bring the facts of Partition to the attention of people everywhere who are interested in democracy and in securing firm foundations for international peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state if the Draft Constitution of Saorstát Éireann, prepared by the Constitution Committee appointed by the Provisional Government of Saorstát Éireann in 1922, has been published; and, if not, if he will arrange to have the document in question now published, or, alternatively, to have it placed in the Oireachtas Library; further, if he will give the names of the members of the said Constitution Committee and its terms of reference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee mentioned by the Deputy was appointed by the Provisional Government in January, 1922, for the purpose of drafting the Constitution of the Irish Free State.  I cannot find that the committee was given any more formal terms of reference.  Its members were:&mdash;Michael Collins (Chairman), Darrel Figgis, James McNeill, Hugh Kennedy, John O'Byrne, Professor James A. Murnaghan, James G. Douglas; C.J. France, and Professor Alfred O'Rahilly.</P>
      <P>The committee submitted to the Provisional Government, on the 7th March, 1922, three separate draft Constitutions, each of them signed by different members of the committee. One of these drafts was selected by the Provisional Government, and a revised draft based upon it was prepared. This revised draft was discussed with the British Government, and an amended text, agreed to by both sides, was arrived at.  This agreed text was published by the Provisional Government on the 16th June, 1922.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of the three texts submitted to the Provisional Government nor the revised draft used in discussion with the British Government has ever been published.  Hitherto, these documents have been regarded as confidential State papers, and I am inclined to the view that they should continue to be so regarded for a further period.  They <Col N="5" /> are, however, of some historical interest, and, if there should be any general desire for their publication, I would be prepared to have the matter further considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware that the emigration of the young male population of Ireland is four times that of the female population and if, in view of the seriousness of the position regarding the marriage rate, he will state the Government's policy and programme to encourage the young men and women to stay at home and settle down in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the continuous emigration of Irish citizens to Canada and Great Britain and that twice weekly emigration officials attend with medical officers at the Iveagh hostel, Bride Street, Dublin, to examine and certify as fit for travel hundreds of young Irishmen from the farming areas who are being recruited by agents and brought to Dublin by bus and after certification brought to the boats; and, if so, if he will state whether the Government have yet found a remedy to stem the tide of emigration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh Ó Briain Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to answer Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any statistical or other evidence to support the Deputy's statement that the emigration of the young male population of Ireland is four times that of the female population.  In the inter-censal period 1946-51, the net number of females who emigrated was 1,365 for every 1,000 males.  If the Deputy's statement were true, a very radical change would have taken place in the sex composition of the net emigration&mdash;and there is no evidence that such a change has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that our crude marriage rate itself is low by international standards, there has been no recent disimprovement in the position: <Col N="6" /> the rate has stood at 5.4 per 1,000 persons from 1948 to 1952, and this represents an improvement as compared with the rate that obtained before the war.</P>
    <P>Emigration to Canada is not as heavy as the Deputy appears to suggest: the latest figures available indicate that it is running at a rate of about 1,500 a year.</P>
    <P>The travel arrangements referred to in the Deputy's second question apply only to migratory workers of a particular category, under an arrangement that has been in operation since 1947, and the number of persons travelling under the arrangement this year is the lowest for the past four years, the figures being:&mdash;1950, 1,300; 1951, 1,200; 1952, 1,006, and 1953, 920.</P>
    <P>As to the Government's policy in regard to emigration, I have more than once made it clear that our economic and social policy aims to create such conditions as would eliminate any material causes of emigration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach any definite policy in mind that will keep the young people at home? Emigration is due to unemployment and the Taoiseach must be aware that most of these people are emigrating because of the fact that neither the Government nor anybody else will provide suitable employment sufficient to keep them at home.  Will the Taoiseach state if he has anything in mind to stem this tide of emigration and give these people a chance of earning a living in their own country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated to the Deputy that the whole policy of this Government has as its object, and effect, the reduction of emigration and its possible elimination; proofs of that are the results achieved in the years before the war and the results immediately following the war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the pre-war purchasing power on the basis of the value of the £ sterling as at the 1st August, 1939, of the current rates of benefit under the Social Welfare Act at 50/- per week for a man, wife and two children, 36/-per <Col N="7" /> week for a man and wife and 24/-per week for a single person.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to state the values of the current rates of benefit in question in terms of August, 1939, prices, since cost-of-index numbers appropriate to the classes concerned are not available. From the official general index numbers it is estimated that £1 in mid-August, 1953, would have purchased the same quantity of goods and services as at 8/8 in mid-August, 1939.</P>

The other countries of origin of sugar imported in that period were Great Britain, the Six Counties, Belgium, Spain and the Dominican Republic.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if applications have been made to his Department for licences for the export of Irish native timber in the round; and, if so, whether in considering such application regard has been had to the serious consequences which would result from such export, if permitted, both in respect of native timber resources, and of employment in Irish sawmills, and in the Irish furniture manufacturing industry; and whether in view of these considerations, he will now definitely state that such timber exports will not be countenanced.</P>

      <P>In considering applications for licences to export native timber in the round, due regard is had to the considerations referred to by the Deputy.  Save in very exceptional circumstances, the export of round timber exceeding ten inches in diameter is not permitted, but smaller timber suitable for pit props is allowed to be freely exported.  I am satisfied that the present volume of such exports will not adversely affect home interests.  The position is, however, being kept under constant review.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the margins allowed to wholesale and retail traders were regarded as inadequate, in view of their increased costs, the price of butter to them was reduced by 8d. and 2/4 per cwt. respectively, thus increasing their margins by these amounts.</P>
      <P>By the utilisation of moneys available in the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Fund established under the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act, 1935, it was possible to effect the necessary adjustment in traders' margins without increasing the price of butter to the consumer, or imposing any charge on the Exchequer.</P>

Cassidy; (b) the total expenditure chargeable against the authority in each of the years since it was established was: 1949-50, £45,304; 1950-51, £56,746; 1951-52, £32,872; 1952-53, £11,666.  In the year 1949-50 the amount chargeable directly against the authority was limited to the remuneration and personal travelling and incidental expenses of the chairman and other members of the authority (£8,000).  The salaries and other expenses of administration (£37,304) were covered by provisions included in other sub-heads of the Estimate.  In subsequent years the total expenditure was charged directly against the authority; (c) some 40 projects of varying importance are being studied by the authority; (d) the nature of the present activities of the authority is such that the publication of an annual report of the nature suggested would not be practicable or advisable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question would appear to imply that the existing spread of the tax burden is unrelated to taxable capacity.</P>
      <P>Such, however, is not the case.  If the Deputy will refer to Tables 67 and 78 of the Twenty-ninth Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners he will find, for example, that for the year 1951-52 a married man with three children would not have had to pay income-tax if his earnings were £600 a year, while with £700 a year he would have been charged at an effective rate of only 3d. on each £ of his income and with £800 a year at an effective rate of 8½d.  If his income were £5,000 a year he would have borne, in income-tax and surtax, an effective rate of 7/2 on every £ of his income.</P>
      <P>The Thirtieth Annual Report of the Revenue Commissioners, which is in course of publication, will give the corresponding figures for 1952-53, which are the same as those for the current year.  A married man with three children now pays only 1d.&mdash;instead of 3d. as in 1951-52&mdash;for each £ of income if his earnings are £700 a year and 4½d. &mdash;instead of 8½d.&mdash;if they are £800. Where, however, the income is £5,000 the effective rate has risen from 7/2 in 1951-52 to 7/10 in 1952-53 and 1953-54.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate from these figures that the position is kept under constant review and that no formal inquiry directed to the purposes indicated in his question appears to be necessary.</P>

      <P>As indicated in reply to a previous question by the Deputy, it will be necessary, on completion of the field work of the survey, to plot the data collected and to design an arterial drainage scheme for the catchment.  Subsequently, the statutory requirements in regard to exhibition, etc., of the scheme must be complied with before it can be submitted for confirmation.  I am not in a position to say how long these steps may take, but there is no prospect of their being completed in time to permit of works being started next year.</P>

      <P>The Limerick-Shannon area is regarded as being of considerable strategic importance and during the 1939-45 emergency, troops had to be stationed there under most unsatisfactory conditions.  Premises were rented in 21 different places and timber huts had to be erected to supplement the accommodation thus provided.  The Department's property at Knockalisheen, County Clare, was acquired in order that troops could be quartered in the area at short notice in the future and the timber huts, which would otherwise have had to be stored in a dismantled condition, were withdrawn and re-erected on the property.  In addition, concrete huts were erected; water supply and sewerage disposal systems, electric lighting, roads and paths were provided; existing farm buildings were adapted; and the residence purchased with the property was reconstructed.  The cost of the work was £51,400.  The extent to which the camp will be used in the future will depend on military requirements.</P>

      <P>The question of the continuance in operation of the rule requiring women national teachers to retire on marriage is one of general policy involving considerations of a social and economic as well as of an educational nature.  It would not be appropriate to decide the issue on the ground that there was a temporary shortage of trained teachers.  The Department must leave itself free to frame new conditions of service in the case of persons who are only in course of preparation for the teaching profession, and I do not agree, therefore, <Col N="31" /> that any injustice was done in the case of those to whom the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take these two questions together.  Public telephone facilities are provided at Collinstown Airport by means of coin-box telephones rented by Aer Rianta. <Col N="36" /> There are no departmental public telephones in any buildings or offices of Aer Lingus Teoranta or of its associated companies.  The other particulars sought in regard to the actual number of telephone points and lines are matters between the Department and the subscribers concerned and it would be contrary to departmental policy to disclose such information.</P>

Is he aware that, on occasions when flights are cancelled, the place is teeming with hundreds of people driven frantic by not being able to communicate with their homes about the alteration in their travelling arrangements; and will he, therefore, install immediately a sufficient number of these boxes?</P>

      <P>While in Denmark recently I made some inquiries into this subject. The arrangements for credit existing there hinge largely on the co-operative structure of Danish farming organisation.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if it is correct that the export of fat cattle from the port of Dublin has fallen from 15,127 in the seven months January to July, 1951, to 6,145 in the same period of 1953, while for the same periods the export of fat cattle from the port of Belfast has increased from 18,333 to 31,472; further, that two cattle boats have been transferred from Dublin to Belfast; and whether, in view of the adverse effect such changes in the cattle traffic from this country have on employment and also on domestic prices for meat, he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards exports to Britain, the answer to the first two parts of the question is in the affirmative.  Exports of store cattle from the port of Dublin, however, increased from 72,434 in the first seven months of 1951 to 90,498 in the corresponding period of 1953, while exports of fat cattle from Dublin to the Continent increased from 9,684 to 10,645 in the same period.  Exports of carcase beef, a substantial proportion of which takes place from Dublin port, also increased from 67,996 cwts. in the first seven months of 1951 to 308,637 cwts. in the first seven months of 1953; and, similarly, exports of carcase mutton, lamb, pork and canned meat have <Col N="40" /> increased from 7,028 cwts. mutton and lamb, no pork, and 72,911 cwts. canned meat in the first seven months of 1951 to 25,964 cwts. mutton and lamb, 141,772 cwts. pork and 116,400 cwts. canned meat, respectively, in the first seven months of 1953.  As regards the last part of the question, it is clear, therefore, that employment has benefited considerably since 1951.  The export prices for live stock and meat are primarily governed by the trade arrangements with Britain, under which both increases and decreases have taken place since 1951, following the application of similar changes in the prices payable to British home producers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The future stability and prosperity of the agricultural industry, which is the basic industry of the country, is in my opinion bound up with the policy of the Minister and his colleagues in the Government to stabilise prices and to reduce where possible, and if possible, the cost of agricultural production.  The Minister has various ways and means of dealing with matters of this kind.  He has provided, through this Estimate, facilities for the establishment of a consultative council.  On that matter I should like to know from the Minister when he is replying how many meetings of this consultative council have been held since he came into office, what recommendations, if any, were made by this <Col N="44" /> consultative body to the Minister, or does the Minister personally meet this consultative council, as his predecessor I understand or some of his predecessors did from time to time, to deal with the problems confronting this big Department of State?</P>
      <P>Different groups of Deputies take different views in regard to matters affecting what we know as fundamental policy.  The Minister, I suppose, agrees that wherever it is desirable and possible, the cost of agricultural production should be stabilised and, if possible, reduced.  I ask the Minister what steps he has taken in that direction since he came into office.  So far as I can see from the effect of the policy of the present Minister, instead of reducing the excessive number of middlemen who are preying on the agricultural industry and sucking the lifeblood out of producers, his whole policy seems to be directed towards increasing, and not reducing, the number of middlemen.  I am very glad to observe that during the holiday period the Minister visited other countries with which we can make a favourable comparison, from the point of view of the agricultural industry particularly.  I hope the Minister has learned something about many of the matters that affect the prosperity of the agricultural industry during his recent tour on the Continent.  Perhaps he may devote some of the time he will occupy in replying to this debate to telling us whether he has learned anything in his recent tour on the Continent in regard to the ways and means by which he can help the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, perhaps, would not have taken part in this debate so soon were it not for the fact that I realise from personal experience the condition of the small farming class at present, as a result of the rather disastrous decision which the Minister has recently taken, and to which, apparently, according to the reply he has given to-day, he is going to adhere, to wipe out the organisation known as Eggsports Ltd.  I think that is the most disastrous decision taken by a Minister for Agriculture for a long time.  Does the Minister not admit that, by the abolition of Eggsports, which is a marketing board, he is <Col N="45" /> going to increase considerably the number of middlemen and merchants who will prey in future on the poultry producers and the egg producers, who are mainly found amongst the small farming classes in this country?  Having been associated with the transport industry for a lengthy period, I have had personal experience over a number of years of the value of this organisation to poultry and egg producers. Does the Minister not realise that by bringing in merchants and middlemen to operate in future, where one exporting body operated previously, the profits of poultry and egg producers will be reduced?  One does not require to be an economist to see that point.</P>
    <P>I hope that Deputy Cogan, who supports the Government on many vital issues, will say what he thinks about this proposal so far as it is likely to affect the constituency which he represents, a constituency which is bound to be seriously affected in the same way as my own constituency by this drastic and disastrous proposal. Does the Minister not know that from the time this organisation was set up &mdash;and very efficiently managed, in my opinion&mdash;that the value of our exports of poultry and eggs has been considerably increased as a result of the efficiency displayed by this marketing organisation?  I remember a time when I was working in the port of Dublin when one would be ashamed of the way in which poultry and eggs were being transhipped to the neighbouring country.  These bad conditions have almost entirely disappeared due to the efficiency of this marketing organisation in dealing with exports.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will give due praise to the people who constituted the board and the staff of Eggsports for the valuable work they did for the poultry and egg producers of this country during their long period in office.  I want to know what is the real reason for this disastrous and drastic decision of the Minister?  Is it to save money for the State?  It is to save <Col N="46" /> subsidies in future?  Has this decision been forced on the Minister and the Government as a result of the change of policy in Great Britain, due to the existence in Britain of a Tory Government that pretends to believe in private enterprise or to place its whole faith in what it calls private enterprise?  It is well known in Great Britain, and it should be known to those who study conditions in Great Britain, that Lord Woolton, who was one of the super-Ministers in Mr. Churchill's Government when the Tory Government came into office, got full authority and took full responsibility for wiping out as quickly as he could, on behalf of the merchants and the middlemen, the marketing organisations and the purchasing organisations that existed there and that were set up during the lifetime of the Labour Government.  Has this decision of our Minister any bearing on the policy pursued by Lord Woolton and the Churchill Government in Britain or was this drastic decision taken for the purpose of saving £100,000 or £50,000? It is not going to be a saving to the poultry and egg producers and, if by any chance, it may effect a saving for the State by way of the abolition of subsidies or by way of the withdrawal of whatever other assistance the Department of Agriculture has been giving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will he deny that this step is going to increase the number of middlemen and merchants who will operate in future?  Does he or anybody suggest that these merchants and middlemen, who in future will carry on the marketing of poultry and eggs, will do that job for the love of God or the love of the country? Not at all.  They are going to have their 33? per cent. or the 50 per cent. profit which will come out of the price paid to the poultry and egg producers. I do not want to labour this matter unnecessarily, but I regard this as one <Col N="47" /> of the most serious and dangerous proposals made by the Minister since he came into office.</P>
      <P>I read very carefully the interview which the Minister gave to the <i>Sunday Press</i> last Sunday.  Whatever credit the Minister is entitled to, so far as the operation of a sound agricultural policy is concerned, I am not going to deny it to him.  The Minister, of course, will tell us that his policy is intended to stabilise the cost of agricultural produce and to reduce the cost of the raw materials for agriculture wherever and whenever possible.</P>

      <P>I also want to know from the Minister if he believes in reducing the cost of agricultural production.  If his policy is intended to help to increase agricultural production, how does he relate that to the decision of his Department and the Government a year or two years ago to increase the interest on agricultural loans?  Was that done at that time for the purpose of meeting the viewpoint of the British Tory Government shortly after they came into power and shortly after our Minister for Finance had an interview with Mr. Butler, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer?  If there was a good reason, and there may have been a good reason at the time, why interest rates on loans should be increased in Great Britain for the purpose, in some cases presumably, of transferring labour from one industrial activity to another, why should we have copied that example, because in Great Britain they wanted to do it for their own special reasons, while we in Ireland are piling up another 1 per cent. on the cost of agricultural production?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not a fact that the Agricultural Credit Corporation was set up for non-profit-making purposes?  Surely the increase of 1 per cent. on agricultural loans a year or two years ago was not put on for the sole purpose of increasing the profits of a State-established body which was created for <Col N="48" /> non-profit-making purposes?  Will the Minister relate that to the realities of the situation?</P>

      <P>I am challenging certain actions taken by the Minister.  Possibly I may be wrong and the Minister may be right.  If the Minister believes himself to be infallible, he must be right. I am challenging this because I am as anxious as any Deputy to help the Minister in any way I can and to encourage him in any way I can to increase agricultural production and to give the wealth producer in this country a profitable return for his labour and for the use of his land. Does the Minister admit that, as a matter of fundamental policy, the first charge on agricultural production in any decent democratic country must be a fair return for the labour given by the wealth producer, or is it the Minister's view that the first charge on agricultural production should be 5 per cent., or 6 per cent. in some cases, to the moneylender?  Does the moneylender come before the man who produces the wealth?  I want the Minister to answer that and I hope he will not be frightened by it.</P>

      <P>I hope I will not frighten the Minister by making this suggestion, that if you are to help agricultural production fertilisers should be provided, and could be provided if they were purchased and distributed in the proper way, at a much lower cost than they are being provided to-day.  Is it <Col N="49" /> not possible to purchase fertilisers through an organisation such as the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, an organisation which has rendered valuable assistance to the agricultural industry, and distributed through their agencies in the country, thereby cutting out the huge profits presently enjoyed by the middlemen? In that way we could reduce the number of middlemen and, so far as I know, there is no country in the world which has such a large number of middlemen per head of the population as we have in this 26-county Republic. Nobody knows that better than Deputy Dillon, because I believe that at one time in Ballaghaderreen there was a public-house for every 13 persons in that small town.  I admit that that may not be a direct charge on the cost of production in the agricultural industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to say whether he has given any consideration to the suggestion which I am making, that the raw materials for agricultural production, such as fertilisers, etc., should be purchased in bulk by the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society or any other organisation associated either directly or indirectly with his Department.  My colleague, Deputy Hickey here, tells me that the sugar company are rendering very useful and valuable services in that direction.  However, between the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society and the Beet Growers' Association, I think a good deal of the unnecessary profit of middlemen in the purchase and distribution of the raw materials of agriculture could be cut out and the cost of production in that way could be reduced or the profits of the producer increased.  I hope that my suggestions are not frightening the Minister.  I am making them because I understand he has just arrived back from a country where the value of co-operation and co-operative societies must have made itself very evident to him when having a look around that country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are often told here that we <Col N="50" /> should try to copy other small European countries.  There is no comparison between the conditions prevailing in agricultural Ireland to-day and the conditions in the countries with which we are supposed to compare ourselves.  These continental countries with a big agricultural economy are highly organised on co-operative lines for the purpose of production and distribution.  In some of these countries the State railways give a subsidy for the carriage of raw materials for the agricultural industry. Some of these countries have their own shipping services available for the purpose of landing their surplus produce in Great Britain and other countries. There are, however, many ways in which we might copy some of these highly organised agricultural countries. We might copy them in regard to the provision of credit for agriculture at a much cheaper rate than it is being provided here.  I would be a very attentive listener to the Minister when he replies if he would try and convey to those of us on every side of the House what he has learned during his recent visit to one of these continental countries.</P>
    <P>One of the things which strikes me very forcibly in looking through the Estimate is the very small percentage of the very big total allocated for the administration of the Department of Agriculture as compared to the amount set aside for education.  I do not object to the sum so long as it is spent in the right way.  I have no objection to the man who occupies the Ministry.  He works hard according to his own conscience and outlook.  That is all I can say about him.  There may be many things upon which I agree with the Minister but there are many more upon which I agree to differ with him but it is for the Minister to convert me if I am unable to convert him.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious problems confronting this country at the moment &mdash;and everybody agrees upon it&mdash;is the desire of the rural population to get away from the rural areas and come into the cities and towns.  Dublin is a glaring example of that kind of national tragedy for the past 20 or 25 <Col N="51" /> years.  We have more people living in and around the City of Dublin and most of them came from the rural areas inside the last 25 years.  I am afraid that our system of education has some responsibility for that.  Therefore, I want to see more and not less money included in the Department's Estimate for the purpose of improving agricultural education wherever and whenever that can be done.  I will be one of the strongest supporters that the Minister can find in this House in backing him on that if he has any difficulty with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, in getting the necessary money from him.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the figure set aside here for agricultural scholarships &mdash;a small figure under the sub-head&mdash; represents the total sum.  I do not think it does because a considerable amount of assistance is given in that direction by our county committees of agriculture.  The detailed figure does not appear for that purpose in this Estimate.  Is not that so?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another point&mdash; it is a policy issue&mdash;upon which I differ seriously from the Minister.  I refer to the policy decision taken inside the last year changing the whole method of carrying out the land rehabilitation scheme.  I notice that there is a huge sum of £1,200,000 in this Estimate for contractors.  Again, I think that is increasing the number of middlemen who are going to prey on the poor farmers.  The sum provided for the carrying out of the land rehabilitation scheme by direct labour is reduced from £250,000 to £70,000.  That looks bad, from my point of view at any rate. I want to know from the Minister for Agriculture whether he hopes, as he sees things to-day, that the big sum of £1,200,000 will be paid out for work done to these contractors before the end of the financial year?  It is a huge sum to put into an Estimate as there is no administrative machine for the purpose of spending the money.  I would not have such a grumble if I thought the money was going to be <Col N="52" /> spent before the end of the financial year although I know the contractors can do the work in the future and get a decent profit out of it.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why the Minister took that decision.  He never explained his reason to this House.  I hope he will do so when he is replying to the discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister suggest that the carrying out of the land rehabilitation scheme by direct labour was a failure and that he succeeded in doing what he desires to do under this scheme by bringing in all these contractors and giving them a fairly hefty profit?  Is that his case?</P>

      <P>The lucky contractors who will get the work under the subhead provided in this Estimate are surely not going to do the work without being sure of a fairly decent profit beforehand.  Any of the work carried out under the direct labour system was work well done.  I can only speak with limited experience.  The Minister, no doubt, has a country-wide experience and statistics at his fingertips to justify the serious policy decision which he took in changing the whole method of carrying out this desirable land rehabilitation scheme.  Would he enlighten the House a little bit more when replying to this discussion?  I did not intend to jump into the discussion so soon, but I hope I have not wasted the time I took up in discussing this matter and I hope that some of the suggestions I made will receive the Minister's favourable consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to keep the Minister very long, but I do want to mention just a few points.  In his concluding remarks, Deputy Davin referred to the land project.  I should like the Minister, when replying, to give some explanation for the inordinate delay that arose in regard to the land project during the past year. Early in the year the Minister made <Col N="53" /> and announced a decision that he was going to sell the machinery.  As far as my memory goes, the first sale took place only in July.  In the interval there was such a state of uncertainty in regard to the project that it is common knowledge that in consequence there was very much less work done than would have been done in normal circumstances.</P>
      <P>It is common knowledge that the effect of the decision by the Minister to sell, plus the delay in his carrying out that decision and the delay in regard to any proper announcement or directive of Government policy, had a most deleterious effect on the work of the project during the past nine months.  I remember that when the Minister was asked about the delay from time to time we were told it was because the machinery was being catalogued or because of the delay in carrying out the decision to sell.</P>

      <P>There was an appalling delay in work.  Anybody who had anything to do with it as a public representative knows very well that in the administrative section of the land rehabilitation project, as a result of the Minister's delay in laying down any policy, there was literally nothing done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question <Col N="54" /> whatever about it that the Minister completely failed his Department in delaying for months and months to lay down any policy in regard to the land project except the sudden announcement he made, without consultation with anybody, that he was going to sell the machinery.  Let us be quite fair about it.  The blame for that is not only that of the Minister personally but of every member of the Government, because I assume it was ultimately a Government decision.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that, for month after month in the early part of this year, contractors and others were endeavouring to get from the Minister and from his Department the line that was going to be followed &mdash;the Government policy that was going to be laid down&mdash;and they were always told &ldquo;we cannot say because the policy has not yet been laid down.&rdquo; The policy was not laid down until the summer was lost.  The evidence of that, apart from other evidence that is known to some of us, is available to the public in this way that it took the Minister from, I think, January&mdash;the Minister himself will remember the exact date that he announced the sale of the machinery: I think it was January&mdash;until July for a simple catalogue to be made of the items of machinery that were available.  If it took the Minister six months to make a list of the machinery available, is it any wonder that the whole project was held up while people were waiting for him to give a decision?  Is it any wonder that that should have held up progress?  Progress was held up until the line of Government policy was laid down.  Of course, every Government has a perfect right to lay down policy, but I suggest it should have been done with some reasonable degree of celerity instead of leaving it in the pocket of bureaucracy or whatever one cares to call it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result, at any rate, was that the good time of this year for doing the work was lost.  I have a suspicion that it was due to this that the scheme was known throughout the length and breadth of the country as the &ldquo;Dillon scheme.&rdquo;  The Minister knows that the scheme is known as such, and for that <Col N="55" /> reason he did not want to turn it down. That would be a too unpopular thing to do.  He thought that the easiest way would be to go a little bit and say that the Government were going to make new decisions, and that until the new decisions came along nothing could be done.  The result was that contractors, and others, were trying to find out what was going to be the Government's policy.  They were unable, however, to get any firm answer to that during the early part of this year when this job should have been pushed ahead.  That was the time when the work should have been done.</P>
    <P>I do not know, even yet, whether the machinery has all been sold or not. Just before the House rose in the summer, we were told that certain machinery had been sold.  I do not know what conditions were attached to the sale of it, whether there was a condition attached that it could only be used for the land project, and whether there was a condition attached that it must not be exported.  Neither do I know how the sales prices obtained compared with the purchase price.  That machinery had been secured under very great difficulties and at great expense, and in my opinion it was nothing short of scandalous that the Minister should have made such a momentous decision by deciding that he was going through the sale of this machinery to cancel a large part of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister's delay had the further very serious effect that the skilled staffs, the units of skilled men who had been got together with such difficulty, did not know where they stood. Many of these skilled people had come back to Ireland when the machinery was originally purchased.  Many of them had had experience of bull-dozers in England and elsewhere, but mostly in England in clearing war-damaged sites.  Many of them, as I say, had come back.  The Minister made his announcement that he was going to sell the machinery, but he delayed for such a long time before doing anything, that many of these men felt their position very uncertain. Some of them, to my personal knowledge, <Col N="56" /> packed up and went away again. These skilled units cannot be brought together in five months.  It is a matter of considerable difficulty to get and train the personnel required for the operation of this machinery.  The fact that they were dispersed was due solely to the Minister's inefficiency in the handling of this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, definitely.  I know it is true because I have seen it. But, quite apart from that, as regards the sections of the scheme where the work is done by farmers themselves, and for which they get a grant from the Government, the experience of many of them, in regard to the payment of the grants, has definitely acted as a brake in their areas.  I am referring now to delays in the payment of grants under the land project and also in connection with the farm improvements scheme, but to a lesser extent in the latter case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the payment of the grants under the land project, you had in the first six months of this financial year&mdash; that is to say, from April to September &mdash;delays which were scandalous.  Cases that came to my notice have now been cleared up, cases where I knew the farmers had their work completed and passed in March of this year.  Yet they had not received payment of their moneys when they came to me in the beginning of September.  There can be no excuse whatever for that.  The work had been passed by the outdoor staff of the Department and, therefore, there should not have been this delay in making the payments.  I know that the position probably was that it was not in the Minister's Department the hold-up occurred.  It probably arose in the Department of Finance.  What I am suggesting is that the Minister <Col N="57" /> should not stand for that type of obstruction from the Department of Finance.  The position was that substantial sums of money were due to many of those farmers.  That was talked about and became a subject of common gossip in the areas in which those farmers resided.  The delays that occurred in the Department concerning the making of these payments became a byword.  I hope that the Minister will now give us an assurance that during the remainder of this year there will not be similar delays.  I suggest that it should not be necessary for a farmer who had done the work&mdash;and work passed by the outdoor staff of the Department&mdash;to have to go to a public representative with a view to getting payment of the grant to him expedited.  The payments should have been made to farmers within a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>One other effect of the sale by the Department of this machinery is that the Minister has deprived himself of the use of a lever against a contractor or group of contractors from any area who do not tender for work at a reasonable figure.  It is common knowledge that these people are going to work in groups, and that they are going, so to speak, to swop information about the tenders that they may put in for work, or something of that kind.  If one contractor decides that he is going to tender at a certain figure, the others are not going to undercut him.  If the amount tendered is excessive, the Minister has now no lever to deal with that situation.  Heretofore, he could always take the line of saying to such contractors: &ldquo;The figure that you offer in this case is an excessive figure; I am not going to accept it, and I am going to put in my own machinery to do the work.&rdquo;  Now the only remedy he has is to say that the figure is excessive, and that he is not going to do the work.  The farmers, therefore, are going to be the sufferers because of the Minister's action.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the position that has arisen in connection with the collection and storage of grain, particularly in the southern end of my <Col N="58" /> constituency.  The Minister knows that South Kildare is a substantial grain-growing area, and always has been. It is an area in which, like many other parts of the country, the combine harvester has come to stay.  I feel that more and more of them will come in there.  It was lamentable to see during the difficult weather conditions the manner in which farmers were unable to get rid of their grain because of the lack of drying and storage facilities.  I agree at once that any question like storage facilities is not one that could be remedied overnight. When Deputy Dillon became Minister for Agriculture he found that the storage facilities in this country were entirely inadequate and he formulated proposals by virtue of which that storage would be increased.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the Minister will ever be able, by expansion of central storage, to solve the problem.  By expansion of central storage he may be able to make the position infinitely better but it will never really be solved except by some method of storage on the farmer's own premises, or, at least, on the larger farmer's own premises.  You cannot turn back the hands of the clock; you cannot reverse the wheels of progress; and the combine harvester on large farms, perhaps even by hiring on small farms, is going to be the method of the future. It is inevitably going to bring with it a much more difficult problem in the handling and storage of grain, particularly in a year that threatens to be any way wet.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why it is not possible to encourage drying by the farmers themselves to a degree much greater than exists at present.  As I understand it, there are a very limited number of wheat buyers&mdash;I think that is the technical term; I do not mean agents&mdash;who get 11/6 for drying.  Surely it would be possible to widen that sphere.  It should be possible to ensure that in regard to wheat prices there would be a price inducement to the man who installed his own electric dryer to cope with his own crop.  If he got the additional benefit that otherwise went to the buyer, it would at least have the effect of withholding <Col N="59" /> that amount of grain from the buyer and from the limited facilities that are available.  To try to deal with the entire problem of drying grain in any year that tends to be wet by means of central drying plant will never cope with the situation.  Unless deliveries are staggered substantially by passing on some of the buyer's margin to the farmers, I do not think the Minister will ever get a the root of the problem.</P>
    <P>We had, too, in Kildare this year considerable difficulty in regard to barley.  There is a perennial problem in regard to the manner in which a certain firm or firms&mdash;I know of one firm&mdash;are quite clearly refusing barley for malting even though satisfactory and going in and buying at feeding prices malt barley for malting later. Needless to say, that did not arise with Messrs.  Guinness.  It is only fair, when I say this, to make it clear that I am not referring to them nor am I referring to Messrs.  Power, in respect of whom I have no complaints whatever. It is felt that throughout South Kildare, which is a barley county, a great deal of barley nominally for feeding has been bought at feeding prices and is being turned in for malting.  The only way of dealing with that situation ultimately is to have for all malting barley grown a contract system such as Messrs.  Guinness have.</P>
    <P>There has been some uneasiness amongst farmers about grading at the various buyers' premises both in regard to wheat and barley.  It should be possible to arrange some system by virtue of which there was somebody nominated&mdash;preferably by a farmers' union if there was such a union, but if not by the Department&mdash;for the purpose of ensuring that the farmers would get a fair deal particularly in the assessment of moisture content.  While it is possible to strike a measure for bushelling, I do not think any farmer is in a position to gauge the moisture content of his crop.  There has certainly been very considerable dissatisfaction in parts of North Kildare as regards moisture content.  An agent there who also happens to have another premises in Meath and who is <Col N="60" /> agent for different buyers is not allowed by the Department to switch deliveries from one buyer to the other.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that is so but the story I am told is that in respect of his Meath contracts there was no deduction over a certain period for moisture content and that in respect of his Kildare deliveries there was a very substantial deduction for moisture content.  I do not think it is likely that there was all that difference between the deliveries in the one place and the other; in fact if anything I would imagine that since the climate must have been more or less the same the heavier Meath land should produce a heavier moisture content than Kildare. In Meath, however, there was no deduction and in Kildare there was a very substantial deduction.  I understand that the matter has been taken up and that the Minister's Department are making some rectification in regard to it.  Nevertheless we would like a little clarification as to exactly what the position was, how far agents, as distinct from buyers, are at liberty to switch their deliveries from one mill to the other and whether the Department enter into that at all or whether it is entirely a private transaction between agents.  It may be so and if it is I would like the Minister to confirm it.</P>
    <P>Recently we had an event which takes place in regard to all political Parties.  This time it was the Ard-Fheis of the Fianna Fáil Party which was held in the Mansion House last week.  I have here the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 14th October, that newspaper to which Deputy Dillon always so adequately and so directly refers as <i>Pravda.</i>  I note from it that certain statements were made, particularly by the Taoiseach, and I was rather amused when I read that the Taoiseach took great credit for the Fianna Fáil policy in regard to the proposal for the regional elimination of tubercular cattle.  We all know that the first step taken in that regard was the step taken by Deputy Dillon when he was Minister for Agriculture with regard to Bansha.</P>

      <P>I was amused also to see that the Taoiseach claimed that it was Fianna Fáil started the arrangements for the cold storage of poultry and rabbits.

Perhaps I am wrong.</P>

There were no storage facilities and, as a result, during 1944 when there was a very serious European and international situation, Deputy Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce, because there was inadequate storage, had to refuse a shipload of wheat offered to this country by the British Government.</P>

      <P>There was a farm buildings scheme in existence before 1948 but it was one of those wonderful schemes for which the Fianna Fáil Party is so notorious.  They produce something on paper and puff themselves out with great pride when they announce it.  In the case of that particular scheme, they went even further.  They put the scheme up.... Now, would the Minister keep quiet for once.  They even put a sum in the Estimates and, of course, then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister still keep quiet until I have finished? Then they pranced around the country and I have a vague recollection of hearing one day down at a fair when I was in Kilkenny in 1948, Deputy Walsh&mdash;or rather, he was only a candidate then&mdash;talking about the scheme. When we came along and looked into it and got the figures, we found it was a grand scheme on paper and a sum was included in the Estimates; but no arrangements had been made for spending any of the money and no grants whatever were given under the scheme in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

There was no method of carrying the scheme out, none whatever. Not a penny piece was spent and there was even no provision made in the Department for staff to sort out the applications.  Deputy Dillon had to come in and get the sacks open because they were there unopened, and to get the scheme put into proper operation so that it worked.</P>

      <P>If I might leave that for a second and come back to it later &mdash;one of the difficulties there is bound to be in Irish agricultural production is the capital difficulty.  The history of our agriculture, as people can remember too vividly, is such that it is bound to take some time to inspire confidence <Col N="69" /> in them for sinking more capital in their land.  There are too many farmers who can remember the crack they got with the collapse of prices after the first world war and then the break in agricultural prices in 1929 starting in America, without going into the political side of the economic war and the collapse there was in farm prices at that time.  Even if things got better it is obviously going to take farmers a considerable time to have confidence that when they have made some little profit they are not going to need it for a similar catastrophe which may happen in the future, and that they can afford to sink it firmly in the land. That is inevitably an historical fact and it is only now, since the last war, that the farmers are beginning to be able to get on their feet in the first place and beginning to feel that they can afford to expand with more capital.</P>
      <P>It will undoubtedly be by far the best investment they can make and it would be a tremendous national improvement if the people engaged in agriculture in Ireland could switch from the habit they had in the past of leaving an arid&mdash;sometimes small and sometimes not so small&mdash;deposit in the bank and utilising that deposit in the bank of their own land which is by far the best and would do more than anything else to expand agricultural production.  I think that at least is a subject on which the Minister and I could agree.  There is an historical reason behind it and it is an historical reason which will fade gradually as things go on, and as the reason does fade people will turn to investing in the land and will realise as they do so that their output and profit will be greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in this statement that he issued to the <i>Sunday Press</i> on the 18th October, is, so far as I can interpret the statement, taking to himself the credit for the increase in cattle profits; from the way in which the statement is set out and from the manner in which it is phrased, it would certainly appear that the Minister is taking the credit.  We all know that, in fact, the rise in cattle prices here over the last three years is due solely <Col N="70" /> to the provision made in the 1948 Agreement and continued in the 1952 Agreement providing that our prices here would be linked to the prices the British farmer got for his cattle.  That is the reason for the increase in the price and the Minister cannot claim the credit for inserting that provision for the first time in an agreement.  He is entitled to the credit, and I was glad to see that he did so, for retaining that clause in the current year's agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The first essential was to get the link.  That was the most important thing.  So far as I can make out, the Minister's claim on the differential amounts to about 6d. per cwt.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when the Argentine was in a very different way of business with the British from the position that obtained in 1948 and when, for that reason, it should have been considerably easier for the Minister to bring about an even greater improvement, if all the things the Minister said when he was on this side of the House were true.  Of course, we all know they were merely propaganda, and I do not think even the Minister, when he was making those statements, really believed them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to deal with agriculture from the point of view of the farmer.  I propose to deal with it from the point of view of the citizen and the consumer.  Agriculture and its development affects the people in the cities and towns just as much as it affects everybody else.  The Minister was asked a question about the credit facilities obtaining in the countries he visited during the Recess and he said <Col N="71" /> that conditions there did not suit this country at all.  I read an article in the daily Press where the Minister was asked what credit facilities were available for the farmer here; were they satisfactory?  The Minister said that was a matter for the Minister for Finance but that credit facilities were quite all right as far as the farmers were concerned.</P>
      <P>I put down a question to-day asking the Minister for Finance to state the number of applications for loans to the Agricultural Credit Corporation; the total amount of loans issued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation to farmers in the year ending 30th April, 1953; and the rate of interest charged thereon.  The reply I got was that the total number of applications was 1,704, of which 837 were approved and 602 issued.  The total amount of loans issued was £244,250 and the rate of interest charged was 6 per cent.  That means that we issued £9,394 per county.  We all know that agriculture has been neglected in the past.  We all know that it has been ignored.  It is still being ignored.  What happened to the other 867 applicants for loans? Why were they refused?  Is it because they were not credit-worthy?  Of course it is.  Now only 602 loans were issued. What happened to the balance?</P>
      <P>I suggest to both sides of this House that the sooner we forget about the personality of the late Minister for Agriculture and deal with agriculture as it should be dealt with, the better it will be for the country and everybody in it.  The part the Minister can play is a very important one.  It is time that he and other important interests took the farming community into their confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard Deputy Dillon arguing with the Minister about the price of fertilisers. He asked why the farmers were being charged an extra £4 10/-for fertilisers he purchased for £9 10/-, and the Minister's reply was that because of certain charges, including bank charges, the farmer had to be charged an extra £4 per ton.  Where do bank charges come into the picture in relation to fertilisers?  I put down <Col N="72" /> a question and I discovered that in 1952-53 we paid the banks £30,800 in interest alone for importing fertilisers for the farmers.  I asked the Minister what sum of money was advanced to the Sugar Company.  Let no one think that I have any criticism to offer of the Sugar Company.  I believe that body is doing an excellent job.  I am not objecting to any money they are getting and I wish them every success. But the Minister told me that the Sugar Company were his agents for importing fertilisers, etc., for the farmers. I asked what amount of money is paid in interest per year to the banks for advances to the Sugar Company and I was told it was not possible to give that information.</P>
    <P>The Sugar Company is one of the most important bodies we have got from an industrial point of view.  I was refused that information.  I was told by the Parliamentary Secretary that if I asked the Sugar Company I would probably get the information.  I asked the Sugar Company and I got a three-line reply stating that the information sought was not usually given by the Sugar Company.  During the Recess the Sugar Company had their annual meeting and the chairman stated that their profits were down somewhat due to increased borrowings amounting to £4,200,000 for the year. I suggest that money was largely borrowed to help the farmers to procure seeds and fertilisers, to grow beet and other crops.  I would have no objection if the Sugar Company got £5,000,000 credit but I would like to know what sum of money was paid by way of interest for that £4,200,000. The sooner we thrash these matters out fully the sooner we will get somewhere along the road towards increasing production.</P>
    <P>If I read the Minister aright, production has increased by only 5 per cent.  Is it not time to ask ourselves why we cannot bring about a better increase than that?  I want to see an increase in the volume of production rather than in the income from production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the dairying industry I must find fault with the Minister or the Government.  I am not satisfied that there is room for two organisations for the management of creameries.  I refer to the co-operative movement and to the Dairy Disposals Board.  I am at a loss to know the reason for having the Dairy Disposals Board if the farmers are able to run co-operative creameries satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Why will they not come in and buy them?  They are for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I am not wrong in saying this&mdash;I am not saying it for personal motives&mdash;that the Minister, as the person responsible to the people, should declare that there is <Col N="74" /> room for only one movement dealing with creameries and he should leave it to the co-operative creameries and the farmers who are doing the job.</P>
      <P>Recently I asked the Minister what bank overdraft the Dairy Disposals Board had and the amount of interest they paid on the overdraft.  Did the Minister supply me with the answer? I am not suggesting that he should give me the information but the members of the House should get that information. From the balance sheet of the consolidated creameries I find that they have a bank overdraft of £1,250,000.  Included with other things is a sum of, I think, £64,000 for goodwill. I am anxious to hear from the Minister the amount paid for goodwill. This company has been in operation since 1928.  Is it necessary that the people should be taxed to pay for goodwill for an institution that has been in operation since 1928?  Why is the House not being fully informed? I am anxious to let the people know, through the House, the amount you are paying the banks in respect of an overdraft of £1,250,000.  I suggest that we are not dealing with agriculture in the manner in which it should be dealt with.  The city people are as concerned as anybody else that the farmer should be properly compensated for his work.  I suggest to farmers on both sides of the House that their only salvation is to give the co-operative movement all possible support.  The farmers are being exploited by the moneylenders and by the middlemen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the details of this Estimate, it is perfectly apparent from the figures that are available that the trends in agriculture are exceedingly favourable at the moment.  The present Minister found himself in the fortunate position when bringing in his Estimate as far back as 16th June last to be able to make a report on the condition of agriculture that anybody in his position or who had previously been in his position would to some extent envy.  Subsequent information goes to show that the optimism at that time was justified and that there are further grounds for optimism for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can get into a number of <Col N="75" /> detailed arguments on such things as whether one is dealing with quantity or value, but if one looks at the figures for years past, taking, say, 1939 as a basis, the situation is reasonably hopeful.  Of course, the increase in the volume of gross agricultural output as money must, to some extent, be equated to the change in money values.  Nevertheless, taking the real side of the picture&mdash;the increase in actual production&mdash;one will find that it is a fair reflection.  In particular, taking the live-stock figures, the trends are favourable at the moment.  The Minister has already drawn attention to the very rapid increase in pig and sheep numbers.  The significant thing is that cattle numbers are going in the right direction.  Taking quantities for some years back, there was ground for a certain feeling, not exactly of alarm, but of caution, a few years ago&mdash;in 1948 and 1949.  According to the figures here there has been a recovery and the recovery has continued.  It is fair to say, therefore, that the prospects in regard to numbers are satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In regard to tillage, again there is a favourable trend.  The acreage under tillage, and particularly the acreage under wheat and beet, is up.  In matters that are associated with the industry, such as the milk taken to creameries and butter production, the trends are favourable.  Altogether, one is justified in saying that the outlook for agriculture is hopeful.</P>
    <P>That brings one to the point. Obviously, now is the time when an all-out intensive effort should be made to develop our agricultural potential. It has been estimated here that in agriculture we are likely to find the most room for stepping up production, stepping it up profitably to the community. Therefore, with the trends as they are, it seems very desirable at the moment that an all-out effort should be made by the community to increase agricultural production in actual quantity and then to take the consequential benefits of money changes.</P>
    <P>The details of that operation I will leave to the farmers but there is one thing that I, as a townsman, would like to say: This industry is fundamental <Col N="76" /> for our whole economy and our whole national living.  There have been certain signs during last session, and in some of the approaches of short-sighted people to national problems there had been signs, of setting up an antagonism between the interests of the cities and towns and the interests of the agricultural community.  I have heard people who thought they might not be reported stressing these points in, say, the Dublin by-election.  Such an approach is very damaging indeed and all of us, whether we are in the town or the country, should realise the inestimable value, in fact, the fundamental value, of this industry to the nation, that its problems are problems for us all to consider and that the solution of these problems is something to which we should all contribute.  That point is very important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Deputy one question?  He pointed out that there is a relative improvement in output but there is one point on which he did not touch and in which I am very much interested, that is, the serious decline over a number of years in the number of dairy cows.  There are about three counties in which the business is exclusively dairying and there is a serious decline which has given me very much concern from time to time.  I dealt with that matter whenever I contributed to the debates in the House.  I would ask the Deputy to deal with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, being from the country himself, probably has an expert knowledge of these matters and I cannot claim to have that knowledge.  I am aware, however, that there is a problem, and there has been a problem, in regard to the type of animal that is being produced here.  We have all heard a lot in this House and outside about dual purpose cows, and I am not going to digress on their merits or demerits now except to say that I understand that that is one of the problems which the Department and the Minister in particular, this Minister, has been interested in and is examining.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should not like to offer my opinion <Col N="77" /> merely from what I have read on that subject, but undoubtedly it is one of those detailed problems that are involved and should be attended to.  I think that is the fairest answer I can make to the Deputy.  From a statistical point of view, I notice that the milk intake in creameries is up.  I do not feel that I could draw any very definite conclusion in regard to the sources of that milk from that fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The good season is the answer to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It possibly is.  In regard to the actual problem of the type of animal I prefer to leave it to the experts.  But I would like to say this about that problem and every other problem involved in agriculture &mdash;that this is a national problem in its widest sense and that it should be treated&mdash;we should all treat it&mdash;as objectively as possible and try to find the best solution.  That is really what I am trying to plead for here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidJohnMadden" hpid="Mr. Madden Mr. Madden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>I do so in a co-operative way.  Statistically, it is reported that the reduction in dairy cows over the last five or six years stands at about 80,000.  Now this is a matter of very great concern to me just as on ordinary Deputy from a dairy county and really it is a terrible problem to face, I appreciate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I prefer to leave what are really technical matters in the industry to people who have some specialised knowledge of it.  It may very well be and probably&mdash;or rather I should say possibly&mdash;it is in regard to such problems that the key to greater production that could be got out of agriculture would be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But moving from that, what I was going to turn to when the Deputy mentioned this question of cows was the question of producing the foodstuffs <Col N="78" /> and the food that humans need as well as animals here at home.  That undoubtedly, in the past, for reasons that are rather hard to understand in retrospect, became a subject for the platform.  If you belonged to one camp you decried tillage.  It seemed to be a rather foolish approach, to say the least of it.  Whatever the merits or demerits about the situation in the past, this fact seems to emerge to-day, that there is not an over-supply nor likely to be an over-supply of feeding stuffs whether for humans or for animals in this country for some time to come.</P>
    <P>We have our own recent experience about the cost of importation and buying from abroad, and this consideration can be added to the basic fact that it is obviously sounder to try to base your agricultural production in live stock here on food grown at home, as far as possible&mdash;that this is obviously better economy for a country such as we are, to try to produce food we need for human beings as far as possible rather than import it.  I need not expand that argument.  I think it is fairly self-evident from simple principles. It certainly follows from the pattern of our trade position at the moment.  One of the things that is to be noticed in the present situation is a correction in that direction&mdash;that the imports of wheat, maize, barley and similar matters have tended to decrease. In my own humble opinion, I think we are far too dependent on outside sources still for such supplies, but there you are.  The consoling fact is, however, that acreages and the production of these things at home are on the increase, and there, again, is a line which should be further exploited in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There are increases in price, anyway, like the butter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, now, prices are a very difficult thing.  But there is this to be said, that no matter what way you look at home production there is a big difference between paying an increase in prices to your own people and your own farmers and having to meet increases in prices to outsiders, which complicates your <Col N="79" /> trade balances as well as everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, as usual when anyone talks about this subject, one gets the usual reaction from the Fine Gael Benches.  They do not seem to like this tillage idea.  But I think this, apart from any arguments we give here, that the facts of the situation and common sense seem to demand that we should go all out for this.  The net result is that with trends as they are, now seems the opportunity and now the time when everyone should co-operate in a drive to get increased agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Ask the banks what assistance they are going to give you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get that. Again, you also have the question of fertilisers, the increased use of fertilisers here, and the opportunity to step up production.  When one sees what is done in certain very restricted areas on the Continent it seems obvious even to a layman like myself on these matters that there are possibilities here.  The problem is what to do.  We understand from a recent announcement that the Government, the Minister and the other Ministers concerned, are considering this problem.  I would like at this stage just to mention another aspect of it.  We sadly need a basic fertiliser industry in this country.  We sadly need it for agriculture, but we need it on a broader basis.  We have been completely deficient in meeting our chemical needs generally, the needs that would be supplied in any modern civilisation by a chemical industry.  We just have not got one in the basic sense.  Now, on the other hand, it is probably beyond our financial resources to set up and maintain a chemical industry merely as a chemical industry to supply such chemical demands <Col N="80" /> as there are at home; but fortunately there is the possibility of wedding the agricultural need and the industrial need in regard to chemicals and basing a chemical industry on the plant and production units which would be designed to produce the basic chemicals needed for agriculture.  In other words, if you set up here a factory or factories and a number of plants to produce the basic chemicals that are needed for fertilisers, if these are properly thought out you are setting up, actually taking the first step to set up, the nucleus of a chemical industry.  Whereas that industry will be designed and will, in fact, serve your major industry&mdash;agriculture&mdash;by a proper design of the offshoots, you will be able to service your other industrial needs as well.  In that regard, I should like to mention to the Minister one thing that I have been somewhat interested in, that I have mentioned in this House on a number of previous occasions and that is, perhaps, the real reason why I have intervened in this debate which is usually confined to agricultural specialists.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, here, the outlook has been to produce sulphate of ammonia. As a fertiliser, sulphate of ammonia has been popular here.  It has certain possibilities&mdash;it has certain compatibilities, put it that way, and we are used to handling it.  Our existing factories are used to handling it.  In the whole set-up, as we handle fertilisers at the moment, including phosphate and calcium fertilisers, ammonium sulphate has fitted in more or less naturally.  On the other hand, I should not like to see our whole fertiliser industry based on the production of that chemical simply because it would be useful for agriculture, perhaps, for it is more or less a dead alley after that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what I have read in the papers about a possible scheme that is being considered&mdash;of which I have no details&mdash;there is to be considered the question of establishing a nitrate factory.  I think that that would be the right line.  It may cause complications but the ideal thing&mdash;looking at it from the point of view of all our needs&mdash;would be to fix your nitrogen in the two forms, that is, as <Col N="81" /> ammonium and as nitrate.  It could be used as ammonium nitrate for fertilising or the nitrate could be used with lime as a fertiliser.  I should like to leave that point with the Minister &mdash;that if this thing is under active consideration now, it should not be for ammonium sulphate but it should be for the nitrate type of fertiliser. Even if you do want a certain amount of ammonium fertiliser, it would be possible to obtain it in the form of ammonium nitrate.  If you fix the nitrogen in both ways, you have this whole road opened up for this nucleus industry I have spoken about.  There are some sidelines.  The ammonium sulphate project, as it was visualised pre-war, was for agriculture&mdash;just fertilisers.  It is more or less a blind alley in regard to other possibilities. The line which I have advocated in the past in this House&mdash;to fix both as nitrate and ammonium&mdash;opens up the possibility of supplying a large amount of your explosives for civilian and military use, and a number of other avenues as well.</P>
    <P>At this stage, I urge on the Minister that the move should be towards nitrates rather than towards the traditional ammonium sulphate.  In that, I base my arguments on something outside agriculture.  I know the objections.  At first glance, people will raise objections about the status.  It means changing certain existing arrangements.  People will say that, perhaps, it is more difficult to store.  However, all these things can be and have been got over. The significant thing is that in places like Holland, and in other parts of the Continent, there has been a move over towards the nitrate type of fertiliser with very satisfactory results. In fact, the results are such that the nitrate is regarded with more favour as a better fertiliser.  There is the further point that ammonium sulphate, as everybody knows, rather tends to make the soil acid.  As far as I am aware, and from what I can judge as a result of the amount of talk we have had in this House about lime, and so forth, one of our problems in this country is over-acidity.  Just offhand, on that ground, it seems probable that <Col N="82" /> the nitrate would be the more satisfactory fertiliser for us.</P>
    <P>However, without going into any further detail on the matter, I think that if we intend to embark on a large-scale production of fertilisers and the chemicals needed basically for that purpose, we should do it in the broad sense.  It may be a little more expensive at the start but, in the long run, it will provide a better service for agriculture, with potentialities for serving other industrial and general needs so that what would flow out of the undertaking would have a higher employment content, in the end, than if one went merely for the traditional ammonium sulphate.  I should like that point attended to.</P>
    <P>I think that that is about all that I can usefully add to this debate except to say again that if we are serious about it, and if we can get the co-operation from all sections of the community that is necessary in this undertaking, we should be able to step-up agricultural production in the immediate future in this country and continue that step-up to such a degree that a number of the economic problems which we have had, to date, more or less chronically would be solved and obviated.</P>

      <P>I have before me the report of the interview which the <i>Sunday Press</i> correspondent or reporter had with the present Minister for Agriculture.  To say the least of it, the Minister's remarks and his general observations were full of optimism.  That being so, I want to put a few points to the Minister for Agriculture apropos some remarks he made <Col N="83" /> a short 12 months ago with regard to agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>This article which appeared in the <i>Sunday Press</i> is optimistic in the extreme.  It talks about an increase in net output and gross output.  It boasts about the increase in the value of exports over the past two years.  It boasts about&mdash;or perhaps I should say the Minister boasts about&mdash;the increase in stocks in the country and gives figures in respect of pigs, cattle and sheep.  He waxes eloquent about the increase in the area under wheat, beet and other crops.  However, there is no mention at all of one of the most important sections in this country and one of the most important sections in the agricultural industry&mdash;the agricultural worker.  I do not want to make a plea on his behalf, because I know that everybody in this House would subscribe to any plea of mine or to any plea of a member of the Labour Party on behalf of the agricultural workers&mdash;with qualifications: severe qualifications of the type that &ldquo;the industry cannot afford to pay agricultural workers any more than they are being paid at present.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not subscribe to that qualification or to that view.  It seems, as I said, from this article and from the Minister's introductory speech that there is a bright future for agriculture and that agriculture and those engaged in it have seen good times since he became Minister in June, 1951.  From the other side, we have not got a denial of that position.  The only difference of opinion is as to who was responsible for it&mdash;whether it was Deputy Dillon or the Minister&mdash;but I say that if it is protested from the Government side or any other side that agriculture is in a little better position than it has been for years, the wages of the agricultural worker have not kept in step with that increase in prosperity.  For that reason, I suggest, on behalf of the Labour Party, that the Minister take immediate steps to scrap the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This board meets periodically&mdash;I think every 12 months&mdash;and for what purpose?  It is not to decide what wages the agricultural worker should <Col N="84" /> be paid or what the industry can afford to pay him, but merely to give that worker his annual or periodical increase of 5/- per week, without having the slightest regard for what has happened in the industry during the preceding 12 months.  I submit that the Agricultural Wages Board is weighted against the agricultural worker and it is futile for the employee's representative on that board to make any suggestion or any submission on behalf of the worker with regard to giving him a wage which can be afforded by the industry and which is related to the living conditions of the worker.</P>
    <P>There was set up in 1945 under the Industrial Relations Act what we all now know as the Labour Court and I think that, by and large, that Labour Court has worked fairly well for employer and for employee.  I submit that, while the Agricultural Wages Board might pretend to be a Labour Court for the agricultural workers and their employers, it does not come any way near what the Labour Court is and has been over the past six or seven years, because, as I have said, the board is weighted with employers, and I therefore urge that the Minister should abolish it and replace it&mdash;I do not necessarily advocate that the claims or submissions of agricultural workers should be put before the Labour Court as at present constituted&mdash;by a court which will have as its function the determining of the wage that ought to be paid to the agricultural worker and the conditions that should be applied to him.</P>
    <P>We have evidence that certain farmers&mdash;a minority, I am glad to say &mdash;are playing fast and loose with the Agricultural Workers (Weekly Half-holiday) Act.  I appreciate how difficult it is for any Minister to give to this House or for the House to pass a watertight Act of Parliament, but in regard to this Act it seems to me, despite the protestations of goodwill that came from farmers' representatives on all sides of the House when it was being passed that that goodwill has not been displayed by certain farmers who are taking advantage of clauses in it to evade the granting of the half-holiday, the half-holiday which <Col N="85" /> this House decided the agricultural worker was entitled to.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of the wages the agricultural worker should be paid, I should like the Minister to throw his mind back to what he said a year or two ago in relation to wages.  He said he believed that the agricultural worker should have the same wage as the builder's labourer.  The builder's labourer in my part of the country enjoys a wage of something like £6 a week, and I should like to ask the Minister how long he thinks the agricultural industry has to go before the worker will be in receipt of what the Minister describes as his ideal, a wage equal to that of the builder's labourer.  If it is to be left to the Agricultural Wages Board which doles out a miserable 5/- per year, the rate of wages to which the Minister referred then will never be reached.</P>
    <P>I suggest to him, therefore, that he should scrap the Agricultural Wages Board and set up a court&mdash;let him call it a Labour Court, or whatever he likes, and let submissions or applications be made by the workers' representatives to that court.  There are farmers' representatives in the different areas and if they want to make submissions, the court is there for them.  Let the court decide these matters.  It can have made available to it the knowledge necessary to enable it to determine what the agricultural workers' wage should be.  I should be glad if the Minister would make some comments on the points I have raised because I think they are the only remarks with regard to agricultural workers' wages that have been made in this debate.  I strongly urge, not on my own behalf but on behalf of the Labour Party, that he should scrap the board and replace it by the type of court that was established in 1945.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to apologise for my absence from the earlier portion of the debate.  I was, unfortunately, unable to be present when the debate started last summer. I have very little knowledge&mdash;except for what I have read&mdash;of the statements made and one can learn much <Col N="86" /> from what one reads but can learn more from the way in which it was said and the people who said it. During the debate&mdash;it opened prior to the Galway by-election&mdash;many things were said that carried very little weight.  Many Deputies indulged in good propaganda, as I suppose they were entitled to, but the unfortunate thing about agriculture is that too many people deal with it from a political point of view.  It would be much better if agriculture which, as has been admitted on all sides, is the basic industry of the country, were approached from a different angle altogether.</P>
      <P>We have, in the past two years, established one fact&mdash;that the growing of wheat in this country is a feasible proposition, that the wheat grown in this country can give as good a return to the farmer as any other cash crop he grows, that the flour made from that wheat is equally as good as flour made from wheat grown in any other country, and that the bread made from that flour is as palatable and as sustaining as bread made from flour produced in any other country.  That has been established and no matter what Government sits here on these benches, no Minister or no Deputy can in future get up and tell the people that wheat cannot be grown, and grown satisfactorily, in this country.  We have at last established that one fact, that it is possible to grow as good wheat here as in any other part of the world.  We should be thankful for that.  It has taken over 20 years to convince a number of people here that it was possible to do so.  I hope now that even with the bad harvest and difficult conditions that have been experienced this year, it has at last been established beyond yea or nay that we can continue with the production of wheat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, as I have said, established that one fact.  Other facts have also been established.  That is why I say that we should take agriculture away altogether from the political arena.  Why during the past couple of years have some Deputies gone out of their way to prevent the people producing some of these crops?  Simply because the production of these crops was advocated by me and other Deputies sitting on this side of the House and for no other reason.  That is why we did not get the co-operation we required.  I hope that we shall not have that attitude in future and that we shall build up the country by making use of our own raw materials.  We are on the way towards doing that in the case of two commodities, bread and sugar.  We can grow the raw materials for both these commodities to the full extent of our requirements.  I hope that, instead of having somebody coming along in the next two or three years or perhaps five years hence, trying to decry the production of these crops, our people generally will co-operate in the effort to produce sufficient to enable us to manufacture our own requirements from these crops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, thanks be to God, we have been very lucky.  We have had a year of abundance.  That was not due to any action of mine; it was due to Almighty God who has given us such good weather.  I have had on <Col N="88" /> numerous occasions gone into the country and talked to the people about the production of milk.</P>
    <P>I told them on many occasions that if our cows were better fed we would get a greater yield from them.  Nothing happened in the past 12 months in the Department, through the agency of the Minister or anybody else, to give us that extra feeding but it came, because we had better grass. It was the most suitable year we have had for a long time for the growing of grass.  The results are shown in the quantity of milk delivered to the creameries from the same number of cows.  In public statements which I have made, I have dealt with the increased production of milk and I have urged among other things the application of lime to the land.  The application of fertilisers has been responsible for the increased production from the soil.</P>
    <P>Again, may I say that since I came into office I have on every possible occasion asked our people to use more lime and fertilisers?  Where that advice has been taken, we have had increased yields.  Any Deputy who is engaged in farming or has any connection with rural areas knows that this year there has been a phenomenal yield from many of our crops where lime and fertilisers have been used.  Again, we want the co-operation of everybody in the country to educate our people and make them conversant with the benefits that are to be derived from the use of more lime and fertilisers.  These are ways in which we can be good politicians.  If we want to build up the country, that is the way in which it can be done&mdash;to go out and educate our people to do these things that are going to increase the national income and to bring more money to the farmers and workers, not alone in the agricultural industry but in other industries that are dependent on agriculture.</P>

      <P>This evening when Deputy Davin was speaking he first of all mentioned a consultative council. I do not know what my predecessor did regarding consultative councils, but there is no branch of agriculture that I do not consult before I make a decision.  There is the consultative council dealing with live stock; there is the consultative council dealing with poultry; there is the consultative council dealing with dairying; and before any major decision is made I consult those people.  In addition to that I have met organisations representing tillage farmers, tomato growers, the Agricultural Association of Ireland, and the Beet Growers' Association. <Col N="91" /> Every one of these has been consulted before I made decisions and I got their views.  What more can I do regarding consultation with the people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a council which I hope to bring into existence in the coming year.  I have already the nucleus of that council in the organisations representing tillage, dairying, live stock and poultry.  It is a question of going one step further and getting a council that will represent all those bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin and some other Deputies mentioned the question of credit.  This afternoon I answered a question regarding the provision of credit in Denmark.  The situation in Denmark is completely different from the situation here and the first thing we would have to do if we were to have a comparable situation with Denmark would be to go out and organise our farmers, because every conceivable thing done in Denmark is done through a co-operative society of one description or another.  They buy through co-operative societies and they sell through co-operative societies; these are two fundamentals. Every branch of agriculture on the buying side and on the selling side is <Col N="92" /> carried on through co-operative societies. Any farmer that you meet there, large or small, may be a member of five or six or possibly seven co-operative societies.  He is a consumer and a producer; he is a pig producer and a poultry producer, and all these have their various societies for co-operation.</P>
    <P>When they started this of course they had their selling and their buying societies and they had money as a result.  Then they built up their co-operative banks and the long-term credits in particular are largely based on the amount of money made available by these co-operative banks. Farmers own the banks and these land the money to the farmers.  There are three different types of credit, long-term, medium-term and short-term and they are catered for by these organisations. It would be very hard, indeed actually impossible, for us to have a similar scheme here at present because there is no organised co-operation amongst our farmers.  It entails a highly organised organisation to put into practice such a scheme as they have in Denmark.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The co-ops in existence are not co-ops in the strict sense of the word; I have said that on many occasions.  Many of them are too much concerned with entering into other businesses that are no concern of theirs, or should not be any concern of theirs.  That is one of the troubles we have with regard to our co-operative societies.  They are not utilising the organisation they have to do the things they should have been doing. No co-op that I know of has made an attempt to do what it should have done.</P>
      <P>There is a golden opportunity to-day when Eggsports have gone for the co-ops to come in and sell our poultry abroad and get rid of the people whom Deputy Davin wants to get rid of, the middlemen.  What effort is being made to do that?  There has been no effort.</P>

It is time enough for the people to make an approach for money when the organisation is there to use it.  I have already asked them to go and do this thing. Why not build up an organisation in the co-ops which Deputy Hickey talked about?  Why not use the organisation that is there for the purpose?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They are getting paid for doing it.  That is not evidence of their being ignored.  There is an opportunity for our people to co-operate and to export our poultry, or take over the management of it.  Incidentally, I might remark that the argument <Col N="94" /> was being used this evening that it was a disastrous thing to get rid of Eggsports.  I do not know how anybody can conceive that.  Who were Eggsports?  Eggsports were a company formed by the exporters, a body set up in order to make it easy to canalise our poultry to the Ministry of Food in England.  That company would never have come into existence had it not been for the necessity for having a canal by which to send the poultry from this country to the Ministry of Food.  It was an emergency provision and nothing more than that.  They did not fix any price for poultry; they did not get a subsidy.  The price which Eggsports paid for our exports of poultry was the price that Eggsports were able to obtain since poultry were decontrolled two years ago.  There was a free market then and the price of poultry was determined two years ago by the price the consumer was prepared to pay.</P>
      <P>There is going to be no change in that in the future.  Eggs have been decontrolled since last May.  From the 1st January next it will also be a free market as far as we are concerned and the price that our poultry and egg producers will get is the price the English consumer is prepared to pay. There was no subsidy.  In the past there was a certain amount of juggling with money in that the price of old hens was reduced in order to build up the price of chickens.  There was no juggling with egg prices.  The prices obtained for eggs were the prices that were paid to the producers but the juggling went on between the prices of old hens and chickens.  When one was down the other was up.</P>
      <P>In the case of turkeys, Deputy Dillon will say he built up a fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no control. Eggsports did not control the price of turkeys in the past.  They appointed agents to sell the turkeys.  Presumably these people now engaged in the export of poultry are going to do likewise but we are going to go a step further.

It will have no effect whatsoever on the market and neither should it have any effect on the price.  On the contrary, there should be an increase in price for the reason that due to the canalisation of our poultry for the past nine or ten years our people were required to reach only a minimum standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is good news.  The Minister says there will be an increase in the price of turkeys this year. <i>Gloria in excelsis Deo.</i>  We were all apprehensive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We will get an aid for the Deputy if his memory is impaired. I notice that during the summer the Deputy lost some of his hair.  With improved standards, and we should have improved standards in many directions because it is a question of efficiency now and putting the best quality on the market, the individual exporter may possibly be in a far better position to give a higher price for good quality stuff than has been given in the past.  You had a certain standard. It was the minimum efficient standard we had.  There was no compensation for a high standard.  Once you reached the minimum standard you reached the maximum price, but if you put good quality stuff on the market now and reach a higher standard of efficiency, then you may possibly get a higher price.  I believe you should get a higher price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All in all, I believe that the change over, the getting rid of Eggsports and getting back to free trade, is going to be a good thing for the poultry industry. I believe that.  I believe the <Col N="97" /> forecast may even be more substantial although I am not taking the place of Old Moore.</P>

      <P>Well, any time it is needed annually.  The cost of money to the State was higher last year than it was the year before.  Money does not fall down like manna from heaven. Money is not a commodity which the Government picks up.  They must go to the people for it if they want to distribute it amongst the people who need it.  It cost the Government more to get that money.  Consequently, there had to be an increase in the interest rate.</P>
      <P>Administration charges were not reduced.  As a matter of fact, they were increased because of higher salaries for the workers.  General administration costs were higher; the cost of money was higher and, consequently, the interest rate had to be raised.</P>

It was set up for the purpose of making such credits available.  I have no control over the corporation nor has the Department of Agriculture, as Deputy Dillon knows. There is control by the Department of Finance, but that is beside the question.</P>
    <P>We have many credit schemes in this country, for example, for the purchase of machinery, for the restocking of land, for the supply of fertilisers and seeds.  The county councils and some of the co-operative societies also have credit schemes.  All these schemes have been working here for a long number of years.  There are credit schemes for the erection of houses and so on.  Money can be made available so that, taking all in all, a credit-worthy person here will not find too much difficulty in getting money if he needs it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the figure <Col N="102" /> with me at the moment.  If the Deputy puts down a question I can let him have the information.  As I said earlier, we have had a wonderful year, and we thank God for that. It is not due to the Department or to the Minister.  I hope that next year is going to be as good.  I should like to say that I think great credit is due to our farmers and agricultural workers for overcoming, as they did, the difficult time they had during the harvest.  The crops have been reasonably well saved.  In that connection, difficulties arose which we must try to overcome in the future, difficulties regarding drying plants and storage.  It is for the Government to tackle these questions.  They must be tackled in the coming 12 months.  Notwithstanding the propaganda that was used last year, we have had an increase in our acreage under wheat.  I have already dealt with that, but I should like to express the hope that we will have a further increase next year.  The Government have done all that they could&mdash;what it was within their power to do&mdash;to encourage the people to grow wheat so as to ensure that this country will not be dependent on outside sources for its bread supply.  We have again fixed prices at the same figure as last year.</P>
      <P>Even though I do not like introducing the question of what was done in the past, we all remember that, when the Coalition Government was in office, there was no inducement whatever held out to our farmers to produce more wheat.  During their period in office, there was no inducement held out for any guarantee.  As a matter of fact, prices were depressed while agricultural costings were going up, were mounting every other day&mdash;wages, machinery and all the other factors that contribute so much to an increase in the costs of production.  These were all there, but the price that was fixed in 1947 was the price that we found when we came into office in 1951.  Therefore, no credit is due to those people, nor are they entitled to any credit in sponsoring the growth of wheat in this country and I feel inclined to include Deputies Hickey and Davin in that.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon does not deny it.  He admits he said it and Deputies Hickey and Davin were prepared to fall in behind you in your depression of agricultural prices.  Then you will go down and ask the agricultural labourers to give you support in an election.  Incidentally you depressed the wages by depressing the prices of agricultural produce.  However, we are improving.  Agricultural prices have improved and as a result of the <Col N="104" /> improvement in prices we have an improvement in production.  We have an improvement in the production of milk.  There have been more intakes to the creameries this year, more chocolate crumb produced and other by-products.  It may not be necessary in the coming year&mdash;I hope it will not &mdash;to import butter.</P>

      <P>The price does not ensure that and here again we have the typical Fine Gael argument.  They want to know what are we going to do about it.  What do they want the Government to do?  There are at least two ways of dealing with it.  It was my pleasure to get one of the Deputies' pamphlets down in Galway. The first four items on that pamphlet were, &ldquo;Bread, sugar, milk and butter.&rdquo; The costs were too high!  &ldquo;We will reduce the cost&rdquo;!  Deputy O'Sullivan and many of the farmer-Deputies who went down there thought they could deceive the farmers of Galway.  How was it going to be done?  They forgot to tell the farmers of Galway how they proposed to do it.  There were about three ways of doing it but they forgot to tell the farmers.  We could reduce the price of milk, reduce the price of wheat or reduce the price of beet.  You could do it that way or you could impose additional taxation on the people.</P>

You were not deceiving the people of Galway.  There was a third way and that was to dispense with the Social Welfare Act.  Deputy Davin was afraid to advocate that, but that was one of the ways it could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have succeeded in getting better prices for our farmers.  As a result of those better prices and the inducements we have held out, we have increased production.  The volume of <Col N="105" /> production has been increased by 5 per cent.  That is no mean achievement when we remember that we were confronted with the task of correcting or halting a downward trend in 1951.  That was the first task that confronted us in agriculture.  The wheat acreage had gone down; the beet acreage was down; no pigs for export; very few pigs going to the factories, milk production down resulting in the importation of butter.  We had all these things to face.  We have faced them and to-day we are exporting pigs, bacon and pork.</P>

When this goddess of his was examined carefully we found a lot of humps, lumps and bumps there which we had to get rid of.  We succeeded in doing that because that is what the figures indicate, notwithstanding the fact that Deputy Sweetman got on his feet to-night and spoke on something about which he knew nothing.  He said there was a hold-up in the reclamation of land during last summer.  The fact is that we reclaimed more land this summer than we did last year and last year we reclaimed more in one year than Deputy Dillon did during three years.</P>

      <P>We have now discovered that the land reclamation work of this country is proceeding smoothly and we are doing more work at a lower cost per acre than was done in the past.  Is it not our purpose and our intention here &mdash;that of every Deputy sitting in this House&mdash;to spend the income of the country as wisely as we possibly can? Should not that be our purpose?  This is our people's money, the taxpayers' money, and it is our duty to see that the taxpayer gets the best possible result from the expenditure of that money.  That is what we are doing at the present time, and it is showing good dividends.  We are getting more work done, and I believe that in the course of two years, as a result of the contractors taking over, we will be able to make very good progress, far better progress than if the Department were doing this work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The contractors will not do well.  That is wrong.  How were the contractors doing before?  There was no such thing as competition before. As a matter of fact, the example that was set before was bad for contractors, if it were nothing else.  The reclamation of land is nothing new: it has been in existence for almost 20 <Col N="107" /> years.  It came in in a small way at first; it has developed, and in 1949 when Deputy Dillon, who was then Minister for Agriculture, introduced machinery it was a natural development of what should have happened. In other directions, the country had become mechanised &mdash; tillage was mechanised, dairying was mechanised and land reclamation was bound to be mechanised also.  It was a new development in extension of the old, but there was no necessity for anyone to stand up and say: &ldquo;I have created something that has not been heard of before or come into existence in any other part of the globe.&rdquo;  There was nothing new about it.  Had it been properly worked in the beginning, handed over to people engaged in the business, it would have been a success; but it was not a success and could never be a success through the Department doing that type of work itself.</P>
      <P>Deputies can be assured that land reclamation is making progress.  I hope at the end of the financial year I will be able to show results, that the money I asked for last year will be better expended and more acreage done&mdash;and better done, if it is possible to do it better than it has been done in the past, though I am not quarrelling about that or making use of that point&mdash;and that the money that has been given to me will have been wisely spent on the reclamation of land.  Furthermore, I hope that the country will be remunerated for putting that money up for the people who had land to clear.</P>

The Minister asked me: &ldquo;Why did you refer this motion back?&rdquo;  I cannot in conscience say that I moved to refer the motion back as a result of some radical change in policy.  I cannot discern any change in policy as at present and when I was Minister.  So far as I know, all the schemes we inaugurated are being carried out.  My only objection is that <Col N="112" /> I think they are being incompetently carried out and they are being incompetently carried out only because I think the Minister is allowing himself to be kicked about by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance.  That is why we moved to refer back.</P>

      <P>Is maith liom a bheith i ndon a chur in iúl don Dáil go raibh an bhliain anuraidh níos fearr ag na hiascairí mhara ná an bhliain roimpí.  Ó thairg mé Meastachán cheana, dí-rialaíodh praghas an éisc.  Dá bharr sin tharla ardú praghais ar an bpoinnte.  San am sin bhí an t-iasc roinnt gann.  Le feabhsú aimsire san Earrach, d'fhairsing sé cuid mhaith agus d'ísligh an praghas agus d'éirigh sé chomh staidéarthach agus is féidir le praghas soláthairtí a bheith nach bhfuil staidéarthach iad fhéin.  Cuirtear chuile shaghas éisc ar <Col N="115" /> an margadh poiblí anois ó dí-rialaíodh an praghas.  Roimhe sin, díoltaí cuid mhaith de na cineálacha den chéadscoth&mdash;cineálacha na mbeadaí&mdash;díreach leis na siopadóirí.  Ní féidir a rá ar díoladh ar an bpraghas rialaithe é. Na cineálacha eile a cheannaíos an pobal fré chéile, ghnídís an praghas ríalaithe beagnach i gcónaí.  Níl srian oifigiúil leis an bpraghas anois, agus athraíonn an praghas do réir tóir an phobail air nó méad na soláthairtí.  Le seanchleachtadh, tá a fhios ag na siopadóirí i mBaile Átha Cliath an méid éisc a bhfuil tóir sheasta air ó sheachtain go seachtain.  Gheibhtear air sin airgead atá cothrom go leor leis an sean-phraghas rialaithe.  Má bhíonn fairsingeacht thar an méid sin ann titeann an margadh faoin bpraghas sin. Is iad báid na hÉireann faoi ndear fairsingeacht mar sin, mar tá allmhuirithe faoi smacht ag an mBord Iascaigh Mhara, agus ní ligeann An Bord isteach seachtain ar bith ach an méid a bhíos easpaitheach i soláthar sa mbaile.  Scaití, ní bhíonn tuairim barainneach ag An mBord faoin easpa sin toisc toradh thar an gcoitian a bheith ag na hiascairí, ach braitheann sé sin ar an aimsir agus ar choinníollacha eile thar cumas An Bhoird. Deir lucht an eolais i dtrádáil an éisc nach mór soláthar a bheith iomarcach do réir deich faoin gcéad má táthar chun dóthain a bheith ar fáil i gcónaí. Ar ndóigh, bíonn an iomarcacht níos mó ná sin, scaití, agus fágann sé sin fadhb le fuascailt.  Tá fonn ar na hiascairí a gcuid éisc a chur go Baile Atha Cliath, agus dá bharr sin tarlaíonn go minic go mbíonn fuíollach ar an margadh sin gan díol.  Dá bhféadtaí na soláthairtí d'imdháil níos cothroime ar fud na tíre ní bheadh an scéal amhlaidh; agus, freisin, bheadh teacht timpeall againn ar an gcúis chlamhsáin a cluintear go minic gur deacair iasc úr d'fháil go rialta faoin tír.  Is fada na hudaráis ag meádh na ceiste seo, agus níl siad gan toradh ar a gcuid meáite. Tá gléasra mhinéisc bunaithe acu cheana, agus tá tuilleadh den rud céanna beartaithe.  Tá beartaithe freisin acu gléasra deataithe a bhunú. Bhéarfaidh an dá dheis seo bealach le brabach a dhéanamh as iasc a théas amú faoi láthair nó a díoltar ar bheagán <Col N="116" /> airgid.  Ní féidir, ámh, an oiread a thabhairt ar iasc le haghaidh minéisc agus a gheibhtear ar iasc le n-ithe. Deirtear go ndéanann an t-iasc an iomarca taistil ó fhágfas sé an bád go sroisfidh sé bord a lucht itte.  Caitear é a chur ar an margadh ar an bpoinnte faoi láthair; ach táthar le tuilleadh deis reóite agus fuarstórála a bhunú. Ar an gcaoi seo síltear go bhféadfar margáil an éisc a rialú agus a réasúnú ar mhaithe leis an bpobal agus na hiascairí.</P>
      <P>Mar gheall ar an tiormacht ní raibh an bhliain anuraidh chomh maith le harú-anuraidh i dtaobh na mbradán. Fiú amháin ins na hinbhir, deir na hiascairí nach raibh an rath céanna ar an iascach agus a bhí cheana&mdash;agus a shliocht sin ar an onnmhuiriú.  Ins na haibhneacha, coibhríodh cuid mhaith éisc ins na poill; tharla sé seo arís i mbliana.  Nuair a bhíos an scéal amhlaidh caithfidh na coimeádaithe a bheith ar a seacht n-aire, faitíos millteanais ag lucht póitseála.  Níltear sásta leis an gcóir chosanta atá ann. Cé gur fiú níos mó go mór iascach na mbradán anois ná mar b'fhiú cheana, is beag athrú atá ar theacht-isteach na mBord Coimeádaithe le fiche bliain anuas.  Táthar ag beartú chun tuilleadh airgid d'fháil as iascach na mbradán le haghaidh cumhdach na n-abhann; agus síltear go mbeidh an bheartaíocht sin i bhfoirm tairiscintí roimh tús na bliana iascaigh arís.</P>
      <P>Tá obair fhónta á dhéanamh ag an Iontaobhas Iascaigh Intíre Incorpraithe a bunaíodh i 1951 chun rath a chur ar iascach na mbreac.  Is fundúireacht í seo a thógas anonn ó dhream ar bith, poiblí nó príobháideach, iascaireachtaí chun a bhfeabhsuithe ar mhaithe leis an bpobal slat-iascaigh.  Tá an tIontaobhas ag laghdú an méid éisc ghairbh i lochanna áiride agus ag cur breac óg isteach.  Is mór an tacaíocht an obair seo do lucht forbartha na cuartaíochta, agus is cóir a admháil anseo go bhfuil meas ar An mBord Fáilte as ucht ar sholáthraigh siad d'airgead le haghaidh na hoibre fónta seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>San Aibreán scaipeadh céad tuarascáil Choimisiún Iascaigh An Fheabhail. Bhain sé leis an sé mhí dar críoch an tríochadú lá, Meán Fómhair, naoi gcéad déag caoga dó.  Is dóigh go bhfuil <Col N="117" /> sé léite ag Teachtaí, agus, ar an ábhar sin, ní thagród go mion dó.  Is léir uaidh go bhfuil an sean-chancar seo réitithe go héifeachtúil cothrom ag an gCoimisiún.  Tá buíochas ag dul don Choimisiún as ucht a bhfuil déanta acu cheana, agus táim á ghlacadh sin leo anois.</P>
    <P>Tá meastachán na bliana seo laghdaithe an méid a caitheadh anuraidh ar cheannach Iascach An Fheabhail, agus tá sé thíos cuid mhaith, freisin, san airgead le haghaidh cúitimh a bhaineas le toirmeasc ar líontóireacht i bhfíoruisce.  Sé seo an chéad bhliain nach bhfuil airgead ar bith sa Meastachán i gcóir báid, agus mar sin de, a sholáthar&mdash;tá an t-airgead sin le fáil anois mar airleacain as an bPríomh-Chiste. Laghdaíonn na hathruithe seo an Meastachán go mór le hais na bliana anuraidh, ach ní laghdaíonn siad caiteachas ar na seirbhísí buana.  Tá siadsan níos fearr ná ariamh, agus fe amhlaidh go mbeifear ag cur leo is himeacht aimsire i leaba a bhaint díoal.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for fisheries for 1953-54 is for a net sum of £112,000, of which £74,000 has been granted by way of the Vote on Account, leaving £38,200 to be moved for as the Vote to Complete, as stated in the Money Resolution.  The Estimate represents a net decrease of £99,330 as compared with 1952-53.  The respective increases and decreases in the various sub-heads are shown in the printed Estimates. It is not, I think, necessary for me to explain all the increases and decreases as several of them are what might be described as of a casual nature, but I would make the following explanations in regard to the sub-heads which show considerable variations compared with last year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F (1)&mdash;Grants to Boards of Conservators and Local Authorities, etc.&mdash;shows an increase of £5,800. The statutory recoupment to local authorities of losses arising from the exemption of fisheries from local rates, pursuant to the Fisheries Act, 1925, shows an increase of £1,500 in the provision as compared with 1952-53. The increased provision is considered necessary as local rates have tended to increase steadily during recent years. <Col N="118" /> The provision for grants to boards of conservators shows an increase of £4,500 compared with last year.  This increase arises out of the need for a larger measure of assistance to several boards of conservators whose income from local sources, licence duties and rates is not sufficient to enable them to carry out satisfactorily the function of protecting and conserving the fisheries which is imposed on them by the Fisheries Acts.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F (5)&mdash;Compensation, etc. &mdash;shows a decrease of £17,000 compared with 1952-53.  This sub-head provides for payment of compensation in respect of the abolition of freshwater netting under Section 35 of the Fisheries Act, 1939, and also under the Freshwater Fisheries (Prohibition of Netting) Act, 1951.  Up to the 31st March, 1953, a total sum of £84,576 has been paid as compensation under these Acts.  Owing to the complex issues involved in examination of claims and legal investigation of entitlement to the compensation moneys, clearance in some of the larger cases is proceeding somewhat slowly.  It is anticipated that some claims may still remain uncleared at the end of the current financial year.  They will not, I expect, be very many, and at the latest, full clearance should be effected early in the next financial year.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F (5)&mdash;Foyle Fisheries&mdash; has only a token provision of £5.  It appears likely that future expenses relating to management of the Foyle area by the Foyle Fisheries Commission can be met from the revenue accruing to the commission from licence duties, rents and rates.  The amount appearing in the Estimates for 1952-53 under this sub-head&mdash;£57,765&mdash; was made up almost entirely of the cost of the acquisition, jointly with the authorities in Belfast, of the fishing rights in the tidal waters of the Rivers Foyle and Faughan.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G&mdash;Grants-in-Aid for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara&mdash;shows a provision of £31,330 compared with a total sum of £64,580 provided in the Estimates for 1952-53 for the services of both the Sea Fisheries Association (which ceased to exist on the 24th April, 1952) and the board which succeeded <Col N="119" /> it.  Under the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, advances to the board for development work and the supply of boats and gear to fishermen are to be issued from the Central Fund and do not, accordingly, appear in the annual Estimates.</P>
    <P>In this connection I may say that the board hope to receive from the Central Fund during the current financial year advances amounting to £154,750.  The sum appearing in the Estimates, £31,330, is made up as to Grant-in-Aid towards administrative expenses of £26,330 and Grant-in-Aid towards development schemes of £5,000.  The figure for administration is £6,575 greater than the aggregate sum provided in 1952-53 for both bodies.  This increase is accounted for principally by the need for new provision of £3,270 for the payment of the fees and travelling expenses of the members of the board and for the travelling expenses of the members of An Comhlachas Iascaigh Mhara.  The figure, I may add, relates to the period from 23rd April, 1952, to the 31st March, 1954.  Other items included are £1,000 as an anticipated contribution towards superannuation scheme for the board's employees, and £1,750 as a Grant-in-Aid towards the employment by the board of consultants and technicians, as required, for special work.  As to the £5,000 Grant-in-Aid of development, the details are as follows:&mdash;The board requires a sum of £3,000 to complete the work in connection with the Killybegs quick-freeze and fish meal plants on which £24,000 has been expended to date.  A sum of £1,500 is proposed by way of grants under this sub-head and the balance of £1,500 will be sought by way of advances from the Central Fund.  A sum of £800 is included for the restocking of oyster beds in Clew Bay, where an effort is being made to rehabilitate the oyster fisheries that flourished there in former times, and £1,250 for the reconditioning of the board's marketing depots.  At least a further sum of £1,250 for this latter work will be sought as an advance from the Central Fund.  The rest of the provision for development by way of a Grant-in-Aid is made up of £950 to meet the net working loss on the <Col N="120" /> Cromane mussel purification station, which has accumulated for some years past owing to the difficulties which have been experienced in marketing mussels from Cromane on the British markets, and £500 for miscellaneous items of development.</P>
    <P>Landings of sea fish, not including shell-fish, in 1952 were greater as to quantity and value than in 1951.  In quantity the increase amounted to almost 16,000 cwts. and in value the improvement came to approximately £47,000.  An important aspect of the improvement which has taken place is that it was effected by increased landings by the inshore boats.  The landings of demersal fish by the inshore boats amounted to 126,000 cwts. while steam trawlers&mdash;the last of which ceased operations during 1952&mdash;landed only 8,600 cwts.  The corresponding figures for the previous year were 105,500 cwts. and 13,500 cwts.  The landings of pelagic fish, that is mainly herrings and mackerel, came to 68,000 cwts. with a value of £81,400 in 1952.  Herring landings at 55,000 cwts. showed some improvement compared with 1951.  The season cannot, however, be regarded as altogether satisfactory as the shoals did not appear in any great density and there was not much encouragement, accordingly, for the fishermen to pursue them to the exclusion of other fishing.  The only point at which landings could be said to have been satisfactory was Achill. As regards mackerel, the landings in 1952 at 13,000 cwts. continued a decline which has been evident for some years past.  The restricted landings are attributed to the fact that the shoals did not come sufficiently close to shore to enable the small type of boat which usually engages in this fishing in an intensive way to reach them.  The fishermen had, however, some recompense for the reduced landings in the better prices realised for the fish which, in the aggregate, returned a figure of £21,000 compared with £20,000 in 1951.</P>
    <P>As to shell-fish, quite a considerable improvement took place in 1952 compared with 1951.  The overall improvement is best expressed in terms of value, as some varieties <Col N="121" /> of shell-fish are marketed by count, while others are handled by weight. The value of all shell-fish landed in 1952 was £124,000 which shows an increase of almost 33 per cent. on the figures for 1951.  The varieties which contributed most to the increase were crawfish, lobsters and periwinkles and, as quite a satisfactory trade in these varieties is being developed with France, I think it may be claimed that this market is proving of much advantage to our fishermen.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that, under the provisions of the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952, the Sea Fisheries Association, which had been functioning since 1931, ceased to exist in April, 1952, and was replaced by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The policy which the board has been charged with implementing is the development of the national fishing industry on the basis of the consolidation and improvement of the inshore fishermen's position.  To do this the two broad features of the board's work are the supply and maintenance of modern fishing boats to fishermen who can be depended upon to make the best use of them, and the better marketing of fish so that demand may be increased and, as far as possible, satisfactory returns assured to the fishermen.  The board operates four boatyards and these were maintained in full production in the construction of new fishing vessels and the servicing, repair, etc., of existing craft during 1952.  In addition, as and when required, the output of the board's own yards was supplemented by placing work with some of the other yards existing in the country.</P>
    <P>During 1952 ten fishing boats, eight of which were of the 50 foot class, were issued by the board to fishermen on hire-purchase terms.  The total number of 50 foot boats, up to date in every respect and suitable for all classes of inshore fishing, issued since materials for the building and furnishing of boats became available with the passing of emergency conditions, is now 25.  The work of these boats is clearly beginning to show itself in the increased landings which are being made by the inshore fishermen.  In the current financial year it is estimated <Col N="122" /> that the board will need £75,000 for the provision of boats, etc., to fishermen, and this sum as and when required will be issued as a repayable advance from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>As to the other aspect of the board's work, that is marketing of fish, 1952 showed an increase in the value of sales as compared with 1951.  In 1952 a gross sum of £281,000 was realised from sales, £201,000 being the proceeds from fish sold by public auction and £79,000 the value of fish sold on a wholesale basis throughout the country. It is one of the principal points in the board's marketing activities to effect the widest possible distribution of fish so that a widespread demand may be fostered.  At present the board distributes fish from five centres, Dublin, Cork, Killybegs, Dingle and Galway, and it has in mind the opening up of other centres of distribution in the near future.  It is accepted by all who understand the difficulties of the fish trade that in order to have a regular and increasing demand for fish by the consuming public, supplies must be made available regularly and in some variety.  The consumption of fish per head of our population is very low compared with other countries and there is room for considerable improvement in that regard.  At present, unfortunately, our fleet of inshore boats cannot provide adequate supplies continuously throughout the year owing to bad weather conditions from time to time.  To get over this handicap and to provide a more or less stable supply throughout the year the board now operate three high-sea fishing boats.</P>
    <P>Two of these vessels commenced fishing in December and the other in February, and to the end of March they landed fish to the value of over £10,000.  In order to keep an adequate flow of supplies the board finds it necessary from time to time to import supplies of fresh fish.  During 1952 the value of such fish imported came to £99,000.  This was a very considerable drop from the corresponding figure in 1951 which was £150,000.  There is, however, considerable leeway still to be made up and the board intends during the current financial year to put <Col N="123" /> in hands the construction of two 80 foot motor fishing vessels at an estimated cost of £60,000.  These vessels may not, of course, be ready to commence fishing operations before the end of the present year.  They will, with the three vessels already in commission, make a very valuable contribution to the country's fish supplies, and thereby help to reduce very considerably the existing volume of imports.</P>
    <P>A prime necessity in the proper care of fish on board a fishing vessel, especially those vessels which can remain away from port for a few days, is an adequate supply of ice.  Up to quite recently this question did not arise to any serious extent because the great majority of the inshore fishing boats in use returned to harbour with each day's takings.  The tendency now is, with the increase in size and efficiency of the boats being acquired by our fishermen, to extend their fishing time at sea and the question of ice, accordingly, is becoming one of greater importance.  At present ice is not available at many fishing centres and, until that situation is remedied, the handling of our fish supplies can not be entirely satisfactory.</P>
    <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara is alive to this situation and it proposes to erect, during the present financial year, two ice-making plants, each having a capacity of about 50 tons per week. It is intended, too, that ice from these plants will be distributed to ports where fish is landed, even in relatively small quantities, and kept available there in ice stores for use as needed. The cost of this development scheme is expected to be £25,000, which will be made available to the board from the Central Fund as a repayable advance when required.  With the progressive increase in the catching power of our fishing fleet the position is being reached where provision must be made to deal with catches which cannot be absorbed in the ordinary way for human consumption.  This can best be done in fish meal plants.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has established a small fish meal plant at Killybegs, <Col N="124" /> which has proved that such plants can be operated successfully where suitable conditions exist as to landings, etc.  There is a ready demand in this country and abroad for fish meal and there would be no difficulty in disposing of the production from another plant with an output capacity much greater than that at Killybegs.  The board is considering the erection of further plant for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Smoked fish enters very largely into the distribution of fish in this country as, with its prolonged period of preservation compared with fresh fish and advantages as to handling, etc., it is very suitable for dispatch to remote places.  At present there is very little production within the country of smoked fish except kippered herrings, and it is consequently necessary to import rather heavy quantities.  Last year such imports cost us over £126,000.  With the increased landings of white fish to be expected following the special steps being taken by the board to expand our fishing capacity, it is desirable that an effort should be made to increase our output of smoked fish with the twofold advantage of providing a further outlet for home landings and reducing imports of smoked fish.</P>
    <P>Methods of smoking fish have been improved in recent years in other countries in order to make the product more attractive to the consumer. These improvements have been studied by the board, and the latest proved techniques will be applied to development of this kind, which it is proposed to initiate during the present year, and for which it is proposed to seek an advance of £8,000 from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>In addition to the advances from the Central Fund to which I have just referred, further advances amounting to £4,750 will be made available to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara during the current financial year.  These advances will be used as to £2,000 to complete the purchase of new office premises in Dublin, and £1,250 for the reconditioning of the board's marketing depots for which £750 is also, as I have already stated, to be provided by way of Grant-in-Aid, <Col N="125" /> and £1,500 to complete work on the board's existing quick-freezing and fish meal plant.  For these items Grants-in-Aid amounting to £2,500 are also being made available this year.</P>
    <P>As regards inland fisheries, the output of salmon and trout for 1952 showed a considerable decrease compared with 1951.  The value of the catches in 1952 was £478,000, while in 1951 the figure was £681,000.  These sums exclude the catches in the Moville Fishery District which was incorporated in the area administered by the Foyle Fisheries Commission. Conditions favoured netting during the early part of 1952 and runs of spring fish were good.  The runs of grilse, however, showed a serious drop and the netting season terminated in most districts much earlier than usual. Angling conditions were not favourable over the greater part of the country for a considerable period, but catches were not greatly below those recorded in 1951.  The catches of both sea trout and eels were somewhat better than in 1951.  Exports of salmon in 1952 realised only £638,000 as against £844,000 in 1951.  This was, to some measure, due to the somewhat reduced prices obtained on the export markets.</P>
    <P>The production of salmon ova at the State-assisted hatchery at Lismore was very satisfactory and all reasonable requirements were met, including supplies needed to rehabilitate stocks of the River Liffey, which suffered a rather serious setback in 1951 when a considerable number of fish were killed through the release of quantities of mud through the dam at Leixlip. Production of sea trout and brown trout ova was unsatisfactory in 1952. In the case of brown trout, the failure was due to the prolonged drought conditions towards the end of 1951 which rendered the collection of ova impossible at many places.  The deficiency could not be made up by imports of ova from Great Britain as somewhat similar difficulties were experienced at the hatcheries in that country.  The income of boards of conservators in 1952 at £51,600 showed an increase compared with 1951 when the figure was £44,700.  Some of the increase <Col N="126" /> was due to the payment of increased grants to certain boards which needed financial assistance from State funds. The aggregate expenditure of the boards amounted to £54,400 and from this it is clear that some boards are finding it impossible to fulfil their functions, mainly in the matter of fishery protection, from their present sources of revenue.  I have at present under consideration a scheme for the provision of additional funds for boards of conservators, and the necessary legislation will be brought before the House as early as possible.  In 1952, boards of conservators employed 1,200 waterkeepers and their efforts, reinforced by the valuable co-operation and assistance of the Garda Síochána, resulted in almost 300 prosecutions for fishery offences.  In dealing with the inland fisheries I must, in order to give a more or less complete picture of the efforts that are being made to make the best of these fisheries, make reference to the work being done by the Inland Fisheries Trust.</P>
    <P>The provision for that body in the Estimates for the current financial year is £7,760, an increase of £2,860 compared with last year.  The activities of the trust have expanded very rapidly since its establishment in 1951. The trust has, I am glad to say, received full co-operation and enthusiatic support from the organised anglers throughout the country, and now it has under its care and in course of development, brown trout fishing waters in 12 counties.  These waters comprise 30 lakes of a total area of 25,000 acres, and 500 miles of rivers excluding minor tributaries.  These waters have come to the trust mainly through the E.S.B. and the Land Commission, and I am glad to acknowledge the co-operation and help extended to the trust by these bodies.  Special mention, however, must also be made of the fact that three fisheries with considerable potentialities for development have been handed over to the trust by private owners, and four more such transfers are being arranged.  These owners deserve the special thanks of the large number of people in this country interested in the popular sport <Col N="127" /> of brown trout angling.  In the waters under its management the trust is directing its efforts towards building up the depleted trout stocks by eliminating predatory coarse fish as a first measure, and then where it is safe to do so, turning in small trout transferred from other waters.  I should also mention that the trust is taking a major part, in conjunction with An Bord Fáilte, in a scheme for the development of the large lakes in the western side of the country&mdash;Corrib, Mask, Conn and Arrow.  This scheme, which is being financed by An Bord Fáilte, is being carried on through the agency of the local angling associations under the supervision of the trust.</P>
    <P>To sum up the position, the total amount which it is desired to provide from public funds for the purposes of the Fisheries Administration in the current year comes to £304,380.  The gross expenditure provided for in the Estimates now presented to the House comes to £149,630, and the advances for capital purposes proposed to be sought from the Central Fund amount to, as already stated, £154,750. The receipts or Appropriations-in-Aid expected to come to hand in the Fisheries Vote amount to £37,430, leaving the net expenditure envisaged on fisheries services at £266,950.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there are any other particulars as to the work of the Fisheries Administration during 1952 which call for mention here, but I will, of course, be pleased to supply any further information which may be sought by Deputies or any explanations which they may require as to the sums set down in the Estimate for Fisheries, 1953-54.</P>

      <P>The most outstanding point that struck me during the Parliamentary Secretary's speech was that we are importing fish to the tune of £156,000, while he comes to this House for a net sum of £112,000 for his Department. I think a better effort than that should be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that makes the matter even worse, because it brings the total to £255,000 for our total imports of fish.  Each year, the Vote for the Department of Fisheries comes before this House and it does not get the same attention as some other Votes do.  There is scarcely a Bill or a measure or a Vote that comes before this House for discussion on which a Deputy from some constituency or other does not raise the cry of emigration, flight from the land, and falling population, particularly along the seaboard.</P>
      <P>I want to bring home to the Parliamentary Secretary that, by virtue of the office which he holds, he has a powerful lever, if not to stop emigration altogether at least to check it considerably.  He can achieve that by extending and giving full rein to the section of the Department over which he has control.</P>
      <P>I was amazed to hear the Parliamentary Secretary state that only 12 fishing boats issued by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are at work around our coasts.</P>

      <P>The yield from these is extremely small.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that along the coast of the county I come from, Mayo, and his own county, Galway, <Col N="129" /> are some of the best fishing grounds in Western Europe.  Between the City of Galway and the town of Ballina, there is a coastline of about 150 miles where the fishermen have a tradition and a knowledge, second to none, of the fishing grounds.  An additional factor is the very poor quality of the land.  The same applies to the coastline of Sligo, of Donegal and even down to Clare, Kerry and Cork.  Every maritime county opens up a vast field for improvement, and I am reminded of another leakage in our national economy when the Parliamentary Secretary speaks of the £225,000 worth of fish which is imported each year, while the value of our own catches is only a small fraction of that amount.  I refer to forestry.  If we are to build up our nation, if we are to keep the young skilful men at home, we should provide work for them, the kind of work in which they have grown up.  Factories and all the rest of it are all very well, but they will be located in the towns and we must make an honest effort to keep as many of our young men on the land as possible.  I have said on many occasions previously that I have never known a young man to emigrate willingly, if he had a reasonable chance of making a decent living at home, and afforestation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help recalling that, in the matter of foreign timber, we are importing £8,000,000 worth and, in the matter of fish, we are importing £225,000 worth.  Both these sums would go a long way towards giving much employment at home and providing an incentive to our young men and women to stay at home.  I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary for the decline that has taken place in the past 100 or 120 years but I do blame him, as I will blame any successor of his, for not trying to stop this leakage.  We throw our hands up to Heaven in pious horror at the idea of importing industrial goods of a kind which we could produce and ought to be producing at home, but here is something on our <Col N="130" /> doorstep&mdash;a vast market for fish.  The demand for fish is very real throughout the country and it is a raw material which will cost little or nothing to harvest.  From my knowledge of the officials in the Department, I know that they need no urging.  They are fully alive to the importance of the industry and are anxious to expand it on safe and sound lines.  I admit that the handling and marketing of fish, and the disposal of fresh fish particularly, is a tricky problem because you are dealing with one of the most perishable foods known, but what other countries have done, we surely are able to do.  Our neighbour across the water, England, is able to get our young men who have a thorough knowledge of the sea and of the fishing business by paying them wages which induce them to go across.  We should do something to stop that.</P>
      <P>The whole coastline of Mayo and of Galway are very badly let down by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Department generally, and along that coastline of practically 150 miles, taking into account all the inlets and so on, we have a most expert people, young men particularly, who know every inch of it, who know every trick of the weather and who know the fishing grounds as they know the backs of their hands.  We here must share the blame for allowing these to fly from the country because they have no option but to go.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is asking this year for only £112,000 or, taking into account Appropriations-in-Aid, a sum of about £140,000.  That is a small sum, even taking into account the fact that the board can draw on central funds up to a certain amount for repayable advances.  I would much prefer that the Parliamentary Secretary would come in here and tell us exactly what sum was needed because this business of repayable advances has a deterring effect on many of the people along the coast who would engage in this business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke last year on this Vote about the method adopted of financing boats for these people and what I suggest is that, if there is difficulty in getting <Col N="131" /> money from the Department of Finance for a purpose like this and if repayable advances have to be made, there should be an issue of something like land bonds and thus provide An Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the same means of financing their work as the Land Commission have in relation to the purchase of land for the relief of congestion.  That is a suggestion I make for what it is worth but it is something I should like to see the Parliamentary Secretary doing.</P>
    <P>We should make a bold effort to stop the flight from our coastline of our intelligent young men who are anxious to develop a livelihood in this business.  There is a very good livelihood to be got in deep-sea and inshore fishing, if the material is put at the disposal of these men.  A 50 foot boat costs about £6,000 and if it is equipped with radar and other modern tackle, the cost might go up to £7,500.  That is totally beyond the capacity of most of those who would like to engage in fishing and some other system of financing the provision of boats should be adopted.  The Parliamentary Secretary asks these men for a 10 per cent. deposit, but a deposit of 10 per cent. on a £5,000 or £6,000 boat is beyond the capacity of these men, unless they are to put up their holdings and their homes for sale and sink all the money in the fishing business.  We cannot  to do that, but asking them for a cash down sum of £500 or £600 is useless.  It is a wrong .</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary whether there is any single case along the whole coastline in which people entrusted with a boat defaulted, dishonoured their bond by refusing to pay for the boat or tackle entrusted to them.  If we give them £5,000 worth of a boat for a cash down payment of £500, the State is risking £4,500 and we might as well trust them with the lot, because most of them are very honest men.  All of them I know are very honest and could be trusted with the lot.  If we are to re-establish the fishing tradition and safeguard the knowledge, the skill and the experience which we are in danger of losing we should entrust them with <Col N="132" /> these boats and put the most modern gear at their disposal.  While I do not know how other countries encourage the development of their fisheries, it seems strange to me that our waters can be infested by foreign trawlers which come right inshore and in some cases, as I read recently in the newspapers, actually show aggression against our people inside the three mile limit.</P>
    <P>Our Air Corps at the present time, in order to keep pilots and aircraft in fighting trim, must use their planes fairly constantly.  I suggest that one use that could be made of these planes would be to employ them on reconnaissance work around our coasts.  If foreign trawlers know that an aeroplane of the Irish Republic may just dart out of a cloud, spot them and report their location to some of the corvettes, I think it would have a very deterring effect on illegal fishing around our coasts.  That is a suggestion I make to the Parliamentary Secretary for what it is worth.  If these planes are using petrol, as they must &mdash;they do not get it merely to look at it in a glass case&mdash;I cannot see any better way in which it can be used in peace-time than for this purpose.  No matter how new our planes are at present, with the advance of science they will become obsolete in two or three years and we might as well turn them to some beneficial use as having them flying around in what must appear to the ordinary person aimless practice flights.</P>
    <P>I would again impress upon the Minister the desirability of placing these boats at the disposal of the few fishermen who are left and giving them all the necessary gear.  You must trust them.  In the case I quoted of a £5,000 boat you are trusting them to the extent of £4,500 and you ask them to put down £500.  That may appear a very small sum to some people but it is a terrific sum for poor people along the coast.</P>
    <P>It is utterly beyond their power to put it down.  I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that he should trust these people with the value of the whole boat and they will not let him <Col N="133" /> down.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary knows the class of people to whom I am referring and that he will admit that he could trust them with a much larger sum.  From the first catch they bring in, they will be establishing a growing claim on the boat and they will care the boat and not run any undue risks with it.  In conclusion I want to repeat what I said at the outset, that in a country like this to have to import fish to the value of £250,000, approximately, is a positive shame.  We have had a native Government in existence for over 30 years and during that time it was recognised that fisheries and forestry were two powerful means of establishing the people on the land and keeping a good deal of our best blood at home.  Yet they are the two branches of Government activity which have been neglected.  Even now, at this late hour, if we start in and try to make up some of the leeway we should be doing a good day's work. As a last word, I would say: &ldquo;Trust the few fishermen we have left&rdquo;.  We are already trusting them to the extent of 90 per cent. of the boats.  Trust them with the whole lot and they will not let you down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has followed the routine of former years. The Parliamentary Secretary reads a statement, there is a debate and there the matter ends.  Then we are told that we have a Fisheries Department to promote the development of our fisheries. Yet, quite recently when the Parliamentary Secretary attended some function at an hotel here in town he told the audience, and through the audience the country, that we were not a fish-eating people.  I always thought it was pretty difficult for people to eat an article they could not procure.  Has it occurred to the Parliamentary Secretary, in the case of other articles which the Department is producing, that he has a duty to see whether the people would buy them or consume them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement which he has presented to the House consists mainly of book-keeping items and the gross cost of the book-keeping is £211,000.  The summary of the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks at the function was <Col N="134" /> apparently that it was a dead concern, simply because the Irish were not fish eaters.  It is about time that we woke up in this country with regard to this Department and this industry. We are told here, year after year, that there are inexhaustible sources available for development in this direction but the result of all our activities, so far as the Department is concerned, is that the Parliamentary Secretary tells the Irish people that they are not fish eaters.  Everybody knows the reason why.  It is the utter cock-eyedness of the Department.  The Parliamentary Secretary is at the head of a Department producing an article of food and he tells us he has no machinery, or that he is not able to produce any machinery, for the distribution of that article of food to likely consumers.</P>
    <P>Did anybody ever hear of such a thing anywhere&mdash;an industry or a factory producing an article, throwing it in the stores and then saying that the customers for whom such articles were made would not either buy them or use them?  Was there ever a precedent for that?  I think that is the position in which the industry stands, that the Department say: &ldquo;We are interested in sea fishing and in catching fish, but we are not going to sell them because we shall not organise machinery for distribution that will bring them to the doors and the homes of the people for whom they were intended.&rdquo;  Is that not the cause of the deadlock? Look at the paltry production of this Department.  In 1952, there were 14,000,000 cwt. of wet fish to the value of £34,000,000 landed on the coast of England whilst there were approximately 500,000 cwt. of wet fish landed in this country.</P>
    <P>In that connection, we frequently hear references to the necessity for export markets to get dollars and foreign exchange and, secondly, year after year we are bewailing the fate of the population along the sea coasts in these poor areas.  In England, where there is scarcely a word ever heard about fisheries, they landed 14,000,000 cwt. of wet fish in 1952 to the value of £34,000,000, and the very areas from which they extracted those <Col N="135" /> fish are open to us.  Yet there is not a town in rural Ireland, practically no urban area, where any day in the week, even on Friday, these people who, we are told, will not, or do not eat fish, can secure a pound of fish for their dinner.  There is no doubt about that.  Nobody in this House or outside it can contradict that statement.</P>
    <P>I know this country as well as any other person living in it and I can say that that statement is quite true.  How does the Parliamentary Secretary expect people to buy an article if they cannot get it?  Where is the use of having a Department costing £112,000 odd to do a job round the coasts of Ireland that would be done anyway and that was done before the Department or the Parliamentary Secretary ever came into existence, when whole catches are thrown into lorries and dumped in Dublin where there is an excess of fish, to depress the markets there, and permit of any juggling that is necessary to get for those handling it the maximum price.  I am not going to deal with the means by which that is done as I have dealt with it before. We have known cases&mdash;I gave them here in this House and they were not contradicted&mdash;where a surplus of fish was sent out to sea and dumped when there should be some machinery by which it could be sent in lorries or vans to the poorer districts of this city and sold to the poor, say, at cost price. All the fish caught round the shores of Ireland is thrown into lorries at the quays where it is landed and sent to Dublin, and then the Parliamentary Secretary tells us that the Irish people do not eat fish.</P>
    <P>I have just spent six weeks in a very rural part of this country, in the townland in which I was born, and I never saw nor could I get as much as one herring in the six weeks.  It is a wonder that the Parliamentary Secretary does not look into what is done in other countries and see the ridiculous, futile position that this country occupies so far as this industry is concerned. I want to put an end to the reproach about our people not eating fish.  It cannot be got anywhere in the <Col N="136" /> rural parts of Ireland.  One of the greatest drawbacks for the people of rural Ireland is that they cannot get fish, although they would love to get it.</P>
    <P>Some 60 years ago I often saw a cartload of fish taken to one home to be cured.  Now a cartload of fish would not come into an entire parish in 12 months.  Probably I will be called a shoneen when I say that that was under a foreign Government.  There is a boundless field for development when we consider that one country alone extracted £34,000,000 out of the industry in 1952, while we caught a paltry 500,000 cwt. in the same period. Then we have a statement read by the Parliamentary Secretary, lasting half an hour, which contained nothing but book-keeping items, not a word about what he is going to do and how he is going to develop this industry.  If the Parliamentary Secretary comes forward with proposals to develop this industry, so far as I am concerned, and so far as I can influence the Party of which I am a member, he will get all the support and all the money he wants to do it.  But I want the job tackled. It will not be done by coming in here and reading a rigmarole of figures. That is not going to develop the resources which we have around our coasts.  It is not going to land or distribute fish.  The first thing is to get an Irish market and supply the Irish people.  There should be a way of doing that and not be sending lorries to various parts of the country, throwing the fish into them and dumping them in Dublin and leaving rural Ireland without any fish.  Even in the towns around the quays where the fish is landed you cannot get any fish.</P>
    <P>How is the fish to be distributed?  All those people engaged in the meat trade have insulated vans for sending meat from one part of the country to another.  Why should not the Department have such vans for distributing such a very perishable article as fish to the urban areas from which it could be distributed in small vans around the rural parts of the country?  You have to go into the business properly or get out of it.  You are pretending that you are in it now but you are not.  A hawker with a donkey and cart would <Col N="137" /> make a better job of it than the Department.  There is no use in deceiving ourselves.  We will never get anywhere by the present methods.</P>
    <P>Where is the foreign market that we had?  Was this House ever told what happened to it?  What became of the export trade we had?  Why was it lost? Were we ever told why it was lost? We were not told a word about it. Here we are like lobsters and crabs crawling around pretending we have a fishing industry and a Department of Fisheries.  To whom did we lose our export trade?  Who captured it from us?  What country has captured the export fish trade of the world?  A country not nearly so favourably situated as we are.  Holland has captured the entire world market not only for cured herrings but dried fish. She has captured the Polish market for salted herrings that we had practically exclusively at one time.  She has captured the entire cured fish trade in the Mediterranean countries and the export market to the United States.  Holland, with a very short coastline, has done all that and we here are blathering about the fishing industry while there are inexhaustible resources for development and nothing being done about them.</P>
    <P>We have spent millions of pounds on &ldquo;cod&rdquo; schemes in this country.  Then we talk about the flight from the land and the disappearance of the Gaeltacht while good employment could be given there if there was anything done about developing our fishing industry. I admit that, if this matter is to be approached in a proper way it will require a big, properly thought-out scheme with capital behind it.  A few years ago the inter-Party Government launched a £40,000,000 scheme for land rehabilitation which was to extend over a period of ten years.  How many millions of pounds went into the development of our sea resources?  We have now to fight for our markets.  We have to create a home market and develop it.  A sound advertising campaign would do that.  But we have lost the export trade and we have to fight against Holland to recapture these markets.  Surely that can be done with the <Col N="138" /> favourable geographical position which we occupy.</P>
    <P>Are we going to do anything about it?  Are we going to take off our coats, get down to the job and provide the capital and organisation that will do these things?  We should first start off by creating a substantial market that is capable of development and capable of providing the poorer people of this country with a cheap article of food which they want and like.  Surely this is an opportune time for such a thing having regard to the price of red meat?  Would we not confer a great benefit on the poor people of the country?  The price of red meat is such to-day that the poor cannot think of purchasing it.</P>
    <P>We have canned herrings from Norway, if you please.  Fifty years ago if you said there would be canned herrings from Norway people would think you were speaking Greek but it is polite language now.  If the Parliamentary Secretary attended a dinner there would probably be Norwegian sardines as <i>hors d'auvres</i> or, perhaps, the tail of a Norwegian herring.  In the Gaeltacht and the coastal areas of Ireland there is nothing but emigration.</P>
    <P>This criticism may sound severe.  It is not meant to be severe.  It is meant to be severely honest with ourselves and with the people for whom we could do something.  We gladly agreed to put huge sums of money into the land of Ireland, to rehabilitate it.  I think it would be an equally good investment to put money into the development of the fishing industry.  It is clear that the population of the world is out-racing the production of food. Therefore, even from the commercial point of view, I would submit to the House that it would be a good investment. It will be admitted by everybody in this country, particularly by those who come from the poorer counties, that the people are leaving the Gaeltacht and that here are areas from which the people will disappear completely within the next 50 years. Could we not make an effort to rehabilitate the fishing industry?  The means are there.  Other countries have utilised these means.  That approach <Col N="139" /> is open to us also and we have the same title to it without encroaching on anybody's rights.  It is only a question of getting the tools, starting work and getting the machinery behind the organisation to market the goods produced.</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary would make an imperishable name for himself were he to launch forth and begin, first of all, to capture and develop the home market.  It is there. It is ridiculous to ask the Irish people to buy fish that they never see to purchase. In that connection the Parliamentary Secretary should see that there is an average substantial flat rate fixed for the price of fish so that the housewife would know from week to week at approximately what price she could get a pound of a certain class of fish.  There should be an end to allegations of racketeering.  A pound of fish costs ? one day and the next it costs 4/6.  You are never going to develop anything by that sort of business.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that as soon as he proceeds on those lines&mdash;and he must proceed along those lines if he is going to do anything&mdash;he should get insulated vans and distribute this fish throughout the country in good condition.  Of course, there should be an end to the use of the square wooden boxes in the transport of fish.  There are plenty of aluminium boxes.  If such are not available they could be made to order.  They are easily washed.  In this way we would be assured that the fish would be delivered in perfect condition to the people in every corner of the country.  There is no use talking about buying or servicing boats or giving loans if they are only to get a lot of fish thrown on the market in Dublin. It is pure eye-wash and I would not waste time talking about it.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of items in the Book of Estimates about which I should like some information.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary give me some information in regard to sub-head G&mdash;Grant-in-Aid of administration and development of Sea Fisheries <Col N="140" /> Association; repayable advances to Sea Fisheries Association for boats and gear; and repayable advances to Sea Fisheries Association for general development?  Last year under this sub-head sums of £9,775, £15,000 and £23,750 were provided.  Sub-head F (5) deals with compensation under Sections 35 and 67 of the Fisheries Act, 1939 (No. 17 of 1939); for payments, including <i>ex gratia</i> grants, under the Freshwater Fisheries (Prohibition of Netting) Act, 1951 (No. 21 of 1951), and for miscellaneous expenses.  The amount is £48,000.  Were those <i>ex gratia</i> grants to people who had been fishing on the freshwater parts of rivers and who are now prohibited from fishing therein?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start on a somewhat more optimistic note that the previous speaker. First of all, I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the efforts he is making to develop the fishing industry in this country.  The past year has shown that we have been going in the right direction in so far as we have been able to record an increase of 16,000 cwt. in the amount of fish landed over the previous year. That may not be a remarkable increase but it is remarkable in so far as it is an increase of 16,000 cwt. and it is at least worth mentioning.  It shows that the efforts which the Parliamentary Secretary is making to revive an industry which was on the decline are meeting with a certain amount of success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="141" /> It is also, of course, a good thing to note that the amount secured for fish generally over the past year shows an upward trend on that received for the previous year.  Ever since I remember on this Estimate in this House, long before I was a member of the House, the same speeches were trotted out and the same criticisms levelled at the Parliamentary Secretary each year without any definite plans or suggestions being put forward as to how this national industry could be more fully developed.  Although midland Deputies do not take much interest in the fishing industry, they all agree that it is one of the most important industries in this country.  The previous speaker contented himself with general criticism and suggested, to use his own words, that a &ldquo;big thought-out scheme&rdquo; would have to be launched.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment envy the job which the Parliamentary Secretary has to do in order to develop the fishing industry.  His task is not by any means an easy one, as his predecessor in office, Deputy Dillon, has said on many an occasion.  I remember the words he used when speaking with regard to the fishing industry.  He said we were not a fish-eating people.  He elaborated on that by pointing out that many people, including himself, did not like fish at all.  I am afraid the statement then made by Deputy Dillon is very largely true.  That is not due, as the previous speaker has said, to the fact that the people do not get fish.  I am afraid that many look on Friday as being the only day on which we should eat fish. For that reason, the market is easily glutted.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the present Parliamentary Secretary is quite capable of dealing with that situation.  Perhaps he is the most suitable Parliamentary Secretary that has yet undertaken the job.  He is well aware of the difficulties which confront him in the task that he is now undertaking.  He knows of all the difficulties that surround the problem of developing the fishing industry; that, in order to develop the market and to make the country, if you like, fish-eating, there must be a guarantee of continuity of supplies. We must be able to give the people <Col N="142" /> fish regularly.  In order to do that, we must be able to land more fish.  If you are to get the fishermen to land more fish, you must be able to guarantee that there will be a market for it.</P>
    <P>Efforts are being made to overcome the vicious circle which seems to operate against the development of this industry.  There are difficulties to be met with.  I am satisfied that efforts are now being made in the right direction to overcome those difficulties.  The present Parliamentary Secretary is taking steps to ensure that, as far as possible, there will be a continuity in the supply of fish for the home market. One way of bringing about that situation is to have more cold storage facilities made available.  Therefore, if there was a glut of fish on the market, it could be put in cold storage and made available for the people at times when supplies were scarce.</P>
    <P>The fish meal industry can deal with surplus fish and thereby ensure that prices will not be allowed to drop to too low a level.  Smoking plants, and any kippering that can be done, will be a further means of dealing with supplies when supplies are plentiful. The Parliamentary Secretary, in his introductory statement to-night, indicated that steps on these lines are being taken.  In fact, such measures have been taken and a good deal of money is being earmarked for these purposes.  We have no doubt that measures of the kind will produce the desired results.</P>
    <P>It is important that the home market should be developed.  Statements of that kind have been made by Deputies as long as this Estimate has been coming before the house.  They have been advocating the distribution of fish to the provincial towns and suggesting that it would lead to an improvement in the industry.  We are all agreed that having a market centralised in Dublin is not the ideal thing&mdash;fish being brought from Killybegs through the midland towns to-night, sold on the Dublin market to-morrow morning and redistributed back to the provincial towns the following day.  We all agree that that adds to the cost to the consumer. It means that many people do <Col N="143" /> not succeed in getting a supply of fish at all.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made here that fish shops should be set up in the provincial towns by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and should get their supplies by means of a transport system operated from the various depôts which handle the fish.  That is not just quite as simple a matter as it may appear.  It may be quite easy for people who make sausages to distribute their supplies to the country and ensure regularity of supply.  They may be able to ensure weekly or daily supplies to the same shops so that customers will be able to have regular supplies.  I am afraid that, when dealing with fish supplies, the same regularity cannot always be guaranteed. The lorries owned by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara may go out one day with supplies to the provincial towns, but I am afraid cannot give a guarantee to the shops that they will be able to deliver supplies on the same day next week. Hence, there will be the difficulty of overcoming this question of irregularity in supplies.  In my opinion the only way of overcoming that is by ensuring that the necessary number of people are put into the fishing industry.  I think if that were done we would be able to ensure continuity of supplies and would be able to overcome this vicious circle which appears to confront us so far as this industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>It will be difficult to put more people into the industry unless you can assure them beforehand that it will be possible for them to secure boats capable of fishing in the deep waters. The Parliamentary Secretary is making a further attempt to overcome that difficulty which concerns this question of continuity of supplies.  An inshore fishing fleet may operate when circumstances are favourable and when shoals are plentiful, but we know that the weather conditions will often preclude them from going to sea at all, while on no occasion can they venture out into the deep.  By procuring a few of the larger boats the Parliamentary Secretary is attempting to bridge that gap by having boats which can go to sea in all weathers.  By that <Col N="144" /> means, continuity in supply can, to some extent, be ensured, thereby cutting out imports of fish to this country.  I think that is the reasonable, sensible way in which to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to see that a number of Deputies were prepared to criticise the action of the Parliamentary Secretary in his effort to procure boats and to enable him to bridge the gap to which I have referred.  I am hoping that success will attend his efforts.  It should eventually prove to be a boon to the inshore fishermen in so far as it will tend to develop a home market for our fish and to maintain continuity in supplies.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the primary interest which any Deputy from the sea coast must have in speaking on this Estimate is to exhort the Parliamentary Secretary to see that more people are employed in the industry at a profitable rate.  If we are to succeed in that we must, I think, improve considerably the facilities which we place at the disposal of those people so as to encourage them to engage in the industry.  I am afraid that the younger people of to-day are not prepared to go out to sea in the old type of inshore boats which were used by their fathers and grandfathers in pursuit of what was, and is, a dangerous and precarious livelihood.  They are not prepared to take the same risks&mdash;not in the same numbers certainly as those in the past did.  If they are to be induced to carry on the industry better boats must be provided and better landing facilities for those boats.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the 50-foot boat known as the half-decker which has become so popular and he pointed out that ten of these were delivered last year.  I am not surprised the number is not bigger although I would like to know the number of applications which were actually received for boats of this type. I am sure it would be nearer 1,000 than ten.  As Deputy McMenamin rightly pointed out the fishermen generally, both young and old, who are anxious to own such boats and who wish to take part in fishing in comfort and with greater hope for the future <Col N="145" /> have not the necessary deposits to put down in order to own one of these boats which An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are so generously placing at their disposal. Ten per cent. seems low but 10 per cent. of £6,000 is more than the average fisherman can get his hands on and very often it is only when a number of fishermen secure the deposit that is asked for that it is possible to have a boat brought into an area. Many of those who would be most anxious to have facilities of that type to enable them to carry on the fishing industry satisfactorily must remain without any such facilities until some other provision is made.</P>
    <P>I know perfectly well that those who in the past have supplied gear and boats to fishermen have had sorrowful enough experience in so far as many of the amounts are still outstanding. However, nowadays the organisation which is in charge of fishing is operating in entirely different circumstances from those in which the old Congested Districts Board operated in their day.</P>
    <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has in almost every worthwhile fishing port in Ireland an organisation of their own and through these agencies they are capable of knowing who is a worthwhile fisherman, who are the hard-working and honest fishermen and who are not.  Fishermen are like every other section of the community; they include every type of people.  It is wrong for any Deputy to say that they are a lot of angels; they are not, any more than any other section of the community, but these agents which the organisation of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara has in every worthwhile port in the country are quite capable of putting a finger on the men who are efficient at their work.  For that reason it should not be necessary to insist that these high deposits be adhered to. They should be enabled to issue boats to the various people in the district who, in their opinion, would be successful with them and make a decent livelihood for themselves and the crews.  Furthermore, not merely can they ascertain for themselves the people worthy of getting such boats but they could supervise the operation of the boats after they had been passed <Col N="146" /> over to the fishermen and by that means ensure that everything possible is being done to make the fullest use of the boats and to have the instalments paid up so that the fishermen will eventually come to own them in the shortest possible time.  Any good fisherman will be most anxious to work to the extent that he will in the shortest possible time become the owner of his craft.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the question of harbours which is agitating the minds of so many people interested in the fishing industry around the coast. Some time ago the Parliamentary Secretary made a very careful personal survey of the western coast from Donegal right around to Kerry and also of the eastern coast.  I think he would be the first to agree that many of those little landing-places, some of them constructed years ago by the old Congested Districts Board, may not have been properly placed in the first instance, but in any event are not now fit to serve the local needs.  The result is that many fishing villages are operating without any particular landing-place having been erected to meet their needs at all.</P>
    <P>I know a fishing village in Donegal where the boats are being landed on the beach as far back as I can remember without any slips, without any trace whatever of landing facilities. No doubt landing facilities might be available a mile or two further away but the fishermen know themselves where the most suitable place is to have their catches landed.  No matter what the marine engineer sent around the coast may say, the place habitually used is the place most suitable for providing landing facilities.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will ensure that a special drive is made towards the expenditure of more money on suitable places of this type. I do not expect he can have one constructed in every nook and creek around the coast where every person would like to have a landing place but he should at least ensure that no fishing village will be left without reasonably safe facilities which can be used by them in moderate weather.  As a rule the inshore fishermen who use <Col N="147" /> small craft do not put to sea in stormy weather and the facilities required are not usually of a very expensive type.</P>
    <P>I would like at this stage to congratulate another Minister who has assisted the industry, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who had been on many occasions prevailed on to have fish prices announced in the morning news.  Just before the Easter Recess this year I gave notice of a question asking the Minister if he would now consider having that done. I was pleased to note that when the Dáil reassembled after Easter, on the same day on which the question was answered, the news was first announced.  I would appeal at this stage to those concerned through the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the most accurate possible prices are given.  Sometimes prices announced are those prevailing in the early portion of the morning whereas later prices are sometimes not given; very often the later prices vary considerably from those prevailing early in the morning. I would like a good cross-section of the prices ruling to be given in each particular news bulletin.</P>
    <P>In regard to inland fisheries more attention should be paid to them, attention of the type which has been directed already towards some of our lakes in Donegal.</P>
    <P>We think that there is a certain potential wealth there which could be developed and which would be of considerable help to the tourist industry in a county such as ours, or in any county, for that matter. The few experiments which have been carried out with regard to lakes in the county have indicated that it would be well worth while developing further along those lines.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the significant increase in the amount of fish landed and to hope that that is the beginning of an upward trend.  If we have sufficient cold storage facilities and fish meal plants&mdash;a second one is now mooted&mdash;kippering stations, smoking stations, we can at least ensure that the market will not be as easily glutted as it has been in the past, and that <Col N="148" /> when supplies are plentiful the price will not drop to the ridiculous figure to which it drops at times.</P>
    <P>There is no Minister in any Government to whom so many suggestions are put forward as there are to the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of fisheries.  It is rather common to find in every fishing port of any significance a few know-all gentlemen who, while they do not fish themselves, can tell everyone else how it should be done, or should not be done, how prosperity can flow from it.  They spend their lives talking and telling everyone how the work should be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main person concerned in fishing is the fisherman, and our primary duty is to ensure that with less effort more people can engage in the fishing industry with a greater profit. There are more people engaged in it than the fishermen; there are various people indirectly connected with it, in distribution and in other ways, but those people who are primarily concerned are those who live on the coast and who have to go to sea to catch the fish.  While we can make various suggestions here as to how things should be done, the only thing we can do for the fisherman is to ensure that his lot is a better one and a more profitable one, that he has at his disposal a better boat and that it is more easily procurable and then that when the fish is landed there will be a market for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not an easy task.  It has been tackled by various people since we first got a native Government.  While it is not a simple task, if we are to get more people into the industry we must ensure by some means continuity in the supply of fish.  That can be done only by the means now being adopted by the present Parliamentary Secretary, of having more fish meal plant, more cold storage, more ice producing plant and more effort to ensure that when there is a glut the price will not drop to an uneconomic level.  By that means we can supply the market when fresh supplies are not being landed and so provide continuity, which is the only means by which we can succeed eventually in selling more fish in areas <Col N="149" /> where it is not now available.  It is only by regular supplies and continuity that we can achieve that.</P>
    <P>I think the people of Killybegs, where the fishing industry is the main industry, practically the only one, have a lot to be thankful for in so far as a good deal of money has been expended on the improvement of facilities there. The sum of £65,000 has been spent on the erection of one of the best harbours on our coast; £24,000 has been spent on the erection of a fish meal plant and on quick-freeze storing and a further £3,000 is to be expended to complete the work.  While many people will say that the present Parliamentary Secretary is not doing everything that he should do in order to assist these people, in all fairness to him and to the Government I say they are making an honest effort to put the fishing industry on its feet around our coast.  It is only with the loyal co-operation of every person genuinely interested in the industry that those efforts will eventually succeed and bear fruit to the extent that I hope every Deputy in this House would like they would.</P>

      <P>It was amusing to hear Deputy Brennan congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary and his Government on the work that was done for the fishing industry during the past 12 months.  He based his congratulation on the fact that an increased weight of fish had been landed, but he did not compare the weight landed during the present year with the weight landed in any previous calm year suitable for boats going to sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Estimate was remarkable for the absence of panic proposals and panic measures.  In fact, it showed a reduction of £99,000.  That shows the attitude of the Government towards the industry.  If they were interested in expanding it, as we have heard in the debate, they would not be reducing the expenditure by nearly £100,000 in this particular Department, while at the same time we have proposals for the expenditure of £5,000,000 on demolishing Dublin Castle and rebuilding it.  I heard Deputy Brennan say the industry was on the decline <Col N="150" /> until the present Parliamentary Secretary took over, but I think that if anyone ever did anything for this industry in the last 20 years it was Deputy Dillon&mdash;the same as he did for agriculture.  He at least created activity there and brought it to life. One great thing which he did was the preparation of the 1950 Fisheries Bill, which the present Parliamentary Secretary and his Fianna Fáil Government threw into the waste-paper basket as soon as they came into office and put in its place the present legislation.</P>
    <P>We can ask the inshore fishermen themselves and those others engaged in the industry whether the present legislation or the 1950 legislation would have been the more suitable to this country.  I heard during the debate that it is proposed this year to make £75,000 available for boats and gear for the inshore fishermen and that it is intended to provide a greater amount for deep sea trawlers.  When we compare the price of a boat for an inshore fisherman, in which several families will be involved, with the cost of a deep sea trawler, we can see that the present Government is not interested in putting proper gear into the hands of the inshore men.  Instead, they are going to spend a greater amount of money on a couple of trawlers.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another point. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the deep-sea trawlers.  There was a good deal of debate here last year when this matter arose.  It was contended by many that the inshore fishermen were going to suffer by the introduction of these deep-sea trawlers. We did not get a report, on this Estimate, of the work done by these trawlers.  We did not hear, for instance, from the Parliamentary Secretary whether these trawlers brought in a satisfactory quantity of fish in comparison with trawlers of similar make being used by other nations and in relation to the staff employed.  We did not hear from him whether they are able to make fish available more cheaply than the existing system.  We should at least have some kind of report available here concerning these <Col N="151" /> deep-sea trawlers which were regarded as an experiment and promised as a boon to the nation when this matter came up last year.  I think the public should be told what the results are from these trawlers and whether, in fact, the use of them is justified in relation to the quantity of fish they have brought ashore and in relation to the prices at which such fish could be sold.</P>
    <P>We have heard talk in this debate about the distribution of fish, and it has been said that the industry is really developing on these lines of distribution, but the first question I would ask is, how is it managed that we can distribute nearly £250,000 worth of imported fish?  Surely we could land those fish ourselves, treat and distribute them, just as imported fish is being distributed at the present time? It should not present any great difficulty. We imported, for instance, £126,000 worth of smoked fish last year.  Surely we could arrange to have a curing plant established here in order to provide smoked fish and send it through the same channels of distribution which this imported fish is going through?  Similarly, we heard from the Parliamentary Secretary that £99,000 worth of fresh fish was imported into this country and distributed. Surely the fresh fish landed at our own ports could be distributed just as easily as that imported fresh fish? The gap is there.  There is no use in saying that the market is being over-supplied. It is not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy not aware that imports are only allowed when home fish are not available on the home market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but what I am arguing is that this industry could be expanded rapidly with profit so that this demand could be met.  The gap is there, and as Deputy Brennan has mentioned, in order to fill that gap we imported nearly £100,000 worth of fresh fish and £126,000 worth of smoked fish.  That fish is coming into this country and being distributed along the lines where we could arrange to have our <Col N="152" /> own native fishermen distributing our own fish.  Take even the smoked fish &mdash;surely we could set up plants in this country to enable fish to be smoked. People have put forward the argument that smoked fish is chosen in the country because it keeps.  It is more satisfactory for the distributors and shopkeepers because they are certain they will not have the losses they might have in connection with fresh fish.  Realising that preference is there from the purely profit motives, we ought to set about setting up these curing plants or smoking centres which would enable us to treat fish and distribute it instead of importing it.  There is a very small quantity of fish being smoked and cured in this country but I feel we could easily make finance available in connection with this Estimate for the purpose of having such smoking and curing centres available.</P>
      <P>Reference is often made here to the fact that foreign vessels come inside our territorial limits and rob from the sea bed much of the fish which our own men ought to be allowed to catch and to the fact that we should have a better system of guarding our territorial waters and preserving them for our inshore fishermen.  Many different types of suggestions have been made but I believe that the development of the radio telephone and radar would perhaps be the best one in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently, according to this Estimate, it is intended to proceed with the activity of ice-making for the purpose of preserving fish at the larger centres and, in addition, at many of the smaller centres which are fed only by the inshore boats.  That is a welcome development.  It will probably result in greater quantities of fresh fish in good condition being made available to the public.  It was not mentioned where this ice-making plant is going to be established, but I would like to suggest that it be established down the country.  We very often refer to decentralisation when this question of establishing industries arises, and I think when there is a new development, especially a development of this nature, that we ought, if at all possible, locate it outside the most <Col N="153" /> populous areas such as Dublin City. From the wording of the Estimate I was inclined to conclude that it is in fact proposed to have this ice-making plant around Dublin, and I hope that if initial plans are not made that arrangements will be made instead to have that ice-making plant set up down the country in order to distribute our employment and prevent emigration.</P>
    <P>I believe that the inshore fishermen are disappointed with the manner in which the present system of fish marketing is being operated.  Even this year we have had examples of the inshore fishermen being obliged to dump a large quantity of fish probably because alternative arrangements did not exist for disposing of that fish and making use of it.  The result is that the time of these men was wasted and their families did not get the profit that should be expected from the normal activity of fishing by these inshore boats.  I believe that we should face the problem here in a progressive way. We should realise that this being an island country, if we do equip our men with proper boats and gear they will be able to provide at least the full requirements of our own people.  I believe we can proceed on that basis, and we should make a proper effort to bring about that position as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin adverted to the fact that Holland, a country with a very short coast line, has succeeded in capturing the world fish markets. We are an island country surrounded by fertile fishing waters yet we have been unable, indeed we have not made any attempt, to supply our own needs. I am not satisfied with the work done during the past year in this particular sphere of our economy; if sufficient money is invested in this industry we will reap a lucrative return.  Money has been made available for panic relief schemes.  Here we have a reduction of nearly £100,000 in an industry where the return for money invested would be a good one and in which productive employment could be provided for our people.</P>
    <P>One problem in connection with the marketing of fish is the dumping of fish by foreign trawlers.  Large quantities <Col N="154" /> of dumped fish disorganise the entire market.  There is no method of dealing with such fish either by curing it or treating it and it is thrown on the ordinary domestic market at a time when our inshore fishermen are providing the full requirements of that market.  That dumping of fish is a most pernicious practice and the Department should take steps to put an end to it.  Our inshore fishermen are not getting a fair deal from the present Government.  They are a most important section of the fishing industry but they are not treated as such.  We have an example of that in the fact that more money is being made available this year for the purchase of deep sea trawlers than is being made available for the purchase of boats and gear for the thousands of inshore fishermen around our coasts.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to make some attempt next year to provide the necessary capital to put the inshore fishing industry on a proper basis.  If sufficient finance is made available we must reach the situation eventually wherein we will be able to provide our full requirements on the home market and at the same time a livelihood for many of our people. Those of our people who have a long tradition of fishing behind them would be prepared to engage in this industry provided they are adequately financed and properly equipped.  At the moment it is difficult for some of them to compete even with their own neighbours who have better boats and more up-to-date equipment.  We should continue the policy implemented by the inter-Party Government of providing boats for our inshore fishermen as quickly as possible.  An efficient inshore fleet will bring a better return than will all the deep-sea trawlers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate, on last year's Estimate and probably on many others before that the emphasis has been on problems.  Different speakers have adverted to this problem, that problem and the other problem.  I believe there is only one problem; that is, the putting into the fishing industry of sufficient capital. That is all that is needed.  Large sums <Col N="155" /> of money have been expended on the development of other industries.  That cannot be said of the fishing industry despite the fact that it is one of our most important industries since the raw material lies all around our own coast.  We have the skilled personnel, we have the markets.  We have the prospect of an export market.  All these should enable us to build up a first-class fishing industry.  All that is required is the necessary capital.</P>
      <P>Lack of capital is the primary problem. The other problems mentioned are of a minor nature.  They are problems that will solve themselves once we start putting money into the industry. If facilities were made available many of our young men would be prepared to engage in the fishing industry. We must make available to these young men the best equipment that is available and put at their disposal the most scientific and modern methods of building up a first-class fishing industry.  Agricultural methods have changed considerably over the past 20 years.  Farmers to-day are availing of all that science can offer them and all that the Department of Agriculture is putting at their disposal by way of services, instructions and advice. Similar facilities must be put at the disposal of our fishermen.  Better boats and better landing facilities must be made available.  It may be said that there are already slips in existence but the young people of to-day are not satisfied with the second best particularly when they are aware of the improvements that have been made in other industries.  If the obsolete methods of 20 years ago still obtained in agriculture the young people to-day would not take up agriculture as a career.  The same is true of fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The young people of to-day cannot be expected to adopt the methods used by their fathers and it is not fair to ask them to do it.  That is what we are asking them to do if we keep trucking with this question in the present manner.  The sums of money allotted every year are not sufficient and would not be sufficient if multiplied a hundred times.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="156" /> to get his hands on a couple of million pounds and to use it in building piers, supplying boats and gear and organising classes where young fishermen would receive instruction in modern methods.  That would solve many of the other problems which have been mooted.</P>
    <P>I know there are problems of marketing.  Once we get a regular all year round supply of fish, those problems will disappear.  They exist because the supply of fish is irregular and, naturally, the markets must be irregular.  The housewife who grumbles that one week she can get fish and the next week she cannot get it has a grievance but it is not the fault of the marketing system; it is the fault of the landing system.  It is because our fishing fleets are not sufficiently modern and not enough money is available to improve and to perfect the methods used.</P>
    <P>I agree also that more money should be spent on the erection of canning factories and storage facilities. Canning and cold storage of fish will not be undertaken by private enterprise; it is too big.  It is something that the Government or the Department should tackle.</P>
    <P>Another important point is the establishment in technical schools of classes where various methods of cooking fish could be studied.  In that way the dislike people may have of fish would disappear.  If people are served with fish cooked in only one way week in and week out, it becomes distasteful to them.  Modern methods of cooking should be taught in technical schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney has mentioned the hardy annual which crops up on every debate of this kind, the encroachment on our fishing grounds by foreign trawlers.  Talk will not keep them away.  It is true that much damage is done to the fishing beds by foreign trawlers.  In some of the small fishing centres along the coast the older people say that the fish are not there. That is only a half-truth.  It is true to the extent that the dragnets used by foreign trawlers injure the fishing beds and the spawning beds.  Very severe measures should be taken to <Col N="157" /> preserve the three-mile limit.  It is only three miles so far.  Steps should be taken to prevent foreign trawlers from encroaching on that territory.  If they do encroach, steps should be taken to see that they will not get away with a £5 fine, because five minutes fishing would pay off the fine.</P>
    <P>While I am on the question of trawlers I would point out that the Northern coast of Donegal is neglected as far as control is concerned.  It is not altogether neglected but the geographical situation is such that breaches of the regulations by foreign trawlers occur every day of the week and very little is done about it.</P>
    <P>I have a complaint to make in that respect.  Recently a patrol vessel, the <i>Cliona,</i> visited the port of Glengad. No trawlers were in sight.  In an interview with a paper which circulates in this country one of the officers is reported to have said that the fishermen of that port must be lazy because he saw neither foreign trawlers nor fishermen.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if he has seen that report and if any action has been taken.  The Parliamentary Secretary, who has visited Glengad, knows well that the fishermen there are up against many difficulties from the sea and from the landing place. They hope and expect that the landing facilities will be improved very soon. I can asure the House that the allegation in that report is not true.  It so happens that at that particular season any fishing done there is done at night.  It is most unfortunate that such a report should have been issued as coming from an officer of our patrol boats.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Brennan, I am glad to see that attention is being paid to the development of inland fishing, the improvement of lake and river fishing, for the reason that such fishing is an attraction to tourists and to a type of tourist who will spend money in this country.  Fishing tourists, as a class, should be encouraged to come here. The development of our trout rivers and lakes, and salmon rivers and lakes will attract increasing numbers of such tourists.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary's account of the <Col N="158" /> year's work is encouraging, and it is encouraging to note that a keen effort is being put into all facets of the fishing industry, but more than effort is required, and I would again stress that money, and more money, is required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the last speaker has mentioned, capital is essential. We all appreciate that.  While there are a few points on this Estimate, I think it is only right that we should concentrate on the fact that, first of all, we are at this disadvantage, that the Parliamentary Secretary, in his introductory speech on this very important Estimate, naturally laid stress on the period of time that is nearly 12 months out of date, so that now the figures given to us are for the year 1952, and it is rather awkward for us when we consider we are now practically at the end of 1953.  But even so, as other speakers mentioned, I think it is very important for us to question the whole policy regarding fishing in this country, when we have to bear in mind the fact that in the year 1952 we had to import, between fresh and smoked fish, a total of £225,000, or £250,000.  That does justify some speakers in this House who, year after year, irrespective of what Party may be in Government, express criticism of the policy regarding fisheries in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe at the outset that we are again entitled to say that as long as the very important branch of fisheries is only a sort of a godchild of another Department then it just means that it is going to continue to be treated as something of an inferior quality as against some of the other branches of industry in this country.  Speakers have concentrated, perhaps, on either the question of the inshore fishermen or the question of imports of fish.  I believe that if we are going to approach this very important subject as we should we must take into consideration the fact that we cannot be prepared to adopt an approach which is going to be sectional in one respect.  We cannot be prepared to say we are completely for the policy which is going to guarantee to the inshore fishermen all that he requires himself.  On the other hand, we cannot say that we must <Col N="159" /> adopt a policy which is going to cut out the inshore fishermen.  As long as we have to admit that we in this small country, this island, have to continuously import fish, then it means that we must be prepared first of all to introduce a system whereby the consumer is going to be in a position of being able to buy fish at reasonable prices, which is very important to the housewife, and at the same time we must also take into consideration and be prepared to secure in the system of fishing that we want to introduce in this country not a form of seasonal employment for inshore fishermen but a form of employment which could and should give them a guaranteed form of employment at what is vitally important to them, a guaranteed wage.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to agriculture, but we all know that even in that great industry the problem of profit for the producer and guaranteed wages and guaranteed employment for the workers were of vital importance.  In so far as can be compatible with the overall outlook that we must be prepared to accept regarding fishing, we must be prepared to see not only that the inshore fisherman is protected but also that the consumer is going to be provided with the supplies required.  I believe that while it has been said in this House this evening that demand is not as high in this country for fish as it could and should be, the demand would be trebled if prices were comparable with the amount of money available to the people who are in a position at times to buy fish but not at the exorbitant prices demanded.</P>
    <P>Because of that, I know that the view of the Labour Party is such that if we are to make a success of this very important branch dealing with fisheries we must first of all be prepared to say that a Minister must be in charge of this important industry, and that in that industry we must be prepared to go so far even as to set up a State or a semi-State organisation which within its fold will give representation to the fishermen and also representation to the consumer. I honestly believe myself that it is useless for us to set up any kind of board <Col N="160" />&mdash;we had the old board that was in operation for so many years and the new board that is roughly 12 months operating&mdash;whether the name is in Irish or in English, unless alone we have an organisation such that within its fold are included the various interests connected with the fishing industry.  It is not a matter of the capital we may make available for fishing, because I believe we would be starting at the wrong end even in providing that capital unless the organisation is a worthwhile one. Otherwise, fishing cannot prosper.</P>
    <P>Let us at the outset, for instance, realise the position of the inshore fisherman as some of us, at any rate, know in the maritime areas around the South and South-West coasts. Nobody can say that he meets fishermen who are, leaving out the word wealthy, even having a fair income. We know that their vocation in life is of necessity most hard and strenuous on them.  We know that they are exposed to elements of nature that other sections of the community know little or nothing about, but we also know that because of the lack of supplies coming to hand many periods of the year are such that the fisherman is very often in some areas actually in the position of looking for home assistance.  The alternative to that is quite obvious to everyone to see, and members from the maritime areas are fully conversant with the facts.  They know that the younger men are turning their backs on the old vocation.</P>
    <P>They are either entering into the services of other countries in such capacity or else looking for work in a different type of employment completely. Nobody can deny the fact that we have the men, because of their high traditions for generations before them.  We have the men who undoubtedly can meet the demand for any amount of employment we may offer if conditions are made suitable for them, and the only view that I can see worth expressing is that in order to make conditions available which will give guaranteed employment at a fair, decent, Christian standard of living to the inshore fishermen <Col N="161" /> is a system of State or semi-State organisation.</P>
    <P>We also realise, as we must realise, that the present position tends to encourage a system whereby supplies will never meet demand.  We are all human, and we must be prepared to accept the views of those people in the industry in so far as their difficulty all the years back was that if supplies ever got up to demand their worry would be prices.  We have had many occasions to note, unfortunately, where inshore fishermen after a period of fishing coming back with a good catch were then at the mercy of others who, because of their knowledge of market prices or otherwise, had the possibility of offering to fishermen prices which were completely unsatisfactory. Because of that tendency we were faced with the problem of the inshore fishermen never being anxious to put on the market sufficient quantities of fish to meet the general demand that could be available.</P>
    <P>Again, in connection with the demand for fish, I believe we are entitled to draw attention to the great possibilities in inland areas where fish is practically unknown except on a very, very odd Friday of a few weeks in the year.  Coupled with that, I should also like to draw attention to what I believe is true, and that is, that, in institutions controlled by State Departments themselves and controlled by local authorities, no encouragement has ever been offered to utilise or to buy up on the markets supplies of fish.  How can we ask the housewife to buy fish at a price which she may consider she cannot reach when, at the same time, not only are we not advising but we are not insisting on local authorities and State Departments adopting a system whereby more fish can be bought?  If such were the case, imports might have to be of a higher nature.  Should that happen, then, in itself, it would give us more justification to demand a system or organisation which would meet the vast majority of the demand for fish in our country.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has mentioned in his speech the importance <Col N="162" /> of trout fishing.  We have read in the newspapers about the possibility of encouraging tourists to visit this country for fishing, be it trout, salmon or coarse fishing.  That is admirable, to a point.  Before we come to the stage of saying that this country is a sportman's or a fisherman's paradise, we must be prepared to say that, first of all, we will put our own house in order, not for the visiting fisherman but for the housewives of this country, and particularly for the men who are depending on this great industry for a living.  Unfortunately, as far as I can see, we have never come to the point of even striking out on that very important project regarding fisheries.</P>
    <P>As an ordinary member of this House, I do not know the views of the Department regarding fisheries.  My own honest opinion is that, in this very important fisheries branch, we have officials and experts who can advise and in their own way help any Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and in my opinion we should have a Minister for Fisheries.  Unless, however, a Minister gets the backing of his Government and is able to put before the public and before this House a policy whereby we can strike out on a real system of guaranteed wages and prices, and also a guaranteed supply for consumers, it is a waste of time.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that from what I can see on this Estimate&mdash;irrespective of whether we have sufficient capital or not&mdash;we seem to be content to leave fishing in the hands of what we might term &ldquo;private enterprise&rdquo;.  Even though we may have set up boards, the policy gives me the impression that it is nothing other than as if a few private individuals set up an organisation of their own, independent of Government, and tried to provide for themselves an adequate profit from fishing.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have mentioned the problem of the three-mile-limit.  On different occasions, Deputies have put down questions inquiring about the possibility of the extension of the three-mile-limit.  When I heard the Parliamentary Secretary speak this afternoon, I hoped that we were at last making some progress in regard <Col N="163" /> to this problem.  If other countries can insist on increasing the three-mile-limit for their fishing, then, if we are sincere and genuine about trying to get a policy of improved fishing rights in this country, we should claim, as other countries have done internationally, an extension of the three-mile-limit.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies also mentioned the necessity for utilising aircraft and corvettes in this matter of the three-mile-limit. Last year and the year previous to that, and even in years when the inter-Party Government was in office, I remember saying, as I say now&mdash;and I believe and I know that the members of the Labour Party hold the same view&mdash;that it would be good if we could utilise the services of those employed in our naval service to help to protect our fishing industry.  We cannot believe that we must have these services&mdash;independent of fisheries&mdash;for no purpose other than war or protection against war.  I say good luck to our young men who are joining our naval service.  I have encouraged young men in my area to join that service.  Knowing the type of young men entering this service, I believe that they could be utilised greatly to the benefit of this small State by helping and co-operating more fully with our own fishermen. Undoubtedly, the problem is to keep foreign trawlers outside the three-mile-limit. We all know that problem. It has not happened overnight.  It did not arise in the past few years: it has been there down through the years. If we have a stronger way of dealing with these foreign trawlers than expecting the unfortunate inshore fisherman to do something about it, then I believe we should succeed much more quickly if we put it into operation.  Very often the poor unfortunate inshore fisherman is expected to get a catch in a boat so unseaworthy that people in inland areas could have no conception of the difficulties he has to face.  I am not speaking now of the boats that people are lucky enough to get from the Department.  We must not forget, however, that many other fishermen are striving to make a living <Col N="164" /> under conditions which are totally unsatisfactory, and in my opinion it is inhuman to expect these men to continue under those conditions.  Let us, then, give them the co-operation of our naval service.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as a result of our present policy, young men who undoubtedly would be an asset to the country and who, under the Constitution of this State are entitled to a living in their own country&mdash;and that living is there for them if only we are prepared to put into operation a scheme in connection with fisheries that will give them the employment they seek&mdash;are forced to emigrate.  If we refuse to give them employment here, why should we question these men who leave their own country?  In the Kinsale and other noted areas connected with the fishing industry&mdash;noted not just for the past few years but for centuries&mdash;I know that things have reached a situation whereby a young man turns his back on his own country rather than go into this industry from which he knows he will get no return.</P>
    <P>These men have in the past been at the mercy of people who at times took advantage of them in buying their catches, and they have also been in the position of having to return empty-handed from the fishing grounds.  These people leaving the country are a loss to the State and their departure is a loss for the people in the inland areas who are crying out for fish supplies.  I do not believe that, as some Deputies said, we are not a fish-eating people. I believe that the reason why fish is not consumed in greater quantities is, first, that the price is prohibitive in many instances and, secondly, that there is a failure to provide a proper marketing system whereby people will be assured of supplies.</P>
    <P>In many of these inland areas, while the people never got the habit of using fresh fish, in many a home, there could be seen a supply of what was commonly known as stock fish, and at present even the price of that commodity is such that the people cannot buy what they are anxious to buy.  If prices are such that the people are unable to buy, I believe it is the result of the failure of State policy in relation to putting on the market supplies of fish which undoubtedly <Col N="165" /> could and would be bought if they were made available at fair prices.</P>
    <P>I appreciate fully what the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to do in relation to this important industry, but I believe that his hands, like the hands of any Parliamentary Secretary dealing with it, are bound to be tied while the industry is not regarded as it should be.  Are we to admit that while other countries can make this important industry prosper, we are satisfied, not alone to let it remain stagnant but, through the neglect of Government policy, irrespective of what Government may be in office, to be retarded?  Nobody can deny that, being worried as we are about emigration, we can provide employment in maritime areas for the young men who are leaving the country, but we cannot provide it under the present policy regarding fisheries.  If we are prepared to adopt a policy of breaking completely with the past, a policy of forgetting the vested interests of any one section, a policy designed to safeguard the rights of those employed in the industry, to give them a guaranteed wage and the guaranteed employment which we can give them, and designed, at the same time, to assist the people in their demand for greater fish supplies, then, and then only, will we put fishing in the position to which it is entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to some points made by Deputy Brennan and Deputy Cunningham with reference to harbours and piers.  I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to urge on the Special Employment Schemes Office, through Deputy Beegan, the Parliamentary Secretary, to assist us in County Kerry in this regard.  As a member of the county council, I put forward a proposal with regard to slipways and piers&mdash;small, simple works&mdash;and asked for a grant from the Special Employment Schemes Office for the purpose.  There was the usual condition that, unless the county council were prepared to contribute 25 per cent. of the cost and maintenance, there was nothing doing.  The county council agreed to the 25 per <Col N="166" /> cent. contribution, but would not agree with regard to maintenance, and I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to ask the other Department concerned if they could see their way to forgo that stipulation, because in many instances these piers and slipways were never the property of the county council. That is so in this particular instance.</P>
      <P>One of these slipways is at Cromane and the other near Dooks.  They are very essential to the fishermen down there because there is nothing but boulders and rocks on one side and there is no place where they can tie up their boats.  In one case, the slipway cost only £1,100 to construct and the other is a similar construction further down.  The county council are prepared to accept the conditions laid down by the Board of Works, with the exception of the condition in regard to maintenance.  If the piers or slipways were ever the property of the county council, or if it could be shown that they were the property of the county council, they would naturally agree with regard to maintenance, but there is no such record.  In some cases the Board of Works owns some of the piers throughout the country and, in others, the local authority is the owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary once again to try to place the shellfish industry in Cromane on a proper footing.  I know that he did his utmost in the past in regard to it, but, through no fault of his or his Department, the development of that industry was slowed up.  The local people thought they could do it best themselves and could market the shellfish, but it was a failure.  Lack of proper equipment, freight charges and so on operated against them and now the saving of the industry is thrown back again on the Department.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary again to have the matter thoroughly investigated with a view to the maintenance of the industry on behalf of the people concerned. It would be a pity if, after all the trouble and all the expenditure over the years and the losses incurred by the Department in regard to its development, it were to be allowed to go by the board.  I have had discussions <Col N="167" /> with the fishermen concerned and I believe, if the Department step in, these fishermen will co-operate in finding a way out of the many difficulties which up to now have prevented its proper development.</P>
    <P>I see in the Book of Estimates provision for Grants-in-Aid of hatcheries and so on and I should like to make representations again with regard to a hatchery we have in County Kerry, operated by a voluntary organisation in the Killarney district. I understand that the Department did give a grant but it was not sufficient.</P>
    <P>Perhaps on this occassion it could be supplemented and an increased grant given.  With regard to the development of piers generally, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have the question examined in regard to the whole coastline in South Kerry.  Apart altogether from the two proposals that I have mentioned at Cromane and Dooks, we have other small slipways and harbours on the south coast and on a few occasions proposals were turned down because of this maintenance question.  If a serious effort is to be made to develop fisheries and to assist fishermen, I think these legal points and this shifting of responsibility from one Department to another or from the local authority to the Department should be waived, if we are to make any headway.  I am confident that the Parliamentary Secretary will make every effort to assist us as he has done in the past.  He visited Kerry on two occasions and we on behalf of the people are very grateful to him.  I think that this new drive now will have very beneficial results in the future.  The most urgent matter in regard to assisting the fisherman at the moment in these districts is to give the facilities I have indicated and to make whatever representations the Parliamentary Secretary can to the other Department to waive these conditions which the county council believe should not be imposed on them.  I wish to state finally that I hope that before many weeks have passed the Department will send someone down to Cromane to have this question of the shellfish <Col N="168" /> and mussel industry examined again and a proper arrangement come to as between the Department and the fishermen concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a time when people referred to the fishing industry as being second only in importance to agriculture.  Without attaching any blame to the present Parliamentary Secretary or to his predecessor or the Ministers previously in charge of this Department I think that at the present time we can scarcely refer to fishing in this country as an industry at all.  Wherever the difficulty arises, in spite of everything that has been done for the industry it seems not to make any progress.  In fact, if anything there has been retrogression so that we have come to the position that our young people are no longer desirous of taking up fishing as a livelihood.  It is necessary, of course, as a first inducement to them, that they should be fully equipped with proper boats and gear, with boats of a type which would enable them to carry on their calling at all periods of the year and at various stations around the coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the introduction of these four German trawlers by the Department of Fisheries has brought about any improvement, because so far as we know there is still a shortage of fish supplies in the various towns and villages throughout the State.  Something must be done to induce men to enter the fishing industry.  They surely cannot be expected to do so unless they feel that the prospects are bright and that they will be able to eke out a decent livelihood in following that calling.  Something must be wrong with the system of the distribution of fish. The methods adopted at present are, I think, rather primitive.  So far as I know, when fish is landed in various places throughout the country, somebody will purchase a certain amount of it at the pier or landing stage, throw it into a lorry and take it along 30, 40 or 50 miles, even on a warm summer's day, to market it in some town or village.  It is very hard to expect people to purchase fish distributed in that way.  If, as has been said, we as a nation do not like fish, it is quite possible that that is due to <Col N="169" /> the primitive system of distribution. The entirely wrong system of marketing fish may be responsible because of all foodstuffs fish must certainly be delivered and sold to the consumer as early as possible.  You cannot expect people to buy stale fish.</P>
    <P>The days of the old fish &ldquo;jolters&rdquo; should be gone for ever.  In this progressive age new and up-to-date methods should be adopted and when fish are landed at the piers, some provision should be made either by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, or whatever marketing or distributing company is in charge, to have it sent off at once in what I think Deputy McMenamin described as insulated vans, or sent by train properly iced or kept in some type of refrigerator so that it will reach its destination in a perfectly fresh condition. I think that these insulated vans would afford a means of distributing fish to inland areas, more conveniently than sending fish by train.  Until such time as fishermen can have their fish distributed and marketed in an up-to-date manner they can scarcely be expected to put their heart and soul into their work.  It has happened at various times when fishermen have landed their catches that no provision has been made for taking the fish to distant areas.  In such a case it has to be dumped back into the sea.  So many endeavours of various kinds have been made in connection with the fishing industry that I think the time has come when there should be a full inquiry into the whole question to find out what exactly is wrong that the progress we expected has not been made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham suggested that there might be an improvement if more money were put into the industry. It is quite possible that money will be required, but there is no use in putting money into the industry unless it is certain that that money will be spent to the best advantage.  Even if the proper type of boat and the best possible type of gear are placed at the disposal of fishermen, it may not always follow that they will make a success of their job.  We all know that if there are fishermen fishing with a certain type of boat and other fishermen fishing with another boat with the <Col N="170" /> same type of equipment, one group may make a success of the job and the other may not.  We may assume, therefore, that, as in other callings, in one case the fishermen may be regarded as highly efficient in the carrying out of their work and in the other case the fishermen are careless or not properly trained in the work they are required to do.</P>
    <P>If in the vocational schools which are now established, even along the western seaboard, young men were taught the proper method of using up-to-date equipment for the fishing industry, how to preserve and repair the gear, and how to use their boats to the best advantage, it would be a help to the fishing industry by enabling them to have bigger catches.  Full and proper provision, however, would have to be made for the distribution of fish to all parts of the country.  This method of sending fish to Dublin from various parts of the country and then sending it out again seems to be very expensive.  Whoever contrived that system of distribution and marketing must know nothing at all about the distribution of foodstuffs.  As I stated, the fish should be placed on the consumers' table in as fresh a condition as when it left the sea.</P>
    <P>With regard to the use of the deep-sea trawlers, inshore fishermen and other people hold that you cannot carry on the two methods side by side. I think that it should be either one or the other.  In fact, I do not think it was advisable for the Government to undertake that type of fishing with these deep-sea trawlers.  They are certainly in competition with the inshore fishermen.  I do not know the exact system by which fishing is carried on in England, but Deputy McMenamin has stated that last year it brought in an income of £34,000,000, and I do not think they have any Minister of Fisheries in England or even a Parliamentary Secretary in charge.  When we think of that vast income from the fishing industry and throw our minds back to 1937 and 1938, when our total income from the export of agricultural produce from this country was only £39,000,000, surely it is time, if we are to make a success of our fishing industry, <Col N="171" /> that something should be done about it.  There is no use in Deputies talking here year after year and bringing forward much the same suggestions. In fact they become boring at times.  Surely we have fishing experts in our Department as good as in any other country.  As we have not been successful up to the present with this industry, it is time for the whole position to be further examined to see what can be done with the money available or any further moneys which may be made available so that this important industry will be made a success.</P>
    <P>The fishermen in the Portmagee area, who mostly use small boats, complain that when they bring fish to Portmagee, where there is now a good pier, they must continue on for a further distance of 13 or 14 miles to Valentia Harbour and through the estuary or firth, right up to Cahirciveen. It is very hard on the fishermen after spending a night fishing that they cannot land their catches at their own local pier and that provision is not being made for them so that the catches would be transported in an up-to-date manner to the various markets.  The position is that there is a refrigerating station in Cahirciveen and the fish is stored there and despatched by train the following morning.  In such a case fishermen like that should not be asked to undergo the further tedious task of delivering their fish 14 miles away from their own pier.  Then, again, there is in the Valentia-Cahirciveen area, at Renard Point, an old pier of a most primitive type which, from the very start, was entirely unsuitable for the landing of fish.  Four or five years ago efforts were made to improve the pier and engineers were sent down from the Board of Works.  Plans were drawn up and an estimate was made of the cost then.  I think it was £64,000.  Promises were made and fishermen were assured that work would be commenced in the very near future.  That is five years ago and nothing has been done.</P>

      <P>I hope not.  After all, if we have good fishermen, good boats, good gear and good catches, surely we should bring the piers and the landing stages up to date, no matter what they might cost?</P>
      <P>Again, fishermen complain of the poaching carried on by foreign trawlers.  In fact, some of them attach more blame to this poaching at times when they have no catch.  I do not know how true that is but certainly there is poaching by foreign trawlers and the inshore fishermen suffer because of that.  I think it was Deputy Desmond who stated that we should extend our territorial waters.  I do not see how we could protect an extension of our territorial waters since we cannot protect the territorial waters at present within the three-mile limit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the methods of protection are not suitable.  The corvettes are not suitable for protection.  First of all, I understand that the engines must be running and heated for 100 hours before they can move at all.  Even then they are not fast enough to overtake the foreign trawlers, which are certainly speedier than the corvettes.  Some other method should be adopted by way of protection.  In fact, I think if the crews of those 50 ft. boats in the different areas were armed they could, in addition to carrying out their ordinary work, come upon the foreign trawlers unawares.  That might act as a deterrent to foreign trawlers coming within our territorial waters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fishermen in the Cahirciveen-Ballinskelligs area have frequently requested the Department to have the old look-out post equipped and manned as a means of protection against foreign trawlers and as a protection in the case of any accident that might occur to the fishing fleet when it is out at sea.  I believe this is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but if the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of fisheries would make representations and at least request that the position be examined, the fishermen would feel sure that everything possible was being done for <Col N="173" /> their protection.  They would feel sure that as far as possible full provision was made for their protection and that of our territorial waters.  They would be assured that in case of an accident the men on the look-out post would arrange that rescue crews would be sent to them as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>A great many things urged during this debate have, in fact, already been done or have been begun.  Equally, there are a great many things for which I have been blamed and which, in fact, I have not done.  I take it that a debate on fisheries is more prone to inaccuracies of that sort than possibly a debate on most other Estimates because, when the debate is finally analysed, we find we are all at one about what should be done and about the difficulties of doing it.  That, in any event, is the interpretation which I put on the speeches I have listened to.</P>
      <P>I think, however, that Deputy Blowick might have been a little more careful when he alleged that I had let down the West coast very badly. Deputy Blowick is a Mayo Deputy and was a Minister in the last Government and must be aware of the information that I am now going to give him.  I am sure he knows the Achill Islands and I am sure he also knows a place called Keel which has a harbour that is commonly known as Purteen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure he also knows that some very enterprising local people in that <Col N="174" /> particular place undertook the development of the shark fishing industry some years ago.  I am sure he further knows that the harbour facilities at Purteen which is used in connection with this new industry are very unsuitable and require considerable improvement.  I am sure he knows too that general fishing is also carried on from that particular port of Purteen for generations.  I feel sure that he could, as a Deputy for Mayo and also as a Minister of a Government, have recommended the expenditure of a considerable sum of money on the development of that particular harbour.  It is a very strange thing that when his Government was asked for the modest sum of £4,000 to carry out certain improvements in that place for the purposes which I have now outlined they could not see their way to find that sum. Will it not sound still more strange in his ears to learn that since we came into office we found £20,000 without half the delay?  I think that answers the question that we have let down the West.</P>
    <P>Nearly all the speakers dealt with practically the same topics and if I do not single out the Deputies individually in my replies I hope they will not take it that I am in any way ignoring their viewpoints.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again.</P>
