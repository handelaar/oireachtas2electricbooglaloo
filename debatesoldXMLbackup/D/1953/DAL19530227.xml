      <P>I move amendment No. 19:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 21, Section 20, between lines 11 and 12, to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  officers who have retired on pension from the permanent Defence Forces and who on retirement are appointed as officers of the Reserve Defence Force in the rank held by them on such retirement or in any higher rank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> This amendment is designed to provide that officers of the permanent Defence Forces who retire will be eligible for appointment as officers of the Reserve Defence Forces in the rank they held on retirement or in any higher rank.  At the moment, officers who retire from the Defence Forces on pension are entitled to receive their pensions but they are not obliged to continue to serve in the Defence Forces of the State.  We have the position that a young man of perhaps 45, with 25 years' service and experience, retires on pension.  That man has no obligations to serve the State any longer.  In this amendment I propose that those officers would be commissioned in the Reserve in the rank they held on retirement or in any other higher rank, and that their service and experience would be available to the State until they reached an age at which they would no longer be capable of serving in the Defence Forces.  We have had practical experience of that type of Reserve officer.  In the 'twenties and 'thirties, officers who retired from the Regular Defence Forces were appointed to the Reserve of officers in the substantive rank they held on retirement.  These men were, in fact, the vital machinery of the Reserve Forces at the time of the emergency.  The State had the great advantage that those experienced officers who were then called up on the Reserve during the emergency fitted into vital administrative posts.  They were, in fact, even more than the Regular Army at the time, responsible for the efficient organisation and training of the forces that were recruited and called up during that emergency period.  I think the Minister and the senior officers of the Army have paid tribute time after time to the wonderful and most valuable contribution those particular officers made to the State in that period of the emergency.</P>
    <P>Since the emergency ended, we find that the old practice of commissioning those officers in the Reserve has been departed from, and as I see it their valuable service is lost to the State. I think that the fault lies in the Defence Force Regulations which deal <Col N="1964" /> with age.  The same age limit was laid down for the Reserve as that laid down for the Defence Forces.  That was shortly after the emergency ended. That age limit was laid down because of a feeling that they had all over the world, that soldiering was a job for the younger fellows, and that when a man reached the age of 45 he was unfit to soldier anywhere.  It is a strange thing that this was the conception not only here but in countries like Britain and America.  However, the Americans got rid of it very quickly.  They got back to the idea of availing of the services of experienced men.  They found that under the new methods of warfare where men are carried in vehicles from one point to another, it was not necessary to have the same standard of physical fitness based on youth as they used to have when the normal thing was for a soldier to march from place to place.</P>
    <P>While, as I say, Britain and America got away very quickly from that conception &mdash; they had held on to it for a little while &mdash; we have held on to it, and the result is that those experienced officers in the 40's or the early 50's who are obliged to retire are cut adrift entirely from the Defence Forces.  In the event of an emergency tomorrow or in the future, they would have to offer their services as volunteers and be called up perhaps in the rank of private for a start or in whatever rank the Minister might decide to call them up in.  Obviously, the calling up of the men in those circumstances would lead to a considerable amount of confusion, whereas if they were commissioned, and were already selected for vital administrative appointments, they could fit into those appointments right away, and the emergency Army could be built around them.  We will have, and we must have of necessity in this State, a small permanent force or standing Army as it is called.  The efficiency of the Reserve will depend on the machinery that is there when it is called up to see that it fits properly into the Army administrative machine.</P>
    <P>I do not want to specify the particular appointments where experience will be valuable, such as quartermasters, <Col N="1965" /> camp commandants, provost officers, etc.  There is a whole list of them that one could mention, but there is no necessity to do so.  What I am anxious to see is that we will not continue the system which we have at the moment of cutting these experienced men adrift from the Defence Forces when they retire from the permanent force.  Those men who retire from the permanent force retire with a pension, and if they are to be commissioned in the Reserve, then, obviously, they would receive Reserve pay and it, added to the pension they had, would help them considerably to make ends meet.  Therefore, it would be of value to the officers themselves if they were commissiond in the Reserve, but it would be of greater value to the State.</P>
    <P>I think that this is an important matter.  I think it is right, certainly up to the age of 65 or longer if you like, that any person who is in receipt of a pension for service in the permanent forces of this State should be available and at call in the event of this State being faced with an emergency. If he is not available and at call, then, to a large extent, the value of the services that he could contribute are being lost from the national point of view.  Therefore, I think this is an amendment which should be accepted and I ask the House to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>While not necessarily committing myself to the form of the amendment which Deputy Cowan has tabled in this particular instance, in its general tenor I do very strongly agree with him on this question of retired officers in the Regular Forces or, for that matter, if some arrangement could be made about it for officers of the Reserve who cease to become active.  It particularly applies, of course, to officers of the Regular Forces.  From a common-sense point of view, the arguments for this seem to me unanswerable.  All that I can think of is that the Department will say: &ldquo;This kind of thing was not done before and we cannot chance doing it.&rdquo;  It is an example, I suppose, of how red tape ties up things of this nature, and possibly will tie them up again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1966" /> Let us see this from a common-sense point of view.  You have an officer or a number of officers.  They retire at varying ages &mdash; it will depend on their rank &mdash; before they reach the age of 60. They had served in peace-time.  They would be more valuable still if they had had war-time service.  But during their peace-time service they have acquired an intimate knowledge of the machine.  They know every bit of it. They know all the details which are necessary for its smooth administration, as well as for fitting themselves into whatever task is allotted to them. They have been constantly in touch with the machine, and even if they did nothing more than that &mdash; to be merely in touch with it &mdash; it means that their minds have been kept tuned up to the way the Army is thinking in regard to combat and administrative matters. Therefore, if they are any good at all, they have been kept right up to date.</P>
    <P>May I make this digression?  You can train a man professionally in any profession.  He can secure the highest qualifications at his examinations or in professional proficiency at a certain stage, but if he does not continue to keep in touch with his profession and to practise it, he will be at a serious disadvantages compared with the man who continues in touch with it.  The same kind of thing applies in regard to an army.  It is the same kind of idea as to why, say, in research or anything else in the university, the contacts of people who are interested in the same things are of importance &mdash; the exchange of ideas and so forth.</P>
    <P>It leads one to this: No matter how good a man is and how well trained he is, if he has been away completely for a number of years and you take him back, or if he has never had contact and you train him quickly as far as you can to the pitch of proficiency required, he will always remain at a disadvantage to the person who has been in continuous touch over a number of years. That is to a certain extent a digression.</P>
    <P>The point in the net is that the officer who has been there over the period as a regular officer has, not only the professional competency, but the habit of mind, if I may call it that, that general experience, that continuing knowledge <Col N="1967" /> and that intimate association and knowledge of the machine that make him familiar with every nut and bolt in it, so to speak.  Why not continue the services of that man up to the end of his usefulness, if there is a place that somebody corresponding to him will have to fill some day?  That regular officer will be useful, certainly up to 60.  Why not use him?  Looking through the debates, I see that the Minister said that you could very easily call him back.  That is an answer given to us in Committee, is it not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>To some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer to that is that, if you are going to be in that position, why not ensure maximum efficiency by keeping him in touch and making the calling back simpler and more effective?  That man will be all the more efficient by being kept. Common sense seems to demand that, if we are to have a reserve at all and if there are officers who are trained, regular officers of the highest category and experience that you can get, going out at an age that will still leave them below, say, 60 or even a little more, and available for those jobs to which I will refer more specifically in a moment, the obvious thing is to provide in the interim period after their retirement from whole time regular service the necessary contact with the machine to keep them in touch so that the first hand contact that they enjoyed at the moment of leaving will not be lost.  That seems to be a desirable thing and, of course, the most reasonable way of doing that is to fit them into some category in the Reserve.</P>
      <P>So far, the argument is based on the assumption that these officers would be needed and that there would be a place for them when it would come to mobilisation or some such time.  I feel fairly confident that they would be, both from our experience in the past and from the experience of other organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, in one sense, the circumstances were somewhat different because the type of officer to whom Deputy Cowan referred were officers <Col N="1968" /> who retired at a fairly early age and were therefore still in a relatively low age group when they were mobilised. Even so, let us look at it this way: In 1939, when the Defence Forces were mobilised, it was very surprising to find how many officers of the Reserve, whether young like some of us or old like some others, found themselves in administrative positions.  That applied particularly in 1940 when the expansion came.  If it had not been for that pool of officers who were able to fit into these positions as well as the Reserve officers and N.C.O.s who were able to take over competent positions, the attempt to mobilise an emergency army in 1940 would have collapsed.</P>
    <P>I have already instanced the case in Eastern Command, where the officer commanding the regimental depot&mdash; that was the training depot for the whole of the Eastern Command &mdash; his successive adjutants, at one period, two out of three of the company, the commandants, including the officer commanding the advance training company &mdash; that was the company that was in charge of training N.C.O.s, and, later, potential officers, specialists, and so forth&mdash;all these happened to be Reserve officers, and when it came to mobilisation in 1940 some of these officers in the young category were wanted for outside jobs, for duty with columns, and it was a question of looking around to know where to get some of the older type of officers to fit into these posts, and they were available, from the old type of reservists of which Deputy Cowan talks.</P>
    <P>Of the Eastern Command, I can talk with personal knowledge.  Take the records officer.  The whole administration of records in that command was immediately and most conveniently filled by an old Reserve officer of the type of which Deputy Cowan talks. A number of these officers were beyond what you might call their field usefulness.</P>
    <P>I am afraid there is a bit of confusion here between the general usefulness of an officer and his services as a field-commander, jumping over ditches and all that.  There is a certain amount of confusion arising in this matters because, admittedly, a number of these <Col N="1969" /> officers were certainly gone beyond the day when they would take a five-foot gate at one jump, but they were, on the other hand, more competent to handle the routine administration, to fit into the machine, to deal with Army forms, to look after stores and to get into the scheme of Army accountancy, which is a peculiar thing on its own, incidentally, and a certain amount of previous experience is desirable before you take it over.  These people fitted in there very usefully.</P>
    <P>I can visualise the same kind of thing happening in future.  Certainly, on paper and on the way we are facing up to defence as we have been, it is very clear that &mdash; Dia idir sinn agus an olc &mdash; if anything happens it will be a big, bad scramble.  We will have a certain number of regular troops that, if we come up against the hard fact of the matter, will be in any event insufficient. We have a completely deficient Reserve.  There is no use blinking our eyes to the facts.  These are the hard facts of the situation.  As to our F.C.A., Second Line Reserve, we have not quite made up our minds as to what its rôle is and, even as it is, it cannot be considered as completely organised or completely equipped.  In that situation we can look forward to another 1940 at some stage or another, from the point of view of mobilisation, of facing up to the task when the thing comes upon us.  If that happens, I can see a lot of the old troubles developing again &mdash; taking over new posts, expanding units, having to cater for training while you are trying to mobilise and organise, that is, if you get the time, as we did on the last occasion, trying to get in, at the same time, training of leaders for new units, and so forth.</P>
    <P>All that will lead to a somewhat similar type of picture to what we had before &mdash; a scramble, looking for people for administrative posts and not having enough trained people or people with the necessary knowledge and experience to fill all the posts.  You will want the more active and particularly the regular types for primary combat jobs and staff jobs.  You do not want to be wasting your best Reserve <Col N="1970" /> officers in administrative posts There will be quartermasters and adjutants and so on to be found.  The ideal place to find them would be from a number of officers even up to the age of 65 &mdash; I will go as far as that in some cases.  I know that some of them would be quite active and good enough up to that age for some of these administrative jobs, depot commandants and posts of that sort.  Then, even on the training side, there will be people to be trained and courses to be run and, again, for the planning and administration of these courses some of these well-trained officers would be very valuable.</P>
    <P>That is no radical idea for this country.  I have one case in mind and I will give chapter and verse to anybody who wants it.  There was the case of a man who joined the British army as a private before the 1914-18. War and rose from the ranks during that war to be a regular officer.  He joined as a regular private in 1913, or some time like that.  Having served in all capacities, officer, N.C.O., and private, during the 1914 war in that army, he went out some time after the war as a reserve officer until 1939.  He was mobilised again and eventually was in charge of a training establishment, actively organising and training troops for all types of work.  You can look at the age factor in that for yourself.  He joined as a private in 1912 or 1913.  You can look at the experience and the history there for yourself.  He was available for the job.  The net point is that he was used in that army and used effectively with all his experience behind him.</P>
    <P>I do not see why we cannot have the same kind of approach in this case.  I know a number of ex-regular officers who went out after their period of service on pension.  I could rattle off a list of names of officers who went out after their period of regular service and who, if we had them on the Reserve, would be extremely valuable. If I mentioned some of these officers, the mention of the list would be enough to prove the case.  Passing through my mind is the case of some of the technical corps as well as the general service and the infantry.</P>
    <P>It seems to me then that there is an <Col N="1971" /> unanswerable case for making some provision for keeping these regular officers available; not only keeping them available, but keeping them in touch, keeping up their professional interest, and, reciprocally, keeping them in contact with developments, not only locally, but so far as these are known to our Defence Forces as a whole.  That is important from the point of view of keeping them in touch with the organisation of the machine, so that if they have to come into that machine as an adjutant, a quartermaster, a training officer or anything else, they will know precisely what the situation is.</P>
    <P>The next question is how would you do it?  Some of us put up a suggestion already as to how it can be done.  For instance, it can be done in this way. When a man retires from active service, instead of his going out with complete freedom and merely a pension attached, he would be liable to be recalled.  I think it is more or less the situation in other countries &mdash; that he would be liable to recall.  Then you can go to sub-divisions in this sense. If a man went out, say, at 45, he would have another ten or 15 years of useful service there before him.  You could place him in a special category of the Reserve, the retired category, and treat him as a Reserve officer by paying the additional emoluments that go with activity on the Reserve in addition to his pension.  He will have that, so to speak, augmentation of his pension. It is not really a pension, because he will be coming up for training. These terms can be modified and some suitable arrangement of that kind can be made.  He is kept in touch. He comes up every year for a certain amount of training and is treated as a Reserve officer accordingly.  Then, at the expiration of a particular time, when he comes to the age of 55 or 60 or something like that, he simply becomes a Reserve officer as he is at present.  It should be perfectly easy to work out a scheme somewhat on these lines.</P>
    <P>Somebody may say: &ldquo;What about the existing Reserve officers; are you going to force them to do this under their contract?&rdquo; The answer to that <Col N="1972" /> is that you can leave it voluntary for these officers at the change over period.  If you leave it voluntary on the basis I have suggested, namely, that a man would have the option, I think the problem would to some extent solve itself.</P>
    <P>Whereas, in regard to this amendment, some of the details may not be completely <i>ad idem</i> with the principle of this, by trying to make some provision for keeping these men available you will have their services immediately available when they are kept there with that point in view during the interim period.  The general idea we have tried to put forward should be knocked into some kind of workable form, instead of allowing an officer to go out and forget all about it, which is, I think, a waste.</P>

      <P>I promised the Special Committee that I would have this question examined.  It has been examined and is actually being discussed at present.  Both Deputy Cowan and Deputy de Valera have made a case for the non-acceptance of this amendment by reason of the fact that they have outlined in detail the excellent services rendered by officers of this type, officers who had retired under the age limit and who, when a situation of emergency arose, were called up and appointed to various posts.  These appointments were generally to administrative posts, because, when all is said and done, emergency service, which is to a very large extent equivalent to active service, requires comparatively young men to operate in the field.  The retiring ages run from 50 for a captain to 63 for a major-general. I think the age limits are reasonable.  One must remember that a captain at 50 years of age is a man who will be expected to lead his unit into the thickest of the fray.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>He could, or he could be in some office where he might be doing nothing but writing notes and so on just as easily.  Generally speaking officers of the rank of captain are in the main company captains who are expected to be very active men.  A commandant is likewise expected to be a very active man.  Deputy de Valera and Deputy Cowan have given us examples from their own experience of the type of man who has been called back in an emergency and used in the capacity or category to which they have referred.  Deputy de Valera referred to the desirability of keeping these men in touch.  How can one keep a captain of 50 years of age in touch with the active work of a captain in the field?  One must remember that at 50 years of age the man has retired and may not be called back for another ten years.  At 60 years of age he could not be expected to go back into the field and lead a unit in active service even if he kept in touch during the whole ten years.  Neither could any of the other people whose ages range from 50 to 63.</P>
      <P>I have said that the Army authorities are examining this matter at my request.  May I remind Deputies that Section 21, sub-section (2) (a) provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may by regulations constitute such and so many classes of officers of the Reserve Defence Force as he thinks fit and assign to any class so constituted such title as he thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That gives the Minister the power the Deputy is seeking and it was under a regulation such as that that we were able during the emergency to call up all these officers, utilise them and avail of their services &mdash; and I agree they were very valuable &mdash; to the utmost.  Furthermore, they went long beyond the retiring age since we were able to retain them under the Emergency Regulations.  If the necessity arises for doing that again I have no doubt that any Minister would put all the younger and more active men into active service and avail of the services of these men <Col N="1974" /> in the administrative posts left vacant. If the Deputies examine that particular section they will see that the Minister will have the necessary power to do what Deputy Cowan suggests should be done in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister is not accepting the amendment. I do not think it is necessary to dwell at length upon the amendment. Deputy Cowan suggests that the Reserve should be established by right for officers retiring from the permanent force and that any officer who is fit could apply for admission to it.  The Minister's line is that he will select the people.  That is the difference between us in a nutshell.  The Minister may like the colour of one man's hair and tell him that he is commissioned and will be retained on the Reserve.  He may not like the colour of another man's hair and he will say: &ldquo;Out you go.&rdquo; That is what sub-section (2) (a) of Section 21 means.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan, in his amendment, wants to give every man the right, if he is physically fit, of becoming a member of the Reserve.  The Minister says that a captain of 50 years of age cannot be expected to lead men into action.  Such a captain can lead them in all right, and experience has shown that the man of 50 leading a company will give better service than a man of 25 or 30, for the simple reason that the older man is not so inclined to run away.  He will either stand and fight or get &mdash; one or the other.  We want to strike an even balance.  We want a fairly aged company commander with young fellows under him to give him the necessary gyp, as it were.</P>
      <P>The matter depends on the administrative action the Minister takes.  If the Minister automatically puts a physically fit man on the Reserve, that will be all right.  We are enacting now a permanent measure, and I think the Minister should reconsider this matter and accept the amendment.  It will not make very much difference, anyway.  If a man is fit he will go on the Reserve by right instead of by ministerial selection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Selection is not so hot.  There may be animosities.  There may be a desire to get a man out at any cost.  That <Col N="1975" /> does not help towards the loyalty and goodwill that should exist in an army when people know they are protected up to the limits of their ability.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has been wrongly advised in regard to the sub-section which he has mentioned.  At the moment there is an age limit for the permanent forces. There is the same age limit for the Reserve.  Therefore, if an officer retires at 45 or 50 from the permanent force he cannot be appointed to the Reserve because the same age limit obtains there.  That is where the difficulty arises.  I am surprised when the Minister says he asked the Army to examine this, and that they are considering it at the moment, because on 13th March, 1952, we made an even stronger case in the Special Committee than has been made here to-day, and we were assured then by the Minister that this matter would be examined. That is almost a year ago. A matter of that kind could very readily be decided within that period. I know the Minister is advised to say that a captain of 50 leaving a company is perhaps too old for that, but that cannot possibly be the advice of military men.  Military men realise how important the administrative end of an army is.  It does not matter how good your fighters are; if you have not the administrative machine the Army cannot function.  I think it was Napoleon who said that an army marches on its stomach; the most important part of the Army then is the machinery by which the troops are fed and equipped.  If one looks at an army and at the services that are necessary to maintain even a small force in the field, one realises that, while captain rank originally was captain in command of a company, it is a military rank in the military hierarchy, and that the captain fulfills many important functions other than leading a company.</P>

      <P>For instance, you could take the training point the Minister mentioned.  Actually they have been employed during peace-time <Col N="1976" /> and there has been plenty for them to do, assistant adjutant, assistant quartermaster in regimental units and so on.

      <P>That is why I say the Minister has not been advised by the military men in regard to this.  I had better be plain about my difficulties in regard to this Bill.  We put a considerable amount of work into this Bill.  Sometimes I have met military officers and I have said: &ldquo;What are you doing about this Bill?&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;We never heard about it. We read a bit in the newspapers but we have never seen anything else about it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those of us who have had some practical experience of how the Army is run, know that you just cannot have this Defence Forces Bill based entirely on the advice of the civilian side of the Department of Defence.  Some men in the civilian side of the Department of Defence may have the conception that in an army a captain is to lead his company on to the field.  That is not the military conception.  That is one of the functions of a captain.  In fact, we find that company commanders in most countries have a rank higher than captain.  The American and British armies have company commanders ranking as major.  We have company commanders here who are commandants, and rightly so.  However, an appointment is one thing and a rank is another.  I am wondering whether we can get anywhere with this Defence Bill at all.</P>

For years I have looked forward to the time when I would be able to contribute something towards improving the Defence Forces Act and I find now I am in the position of helping to pass an Act that will bear more severely on the officers and soldiers in the Army than the present old Defence Forces Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  With respect, Sir, I do not intend to stray.  I am talking about the matter we are dealing with at the moment.  This particular section has been under discussion for a year and apparently they have not made up their mind as to whether my amendment is a good amendment or not.  Three Deputies who have spoken here with experience of the actual operation of the Defence Forces advise that something like this could be done.  I would agree with Deputy Major de Valera that perhaps my wording is not the best wording.  I agree with his view that what we want is a liability to recall in the case of a permanent officer who is out on pension.  That is why my second amendment about commissioning in the Reserve was submitted so that those men would be brought along yearly or once in every two years or whenever it is considered necessary to get a refresher course.  For instance, there are new methods of accountancy.  The young fellow is not worried about accountancy.  The young officer always tried to get away from quartermastering or accountancy.  In my young days he would not touch it with a 40-foot pole but as one gets on one finds that there is a good lot to be said for what the Minister describes as the funk-hole officers, the man who keeps the machine moving, who is there at all times, who is not like the young fellow anxious to be out having a dance, a drink or a fling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Strange as it may seem, the regulations are the most important matter in the running of an army.  As regards young officers who are commissioned in the military college after a very thorough course, it takes them many years before they have half the knowledge that the older officer has built up over a long period.  Like Deputy de Valera I think it is a scandalous thing that we should have this deliberate waste, the loss of the <Col N="1978" /> services of officers who are fully competent and fully qualified.</P>
      <P>In opening, I made the case, as did Deputy Major de Valera, who followed me, for the old Reserve officers who are part of the Reserve and who were called up to serve in the emergency. They were the men who trained the Army, looked after the equipment and built up the emergency Army.  The Minister has not referred to them.  He has referred to men with experience who were brought in and commissioned during the emergency.  They were a different class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>And it took them some time to find out what had happened in between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>They had to be trained and their capacity had to be studied.  They were generally commissioned as 2nd lieutenants; gradually they worked their way up but it took a good while for them to reach the rank of captain; whereas, if they were in the Reserve, their ability would have been discovered in the meantime and in the time of emergency they would have fitted properly into the rôle.</P>
      <P>What we are trying to do is to ensure that a person who is on pension at, say, 50 years of age, will be liable to recall until he reaches an age when it is reasonable to assume he will not be able to render efficient service any longer unless he is a Von Manstein or somebody like that.  I do not want to tie the Minister down to the actual words in the amendment but I want him to agree to the principle that officers retiring will remain liable for service, that they will be placed on the Reserve, that they will be called up and that they will get the training that will keep them in touch with military developments.  I think the amount involved would be a very small sum for the State to pay to retain the efficient service of these men.  If the Minister will agree to accept the principle, I do not mind who prepares the wording.  All I ask the Minister to do is to accept the principle of the case that has been made by Deputies.</P>

      <P>In page 25 to delete Section 27 (1), lines 3 to 5, and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may establish a military college and so many other institutions as he thinks necessary for the training and instruction of members of the Defence Forces and of students therefor.</P>
      <P>We had in the old Act a provision for a military college and, of course, provision for institutions.  The Bill says in Section 27 (1):&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may establish such and so many institutions as he thinks fit for the training and instruction of members of the Defence Forces.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I propose to amend that section by deleting the sub-section and substituting for it the words set out in the amendment.  There are two points in the amendment.  I first of all want to retain the statutory position of the Military College.  The Military College has been in existence for many years. Most of the officers in the Army have graduated through the college either as cadets or through courses in the college subsequent to receiving their commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that under the wording of the section the Minister would be able to establish by regulation an institution which we will call a military college, but the section, as worded, marks a break with tradition for which I do not see any necessity.  I think it should be made very clear that we should have a military college and, as I say, so many other institutions as the Minister may think necessary.  I provide additionally that there shall be institutions for the training of students for the Defence Forces, that is, for young boys who are not members of <Col N="1981" /> the Defence Forces.  It may be desirable in future to have institutions where the sons of Army personnel would be trained to become eventually soldiers.  I go a little further than the Minister by making provision for the training of students and I want to see retained in the statute the title of Military College.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to accept the amendment subject to the deletion of the words &ldquo;and of students therefor&rdquo;.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it absolutely necessary to prohibit ourselves by legislation or, by implication in existing legislation, from accepting outside students in the Military College?  It has been customary in other countries to allow military colleges to be availed of by external students.  I am not suggesting that we should do that here but it might be highly desirable in certain circumstances that some people who are not actually members of the Defence Forces should do a course in one of our military colleges.  I have not looked into the matter from a legal point of view but, as I say, it might be highly desirable in certain circumstances for some people to do a military course.  Frankly, I think it would be a good thing if certain civilian members of the Department of Defence were obliged to do a military course and if, <i>vice versa</i>, some of our staff officers were required to have a knowledge of Civil Service routine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would make for somewhat more harmonious working.  Aside from that point, there might be actual circumstances in which it would be desirable that some person who was not a member of the Defence Forces should be allowed to attend a course in a military college.  Remember this is enabling something to be done, not saying that something must be done. If somebody suggested that we should insert a clause providing that the Minister must allow a number of <Col N="1982" /> civilians to go there, clearly I would say: &ldquo;Delete it,&rdquo; but this is enabling legislation and I can see circumstances where it might be desirable to use a facility of this nature.  In that case, I do not know whether the insertion of the words suggested by Deputy Cowan is not, in fact, desirable.  I do not think the words &ldquo;and students therefor&rdquo; are actually apt words.  I would suggest something like this: &ldquo;for the training and instruction of members of the Defence Forces&rdquo; and then I would delete the words &ldquo;and of students therefor,&rdquo; and further add &ldquo;and such other persons as the Minister for Defence in his discretion may nominate.&rdquo; Something like that would leave it completely at the discretion of the Minister.</P>

The Minister may think it is not serious and he may take it as being not serious if he wants to, but I am not going to do that.  I think that the acceptance by the Minister of the amendment with the deletion of the words &ldquo;students therefor&rdquo; is satisfactory to me.  I am satisfied with that so long as the Military College end is retained.</P>

      <P>I am also glad that the Minister has agreed to retain the statutory establishment because I think the Military College has undoubtedly made its name.  I hope it will be there many hundreds of years from now not only with members of the Defence Forces in it but with students from other countries coming over to get training there.</P>
      <P>I think the rest of my amendment has been misread.  The amendment now reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister may establish a military college and so many other institutions as he thinks necessary for the training and instruction of members of the Defence Forces and of students therefor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What I visualised there was that students for the Defence Forces would be sent to the Military College.  I agree with what has been generally said that the Military College is a place for training members of the Defence Forces and for training members of the military forces of other countries who will come here on some exchange basis.  I do not think there will be any trouble about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1984" /> Under &ldquo;these other institutions&rdquo; the Minister might set up a school in which the sons of serving soldiers and officers, boys from 14 years of age up, and, perhaps, the orphan children of soldiers would be trained.  When they reach the age of 18 they will themselves, I am sure, be very desirous of joining the Defence Forces.  That is what I had in mind.  As Deputy Major de Valera said, the incorporation of the word &ldquo;students&rdquo; does not in any way weaken the section nor does it in any way compel the Minister to set up such a training place.  It was not in connection with the Military College but in connection with the other institutions. There are all kinds of schools that the Minister will establish under this, corps schools and other different schools, but I had in mind, perhaps, that in the future there might be this idea of training the orphan sons of soldiers to be soldiers in the future.</P>

    <P>(g)  the procedure to govern the hearing of appeals by the appeal board againsts the decision of the examiner or examiners.</P>
    <P>This is a sort of technical amendment. Section 27 (2) sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister may make regulations in relation to all or any of the following matters:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the staff of institutions established under this section,</P>
    <P>(b)  the persons to be admitted to such institutions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is those I had in mind in connection with the sons of soldiers.  The section goes on to enumerate:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;&ldquo;&nbsp;(c) the curricula of such institutions,</P>
    <P>(d)  the duration and description of the courses of instruction and training in such institutions,</P>
    <P>(e)  the examinations to be held in such institutions,</P>
    <P>(f)  the management, control and good government of such institutions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I altered this slightly.  I say that:</P>

    <P>(a)  the staff,</P>

    <P>(f)  the appointment of examiners and of an appeal board,</P>
    <P>(g)  the procedure to govern the hearing of appeals by the appeal board against the decision of the examiner or examiners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposal in relation to the standards to be attempted is a new one.  Where you have a military college, the appointment of examiners is a matter which should be governed by regulations, and if a person is dissatisfied with the ruling of the examiners he should have the right of appeal to an appeal board established by the Minister.  I think that is reasonable. A young man who goes into the college and remains there for a couple of years is in line in the ordinary way to be commissioned.  He may find that he is marked wrongly, as he considers, on some particular paper.  A decision on that might affect his whole career. It may decide whether he is to be in the Army or not.</P>
    <P>I think there ought to be a right of appeal to an appeal board established by the Minister.  I think that is a matter of ordinary justice and that there should be no objection to the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Minister can get rid of it in that fashion.  The idea of an appeal board certainly influences me because <Col N="1987" /> sometimes marking can be unduly harsh and it could affect a young man's whole career.  I think that the Minister cannot just cast the amendment aside with just a few words about safeguards and saying the matter is already fully covered.  I would suggest that he examine the matter in greater detail. The amendment is doing something that is wise.  It states what the subjects are that will be governed by regulation. I think it is no harm at all to have these headings inserted.  We would know, the Army, the cadets and everybody else would know what procedure would be followed in the appointment of the staff and the examiners.  A student or a number of students might ask for an examination of papers which they sent in or they could be interviewed by the board subsequently to see if they were likely to become officers.  I think the Minister should consider the matter carefully before rejecting it in an offhand manner.</P>

In military colleges they are dealing with young men of 20 years of age, men who have reached the use of reason and may come to the conclusion that they have been dealt with unfairly in some examination paper, either in the way it was set or in the way it was marked.  Examiners in the military sphere, in any country, may set questions which could reasonably be considered unfair.  This is a matter of justice.  The only difference between the Minister's section and mine, apart from construction, is that I provide an appeal board and procedure to govern appeals against the decision of the examiners.  I think it is just that that should be done and I cannot see why there should be any objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has been reached because Deputy Murphy and his colleagues failed to propose and speak to the motions standing in their names.  It asks that a commission be set up to inquire into the whole question of rating and rateable valuations, and that, pending the report of that commission, a stay be put upon the process of increasing existing valuations.  That proposal is put seriously before the House because there is a widespread feeling throughout the country, in city, town and rural areas, that the present system of poor law valuation contains many anomalies and inflicts many hardships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting for one moment that this problem is capable of easy solution.  It is a complex and difficult problem, just as every problem relating to the assessment and imposition of taxation is a complex problem.  It is always difficult to ascertain accurately what is the best and fairest means of distributing the burden over all the sections of the community and, personally, I feel that it is right and proper that taxation, in the main, should be divided into two classifications or that there should be two types of taxation &mdash; indirect taxation based on the outlay of the individual, the manner in which he spends his money, and direct taxation, which is a direct impost measured according to income.  There might be some to say that all taxation should be indirect, that that is the easier way to spread the burden on the community.  I do not <Col N="1991" /> share that view.  I think it is no harm to have a certain amount of the revenues of both the central and local authorities collected by means of a direct levy, proportionate so far as possible to the income of the individual citizen.  If we accept these general principles, we will admit that direct taxation is necessary and an essential part of the general code of taxation.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of direct taxation, we have local rates and income-tax. Income-tax is based mainly upon the income of the citizen and rates are levied on the amount of property, the valuation of the property, owned by the citizen.  In this motion, we are dealing with the matter of property valuation for the purpose of taxation. It must be remembered that the rateable valuation of property affects not only the citizen's contribution to local authorities but also his contribution to the provision of public lighting and of lighting to his own home, together with such other charges as those in relation to water supply and so on.</P>
    <P>Valuation also affects the licence duty in respect of licensed premises, so that the amount of valuation assessed upon a citizen's property has a very material affect on the burden he has to bear.  If we accept that there are anomalies and injustices in the present system of rateable valuation, we must accept the view that this motion is justifiable and that it is at least desirable to inquire into the whole system with a view to designing some measure of reform.</P>
    <P>It may be asked in what way do anomalies arise.  In the main, they arise because of the fact that rateable valuations are based on a very old statute, a statute of 1852, over 100 years ago, which provides that valuation shall be based on the annual value of the citizen's property, whether land or buildings.  I think it is generally referred to as the letting value of the property.</P>
    <P>We all know that conditions have changed very materially during the past century.  A system of valuation which might have been efficient and <Col N="1992" /> just 100 years ago would have to be very well designed to meet all the changes that have occurred since then. In the Valuation Act there is provision for periodic revision of the valuation of individual citizen's property.  In the main, periodic valuations are brought about as a result of a request from the ratepayer, from the local authority or the local authority's officer, the rate collector.  I think it is generally on the application of the rate collector that revisions are made. Having regard to the fact that the value of money has, in the main, steadily been falling over the past 100 years, it is inevitable that valuations should rise from year to year in so far as they are carried out or revised.  This is one way in which injustices occur.  If a citizen's property is revalued or has recently been revalued the new valuation will necessarily be high.  If a citizen's property has not been revalued for a fairly long period, the valuation will be relatively low.</P>
    <P>Since these revisions of valuation occur at different periods, there is a very wide variation in the valuations of different properties situated perhaps even in the same town, city or the same rural area.  It follows, therefore, that even if you accept the principle that the basis of valuation is relatively fair, the fact that valuations are carried out in different years constitutes a very grave injustice.  There is some property which is valued higher than other property of equal market value.  Therefore, there seems to be a case, even on that narrow basis, for an investigation of the whole position.</P>
    <P>The injustice of the present system is more apparent when we consider that revisions of valuation frequently take place where property is improved&mdash; where new buildings are erected or existing buildings are enlarged or improved.  That, in itself, constitutes one of the most serious hardships in the existing system.  The person who improves his property is penalised for so doing by having his rateable valuation increased and, therefore, his share of direct taxation to the local authorities is increased and other charges are proportionately increased. That is a grave injustice and I think it <Col N="1993" /> is bad from a national point of view. It is true that, under existing laws, various remissions are granted in respect of some improvements.  At the very outset, the original Valuation Act provided that new farm buildings would enjoy a remission of rates for seven years.  That might seem a fairly valuable concession but if it is analysed it will be seen that it does not amount to very much.  Anybody who is familiar with rural conditions and the manner in which farmers carry on their ordinary business knows that only rarely does a farmer build the full number of outoffices he requires on his farm in one year.  Generally, he acquires a farm without outoffices.  If necessity arises, or if his conditions improve, he seeks to erect new buildings or to improve the existing buildings from year to year.</P>
    <P>In the first, second or third year he builds perhaps only one small out-building. In the course of a further number of years he probably erects another out-building.  If he is an enterprising and industrious man, he continues to improve his farm buildings. It is possible, however, that the rate collector may note the new or improved buildings on the farm and that he will look into the matter.  If, by the time the rate collector takes note of the improvements, the buildings are seven years old, then the increased rate takes immediate effect. There you have an immediate damper put on that enterprising farmer and it is an immediate deterrent to a further improving of his farm buildings. I consider that that is utterly and completely wrong.</P>
    <P>One of the strongest complaints which our fathers had against the land-owners was that when they carried out an improvement to their farm or house or outoffices the land-owners immediately increased the rent.  That very grievance is being perpetuated under the existing valuation system, notwithstanding the seven years' remission of rates.  I think that, to be fair, it would be desirable to avoid any increases in the valuation of farm buildings during the term of ownership of the existing owner.  I think there should be no revision of valuation <Col N="1994" /> unless there is a change of ownership. To a certain extent, that would get over the problem.</P>
    <P>Under the Local Government and Housing Acts, houses for which there is a Government grant get a two-thirds remission of rates for a period of seven years and non-grant houses get a two-thirds remission of rates for five years.  That, again, is a very small concession, having regard to the cost of building.</P>
    <P>As we all know, most dwelling houses now are built with the aid of housing loans, the repayment of which extends over 25 or 35 years.  But, while the repayment of the loan is current there is a very heavy burden on the owner of the new house.  Therefore, I think there is need for a further concession in regard to new houses. We know that, under the Undeveloped Areas Act, substantial concessions are made in regard to new buildings for industrial purposes.  There is a complete remission of rates for a period of seven years.  Under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, a remission of rates for 20 years is given.  I think that a remission of rates for 20 years, in respect of a new house, seems to be what is urgently required and what I think justice would demand.</P>
    <P>I know it will be said that concessions in respect of rateable valuations constitute a potential or actual loss of revenue to the Central Exchequer and to the local authorities.  That point of view may be urged, but I think, as against that, we have to face the fact that any incentive which is given to a private individual to improve his property is really a social benefit to the nation.  It may be that the amount of additional revenue which might be gained by increasing the valuation of ratepayers' property, because of improvements or extensions carried out, would be completely offset by the amount of unemployment caused by deterring citizens from improving their property.</P>
    <P>That is particularly true in regard to another type of property, the property of business people.  Shopkeepers, as we know, are in the main thrifty, industrious, enterprising people.  Most successful businessmen like to improve <Col N="1995" /> their business premises because they realise that it is not only of benefit to themselves to have their premises up-to-date but that it is of benefit to the street, town or village in which they live.  They realise also that, by improving their property, they are giving employment to their neighbours and to their neighbours' children.</P>
    <P>Now, under the existing Acts there is no concession whatever for the businessman who improves his property. Immediately he extends or enlarges his business premises, he becomes subject to revision and, I would say, to an increase in his rateable valuation and, therefore, to an increase in his rate burden to the local authority as well as in his contributions in respect of other fixed charges based on property valuation.</P>
    <P>I have come across cases in my own constituency where shopkeepers, the owners of licensed premises anxious to improve their business and to cater for the much-boasted tourist industry, enlarged and extended their licensed premises.  They did so in order to give their customers the amenity of a comfortable and up-to-date saloon bar or restaurant rooms in which they could take their food or refreshments in pleasant and decent surroundings. Almost immediately they carried out these improvements their premises were revalued, the valuations in many cases showing a very substantial increase. I have known of cases where the rateable valuations of business premises were doubled and in some cases trebled because of improvements carried out by the owners.  It is true that this increase in valuations brings in additional revenue to the local authority.  Perhaps, if that system of increasing valuations was not in operation there would be a reduction in the expenditure of the local authority inasmuch as the business people in these towns and villages would go on improving their property, giving employment to workers and thereby relieving the burden on the local authority.  That is a consideration which, I suggest, must be taken very seriously.  We are, I think, tending <Col N="1996" /> too much towards relying entirely on the State to do everything for our people: to provide them with food, clothing, money and everything else, and, as a necessary corollary to that, to go all out to rake in the last shilling from the citizen.  I think it would be much better to give the individual citizen the chance to do something for himself, and in doing that to do something for the community at large.</P>
    <P>I think that if we were to stay the hand of the valuation authorities in regard to improvements to property, if we could get them to ignore for a considerable time improvements carried out, and thus give an incentive to citizens to spend a little of their own money improving their own property, we would be doing a very great national service, perhaps a much greater national service than by increasing valuations, increasing the rates and increasing at the same time the amount of expenditure required to relieve poverty and destitution.</P>
    <P>I think there is something radically wrong with a system which penalises the citizen for expending money on improving his property, in giving employment to workers and at the same time increasing the productive output of the property which he has in his hands.</P>
    <P>This is a small nation made up to a very great extent by a very large number of small property owners, and because of that we must have regard to the immense advantage it would be if every property owner sets out deliberately and consciously to improve his property.  I agree that under the existing law there is no interference or alteration in land valuations.  Land valuations were fixed 100 years ago and have never been altered.  Perhaps that is a good thing, although there are very grave complaints about anomalies in the present system of land valuation inasmuch as there are areas where, because of the conditions under which farming was carried out 100 years ago, the valuations are higher than the valuations of better land in other parts of the country.  We know that wheat growing was one of the most important items in the farmers' income and that <Col N="1997" /> the price of wheat 100 years ago was relatively high compared with other crops.  When the Griffith valuation was taken, land under wheat was assessed at a high valuation.  That has survived to the present day.</P>
    <P>I know quite well that there is a feeling amongst farmers that it would be undesirable to alter generally land valuations because of the fear that a general revaluation means a general increase.  I will come to that question now.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that a general revaluation should mean a general increase.  A new basis should be found for valuation purposes which would not mean an increase.  There are people who will say that it does not matter very much whether valuations are increased or not because a general increase in the total valuation of the State would mean that the rate in the £ would be proportionately reduced.  That is a rather dangerous theory.  If there were a general increase in valuations, I think there would be almost automatically a stepping up of the rate in the £ by local authorities.  The rate in the £ might be reduced for perhaps one or two years but, within a short time, it would be brought up to present level. Therefore, farmers and ratepayers generally fear any general revaluation but we are anxious that the whole matter be investigated with a view to removing the anomalies and injustices which I have indicated.</P>
    <P>It is particularly necessary that no increase should be imposed on rateable valuations because of improvements or extensions carried out, at least for a very considerable number of years or, better still, until there is a change of ownership.  That, of course, might not apply in the case of limited companies where ownership would remain permanent. There might be some specified number of years in that case.  A considerable period should be allowed to elapse from the time the improvement is carried out until the valuation is increased.</P>
    <P>There is another anomaly which I believe exists.  I have not had time to check up on this.  There is no rateable valuation as far as I know on ground <Col N="1998" /> rents.  If there is any particular type of property that should be subject to a rateable valuation it is the site upon which buildings are erected.  It is altogether wrong that, while the owner of the building, the leaseholder, who, perhaps at very considerable expense to himself, has erected a building, is subject to a high rate, the person who owns the site and who derives a fixed income from it is exempt from contributing to the local rate in respect of that property.  That is definitely unjust. It is a matter that a commission such as I have suggested should look into and seriously investigate.</P>
    <P>It will be acknowledged that the rateable valuation of the State has very considerably increased over a number of years.  I have here only recent figures but they show a substantial increase.  The total rateable valuation of all property in the State was £12,414,000 in 1946, and by 1950 it had risen to £13,000,000&mdash;an increase of about £500,000 in four years.  That indicates a very rapid stepping up in the basis upon which rates are levied.  It may be said that a large portion of that was due to new buildings.  It is equally true that a substantial portion of it represents revision of rates on existing buildings because of a certain amount of renovation and improvement. That is altogether wrong.</P>
    <P>From every point of view, there is an urgent need for an investigation of the whole system.  It is particularly wrong that the farmer, who has never very much spare money to invest in permanent improvement of his property, should be penalised because he seeks to improve that property by building new cowsheds, new out-offices or improving his dwelling house.</P>
    <P>We ought to face this question in a broadminded way and realise that, if we encourage citizens to improve their own property, we will give more help to the deserving section of the community than could be given by the State in the expenditure of the money which they would rake in from those citizens through increased valuations.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I commend this motion to the House and hope that the Minister will seriously consider the setting up of a commission to inquire into the <Col N="1999" /> whole system of rateable valuations, and that he will give attention to the second part of the motion which asks that, pending the report of this commission, no further increases be made in rateable valuations.  If that is done, it will give a fillip to all enterprising people who are anxious to carry out building and improvement work which would increase the volume of employment generally.</P>
    <P>I have frequently in this House referred to the injustice meted out to the farming community under the present valuation system, but I want to make this admission at any rate, that that injustice is being mitigated to a certain extent, partly because of the increasing valuation of urban and city property, and partly through the increase in the agricultural grant recently.  But, in addition to that, one point which I frequently made in the past in support of the derating of agricultural land has been weakened by the fact that over the last ten years there has been a steadily increasing volume of State expenditure on the improvement of land.</P>
    <P>Our case in the past was that, while the farmer had to meet a substantial burden of rates, he derived very little benefit from State or local expenditure generally.  Since the farm improvements scheme, the farm building scheme, and, more recently, the land rehabilitation scheme and the drainage scheme were introduced, that case is being met I would say to a certain extent.  In addition to that, the proportion between the valuation of land and the valuation of buildings has been altered.  Back in 1929, land valuation represented 72 per cent. of the valuation of the State and I think at the present time it is very little more than 54 per cent.  Of course that does not represent the total valuation of farms, because that only includes land, and in addition to that you have the valuation of farm-houses and buildings.  At any rate, it does show that the excess in the valuation of land in proportion to its income and producing capacity is not as great as it was.  Land valuation does not form as big a proportion of the total valuation of the State as it <Col N="2000" /> did and in that way one of the former grievances in regard to rating is being met.</P>
    <P>There is, however, the other very substantial grievance, that improvements carried out in farm-houses and buildings and permanent property of that kind are being valued on a different system, and I think it is desirable that that injustice should be removed, not only in the farmers' interests but in the general interests of the nation and in the interest of increased employment.</P>

      <P>Now that it has been seconded, I believe that it serves a useful purpose in that it enables this House to discuss this system of valuations.  Deputy Cogan's statement in support of his motion, to my mind, was a mass of contradictions.  Personally, I am of opinion that there is a general need for a full revision of valuations in this country in every line of business.  The present valuations on many properties are completely outdated and people are complaining that some people are paying out moneys that they do not justifiably owe because of the fact that other people who have improved their properties have not had their valuations proportionately increased.  We know that it is only in the case of house valuations that revisions have been made, that no revisions have been made so far as land valuation is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that money must be collected for public use and that there are two means by which that money can be collected &mdash; by taxation and by rates.  I believe that the rating system is a very equitable way of collecting money for public use.  While I am not sure of the figures, I believe that for every pound of money collected through the medium of rates there would be a sum of from £8 to £10 collected through the medium of taxation, or probably more.  We hear more talk about the rates than we do about taxation, and I believe that that is due to the fact that the rates are collected directly from the people annually or by half-yearly instalments. These instalments, when they come to be paid, seem to the person <Col N="2002" /> paying them to be very large and, definitely, in many cases they are very large and growing from day to day.</P>
    <P>That is not the position, however, so far as taxation is concerned.  We are paying money in taxation indirectly day by day and the present Minister for Finance has adopted many systems for taking money from the people without their actually knowing that they are paying it to him by indirect methods and underhand methods, which I believe would be the best way to describe it.  One of the main reasons why Deputy Cogan has put down this motion is that he is very sympathetically disposed to people who pay large sums annually by way of rates to local authorities.  These people who pay rates have also to pay taxes because it is the same people who pay both rates and taxes.  I believe that the House cannot but agree that Deputy Cogan is insincere in proposing this motion because during my short term here Deputy Cogan has supported many measures directed at extracting money time and time again from those sections of the community about whom he professes to be so concerned to-day.</P>

      <P>What has that to do with the motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect it is related to the motion because we are discussing the system of valuation and the method by which public authorities can continue to operate without further increasing valuations and rates.  That is the contention advanced by Deputy Cogan.  If money is not collected by way of rates, then it will have to be secured by way of taxation.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the method of revising valuations needs review.  When a person improves his property it is only right and just that there should be some increase in his valuation because by improving his property he improves its market value and, if he is a businessman, he attracts new custom to his premises.  It is only natural that if he attracts more business his neighbour, also engaged in business but without the capital to improve his premises, will suffer a reduction in his trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2003" /> The principal objection to the present system of revising valuations is based on the method that is adopted.  I have heard prominent people, including the present chairman of the Cork County Council, a former member of this House, assert that the officers carrying out these revised valuations have no practical experience of the work and no knowledge of the letting value of premises.  Indeed in some cases such an exorbitant increase has taken place in valuations as 300 per cent.  Naturally in such cases people are bound to object and that is why there is such an outcry at the moment against the present revision of valuations.  The people feel that the revisions are altogether out of proportion to the amount of work done either by way of renovation or reconstruction.</P>
    <P>I think the Department should instruct its officers to take into consideration in future when assessing the value of the work done the ability of the people to pay.  That would be a much wiser course.  People whose valuations have been revised have complained that no notice at all is taken of information supplied by those whose valuations are under revision. The officers appear to act completely and entirely on their own.  We all know that they have not much knowledge of the business because in my constituency and throughout the country generally there are applicants coming before the Circuit Court judge every day seeking a reduction in their valuations and in some cases the increase in the valuations has been reduced by almost 100 per cent.  I am sure everybody will agree that the Circuit Court judges are correct in their decisions. On that argument then it must be admitted that there are many people carrying out this work of revision who have not the necessary knowledge of the job.</P>
    <P>I think it is unfair that people should have to go before the Circuit Court judge to have their grievance remedied. There is always the risk that an applicant may lose his case.  If that happens he is faced with not only increased rates but very substantial legal costs as well.  I think the legislation is framed for the benefit of lawyers and <Col N="2004" /> solicitors because it plays into their hands.  I cannot see why an applicant whose valuation has been exorbitantly increased could not make his appeal directly to the Department or to some kind of tribunal established by the Department sitting in different centres throughout the country.  That would give an applicant an opportunity of airing his grievance without exposing him to the risk of heavy legal expenses. The present valuation system is a golden harvest so far as the legal section of the community is concerned. That section is definitely reaping its reward from it.</P>
    <P>There are many people who are anxious for a general revision of valuations. I know people living on islands whose valuations are entirely out of proportion to the property they own. People living in such circumstances labour under grave disadvantages and they think that a revision of valuations would be definitely beneficial to them. I believe they are right in that.</P>
    <P>One would think from the statements made by Deputy Cogan that the revision of valuations and the system whereby valuations can be increased is aimed at extracting money and imposing hardships on the ratepaying sections of the community.  I am sure the Deputy knows very well that that assertion is completely incorrect.  If a local authority has a valuation of £1,000,000 and if it requires for its operations over the year a sum of £1,000,000 all it has to do is strike a rate of £1 per £1 and in that way raise the necessary money.  If, in the following year, the rateable valuation increases by £50,000 or by £100,000 and if the local authority again only requires £1,000,000 the people whose valuations were not revised will benefit because their rates will be reduced while those whose valuations were revised will have to pay more.  A hardship on some will be a benefit to others if the valuation of a county increases since some, because of circumstances beyond their control, cannot improve their properties and will thereby benefit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan must agree that the county council will get its money irrespective of valuations because it will strike a rate sufficient to meet the <Col N="2005" /> demand made.  From that point of view there is no case to be made. Deputy Cogan also asserted that it would be advisable to have an abatement of rates on new houses for a period of 20 years.  He subsequently asserted that people are becoming inclined to depend on the State for many of their requirements.</P>
    <P>I do not know how Deputy Cogan relates the two assertions.  On the one hand he states that those people, along with getting fairly substantial grants, should have to pay no rates for a period of 20 years.  I do not know how Deputy Cogan ralates that with his assertion that the people are now looking to the State for everything and that there is no self-dependency whatsoever. I am as anxious as any other member of this House to see that people who build houses on their own should get every possible facility but I believe that if an abatement of rates was made, say, for a period of five, six or seven years, it would meet the situation quite well.  I cannot see any reason for the suggestion made by Deputy Cogan except that it may be a fairly popular one and one that will go down throughout the country with people building new houses, that they should get an abatement of 20 years and that people who may not be in a position to build houses for themselves should pay for it.</P>
    <P>The case made in support of the suggestion that there should be no revision of valuations when property is improved is that it is retarding progress and that it is deterring other people from improving their property.  I do not think that assertion is correct.  If a man progresses in life and is in a position to extend premises, surely such a person should be asked to pay more than his neighbour who probably, through circumstances beyond his control, through illness or through some other misfortunes, is not in a position to improve his property and cannot increase his income.  Surely the man who increases his income and improves his property should be asked to pay a higher contribution than the man who is not in a position to do so.</P>
    <P>The main reason why I spoke on this <Col N="2006" /> subject at all was to air the opinions of the many people, in my constituency, at any rate, who claim that there should be a general revision of valuation. A number of these people, particularly those living in rather isolated areas&mdash;granted their valuations are not very high&mdash;are of opinion that if there was a general revision of rating, they would fare better and that their contribution to public funds would not be as high as it is at present.</P>
    <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with one section of the community who are penalised more than any other section by the present system.  They are the publicans.  Deputy Cogan mentioned them in the course of his statement and he was very sympathetically disposed towards them.  A number of them down in Cork have had to go to the Circuit Court to have the increased valuation revised and I believe that in all cases, without exception, they got them revised.  I have sympathy with them also because their business is declining from day to day and it is declining due to the attitude of the present Minister who has imposed such heavy taxation on the goods they have to offer for sale that it is now impossible for the people to buy those goods.</P>
    <P>I believe that some review should be made by the Department of the system by which the valuations are increased. I am asking the Minister to indicate, when he is replying, if those officers have a thorough knowledge of their work, so many of their decisions are reversed by the Circuit Court judge when application is made to him That is the main difficulty I see in Cork and I think it is very unfair that people who have a complaint should have to go before the Circuit Court judge to have it rectified.  I do not propose to detain the House any longer.  I am glad, however, that this matter has come before the House because it has given us an opportunity of going into this important question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad also to have the opportunity of bringing to the notice of the House some grievances in connection with the present system of valuations.  I understand the valuation code as it exists here is 100 years old.  There are many grievances <Col N="2007" /> under the law as it stands and I would be in favour of an approach to the whole question of valuations which would modernise the valuation law and also bring within its scope cases where hardships exist at the moment and also to expand it to meet other cases.</P>
      <P>It is admitted that all over the country you have valuations which are too low.  That is due to the fact that valuations have not taken place in some cases for a long number of years. On the other hand, there are valuations which are exorbitantly high.  Like the income-tax office the valuation office acts with lightning speed and anywhere there is any improvement at all they are very quick to seize the opportunity of increasing the valuations.</P>
      <P>One example will show where much improvement is required in the valuation law.  I quote the case of the town of Buncrana in County Donegal.  In that town the urban council, in order to improve the town and provide better facilities there, decided that some of the valuations there were too low and in order to get increased money for expenditure on the town they decided to seek revaluation.  They found that was not possible but that it was possible to get 100 per cent. revision. They felt that by getting this revision injustices would be remedied, that evening-up would take place and that those whose valuations were very low would have them brought into line.  It was also felt that in any cases where, as there were, exorbitant valuations existing, there would be a reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The valuation Office acted very quickly on that and 100 per cent. revision was carried out.  The result of that revision was that in no case was there a reduction and in some cases there were increases of valuation up to 150 per cent. and 200 per cent.  The valuation of that town prior to the time that 100 per cent. revision took place was £7,000.  After revision, the valuation stands at £11,000.  That situation is bad enough but there is another aspect which makes it even worse.  All the money collected from increased valuations is not spent on providing services to the town.  There is a county-at-large charge; that is as well as providing services for the town, the urban <Col N="2008" /> council must pay a sum based on valuation to the county council.  That sum paid to the county council gives very little advantage to the urban council.  It covers only charges like mental hospitals and other similar charges.  Yet, the contribution from the urban council to the county council jumped from £2,000 to £4,000.</P>
    <P>That means that the ratepayers of Buncrana are paying per head double the sum that ratepayers in any other town in the county or any other town in Ireland are paying.  Further, there is no way, unless by a change in the laws of the State, to remedy that injustice. I have discussed the matter with several people and everybody admits that there is a grave injustice there inasmuch as the people of the town have to pay double the figure paid by people in any other town and for a very small service.  They would not mind if the money collected in rates on the valuation of £11,000 were expended in the town but that is not the case.  Due to the contribution which had to be made to the county council, the rate struck by the commissioner last year in Buncrana was 38/4 in the £.  To provide the necessary services for the town, the services that will be provided this year, all the urban council would require to strike would be about 26/- in the £.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just trying to point out how the present law operates.  I am quoting this as one of the very grave injustices which can arise and for which there is no remedy under the law as it stands.  Again, when people complain that their valuations are too high, somebody advises them: &ldquo;Why not apply for a revision?&rdquo; From the experience which people have gained as a result of making applications for a revision of valuation, I think nobody in this country will apply for a revision if he is wise because, in any case which I know of, when an application was made for revision, no revision took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" /> Actually the opposite was the result, the valuation was increased.  For instance in the town of Buncrana, a house which was built in 1949 was valued the year before the revision took place, and even in that case the valuation was increased by £6.  I think there was no reason for that.  In the year in which it was first valued, 1949, business was as good as it was in 1950 when the revision took place.  As I say, nobody will ask for a revision in circumstances such as these.  There are several farmers whose valuations are exorbitant.  For instance, in my own place near the City of Derry, at the time the valuations were struck, the farmers in that area had the advantage of living in proximity to a fairly large city to which they could supply the produce of their farms&mdash; milk, butter, eggs, etc., and for that reason the valuations were fairly high, although in some cases the land was not too good.  Now that the opportunity to supply produce to that city no longer exists, the farmers should, I think, seek revision of their valuations, but again it is a case where the experience of other people who sought revision of their valuations, prevents their doing so.  In my view and in the view of many other people, the present system is bad, and not alone should it be revised and overhauled, but new regulations allowing greater flexibility to ratepayers should be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there should be an inquiry into the method by which rateable valuations are fixed at present.  As the proposer of the motion mentioned, all sorts of anomalies exist.  Hardships result from these anomalies and from the old-fashioned method of valuation followed in this country.  If a man builds a house or a factory it is perfectly just that he should pay rates on a fair valuation, but what the citizen finds unjust is that if he erects a house, and perhaps a couple of years later decides that he should add a garage to it, he will find that his valuation will be increased when in fact if the garage had been built at the same time as the house, the valuation would very likely be no greater than that originally assessed on the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2010" /> That is of course the sort of thing that it is impossible for an individual to prove but a comparison of the valuations of similar houses in various districts would tend to show that the charges levelled against the system of valuations are not unfounded.  Similarly in the case of factories and business premises, when the building is erected a valuation is put upon it. Then after a few years small additions or alterations take place and up the valuation goes again.  I know the difficulty which the Valuation Office officials are up against&mdash;at what point should they say: &ldquo;No, we shall not charge extra for this improvement&rdquo; or &ldquo;Yes, we shall charge extra for that one.&rdquo;  That is the difficulty in the present situation and as a result of it a premium is placed on inactivity, a premium which favours the individuals or businessmen who do not improve their premises.  Many improvements are carried out in business which are to the benefit of the personnel employed in the business.  In other words, the improvements may not be in any way connected with earning increased profits and yet an increased valuation will result from those improvements. Therefore, the industrialist who does not carry out improvements which, perhaps, are for the benefit of the staff is operating under cheaper conditions and is, therefore, in a position to make more money.  The result is that a premium is being placed on inefficiency.  Exactly the same result ensues in the case of an individual who does something to improve his house while his next-door neighbour does nothing.  The community then is so much the poorer because decaying property is in effect being subsidised by this policy.</P>
    <P>Another thing which comes out if one examines the question of valuation is somewhat similar to what Deputy Cunningham referred to in connection with the farmers outside Derry.  Whole districts deteriorate in value and in fashion.  We in the City of Dublin see a great deal of that happening.  What were once fashionable and wealthy districts have become very poor but the valuations continue, in the main, to remain at the same high level as existed in the days of prosperity. <Col N="2011" /> There are districts in the Borough of Dublin where there used to be a number of small local authorities which have now been swept away and amalgamated either in the county or in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire or in the city.  Every time a new house was built in their area these small municipalities were so delighted that they dashed along and put on a valuation which was largely based on the pocket of the individual who built the house.  As a result, there are houses in South County Dublin which are valued at fantastically high valuations.  They are quite out of all proportion to the size of the house and the district. These valuations were based principally, I think, on the amount the man who was building the house could pay and the fashionableness of the district.</P>
    <P>Somebody referred to the question of revisions.  I can tell the House that by and large the advice given by house agents and valuers&mdash;the people who are engaged in that trade&mdash;to their clients is that except for very, very good grounds revision is simply not worth while, that the cost will far outweigh the very trifling alleviations of valuation which they might get.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy spoke earlier about the man who improved his property and said that he ought to be made pay more than the man next door who was too poor to do so.  The valuations of houses are something which are not, and should not, be run on charitable lines.  It has nothing to do with the capacity of the individual to pay.  That argument to my mind is not valid.  It does not necessarily follow that the man next door cannot afford to improve his property.  He simply does not want to maintain his property in the way in which it ought to be maintained.  Then the man who does spend money on his property is put in a bad position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the man who will not do it.</P>
    <P>Very many alterations are carried out in and about business premises which are not so much in the nature of improvements as necessary alterations. I think it is undoubted that the system of valuation is one which is not <Col N="2012" /> in keeping with our present needs either as private individuals or as members of the business community.</P>
    <P>It was all right 100 years ago when there was an idea that any change and improvement was something which was carried out by wealthy persons for their own private comfort or, indeed, luxurious indulgence.  That was very largely the mentality 100 years ago and the same idea prevailed very largely in commercial life.  It was not a time of change; it was a time when people said, and firmly believed, that what was good enough for their fathers was good enough for them and men who carried out alterations to their premises were very often held to have done so because they had been bitten by the building bug or for some other reason.  It was not thought that building changes were necessary improvements. Nowadays, we live in an age in which, by virtue of social changes, people have to alter private houses. They have to carry out alterations on houses which were built to be run by a staff of servants in order to make it possible to live in these houses with perhaps no servants at all, and these changes which are carried out because of present-day social necessities have very often to be paid for in increased valuations.</P>
    <P>We have exactly the same type of thing in business.  We know now that if we are to keep our place in world industry and, indeed, in world farming, we need to be as up to date as possible. We need up-to-date machinery which must be housed in up-to-date premises, and if the man who provides himself with these premises is always to have his valuation increased when, in fact, he is not making any larger profit as a result of the changes&mdash;he is perhaps gaining only in efficiency&mdash; our system of valuation is placing an unnecessary yoke around the neck of our industrial and farming community.</P>
    <P>I support this motion which says that an inquiry into the method of valuation and the whole circumstances surrounding it is very necessary, an inquiry which, I think, would bring about a change for the better.  It is not altogether a question of increasing or decreasing valuations.  It is a question <Col N="2013" /> of making our system of valuation suit the needs of our twentieth-century life and not the needs of 100 years ago.</P>

      <P>We have to ask ourselves to-day whether the present system of valuation is just and equitable.  That is the question facing us.  We have heard a number of arguments for and against, both inside and outside the House.  The State must get money by means of either direct or indirect taxation, but I want to ask if we are wise in having a valuation officer going around the country and, directly a person improves property, revaluing it, inside a week or a month.  There are two schools of thought in regard to this <Col N="2014" /> question.  One is that the system deters certain people from improving their property.  If we examine it and the examination leads us to the logical conclusion that it does, then it is time we revised the system.  On the other hand, there is the industrious man who is anxious to get along in business and who improves his shop front or his dwelling because he has become more prosperous as the years passed.  He will do that irrespective of any valuation.</P>
      <P>It has been represented to me in my own constituency that directly enterprising people carry out certain improvements, their valuations are increased by from 20 to 30 per cent. and up to 100 and even 150 per cent. in certain cases.  If the system is preventing people from improving their property, if it has that undesirable effect, we shall have to examine its implications.  During the régime of the inter-Party Government, valuers went around the country&mdash;I do not know whether it was whispered to them directly or indirectly&mdash;and they revalued many business houses.  A number of business houses in my constituency went up by at least 200 per cent. during the régime of that Government.</P>

      <P>And Deputy Sweetman's Party decided they would make them pay for the profits they were making. A number of business houses were revalued and many business people complained about it because it meant that when the valuation of a licensed premises was increased, the E.S.B. charges were increased.  In the town of Balbriggan, one business house went up in valuation by £150 per year.  I have met a number of farmers who have complained that their land was dearer than other better land.  Perhaps if Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Blowick finished their conversation, I might be able to continue.</P>

      <P>Farmers have complained from time to time that the valuation of their farms is higher than that of their next-door neighbours.  In some cases they asked for a revaluation, but found they were worse off then.  That is one of the worst problems we have to face.  People who are buying new houses are in many cases working people, struggling to get homes of their own, and they find these houses highly valued.  They are paying a good deal for them, notwithstanding the grants.  I am referring especially to that depressed type known as the white collar worker, who has only a fixed income and has to live up to it.  We must ask ourselves are we fair and equitable in dealing with this matter in the way we are dealing with it to-day.  As times change, we have to change, too, but it is unjust that we should bring old property up to the value of new property, and we must ask ourselves how we are to deal with that.</P>
      <P>Are we logical in sending valuation officers round to improved properties, to revalue them immediately and increase the rates?  The small businessman and the small farmer throughout the country find this happening regarding additions and outhouses, and they are all talking about this.  If we can do something to encourage these people to improve their property we should do it, without having people coming immediately afterwards to revalue the property.  That is one of the biggest national problems we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion offers an opportunity to Deputies to vent their feelings here.  While we agree that there is need for examination of our whole valuation system, we must appreciate that it is a delicate subject which should be examined very carefully before changes are made.  If we change the system there are people who would benefit, but there are also people who would suffer.  Therefore, most Deputies would be reluctant to make any suggestion and the best thing that could be done would be to establish a commission of inquiry to consider all the details.</P>
      <P>For the past four or five years and up to the present, the farming community have been pestered by the valuation office.  Before that we were not accustomed to inspectors calling on farmers, but nowadays it is quite a natural thing to see them pulling up outside a farmhouse and, whether it be a hen-house, a dog kennel or a pigsty that has been erected, there is a tax placed immediately on it.  The average farmer considers that that kills his incentive.  For a hayshed 10/- is put on; for a shed for a cart, a plough and harrow, there is another 10/- and any repair you do around the farm is taxed.  The farmers to-day are reluctant to undertake any reconstruction whatsoever, as these gentlemen from the valuation office are moving around the country placing extra valuations on these new outoffices.</P>
      <P>It is not even necessary nowadays to put up a new building.  I know a poor down-trodden farmer whose valuation was as low as 15/- on land and who had 10/- put on the outoffices; yet over 100 years there was not a single building put up on that small farm.  I am glad the gentlemen concerned with that office are here in the House and I hope they will take some notice, as what I am saying is a fact down in County Mayo.</P>

      <P>Farmers who carried out no reconstruction on buildings or outoffices for the past 50 or 60 years fave found there is an increase of 10/- or £1 put on these buildings.  I would like the Minister to realise that it kills initiative in the farming community. Agriculture is our principal industry and the backbone on which the whole nation hangs.  When a farmer does reconstruction in one form or another, he now finds a new tax levied on him, followed by an increase in rates.</P>
      <P>It may be argued that revenue must be got in some way, but revenue under that heading is an expensive item, as it is a deterrent to the farmer. I would ask the Minister to reconsider it, as the whole community is crying out.  This has been taking place only in the past five or six years. Prior to that, the valuation authorities seemed to be partly asleep and were not as alert as they are at present. Over the past five years they have visited almost every single tenant-farmer in the West of Ireland and placed a new impost on them of from 5/- up, whether they carried out reconstruction or not.  The idea of appeal is only a sham, because an appeal costs much more than the concession made arising out of the appeal.  Therefore, farmers are reluctant to enter into litigation with the Valuation Office, because of the feeling as to what the result will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards small towns, I have had reason to bring to the notice of the Valuation Office on a few occasions increases of £9, £10, £14 and £15 for very minor repairs.  One man was valued £9 for the installation of a toilet and bathroom.  The building was there but he made an addition in height.  He did not expand the ground area under buildings but put up this addition in height and his valuation went up £9.  That occurred in a small, insignificant business in a small country village in the West of Ireland. I wonder could the Valuation Office <Col N="2018" /> justify that?  They could not, but if that man went into court he had no guarantee as to what the result would be.  In nine cases out of ten, the justice might not side with the small man.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that while we appreciate that there may be a need for a new approach to this matter&mdash;I am sure Deputy Cogan will admit this &mdash; it may do as much harm as good.  If we are going to have a new approach then I hope it will be brought about by a commission set up by the Government.  On that commission I should like to see the farming community represented along with the business community.  I realise that it can be a very unpopular thing for a Government to introduce a new valuation system, but at the same time it is better than the piecemeal approach which we are having at the moment. Deputy Blowick is as well aware as I am that, day after day, we get letters of complaint in this matter from small business people and small farmers. That is especially so now when we are experiencing a recession in trade, with business on the downward trend and taxation on the upward trend.  Notwithstanding these difficulties, people find that if they carry out any modest repair they are heavily taxed.  I appeal to the Minister, when he comes to address the House, to approach this matter on a non-political basis.  I agree that he is, perhaps, in a very awkward and thankless position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the last two lines of the motion which read as follows: &ldquo;... pending the report of the commission no increase should be made in valuation of building because of improvements or extensions.&rdquo;  Only a week ago I put down a question on exactly the same lines.  I suggested that should the owners of <Col N="2019" /> property incur the responsibility of raising money in the banks at the very high rates of interest now operating, for the purpose of carrying out improvements to their property, they should get some concession for taking their courage in their hands and providing work for the building trade at a time when it was never more urgently needed.  My object was to try and encourage certain Dublin firms and small business people who are anxious to repair, improve or maybe even extend their property and who give good employment at reasonable wages.  The moment the work is completed there is the worry of the increase in valuation.  As a previous speaker has pointed out, there is that worry even when the work does not involve an extension of the premises but just the improvement of accommodation for the workers there. The Minister who replied to my question stated that the owner of the property knows what he is doing &mdash; that he is extending or improving his premises for the purpose of bringing about increased business.  That is not a proper way to put it.  There are cases where a man must carry out repairs to his premises or else they will decay and eventually fall down.  There are a dozen cases in the City of Dublin alone where handsome sums of money were spent on extending buildings and where subsequent returns revealed that the business did not improve at all.  Because of some antiquated regulation, the owner of such property is faced with increased taxation without any corresponding improvement in business. If the Minister's view is that because a business improves to any extent, the valuation should be increased, then I say that that view will cripple industry.</P>
      <P>It does not encourage people who desire to extend their premises and give good conditions of employment. If a man in the licensed trade improves his property in any way, the Valuation Commissioners come along and, to whatever extent they increase the valuation of his premises, up go his ordinary rates and taxes and, in addition, his licence fee is doubled if not trebled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that not penalising people who are giving good employment and who wish to extend their premises?  I know of a man who installed improved toilet accommodation in his business premises.  The valuation of his property was raised and he had to face increased taxation. The Government should not permit of an increase in valuation where the improvement is for the benefit of staff and not for the purpose of bringing about increased business.</P>

      <P>A number of small building societies in this city build houses on which a loan under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts can be obtained&mdash;a loan spread over a 30-year period.  The latest increase in the rates of interest on these loans will mean, in many cases, an extra 10/- or 12/- per week on the repayment of the loan.  There is a scheme at Philipsburgh Avenue, Fairview.  In that scheme houses which were built by the Dublin Corporation are occupied by tenant purchasers who are all citizens of Dublin with a wage probably not exceeding £10 a week.
