      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) the total number of agricultural holdings in (i) the country, (ii) the congested districts; (b) the number of agricultural holdings in the congested districts (i) under £4 valuation, (ii) over £4 valuation and under £10, and (c) the number of agricultural holdings in areas other than congested districts (i) under £4 valuation and (ii) over £4 valuation and under £10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of agricultural holdings in the country on 1st June, 1951, the latest date for which such information is available, was 379,123.  It is not possible to state the number of holdings in the congested districts on that date, but the total number in the eight counties of Clare, Donegal, Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo was 163,169.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since particulars of holdings were last classified by valuation in respect of the June 1937 returns, it is possible in reply to the second and third parts of the Deputy's question to give only <Col N="172" /> estimates of the 1951 figures.  It is estimated that in the eight counties the number of agricultural holdings not exceeding £4 rateable valuation was 55,200, and that the number of holdings above £4 and not exceeding £10 valuation was 51,800.  The estimates of the numbers of holdings in the corresponding valuation classes in the remainder of the country are 69,300 and 33,500 respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The practicability of establishing a power station at Arigna has been under consideration at various times for some years past.</P>
      <P>In 1950, following a request from my predecessor, the E.S.B. addressed an inquiry to colliery owners in the area regarding the quantities and qualities of coal which might be available for use in a generating station.</P>
      <P>Following on the decision to erect a turf-burning station at Lanesboro', County Longford, consideration was given to the desirability of including in the Lanesboro' station a boiler and set to use Arigna coal, and the board reported to me in the matter on November 18th, 1952.</P>
      <P>On consideration of this report I decided that it would be more satisfactory to build a station at Arigna, and I directed the E.S.B. on January 16th, 1953, to take the necessary steps to this end.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period up to 31st January, 1953, An Bord Fáilte spent approximately £10,000 on the organisation of An Tóstal, 1953, and Fógra Fáilte spent £10,000 on special publicity for the event.  In addition, An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte have entered into firm commitments which will involve them in further expenditure of the order of £5,000 and £36,000 respectively.  The total expenditure by the two boards on An Tóstal, 1953, will, therefore, be at least £61,000.</P>
      <P>Publicity is a matter for Fógra Fáilte and I do not interfere with the discretion of the board.  I have no reason to think that they are not carrying out their duties efficiently and satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>The question with which the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association were concerned was whether imports of tea from the countries of origin should be made through a central purchasing organisation or by individual merchants.  The views they conveyed to me are under consideration. I had informed the association that they must proceed on the assumption that it would continue to be the policy to obtain our supplies of tea directly from countries of origin and I am not prepared to depart from that policy.  I do not accept the Deputy's suggestion that supplies of cheaper tea would be available if imports from any source were to be permitted.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 17, 18, 19, and 20 together.  The Government has at present before it the report of the Civil Service Arbitration Board.  No decision has yet been taken in respect of the board's findings.  As soon as a decision has been reached the Government will present the report to Dáil Éireann.  Presentation will in any event be made within the three months' period prescribed in the agreement concluded between the Minister and the Civil Service staff organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister was freely a party to the setting up of the arbitration board, that the Tánaiste, during the last general election said that this Government accepted the principle of arbitration for the Civil Service, and that the Minister himself was represented on the recent arbitration board proceedings, is it possible that at this stage the Minister for Finance proposes to welsh on the arbitration award?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister cannot speak for the Government, but the Government is entitled to have at least three months to consider the implications of this award in so far as they affect the ordinary taxpayer in this country.  In addition to that, we must necessarily consider the position of other people as well as the public servants to whom this award applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that increases have been freely granted by private employers in recognition of the increase in the cost of living and of the fact that the Tánaiste said recently at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis that the Government was prepared to face up to an adjustment of wage levels because of the slashing of subsidies, surely the Minister for Finance and the Government should not contemplate at this stage refusing similar increases to lowly-paid State employees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the position in regard to private employers and to the Government as an employer is very different.  In the case of private <Col N="183" /> employers, if they increase wages and if that results in an increase in prices, the ordinary general public has always the option of refraining from purchasing, and, therefore, may not be mulcted to the extent represented by the increase in wages and the consequent increase in prices.  In the case, however, of public employers like the Government or a local authority, if the Government decides, or the local authority decides, to increase the wages of its employees, it is <i>ipso facto</i> compelled to make the ordinary public pay that increase.  The ordinary public has no option except to pay and, therefore, there is no analogy between the two cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of his statement that the recent importation of timber by direct steamer from Russia was necessitated by the fact that similar kinds of timber were not in stock, he will state if he satisfied himself that the kind of timber imported on the occasion under review was absolutely essential, as reliable assertions have been made that Finnish and Swedish timbers of comparable varieties and qualities are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No imports of Russian timber have taken place for several months.  As regards such imports, my information is that essential timber of the same kind could not have been bought as cheaply in any alternative market.  It was on that basis which accorded with a direction given by our predecessors, that exchange control approval for the payments issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the direction to which I have referred, I feel that the Deputy will be interested in the fact that in <Col N="190" /> June, 1948, when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy McGilligan, sought a direction from the Coalition Government as to whether, as a matter of policy, purchases should be made from Czechoslovakia, it was decided that purchases should be made in the cheapest market, whether or not these be in Communist countries.  Similarly, when the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, sought a further direction as to whether, in view of its Communist affiliation, food should be sold to Czechoslovakia, the Coalition Government decided in the affirmative.</P>
    <P>In connection with all this I should, perhaps, remind the Deputy that under the Communist régime His Grace the Archbishop of Prague, which is the capital of Czechoslovakia, would appear to have been forcibly deported from his see and that his fate is unknown.  Furthermore, I would add that, though I have been unable to find any evidence that the Deputy raised these matters when our immediate predecessors allocated currency to the extent of £200,000 for the purchase of timber from Russia, nevertheless should he require any further enlightenment on this issue I shall gladly hold myself at his disposal.</P>

It may be that some part of the currency made available under general authorisations to import textiles was used for the purchase of afgaline abroad, but the records of payments for imports kept in my Department do not distinguish between afgaline and other textiles in such a manner as would enable me to answer the Deputy's question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will use the powers available to him, or if these be insufficient will seek such powers as may be necessary to direct the governors of the Central Bank to reduce by 50 per cent. the moneys at present held by them in low interest bearing securities elsewhere than in the Republic, and to re-invest the sums thereby made available in the form of similar low interest bearing loans to our farmers in Ireland for the purpose of rehabilitating our agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Acts <Col N="192" /> governing its establishment the general functions of the Central Bank are in the main threefold&mdash;to act as the provider of Irish currency, to safeguard the integrity of that currency and to act as lender of last resort.  As a provider of currency, the Central Bank issues legal tender notes in accordance with the terms of the Currency Act, 1927, under which our separate Irish currency was established.  As in general all transactions relating to the payment of money in this country must be executed and fulfilled here by payment in our own currency, it is obvious that the issue of this currency in the form of legal tender notes must be strictly regulated by law, so that it may not be subject to debasement and its purchasing power in terms of other currencies be diminished.  Accordingly, the mandatory provisions of the Currency Act, 1927, regulate the issue of the currency and concurrently impose on the Central Bank the unlimited obligation of maintaining the free inter-convertibility, on the basis of parity, of Irish currency and sterling. The procedure whereby this inter-convertibility is secured is established by Sections 47 and 49 of the Act. Respectively, these sections regulate the issue of legal tender notes and provide for their redemption.  Thus Section 47 obliges the Central Bank to issue legal tender notes in exchange for an equivalent amount of money which is legal tender in Great Britain or for gold bullion&mdash; in actual fact, however, gold bullion is never offered.  Conversely, Section 49 obliges the Central Bank to redeem Irish legal tender by payment on demand of an equivalent amount of British legal tender.  It will be seen, therefore, that against such legal tender notes as are issued by the Central Bank, there has been delivered to it an equivalent amount of British legal tender money and that all or any of our legal tender notes are redeemable and the corresponding sterling amounts repayable by the Central Bank on demand.  Clearly, therefore, the issue of legal tender notes is a transaction to which a rigid obligation attaches and the Central Bank must at all times stand ready to honour it.  To enable it to do so, it is essential for <Col N="193" /> the bank to hold the resources which it has secured in the manner I have described in a readily realisable form.</P>
      <P>Some central banks hold their note fund assets in the form of gold, which, as we all know, is, in the present state of the world, the most readily realisable asset.  But gold so held earns no current income and is an expensive treasure to guard.  Therefore, other central banks place their resources in short-dated securities for which there is a ready market and which are more or less safeguarded against serious capital depreciation.  By this policy they endeavour to safeguard the capital value of their assets and to maintain that degree of liquidity which their obligations require, while at the same time securing an income to cover their expenses and, incidentally, making a modest contribution to the public revenue and in relief of the taxpayer. The policy which the Central Bank of Ireland has adopted is intended to enable it not only to fulfil its obligations to the holders of all its notes, to redeem them on demand, but to function as lender of last resort to the commercial banking system should the latter ever find itself in difficulties.</P>
      <P>From what I have said it will be realised that the Central Bank must avoid any involvement in commercial banking business or long-term credit transactions which would immobilise its resources and thereby impair its ability to carry out its statutory obligations and to intervene, if necessary, to protect the currency and to stabilise the credit structure.  It would not be desirable, therefore, for the Central Bank to be empowered to engage in the type of banking business suggested in the question; for apart from the fact that other institutions exist which could more properly undertake it, loans to farmers are essentially long-term loans and are in the main not liquid.  At a time when the general exchange reserves of the country are falling it is all the more necessary for the Central Bank to conserve the liquid resources on which its ability to discharge its functions depends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask two supplementary questions.  First of all, may the House take it that the Minister approves of the policy of the Central Bank in not investing any of the legal tender note fund in Ireland?  That is number one.  Number two&mdash;will the Minister state whether any other country in the world backs its currency 100 per cent. by the securities of a foreign Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, Sir, I should point out&mdash;and if the Deputy has studied the legislation governing and regulating our currency it should not be necessary for me to answer the question&mdash;the Government has no responsibility for the policy of the Central Bank.  The obligation of the Central Bank has been determined by legislation passed by the Oireachtas of this country.  This lays it down that the primary function of the bank is to protect the integrity of our currency and the responsibility for doing that is placed upon the board of the Central Bank.</P>

I am keeping the matter under observation and the Deputy may be assured that, if it should prove necessary, steps will be taken to safeguard the public interest.</P>

      <P>I am aware that persons seeking unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance at certain local offices of my Department have been subjected to delay.  This was principally due to changes in procedure necessitated by the implementation of the relative provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, on 5th January, 1953.  The normal seasonal increase in the number of persons seeking unemployment benefit or assistance was, of course, a contributory factor.  All available experienced staff have been assigned to the local offices concerned and the position has now improved considerably.  It will improve further as the staff become more familiar with the revised procedure and conditions governing the payment of unemployment benefit and assistance.</P>

      <P>Persons who go to Britain for seasonal work such as, for instance, migratory workers whom, I take it, the Deputy has in mind, and who return to this country when this work is completed, are not, I am advised, classified as being ordinarily resident in Britain and are not, therefore, liable to be called up for service in the British armed forces.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to reconsider it.  These maps were all out of date and there was no necessity whatever to have them there.  They were too expensive and the whole practice was uneconomic.  It was compulsory to have them up to 1942 but the Act of 1942 made that unnecessary.</P>

      <P>The answer is in the affirmative.  It is proposed, as an experiment, to select the next group of recruits by calling, in order of merit, the candidates who obtain the highest marks in a written examination.  All candidates who are of good character and who comply with the physical requirements will be eligible to compete.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice has no function in the matter.  The Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, provides that the Censorship Board may make a prohibition order in respect of any newspaper or other periodical publication whose recent issues have, in the opinion of the board, devoted an unduly large proportion of space to the publication of matter relating to crime.  The board is entitled to act only on a complaint made to them in the prescribed manner and I understand that no complaint has been made in respect of the newspaper in question.  Any member of the public is entitled to make such complaint to the board.</P>

      <P>Members of the Garda Síochána are prohibited by regulation from communicating to the Press any information in connection with matters which come to their knowledge in the course of their duty unless authorised to do so by the commissioner.  I cannot accept the implication in the Deputy's question that the public interest requires that police information concerning criminal assaults, other than such information as may be given in the course of court proceedings, should necessarily be disclosed to the Press.  On the contrary, I think that the publication of such information might often be harmful.</P>

      <P>In the national conference programme for primary schools, the great importance of local history in the general teaching of the subject is stressed.  Teachers are advised that special attention should be paid to the part played by the district during the period under treatment, its patron saints, the notable persons connected with it, the events and legends of which it was the scene, and its historic remains.  Teachers are recommended to bring their pupils occasionally to places of historic interest in their neighbourhood.  The programme provides also that local history in the higher standards should be treated in greater detail.</P>
      <P>The Department has issued a pamphlet containing elaborate notes on the teaching of history in the schools, a copy of which is available for each teacher.  It deals in detail with the part which local history should play in the development of the subject and provides much help and guidance for the teachers in their approach to it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state when it is likely that there will be sufficient accommodation and treatment for mentally retarded children and children described as backward whose health, education and progress is being retarded through inattention and failure to provide the treatment that would make them healthy and capable of absorbing education and engaging in useful occupations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole position in regard to the provision of educational facilities for the various groups of mentally retarded and backward children is at present under consideration in my Department.  These groups include children whose mental retardment may be due to physical causes, for example, the blind, deaf and dumb and those suffering from epilepsy, cerebral palsy or orthopædic diseases.  I am not yet in a position to state when it is likely that accommodation and treatment for all these groups can be made available, as, apart from the question of the provision of accommodation, serious difficulties arise in the matter of the recruitment and training of suitable teachers for the specialised work of the instruction and care of these children. I may say, however, that during the past year or two some noteworthy advances have been made by the religious communities and other bodies who have undertaken the care and training of these groups and that considerable financial aid has been provided <Col N="236" /> for them by way of teachers' salaries and other grants from public funds to assist them in their work. Improved staffing arrangements have been sanctioned for the schools for the blind and for the deaf and dumb; a new school has been established for boys at the colony for epileptics at Mulhuddart; and a new day school for children suffering from cerebral palsy has been provided in temporary premises in Dublin.  For some time past, also, schools have been provided in connection with the orthopaedic hospitals and convalescent homes for children whose normal mental development has been impeded by long periods of illness.</P>
      <P>As regards the ordinary backward children, it has been found possible in many of the larger schools in the cities to adopt a systematic grading of classes which allows the various groups to progress uniformly in relation to their ability and mental development.</P>
      <P>Last year, an experimental class was established in the Central Model Boys' School, Dublin, consisting of backward boys from a number of neighbouring schools.  I am watching carefully the result of this experiment, with a view to its extension to other groups of schools in the near future.</P>
      <P>As regards the group of persons, including children, who by reason of incomplete development of mind are ineducable and are in need of special institutional care and supervision, I am aware that the Department of Health is giving active consideration to the question of improved provision for these classes.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is about one and a half years since he gave me an almost similar reply?  As every Deputy who has been asked to get a child, who cannot assimilate education in the ordinary way, into one of these institutions knows, it is now more difficult than ever to get such a child into an institution.  Would the Minister do something to speed up the provision of accommodation so as to give the parents of such children the opportunity that I know he is most anxious to give them, of providing for their education?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that a children's bus from Finglas housing area to Rutland Street National Schools is urgently required; and, if so, if he will request C.I.E. to provide a bus for this school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Special bus services have been established to provide educational facilities for children, who have recently been transferred to the new housing area in Finglas, pending the provision of adequate school accommodation in their own area. Senior boys are being conveyed to East Wall Boys' School where spare accommodation of a very suitable character is available for about 300 pupils.  The girls and infants are being conveyed to Gardiner Street Convent which had, at the inception of the scheme, similar accommodation for about 500 children.</P>
      <P>Some hundreds of the children concerned had previously been enrolled in other schools throughout the old city area and a considerable number of those have elected to remain on, in small groups, in the schools which they formerly attended.  They travel to their old schools by bus at the reduced rates applicable to school children rather than avail themselves of the special buses provided by the Department. In none of these cases, however, is there sufficient children to warrant the provision of a special bus and it would be impracticable to provide a special bus or buses which would range over a number of schools situated at a distance from one another.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the schools to which the Deputy refers there are on the rolls only 31 boys and 19 girls from the Finglas area.  As double-deck buses carry 100 children, and single deckers over 60, it would be a completely uneconomical arrangement to provide two buses, one for boys and one for girls, to cater for these 50 children.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of families whose children formerly went to Rutland Street schools have been removed to a corporation housing area three or four miles away?  We have asked that buses be provided to bring these children back to Rutland Street National School but the remedy which has been applied is, not to bring them back to the Rutland Street school, but to other schools in the city to which buses, which are already overcrowded, are plying, thus taking from the teachers in Rutland Street the benefit of the attendance of children who formerly went to these schools.  That is not playing the game with the teachers in Rutland Street and it should not be tolerated by the Minister.  He should allow us to go on with our housing policy and let the children go back to the schools which they formerly attended until schools are provided for them in their own area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this question as it appears on the Order Paper.  I am merely saying that it would not be possible, without a great expenditure of time and effort, to compile the information sought in the question.  A simple reading of the question will indicate to anybody the amount of work that would be involved in that attempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The information is particularly necessary in view of the fact that many county managers throughout the country have embarked upon a campaign of raising the rents of old <Col N="247" /> cottages which, in most cases, have already been paid for.  This information, therefore, is necessary in order to ascertain the reasonableness or otherwise of the demands of county managers in particular cases.  I do not think it is unreasonable to ask the Department to furnish that information. God knows it costs enough money to administer the Department which is asked to supply information of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add to what I have already told the Deputy. If the request for information seemed to me to be reasonable and if it could be procured with a reasonable amount of human energy and expense, I naturally, as Minister, would be obliged to try and procure it for any Deputy.  The information sought here is to my mind entirely out of the question from any of these points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This raises an entirely new issue.  The Minister is taking up the attitude that he is entitled to decide whether or not it is worth spending time on a question put down by a Leader of a Party in this House.  Does the Minister think that it is just for recreation that I wrote this question? I had to look at the matter from all angles in order to frame it.  Now I am told that the Minister's Department cannot supply the information.  One wonders how a Department is run that cannot supply this information.  This information is not asked for in a capricious or frivolous way and the Minister and his Department should make some serious effort to facilitate the Dáil when a responsible Deputy puts down a question of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is any single item included in this list upon which any Deputy requires information it can be had through parliamentary question or otherwise.  This blanket cover included in this question asks for information which in many cases would not, in my opinion, be easily obtainable at all and is not reasonable.  I do not think it is fair to send a bunch of highly paid officials around the country on a wild goose chase looking for <Col N="248" /> information which does not appear to me to be of any great substance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to find out the sources from which labourers' cottages were financed, the regulations under which they were financed, how much was spent, how much has been repaid, how much outstanding, what rents and rates are outstanding and the cost of repairs in order that I might get a comprehensive picture.  I want to obtain this in the light of the new campaign by county managers to raise the rents of those cottages.  The Department says it is too troublesome to supply this information.  There ought to be some responsibility to supply information of this kind.  I am not in the habit of putting down facetious or frivolous questions.  I framed this question at length because I wanted to get information.  That is the only reason why information is sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the House that, before rents can be increased in respect of the houses which the Deputy has in mind, the matter must be considered and discussed by the local body and if the local body should decide to increase these rents the matter is then subject to the approval of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to deal in one reply with Deputy MacEoin's Questions Nos. 125 to 130.  In view of the nature of the questions the reply is necessarily of some length.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mrs. Kathleen Devine was appointed sub-postmistress of Ballinalee in 1942 in succession to Mrs. Mary Anne Kiernan, who had held the position <Col N="252" /> since 1920.  The other persons mentioned in the Deputy's questions had previously held the position from about 1880 to 1920.</P>
    <P>Inspections of the sub-office were made twice yearly during the years 1940 to 1947.  In 1948 the frequency of checks had to be increased because of accounting irregularities, carelessness and general inefficiency in the working of the office.  I may say that no complaint has ever been received regarding any lack of courtesy and consideration on the part of the ex-sub-post-mistress in her counter dealings with the public.</P>
    <P>In April, 1948, it was necessary to warn the sub-postmistress sharply that if she again came under notice for similar irregularities the consequences for her would be serious.  This warning did not bring about any permanent improvement and following further serious neglect of duty the sub-postmistress was, in April, 1950, seriously cautioned and warned that unless there were an immediate and sustained improvement in the working of the sub-office, the question of relieving her of her appointment would have to be considered.</P>
    <P>That Mrs. Devine herself fully realised the serious view taken by the Department of the unsatisfactory manner in which she was conducting the business of her office, is amply illustrated by the fact that before the last mentioned warning was administered to her she said, in a communication to the local postmaster, that if drastic action were to be taken, she would be grateful if given the opportunity of resigning.  Some improvement followed this serious warning, coinciding, I may say, with the employment by Mrs. Devine of an assistant, but at no time thereafter up to the date of her suspension was my Department free from anxiety regarding the working of the sub-office. That this anxiety was well-founded is proven by the position disclosed in June, 1952.  A check of accounts carried out at the sub-office on the 24th of that month, and subsequent inquiries by a departmental investigation officer revealed a multitude of errors and omissions.  In brief, the situation in <Col N="253" /> have warranted my relieving the sub-postmistress of her appointment even if no further irregularities were brought to light.  In fact, I feel that Mrs. Devine had already been allowed far too long a period in which to achieve the improvement the necessity for which she had twice been warned.</P>
    <P>Apart, however, from the errors and omissions to which I have already referred and which might be attributed to inefficiency or negligence, the inquiries of the investigation officer revealed a number of grave irregularities. I detail them in the form in which they were communicated to the sub-postmistress' solicitor on the 5th January, 1953:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(1)  A deficiency of £30 13s. 11½d. found on a check of the sub-office accounts on 24/6/1952.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(2)  A shortage of £20 in the official cash in the week ended 21/6/1952 which was cloaked by falsifying the accounts.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(3)  Misuse of official cash amounting to £10 on 23/6/1952.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(4)  Inflation of the amount of cash on hands in order to balance the accounts.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(5)  Failure to report a deposit of £7 on 20/6/1952, and attempting to deceive the investigation officer by making a false statement.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(6)  Delay from 20/7/1947 to 28/9/1947 in bringing to account a Savings Bank deposit of £10, which she used for private purposes in the interim.</P>
    <P>&nbsp;(7)  Failure to report a Savings Bank deposit of £10 made in July, 1951, and use of that sum for her private purposes.</P>
    <P>Each of the foregoing irregularities was admitted by Mrs. Devine in signed statements, duly witnessed, taken from her after the administration of the usual legal caution, during the course of the inquiries in June and July of last year.  I feel that a couple of doubt that she had acted in a manner extracts will suffice to establish beyond which rendered it imperative in the interest of both the public and the <Col N="254" /> Department that she be dismissed from her post.  The extracts are as follows: for obvious reasons I am omitting the name of the depositor:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Extract (1) (relating to a lodgment made by a Savings Bank depositor):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The entry of £10 on July, 1951, was made when Blank gave me this amount in the sub-office for deposit in her savings account.  I could not find the book at the time but later when I found it I entered the month of July only, as I could not recollect on what date I had received the money.  I did not prepare a deposit docket in respect of the deposit or forward the amount to An Cuntasóir. I used the money for my own private purposes, intending to forward it later but I never did so.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Extract (2) (dealing with the same Savings Bank transaction):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the visit of the officer from headquarters on 26th June, 1952, my husband visited Blank.  Her book had been found in the sub-office and as I knew it was irregular I sent him in to warn her that if any inquiries were made she was to be sure and say that she asked that the book be kept in the sub-office.  I knew at this time that the account was at least ten pounds (£10) short of the balance that should be in the book to the credit of the depositor.  I tore out the centre pages of Blank's old book and destroyed them to conceal the real position of the account from her if she called for the book before the new one was issued.  I intended destroying the old book altogether when I received the new one which I would have given to Blank but when the new book arrived I could not find the old book.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These extracts speak for themselves. Provided the Deputy can obtain the consent of Mrs. Devine, I shall be prepared to show him all her signed statements in explanation and admission of her irregularities.  As regards the departmental reports, the Deputy will, of course, realise that these are confidential and that it would be contrary to established the sub-office was chaotic and would <Col N="255" /> practice and detrimental to the public interest to disclose their contents.</P>
    <P>The check of accounts on 24/6/1952 was carried out by the postmaster, Longford, and Mrs. Devine's interviews with the headquarters investigation officer took place on the following dates:&mdash;</P>

    <P>On 26/6/1952, apart from the main breaks for meals, there were breaks of 20 to 30 minutes' duration in both morning and afternoon interviews.</P>
    <P>The investigation officer who conducted the inquiries is an officer of the highest integrity in whose reliability the Department has the fullest confidence.  In the course of his work he has had occasion to take hundreds of statements from suspects and others and on no occasion has there been the slightest suggestion which would impugn his honour or his methods. The Deputy and the House may unreservedly accept my assurance that he treated Mrs. Devine with the utmost consideration, having regard to the circumstances of his meetings with her and she, herself, I am glad to say, acknowledged this and expressed to him her appreciation of his consideration.</P>
    <P>Mrs. Devine was suspended from duty on 27th June, 1952, and her dismissal was authorised by me on the 13th September.  In the interim, she had ample opportunity to make any representations she cared to make&mdash; supplementary to the explanations in her written statements&mdash;regarding the irregularities of which she was made aware by the investigation officer.</P>
    <P>As regards the investigation of this case, I should state that the procedure followed in no way differed from that which has been followed for so far back as can be ascertained from departmental records or from the recollection of departmental <Col N="256" /> officials.  Inspections of post offices and investigations of irregularities are carried out by established departmental officers who submit their reports to headquarters where, I am satisfied, they are most painstakingly considered.  In the more serious cases the reports are submitted to the Minister with a departmental recommendation as to disclipinary action.  In cases involving defalcations or other serious irregularities, it is not the practice, where statements have been taken after the usual legal caution has been administered, to ask the offender for any explanation supplementary to those already given by him and if the admissions of the offender so warrant, a decision to dismiss is taken by the Minister.  So far as can be ascertained from the records of my Department or the recollection of my principal officers there has never been any case of irregularities comparable in their gravity to those admitted by Mrs. Devine, where the officer concerned was retained in the postal service and frankly I cannot conceive of a state of affairs in which irregularities of the nature referred to here could result in any action short of dismissal. Officers of the Department have been dismissed for irregularities much less serious than those of Mrs. Devine.  Having regard to the nature of the work performed in its suboffices, the Department must insist on the highest standard of integrity on the part of its officials and the Deputy will appreciate the need for the maintenance of a strict disciplinary code. It is only by taking the sternest action in the case of serious irregularities such as those dealt with in this reply, the Department can obviate any impairment of public confidence in the handling of public moneys in the postal service.  I am satisfied that from these points of view I would have been failing in my duty as a Minister had I permitted Mrs. Devine to continue as sub-postmistress.  I need hardly say that it is a painful duty for me to dismiss any officer from my Department and I do so only where I am satisfied that there is no alternative.</P>
    <P>In considering the case of Mrs. Devine the question arose of taking steps towards the institution of <Col N="257" /> criminal proceedings against her.  In deciding not to take such steps, I was influenced by her frail physique and nervous disposition as reported to me by the investigation officer, by her domestic circumstances, by the long record of loyal service which previous members of her family had given to the Post Office and by her own action in making good in full the amount of the deficiencies for which she had been responsible.  I decided that, in all the circumstances as placed before me by the Department, dismissal action would suffice.  Discretion has at all time been exercised by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs as regards the reporting of such cases to the Attorney-General and in this case, for the reasons I have mentioned, I refrained from setting in motion a procedure which might have resulted in Mrs. Devine's prosecution on a criminal charge.</P>
    <P>As regards the further points covered by the Deputy's questions, Mrs. Devine according to information supplied by her, is married to a farmer and they have two young children.  She could not, in view of her record, be approved for employment in any other post office. Her eligibility to receive unemployment assistance can, I understand, be determined on her making application to the local officer of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I feel I can with confidence say that the House extends its sympathy to the newly appointed sub-postmistress on account of the damage done recently to her home and on account of the physical violence to her husband. Having applied, with five others, for the vacant post on its being advertised, she was in due course recommended by the board set up by my predecessor in office and subsequently appointed by me.  Her lot and that of her husband and three children during recent weeks has been most unenviable and all public-spirited people will deplore with me the fact that ill-conceived agitation on the part of a section of the local people has taken the form of mob violence.  Three Civic Guards have been injured and postmen and engineering workmen have been attacked.</P>
    <P>Might I say to the House that those <Col N="258" /> attacks are something that every Deputy should join me in condemning? We all know how vulnerable the Post Office workers are to violence.  Their duties take them into remote and lonely places at all times and seasons. The danger of the example set at Ballinalee is that if there is a dispute about an appointment, the part-time postman going out with the mail in the dark of a winter's morning will be in danger of being beaten up on some byroad or the linesman repairing the telephone wires after a storm will be in danger of being felled by a stone. Deputies know that the work of the Post Office is of a civilian non-political nature more than that of any other Department and its service is to the community as a whole in a very real and practical sense.  That has always been recognised in the past, even in the bitterest trade disputes and land agitations.  It is, of course, the public itself which will suffer whenever the work of the Post Office is interfered with.  The cutting of the telephone line to Ballinalee last week, for instance, was much more likely to prevent some unfortunate person in that neighbourhood from getting a doctor in time than to cause any inconvenience to me or the Department as a whole.  All Deputies will recognise the necessity of letting the Post Office get on with its day-to-day work and of not visiting on its defenceless employees any dissatisfaction with ministerial policy.  I am not without hope that my reply to-day to Deputy MacEoin's questions will have the effect of putting an end once and for all to the regrettable action of those who have lent their support to a campaign for the reinstatement to office of a person who had entirely lost the confidence of my Department and whom, for what I am satisfied are good and sufficient reasons, I felt constrained to dismiss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether it is proposed to connect Meenacross sub-post office, Dungloe, County Donegal, with a telephone service; and, if so, when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Deputy O'Donnell's question and perhaps anticipate further similar questions by making a general statement about the scheme for providing a telephone in every rural post office.</P>
      <P>When the scheme was commenced in 1947 the number of rural post offices without telephones was approximately 940.  Of these 396 were provided with telephones in the five years ending December 31st, 1951, leaving a balance of some 544 still without telephones.</P>
      <P>Early last year I decided that a special effort should be made to complete the scheme within a period of approximately two years.  Progress in the meantime has been satisfactory as indicated by the fact that 246 additional sub-post offices were served in 1952.  If there are no unforeseen difficulties, the balance of 300 odd sub-post offices (including that at Meenacross) will be provided with telephones by the middle of next year.</P>
      <P>As I have explained previously, I do not propose to give more precise estimates as to when installation work is likely to be carried out at particular post offices because changes may be made from time to time to co-ordinate the call office work with other engineering work, and I wish to give the officers concerned full liberty of action to settle or revise the order of installation on purely engineering considerations.</P>

It would appear that we are now going to leave these unfortunate people on the most western island on the seaboard without a telephone of any description. <Col N="265" /> Better let us tell them the truth-they are going to receive no facilities there.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether I need go any further into this matter. In actual fact, prior to 1936, there was communication with only very few of the bigger islands.  A departmental committee in 1939 thought that there should be some kind of radio telephonic link with islands the population of which exceeded 100, and a scheme was completed finally with 13 islands having this form of communication.  The island referred to by the Deputy has a population of 50 and there, again, the question is at what point does one draw the line.  I have every sympathy with the islanders, but it would result in a very great commitment if we were to go below the figure of 100 persons. However, the matter can be considered and I will refer the matter to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government to see whether the social advantage conferred would be worth the very great expense having regard to the other ways in which finances could be expended for the betterment of the Gaeltacht generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that 80 per cent. of these 50 people are engaged in the fishing industry, that there is not a policeman, a doctor, or a nurse on the island, and that there are times when it is absolutely impossible to land on the island, would the Minister favourably reconsider his decision in this matter?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the statements which were recorded by the Minister for Finance were entirely out of accord with the statement made by the Secretary of the Department of Finance which was endorsed at a late hour last night by the Taoiseach?  It is the feeling of the people throughout the country that the radio was utilised that night for a pure piece of political propaganda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he has satisfied himself that the number and capacity of licensed canning and dressed meat factories in the country are sufficient for (a) present available live stock and (b) increased population of cattle and pigs in the foreseeable future and, in addition, whether he will ensure that the policy of his Department in protecting existing firms <Col N="279" /> will not be detrimental to the producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Taken as a whole, the slaughtering capacity of the premises already engaged in the export trade in dressed meat and canned meats is sufficient to meet all potential requirements. Additional refrigeration facilities would probably be necessary in the event of a further large expansion of dressed meat exports.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect in suggesting that existing meat export firms are protected, either from competition from further entrants into the trade who provide suitable premises or from exporters of live stock.  No such protection, capable of being detrimental to the interests of producers, exists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I had already made statements on two occasions in that connection.  I made one statement on 16th July, 1952, speaking here and one on the 23rd April, 1952, speaking at the Cattle Salesmasters' Association Dinner at the Hibernian Hotel.  It has appeared twice publicly that I had stated we had sufficient slaughtering premises in the country.</P>

Would it not have been better if these people had been spared the considerable expense in which they were involved before they were led up the garden path?</P>

      <P>The standard price payable by the British Ministry of Food for pork carcases received from this country has not been increased.  Since 12th January, however, the quality premiums payable by the Ministry on carcases within certain weight ranges have been revised.  Particulars of the changes made are set out in a detailed statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have included in the official report.  It <Col N="283" /> will be noted that in some cases the rate of premium has been decreased, while in one instance it has been increased.</P>

      <P>With regard to the final part of the question the position, as I informed the Deputy in reply to a question on 23rd April 1952, is that the full moneys receivable from the Ministry of Food for pigs exported in all forms will be distributed by the Pigs and Bacon Commission to exporters, and producers will not be affected by the form in which their pigs are exported.</P>

    <P>(1)  the back fat measured at its thinnest point was not less than ¾ <Col N="284" /> inch measured with skin-on, and that</P>
    <P> (2)  the carcase was not, by reason of feeding with fish or fish products, unsuitable for bacon production and for the retail pork trade.</P>

    <P> (a)  Carcases weighing from 1 cwt. 1 qr. 1 lb. to 1 cwt. 2 qr. 12 lb.&mdash; 22s. 5d. per cwt.</P>

    <P>Quality premiums are payable on carcases of clean pigs of certain grades weighing from 1 cwt. 1 qr. 1 lb. to 1 cwt. 2 qrs. 17 lb. deadweight, provided that the carcase is not, by reason of feeding with fish or fish products, unsuitable for bacon production and for the retail pork trade.

      <P>There is one simple little question to which I cannot get an answer.  I have asked will the exporters of pork get what is paid by the British Ministry for pork or is there a deduction from that which is used as a levy on bacon?  I get the answer that the general producers of pigs and bacon will get the full amount of the money.  Is it a fact that there is a levy placed on pork to subsidise bacon?</P>

I cannot give the Deputy any further information than I am giving him now.

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  I am informed by the Dairy Disposal Company that the milk supplies to some of the travelling creameries in the West Cork area had, as is usual at this time of the year, dwindled to such a point that it was found necessary to discontinue operating those vehicles as from the 1st January last.  It had been intended to resume operations by the 1st February, if the milk supply had by then sufficiently improved.

      <P>The estimates submitted to me in respect of the fishery year ending on 30th September next by the Kerry Board of Conservators showed an excess of expenditure over receipts amounting to almost £1,200.  The board was unwilling to adopt a suggestion made by me that the fishery rate be increased by 5/- in order to meet to some extent the anticipated deficit and as a State grant to the full amount of the deficit could not be provided it was necessary for me in order to maintain the solvency of the board to increase the rate by 5/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that last year the board increased the fishery rate by 2/- in the £?  Is he further aware that the increase now of 5/- in the £ may have the effect of putting some of these fisheries out of business. Furthermore, does he realise that the board is very dissatisfied that the Parliamentary Secretary increased this rate without any consultation with <Col N="290" /> the board?  Will he now agree to send down one of his officials to consult with the members of the board at their next meeting?  In that case perhaps everybody would be satisfied.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the board did increase the rate.  It is not true to say that this is an arbitrary decision on the part of the Minister for Agriculture, acting through me, but is in fact due to the increase in the expenditure by the Board itself, for which they did not make adequate provision.  They simply increased their expenditure, deducted the amount of their estimated income from the total, and put down the difference as a State grant without any previous consultation with the Fisheries Branch.  I would point out to Deputy Palmer that the consultation to which he refers did, in fact, take place when an official of the branch was present for a meeting of the board, and discussed fully the implications of their estimate.</P>

Arrangements are made generally beforehand, so as to facilitate various Ministers and Departments, for the work as far ahead as one can reasonably know. As pointed out by the Tánaiste, you have to take account of the arrangements made, as otherwise you upset a great deal of work that has been done.  I suggest to the Opposition that they will have Tuesday, and if the debate is not finished on Tuesday they can have another day again&mdash;but not Wednesday or Thursday of that week.</P>

We cannot allow that to happen, in the public interest.  The Government business must be disposed of in this limited session of two months.

The Whips can get together to make some arrangement which will avoid the danger the Government has in mind, of having the Government business of the session completely disorganised.  The two months' session must end by the end of March.  In that time we must deal with the Vote on Account, which in itself generally leads to a protracted debate.  There is also a number of Bills and Supplementary Estimates which should be passed in this session, if progress is to be made at all.  After Easter we will be right into the financial business <Col N="299" /> of the year.  The aim is to try to avoid that programme being upset by one protracted debate on this subject.</P>

At the same time, the Tánaiste will appreciate that the House&mdash;and particularly the Opposition&mdash;must always be alert to establishing, or seeming to establish, a bad precedent.  I do not think there would be any desire to prolong the debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate merely for the sake of prolonging it.  If that becomes apparent, the Government has the remedy in its own hands.  The Tánaiste knows that also.  I see that the Taoiseach is rather amused at that remark.  I repeat that the Government has the remedy in its own hands&mdash;and it has never scrupled to use it when it suited.  That is in reply to the Taoiseach.  This is a matter of reasonable approach by both sides and it is utterly unreasonable to put forward that you are not confining or limiting it to one day's debate.  We may have the debate opened on Tuesday and then may not touch it again until Tuesday fortnight or three weeks.  That, of course, would be unreal also.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned last night, I was speaking about the possibility of speeding up decisions with regard to applications for military service pensions, and I had referred to the suggestion made by Deputy McGrath that the Minister could possibly examine the position from the point of view of setting up another board, in the light of the fact that the opinion has been expressed that the present board would take four, five or six years to complete its investigations and that, in view of the age of the applicants, it would be rather a long time and that the cost would be the same.  If another board were set up to act in conjunction with the present board, the time would be at least halved.  I recommend it to the Minister for his consideration.</P>
      <P>The Minister made reference in his opening statement to his intention to introduce amendments to the Army Pensions Acts.  Knowing the Minister's concern for the Old I.R.A. and how they will benefit under the Acts, it was a very welcome statement indeed, and, in paying tribute to the Minister for introducing his Bill, we must also pay tribute to him for the Army Pensions Act of 1946 which, in my opinion and in the opinion of all Old I.R.A. men associated with me, was the greatest boon of all time to the Old I.R.A., because it catered for a section that could not have been catered for under any of the other Acts.  It is surely the greatest Act passed for the I.R.A. and I have no hesitation in describing it as such.  I am glad to hear the welcome news that the Minister intends to improve it further, because improvements are very necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One matter which perturbed many people interested in that section is the fact that medals were issued that did not carry a special allowance.  That was the cause of great upset to the people concerned, but now I understand that there is to be an extension of time and that that grievance will be cured.  In dealing with any improvements that may be made in the matter of special allowances, there is one factor which must be taken into consideration, the means test.  I was astonished a couple of years ago to <Col N="302" /> find that there was a different system of assessing means in the case of Old I.R.A. for special allowance purposes from that applied to them for old age pension purposes.  Surely we should at least have uniformity in all Departments with regard to the assessment of means, but I am sure that, in view of the representations made to the Minister during the past couple of years, he will ensure that that grievance will be removed.</P>
    <P>Another great injustice obtaining at the moment arises in connection with the marriage date.  Under various Pensions Acts, but more especially in the case of applicants for special allowance, there is a marriage date which precludes any member of the I.R.A. who married late in life from being treated as a married man under the Act.  It applies also in the case of some of the Army Pensions Acts.  That injustice should now be removed, and if a date has to be fixed before the date of application, a reasonable date should be fixed by which applicants could be regarded as married persons.</P>
    <P>It is true, as some Deputies have said, that this matter has been talked about a little too long, but it is a source of great satisfaction to find such unanimity in the House, and a source of great satisfaction to the Old I.R.A., or those of them who are left now, to know that each and every Party and every member in the House is anxious to see that they get recognition for services rendered when this country required their services.  Again, I pay tribute to the Minister and also to the House for the manner in which it has received this Bill, and for its decision to honour any awards which the country can afford to make these members of the I.R.A.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to detain the House very long on this Bill but, nevertheless, I feel that I cannot allow the opportunity to pass without voicing my opinions on it.  In speaking to it, I shall not cast any bouquets whatever at the Minister. On the other hand, I hope that he will not think that my remarks in any way reflect on his efforts at the moment. Anything I have to say, probably refers, just as much to any Minister for <Col N="303" /> Defence who held that portfolio since the establishment of this State.  This Bill is all right in its own way because it goes a little step further than other Bills went, but to me it appears only cheeseparing, so far as the Old I.R.A. are concerned.  In my opinion it is just a little gesture, held out until such time as all the people who might hope to benefit by it are dead and gone. Quite a number of them have already passed away, and the vast majority of those still living are, we might say, on the brink of the grave.</P>
      <P>I speak particularly of those people in rural Ireland who took a noble part in the national struggle.  Some of them had to go back to their homes, if they had such, to face penury and want when the struggle ended.  The opinion of those who have passed away in regard to the treatment they received when they were alive, I do not know, but I know what that opinion should be.  It is the opinion of those who are still alive, and it is that they have been badly treated by all Governments and by the various Ministers for Defence, no matter who they were.  The trouble, to my mind&mdash;and it is not confined to the present Minister; it has been the experience of each and every Minister and of every Government that ever held office here&mdash;is that the best intentions of Ministers appear to wither under the dead hand of the Department of Finance.  When it comes to providing a few pounds one way or another we at least should not make any compliment about it, and we should give it willingly but, as I say, it appears that the dead hand of the Department of Finance always nullifies the best efforts of succeeding Ministers and succeeding Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present Minister, like his predecessors, has tried to help in a little way to satisfy the claims of the Old I.R.A., but I am quite sure the Minister realises that this Bill, to a certain extent, is useless.  There are references in this Bill to pensions not exceeding £100 and to pensions not exceeding £125 per annum.  To the ordinary person down the country, especially to the individual who would like to be a critic of the I.R.A., it would appear from these statements in the White Paper <Col N="304" /> and in the Bill that all I.R.A. pensions started at £100 per year whereas, as the Minister knows quite well, five-sixths of the pensions payable are less than £25 per year.  In many cases they range from £6 to £7 a year.  Then you take up the White Paper and this Bill and read: &ldquo;Not exceeding £100 per year, an increase of 50 per cent.&rdquo;.  God bless the dead hand of the Department of Finance!  The man who is getting £6 a year will now get £9.  Surely he will give them a clap on the back. Surely he must be delighted with that magnificent increase from £6 to £9. Surely the Minister himself must realise that that is just a drop in the ocean. I shall not say that it is done for political purposes.  Far from my saying that, it is not worth such an allegation. Many of these men would not lend themselves to any game of that kind even though some people say, and it was said in this House, that they do lend themselves to political purposes. Many of them never did.</P>
    <P>In going through the Bill, you find that some people are getting pensions ranging from £200 to £300.  They are quite all right; they are well away in this world, and they generally have other means of living&mdash;not that I say that they are not entitled to such pensions but to the people who have got miserable pensions and who probably did just as much in their own way as those who are getting much higher pensions, to people who are now offered 50 per cent. on pensions of £6 or £7 per year, this Bill is a disgrace.  It is a disgrace to all sides of the House, to the Government and to the Opposition.  I think it is a mean, despicable way of treating these men. I do not intend that as a reflection on the present Minister or the present Government or even the present Opposition; I think it applies to every Government and every Opposition that we have had in this House since the State was established.  I well remember that, in days gone by, many people in the rural areas&mdash;and in the cities, I suppose, as well, though I knew little about cities in those days&mdash; who rendered devoted service in the struggle were despised for their efforts by certain sections.  The people who belittled them&mdash;I watch the descendants <Col N="305" /> of those belittlers to-day and they would do the same thing&mdash;said that the Old I.R.A. were nothing but pensions hunters, job hunters and self-seekers, but we, who know the truth, must realise that the men who carried on the struggle from 1916 to 1923 carried on the tradition of the men of 98 and of other movements for national freedom.  Realising that, we must admit that they are not being properly treated by Irish Governments to-day.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps fitting that I should quote again a statement which was previously quoted in this House, a statement of the Commander-in-Chief of the Republican forces in 1916, Pádraig Pearse.  To-day he is but a memory, but with some people his memory will live forever.  I regret to say that there are some in this generation who have almost forgotten his name.  Just before he was captured in 1916 he made the following statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I desire now, lest I may not have an opportunity later, to pay homage to the gallantry of the soldiers of Irish freedom who have during the past four days been writing with fire and steel the most glorious chapter in the later history of Ireland.  Justice can never be done to their heroism, to their discipline, to their gay and unconquered spirit in the midst of peril and death.</P>
    <P>Let me who have led them into this, speak in my own and in my fellow-commanders' names, and in the name of Ireland present and to come, their praise and ask those who come after them to remember them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To ask those who come after them to remember them!  Those are the words of Pádraig Pearse, the commander who was responsible for the existence of Dáil Éireann.  Those were the words of the commander who went out and was probably despised, with his few soldiers to drive from their country&mdash; at least from this portion of it&mdash;the forces of the mighty British Empire. He succeeded in doing it and he laid the foundations for commanders-in-chief such as Collins who fought with him in those days and for those who followed.  Many of those people are going to their graves.  I regret to say <Col N="306" /> that many of them are forgotten. Would it not be only right that we, benefiting from their work and their sacrifices, should do something that would be decent and helpful to the few remaining heroes?</P>
    <P>I think it was in the <i>Irish Press</i> to-day that I saw the sad spectacle of an Old I.R.A. man being evicted from his home in the City of Dublin. Regardless of our political views we must make an attempt to end things of that sort once and for all.  Does the Minister or any Deputy in the House think that the increase from £6 to £9 per year for the Old I.R.A. men in rural Ireland is a generous offer at the end of their days?  I would ask the Minister&mdash;he will have every member of Dáil Éireann behind him&mdash;to try and abolish the withered hand of the Department of Finance and give to the few Old I.R.A. men who remain a pension that will maintain them in comfort to the end of their days.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, told us that the implementation of this Bill would cost roughly £400,000.  Surely he must realise that that is a very small sum, even though it is better than nothing. I heard a Fianna Fáil Deputy speak yesterday, and say that there should not be a closing date for applicants. I do not want to score any political points.  Section 5 of the Bill provides:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That the time limit laid down in the Military Service Pensions (Amendment) Act, 1949, for the submission of petitions for the re-examination of rejected applications made under the Acts of 1924 and 1934, shall be extended to a date six months after the Bill becomes law.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was making the point that that date should never be closed down. Many of the Old I.R.A. had to fly to different parts of the world on account of the existence of the unfortunate civil war.  They may come back some day, and it may be necessary that it should be open to them to apply.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion when Fianna Fáil were a Government I remember they passed a Bill&mdash;I think it was either in 1947 or 1948, if my memory serves me correctly&mdash;fixing a date <Col N="307" /> beyond which no further applications would be received.</P>

      <P>A Bill was passed on one occasion which had the effect of putting an end to accepting any further applications, and if the Deputy looks up the records he will see that.  I am speaking about the lower pension groups.</P>
      <P>I believe that a pension of at least £50 to £100 should be paid.  Anything lower than that would not be of any use whatsoever at the present time. Having regard to the few people in the lower income groups they should at least get the kind of pension to which I have referred.  I do not believe the taxpayers would mind one bit what it would cost and the few who did would have very little consideration as far as I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will be asked by the Department to which I refer from where this money will come since it cannot be got from taxation.  I can point out to the Minister that not so long ago, through certain legislation passed by this House, £140,000 was remitted in connection with the dance hall tax.  That would provide £140,000 and I am sure that there is not a Deputy on either the Fianna Fáil or the Opposition side of the House but would agree to that dance hall tax <Col N="308" /> being imposed and that the £140,000 got therefrom be given as extra pensions to the Old I.R.A.</P>
    <P>Some time about the period of the last Budget certain legislation was passed that allowed the tobacco manufacturers to get away with £1,000,000.  I am quite sure if that money was put back again it could be used to give the Old I.R.A. extra pensions which they so badly need.  I am not making those points to embarrass the Minister in any way or to belittle what the outgoing Government did.  I am making those points to prove to the Minister that he can show the Department of Finance where the money can be got.  I would also like to say that there are quite a few in this country, who have not yet got any recognition whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I know people who should have qualified for pensions but who were turned down.  I know of an ambush which took place in my own area early in the fight for Irish freedom.  Some of the people who took part in that ambush got pensions while the applications of others, who fought by their sides, were turned down.  Provision should be made whereby such cases can be reviewed.  I am afraid that the reason for the rejection of certain claims stems from the civil war.  Some officers went on one side and some on the other.  I fear that some verifying officers did not forget the ravages and the troubles that occurred during the civil war.  I appeal to the Minister to look into that matter and try to settle it once and for all.  He should endeavour to bring such men whose claims were rejected within the scope of the Act even if it is only into the lower pension group for the moment. It would be something if he even brought them into the under £25 a year group.  These people should get that recognition.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider the case of those people in the lower pension group&mdash;the under £25 people.  A 50 per cent. increase in their case is just nonsense.  I believe that each and every one of those people should get a pension sufficient to free them of financial worry for the rest of their lives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> My second appeal is on behalf of those people who are genuinely entitled to pensions but whose claims have been turned down because of bad friends or bitterness.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill will go through the House&mdash;and the sooner the better.  I trust that the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to the claims of those people on whose behalf I have spoken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I think every Deputy welcomes this Bill.  I have the honour to come from Enniscorthy.  In 1916, a band of men from that town took part in the Rising in the City of Dublin. Very few towns outside Dublin, Galway and Enniscorthy took part in the 1916 Rising.</P>
      <P>I know men in my own town whose pension claims were turned down by the Referee while other men who fought with them were awarded pensions.  I may say, in passing, that a pension of 3/6 a week to a man with 1916 service is an insult&mdash;and when he becomes unemployed that pension is used against him in the labour exchange. I am glad to see that these restrictions are being discontinued.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Donnellan and other Deputies, I should like to see the pension of men in the lower pension group increased.  The ordinary workingman is the one who suffers most.  He lost his employment through imprisonment, whereas business people had their own ways and means of getting on when they came out of prison.  The unfortunate workingman was thrown out of employment.  He became unpopular. At that time the majority of such men had to seek employment across the water.  Here we have well-to-do people drawing big pensions, while other men, who did the same work, draw only 3/6, 6/- and 8/-.  Now, we are told, they are going to get an increase in pension&mdash;an increase, as Deputy Donnellan pointed out, of from £6 to £9.  Any man who served in 1916 must be approaching 60 years of age now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that special allowances are reviewed every year.  From time to time, I have to get in touch with the Department of Defence on behalf of men who were granted a special allowance.  That <Col N="310" /> allowance is granted only from year to year.  In order to get an allowance in the first instance, a man must submit to very severe medical examination, and if he is not a deserving case the allowance will not be awarded to him. In these circumstances, I feel that that severe examination in St. Bricin's Hospital should be regarded as sufficient and that the case should not have to be reviewed every year.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy has received correspondence from the Mansion House Committee in regard to this amending Act.  I have a letter here from the North Wexford Brigade.  Those pensioners in my constituency who are in the lower pension group are not satisfied with the provisions of this amending Bill.  It is just another case of the more you have the more you get.</P>
    <P>According to the Mansion House Committee circular, there are 17,000 claims still waiting to be dealt with. At the rate the Referee is hearing claims, I suppose the lifetime of this Government will have ended before they are all dealt with.  The inter-Party Government opened the door to the Old I.R.A.  That door was closed in 1945 by the then Fianna Fáil Government and no more claims were to be heard after that.  When the inter-Party Government came into office they brought pressure to bear on the Department of Defence and on the Minister for Defence to reopen the claims of Old I.R.A. men.  I am glad that, as a result of that action, some people received a pension.</P>
    <P>I was talking to a man who was a member of the firing party at Deputy Brennan's funeral.  He was one of our leaders in 1916 and he was sentenced to death.  When I met him at the funeral I told him that I had received the Bill that morning, that I had not had time to read it but that I thought that an improvement was coming.  His reply to me was: &ldquo;Jack, it is not much of an advantage to me.&rdquo;  That man, who was one of our leaders in 1916, is in the lower pension group.</P>
    <P>A man who died recently was awarded a pension only during the term of office of the inter-Party Government. That man went on hunger strike and, further, he was one of the <Col N="311" /> first men in County Wexford to go into Volunteer uniform.  The Fianna Fáil Government rejected his claim and he was not awarded a pension until 1949: he did not live long to enjoy it.  There are a lot of grievances throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I consider that there should be no hesitation whatsoever about giving a pension to a man who has had 1916 service.  I do not agree that any man who took part in the civil war, no matter on which side, should be granted a pension.</P>
    <P>I never agreed with that, but I certainly agree that the 1916 men, and the men who served up to the time of the Truce and during the Black and Tan struggle, should be compensated because they risked their lives, and a good many of them lost their lives.  I have found, on a few occasions, that when an Old I.R.A. man died and his pension came down, that the widow who received it had to send it back. She was not even allowed to keep it to meet the funeral expenses.  Some Old I.R.A. men who died in Britain had to be buried there because their people could not afford to bring them home. That is a sad state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should have gone further in this Bill.  Some people may ask, where is the money to come from? My answer is that if there was a world war in the morning the money would be found as it was found in this country during the emergency&mdash;£7,000,000 for the Army.  If there was a war there would be no question as to where the money was to come from.  Surely to goodness, the people who by their sacrifices made the setting up of this House possible and gave us the liberty to come here as the elected representatives of the people, should get some compensation.  It should not be necessary for us in these days to be making these appeals for the 1916 men and those who served up to 1921.  I remember putting a question to the Minister in 1945 with regard to men in receipt of medals.  The medals were given without a pension.  The Minister, however, at that time brought in the special allowance so that 1916 men who had lost their health or were getting on in <Col N="312" /> years, were able to get it.  That is a thing that was welcomed.  It was something which those men deserved to get.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of the House for ten years, and during all that time I have spoken on this matter on the Estimates and on other occasions.  I come from a town where the men there took part in the 1916 Rising.  I know them, and I know their position as well as anyone.  I know the hardships they went through, of how they lost their employment and how they were despised by some people during that period.  I think that if the Minister were to improve the Bill by giving a decent pension to the few who remain now&mdash;those who served during 1916 and up to 1921&mdash;everyone in this House and outside of it would be pleased.</P>
    <P>Everyone honours and salutes the 1916 men.  I hope that the Minister will be able to improve this Bill on the Committee Stage, even if he has to fight his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to get the money.  The increase proposed in the Bill is very small.  It is miserable when one has regard to the present cost of living. What use is £9 a year to a man who has no other means, who may be unemployed or who may be invalided and cannot work?  That man will still have to go to the home assistance officer to seek some help.  That is a degrading thing.  I think the Minister must understand now, after hearing the views of some of his own Party, that this Bill is not as satisfactory as the House would like it to be.  I agree it is an improvement.  Everyone welcomes any Bill that is brought in for the betterment of the people, whether they be old age pensioners, military pensioners or others.  Deputy Donnellan spoke about the £140,000 that was given back to the dance hall proprietors.  If that tax was put on again, that amount of money, if made available, would satisfy for all time the Old I.R.A., and there would be no grumbling.  If that tax were put on again in order to raise £140,000 to supplement the pensions of the Old I.R.A. men, the Minister would get the support of the House. I hope that the remaining stages of this Bill will go through quickly.</P>
    <P>I do not like the present Pensions Board.  If a man was turned down <Col N="313" /> by the Referee in 1934 or 1936, how is that Referee going to alter his decision if the same man comes before him again?  He is a man who probably should not be there at all.  He was not a very popular man with the I.R.A. I think it would be very hard for him to change his mind.  Therefore, I think a new board should be set up.  The Old I.R.A. organisations have suggested that the board should consist of former officers who had served in their own areas.  They know the companies and battalions that these men belonged to, and they know what they did.  If someone in Dublin Castle is sent down to hold a sitting in the courthouse in Enniscorthy, what does he know about the men I speak of? The local officers are the men who can speak on behalf of these men.  At present when a man goes before the board he may be told that he is not a person to whom the Act applies, and so he is finished with.</P>
    <P>I think that something should be done with regard to the constitution of the board because there is such a thing as spite.  I said here before, although the present Minister disagreed with me, that if you did not see eye to eye with some officers, even though you had a genuine case, they would not give you a reference.  I know that has happened in my own town.  I think it would be much better to have a board composed of the local officers of the area.  They are in a position to vouch for Old I.R.A. men whose claims are still outstanding.</P>
    <P>I hope that this Bill will be improved, especially in the case of those men who are in the lower pension groups.  There are men getting £40, £50 or £60 a year, but then you have other men who are going to get only £9 under this Bill.  That is going to mean no improvement for them, and these are men who, probably, have no other means.  These are the men we should be anxious to look after.  I know well-to-do people who have big I.R.A. pensions, while men who served in the ranks have only 3/6 or 5/- a week.  That is not fair.  I have met a lot of those men and they were disgusted when they saw the increases they were going to get on the small <Col N="314" /> meagre pensions which they have at present.  If the Minister improves the Bill and decides to get more money to meet the cases that I have mentioned he will have the full support of the Labour Party and of all Parties in this House.  If he comes forward with a Supplementary Estimate to improve the financial provisions in this Bill I am sure he will get it through the House without any opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few remarks which I have to make on this Bill I intend to confine myself to what I consider to be the most pressing aspects of the cases which the Minister is seeking to remedy.  I shall deal first with what is set out at the end of the Bill where it is proposed to extend the date.  Deputy Donnellan was not exactly right in stating that divisions that occurred in the continuation of the national struggle were responsible for some of these men not getting recognition.  That had very little to do with it because men who faced such dangers together did not forget one another to that extent.  In my opinion it was due mainly to two factors, the first being that many officers, keymen in many cases, who knew the men of their companies, battalions or brigades and knew of their activities were killed in the national struggle and were not there to verify for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second factor responsible for the fact that some men did not get recognition is one that the Minister will be well aware of and which applied more to country districts than to cities.  In order to keep a company unit in a district, men who went out on activities to-day had to be back at work tomorrow so that it would not be recognised that they had left the area. If they were to be of any use to the movement they had to be back at work on the following day.  Then the question of continuous service arose.  These men were available for service and they did go out.  Very often when these men were called out, not being in the flying column, they were placed at the outskirts of an ambush position and when they were questioned as to whether they fired shots or had taken active part in the ambush position, even though they were the first line <Col N="315" /> on which the security of the ambush position rested, they got no recognition because they had not fired shots or for some such reason.</P>
    <P>That approach to the problem was all wrong.  I know men who are getting on in life, whose health is failing although not to the degree that would qualify them for special allowances, who have got neither medals nor service certificates, and perhaps they will have passed to the Great Beyond before the board considers their cases.</P>
    <P>From that point of view I press very strongly on the Minister the need to establish two or three boards, one in each province, and to put one man of the present board on each of them so that their general efforts may be coordinated. The cases could then go before the Referee.</P>
    <P>Detailed cross-examination of witnesses on something that happened 32, 33, 34 and 35 years ago is altogether unreasonable.  It is unreasonable to expect minute accounts of these matters, and very often a question that is put by a man who has spent years at cross-examination may upset a witness.  If there is any little contradiction apparent it is goodbye to his chances.</P>
    <P>My first appeal then is for those people whose cases have not been considered or whose cases have been turned down at first hearing.  I know a man who was sentenced to death and who was prayed for in church who has got no recognition.  That man is illiterate and is ashamed to admit it. That case and many others are standing injustices, and are a reflection on the way that the matter has been administered.  I hope we will get near to a remedy now for these particular cases, and that those that have not yet been examined will be examined without too much delay, and that those who deserve re-examination will get it.</P>
    <P>As regards the lower group to which reference has been made, it would be a decent thing to fix a minimum pension. An appeal has been made for that.  There should be a minimum of £12 or £13 10s. a year.  I do not go <Col N="316" /> up to £40 or £50 because I know there are certain limitations.  No matter how sympathetic we may be, there are these limitations, and we cannot get over them.  Therefore, our appeals must be reasonable.  In many cases that applies to men who gave continuous service, and who were essential men in their particular units, men who had to continue at their work and who were called out for activities as required in their districts and the surrounding areas.</P>
    <P>There are men who lost opportunities in their professions as a result of taking part in the national movement, perhaps university students or people who had intended pursuing educational courses of one kind or another. They spent seven or eight years of their lives on the hills or in prison cells and, as somebody said, were despised afterwards because of their activities, and because they found it difficult to get employment and had to emigrate or go into walks of life for which they were not prepared.  The whole economy of these men was upset.  They married late in life.  If some of them have a little more than others, because of the position to which their comrades elected them for their leadership and military skill, and by reason of these services and by reason of the fact that military success in many cases depended on their ability&mdash; nobody got any more than he deserved &mdash;such men are a small proportion of the number who served their country in those days.</P>
    <P>This matter must be attended to now because in three or four years the opportunity for compensating these people will have vanished and men will have died without receiving any recognition of their sacrifices.  In their own localities their deeds are well known to their neighbours and everybody sees that they were not looked after as they should have been.  I appeal, then, to the Minister, as all sides of the House have appealed to him, to try now, regardless of a little extra cost, to set this matter right.  By the initiative of the Minister and with a united House we should be able at long last to give these men what their deeds and sacrifices deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The present Bill gives members of the House and members of the other House an opportunity at least to say a few words of gratitude to those who made it possible for this House to exist.  Some of them made the supreme sacrifice.  Others are still with us.  Their sacrifices have resulted in the fact that a body of free Irishmen, elected by the free votes of the Irish people, can sit in this Chamber and manage the nation's affairs.</P>
      <P>It is the culmination of a 700-year struggle for independence, and if this Bill did nothing else but give us an opportunity to express our gratitude and to show that those who did make sacrifices were not forgotten, it is a very good thing.  The Bill, however, is a disappointment to some of us who expected it to have a much wider scope.  Unfortunately, the scope of the debate confines us to the Bill, but I want to express dissatisfaction that it does not go as far as the Minister's statement when replying to a Private Members' motion some time ago led us to believe it would go.</P>
      <P>A vast number of the existing pensions which this Bill proposes to increase are very small, and the 50 per cent. increase granted in some cases is a joke, as the original pensions were a joke.  I am referring to some of the lower pensions.  If we had statistics available to us&mdash;the Minister can enlighten us on this point when replying&mdash;I believe I am right in saying that they would show that 80 per cent. of the pensions are under £25 a year. To my own knowledge, some of them are as low as £9 per year.  That represents the princely sum of 3/6 per week, and the proposal to increase that by 1/9 per week is perpetrating a rather crude joke and making little of those who did their best to establish freedom in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that all these pensions should be revised and I speak now in a spirit of fair play to those who took part in a very dangerous and very arduous struggle.  To my own personal knowledge, some of these did what was an unpopular thing in those days and, apart from the actual danger of being under fire and under suspicion by the <Col N="318" /> Crown forces at the time, some of them had their livelihood affected and were more or less blacklisted as a result and perhaps have had their whole life's prospects destroyed as they were young men at the time.  We who are now enjoying the benefits of their heroic work should at least acknowledge it in an open and manly way.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned that money can be found for other things. It can be found for things that seem very frivolous in the eyes of the people down the country.  The remission of the dance hall tax which brought in £140,000 a year is one instance of it. This Bill will cost something in the neighbourhood of £400,000.  When we can find money for rather frivolous things, things which the people down the country think could wait, it would seem as if we were inclined to treat this matter in a very lighthearted manner.  To the pension of £9, or 3/6 per week, we now propose with all the pomp and panoply of Government to add 1/9 a week.  I should like to know how anybody could arrive at the conclusion that a person's services in establishing the freedom of this country for a period of three years, if not longer, could be measured at 3/6 per week.  It is a puzzle to me how any person could calmly sit on a tribunal and say to such a man: &ldquo;We have decided that what you contributed to the freedom of this country is worth 3/6 a week.&rdquo;  The decent thing to do would be either to give a worthwhile pension or else give none at all. No matter how we look at it, there was a certain insult and slight contained in reducing the amount of the pension to that level.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with another matter that members of this House and the other House come up against very often.  Under previous Acts, the rank held by some of these applicants was reduced.  Why a person who held a certain rank should have that rank reduced when the people in his neighbourhood knew what rank he held is beyond me.  That is an injustice which should be remedied.  The Minister should not leave it to Private Deputies to move amendments, but should take it on himself to amend the previous <Col N="319" /> Acts in so far as they allowed anybody or any board to arrive at a decision to reduce the rank of an applicant for a pension.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister whether Section 5 covers all previous applications which were rejected or whether it applies only to those who have military service medals.  After having read the section and the explanatory memorandum I must confess that I do not feel clear on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister could assure me now that it covers all of them I would not pursue the matter further.  If not, I wish to make a plea that all those rejected should get some chance of again putting their case.  I have not the slightest doubt that in some cases the applications were not supported by sufficient evidence.  I suppose that is bound to arise.  In the discussion on previous Bills, I think the number of applications rejected was given as 48,000.  It would be safe to assume that some of these applications were not supported by sufficient evidence. Nevertheless, there must be among that vast number of rejected applications a substantial quota of persons who are entitled to some recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that because a member of the I.R.A. at that time did not take part in an actual ambush or fight his application was turned down.  From personal experiences related to me by men who were not in ambushes I can say that they were in as grave danger as if they were in ambushes, as they were engaged in the task of taking arms, ammunition, bombs and land mines from place to place, sometimes within very close range of police and military.  Many of them escaped at that time only by a hair's breadth by jumping over a wall or getting out of sight at the last moment.  They were, so to speak, suspected.  I suppose the police and the military and the Black and Tans had good reason to suspect them.  They were taken out and beaten up, with the result that their health has never been the same and their physical condition has never permitted them to work and earn a living <Col N="320" /> as the rest of us do.  They have been incapacitated in one way or another. To my own knowledge limbs were broken in some cases.  Some of them were dragged at the tail of a lorry as the plaything of the wild fellows who were careering through the country at the time.  I think all these should be taken into consideration, and where the board is satisfied that such things happened, and where they see that the applicant before them is physically or mentally incapacitated, and where they are satisfied that that incapacitation is due to the ill-treatment they received, there is, in my opinion, a justifiable case for awarding pensions to these people.  While we are in this mood we should cover all cases.</P>
    <P>There are men who risked their lives. There are men who deserted their parents, their wives and their children and went on the run.  There are men who contracted tuberculosis because of the hardships they endured.  I know that a certain member of this House has been virtually crippled because of the hardships he endured when on the run.  There are hundreds of cases like his up and down the country.  I do not think it is fair that their applications should be turned down.  I do not think we are carrying out the last command given by Pearse before his execution.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I desire now, lest I may not have an opportunity later, to pay homage to the gallantry of the soldiers of Irish freedom who have during the past four days been writing with fire and steel the most glorious chapter in the later history of Ireland.  Justice can never be done to their heroism, to their discipline, to their gay and unconquered spirit in the midst of peril and death.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let me who have led them into this, speak in my own and in my fellow-commanders' name, and in the name of Ireland, present and to come, their praise, and ask those who come after them to remember them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is a very clear command from the grave.  It is a command that should not be treated lightly or flippantly.</P>
    <P>There are men whose word I believe and whose word I take.  I have been <Col N="321" /> told by these men that they were prevented through the promises of some of those who are to-day sitting on the Government Front Bench from joining certain services.  They were told not to join the Garda Síochána.  They were told not to join the National Army.  They were told not to take appointments in the Civil Service.  They were told they would be looked after when Fianna Fáil got the control of the Government into their hands.  One man has informed me that the present Minister and some of his colleagues made these promises.  For a long time these men firmly believed that there would be some recognition of their services and of the sacrifices they made.  I think the Minister and his colleagues should honour these promises.  If the promises were made they should be honoured by them now when the Government has the opportunity.</P>

      <P>I would like proof of the statement that I made any promise to any of the I.R.A. in respect of political matters.  There is no use in making statements of that kind.  The Deputy must remember that we try to act as honourably as we can in politics.  I want to put this on record as far as I am concerned: I have never promised anything to anybody for the sake of securing political kudos.  I think a statement like that coming from an ex-Minister is wrong and should not be made here.</P>

      <P>If the Minister or any of his colleagues did that, all I ask now is that they should honour their promise while this Bill is before the House.  This is one place where we should be in a position to lay bare the truth, merely for the purpose of laying bare the truth and not for the purpose of hurting other people's feelings or trying to secure political kudos.  That has always been my attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a number of deserving cases throughout the country for pension or recognition of some kind.  Due to ill-health, to poverty or to the fact that they live in out-of-the-way places they were not aware of some of the provisions in some of the <Col N="323" /> previous Acts and consequently failed to apply within the time specified. Under Section 5 of this Act there is a provision extending the period to a date six months after the passing of this Act.  May I point out that in the Land Act which I put through a few years back I fixed a date six months after the passing of the Act in order to give some latitude to a certain class whose land was being acquired by the Land Commission?  In reply to a subsequent question it was discovered that there were 93 persons who could have benefited under a particular section, but of that 93 only 23 were aware of the provisions of the section and 70 failed to apply.  The present Minister for Lands promised to bring in an Act rectifying that position.  I think six months is too short.  There will be many deserving people who will be unaware of that time limit, and I think the Minister should consider extending it for at least 12 months.  The 70 people to whom I referred in connection with the Land Act were people who stood to benefit to the extent of £1,000 or £1,500, but they were unaware of the provisions of the section. I have not the slightest doubt that the same thing will happen in connection with this particular Act.  I think the Minister should extend the period by ministerial amendment.</P>
    <P>I have been told there are some people getting pensions who are definitely not entitled to them.  That is a thing I cannot prove; I give it for what it is worth and I will not stress that point further.  However, if there are people who succeeded in getting pensions who are not entitled to them, surely there must be many hundreds outside who are deserving of recognition. I know a neighbour of mine who was almost as much in danger as those who took part in the actual conflict or combat.  In case I cannot be in the House when the Minister is replying and in case Section 5 does not apply to all previous applicants, I would ask the Minister to extend the section to cover it.  In case it only applies to holders of medals I would ask the Minister to consider that point and once and for all to clear up this <Col N="324" /> very vexed and very contentious question which exists all over the country. Let him set the minds of the applicants at rest and say to those who are outside its scope: &ldquo;Very good, you are out of it for all time&rdquo; and give fair play to all those who are entitled to awards.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should take the opportunity between now and the Committee Stage to amend the Bill to cover all these points.  If he does I can guarantee him the full support of the Opposition for the speedy passage of the remaining stages of the Bill through this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a certain amount of hesitation that I rise to speak on this Bill.  I am actually conscious of the fact that many Deputies who have spoken, and probably some who will speak following me, have much closer personal knowledge of the applicants who are likely to apply under the provisions of this Bill.  But I feel, like Deputy Blowick, that it is necessary, for a number of reasons, for Deputies, whether they had actual service during the I.R.A. period or not, to take advantage of this Bill being introduced to pay a tribute to those who made this Republican State possible.  I do that willingly and I offer them that tribute.  As well as that I believe that those of us who, due to our age, had no direct contact with the Republican Army, may see things from a detached point of view, and that our observations of the clauses of the Bill, because of that very fact, may have some special value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also, as Deputies, have the responsibility of expressing the views of those members of our constituency who feel that they have a grievance to ventilate and it is our business to put before the Minister this grievance so that he might in his wisdom either extend or amend this Bill.  I feel as an individual that men and women who have secured a certificate for service in the I.R.A., be it in 1916 or in the later period, should they, at any time, be totally unable to provide for themselves and their dependents, are entitled in justice to secure and have provided for them in this country <Col N="325" /> ample financial means to enable them to carry out their commitments to their dependents.  I say that irrespective of length, irrespective of the engagements that took place, should they be totally unable to provide for themselves through illness or disability, ample provision, so that they could keep themselves and their dependents, should be made for these people.</P>
    <P>I feel that most members of this House and most people in the country would be quite glad and would be prepared to face the financial burden that that assurance would be given to those who served this country well. There is a number of people who are receiving very modest pensions under previous Bills.  It is proposed to increase their awards by 50 per cent. I have in mind the case of a constituent of mine from Waterford City who made application under the first Act.  After a long number of years his case was finally decided upon and he was refused a pension.  He reapplied in 1949 and got an award of £5 4s. 9d. per year.  He will now receive that plus 50 per cent. of it.  Mark you, in 1949 it was admitted by the Court of Referees set up to investigate the case that this man did have I.R.A. service but because of the provisions of the 1949 Act it was not possible to go back further.  Having waited over 15 years this man now finds that he has £5 4s. 9d. per year, dated from some time in 1949 plus a 50 per cent. increase. In his name and in the name of thousands like him who gave service to this country, I suggest to the Minister that he should increase, as far as possible, the award of the small servicemen to a minimum, I suggest, of £25 a year.  I feel that any pension, any recognition of service, be it for long or short, should certainly not be below £25 per year.  It is admitted, and I have heard it said here in the House that there must be some method of measuring service and awarding pensions.  I was glad to hear Deputy MacCarthy on the opposite bench pleading the case of those lower pensioned people.  It was not often due to their own fault that their service was not continuous.  Being soldiers and having to obey orders, they were not put in a place where <Col N="326" /> they could have active service and so they got small awards.  In making the plea for a minimum award of £25, I feel that if the Minister chooses to implement it he will receive the approval not only of this House but of all the people in the country.</P>
    <P>There is just one other section for which I would like to make an appeal. During the glorious week of 1916 a number of men and women in Dublin and in some other centres took their lives into their hands, to give back to this country its sense of independence. Those numbers are, in the course of things, dwindling slowly away.  Most of those who served during the Easter Week Rebellion, the 1916 men and women, have in the main, due to entering the Army and for various other reasons, secured pensions of the rank from which they retired in the Army, and which provided a fair amount for them; but there are some men and women&mdash;one to my own personal knowledge&mdash;who served in 1916 and who are in receipt of a pittance of £21 a year. I would suggest that the Minister should investigate the number of those 1916 men and women who now receive less than £100 per year, and I would say that, as a tribute from this nation to them, the minimum figure should be provided.  I suggest that the number would be small, the financial outlay little.  Unfortunately, the time will be short for which it will be paid.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would say to the Minister that we are glad he has seen fit to introduce this Bill, that we wish him well with it because it is giving some token tribute of the gratitude of the people of this country to the people who served her well in her time of need.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I must refer initially to something for which perhaps I was responsible by reason of the fact that I made reference to another Bill that I was bringing in in a short time.  That statement of mine resulted in some Deputies discussing some things which were outside the scope of the present Bill and bringing in quite an amount of irrelevancies.  I refer to that now <Col N="327" /> because I do not intend to deal with any of the matters which were irrelevant to this Bill, as I will deal with them when they come up on the other Bill.  I hope to be in a position to bring that Bill in before the end of the present session.</P>
      <P>I would also like to refer to a statement that was made initially by Deputy Collins and later by Deputy Norton, I think, and more recently by Deputy Donnellan&mdash;that the &ldquo;dead hand of Finance&rdquo; appears in this Bill. Last evening, the Ceann Comhairle very rightly pointed out that a Minister is always responsible for whatever measure he brings in here.  Civil servants are there as advisers to any Minister and if a Minister, in the course of his investigation of a particular subject, finds it necessary to consult with a civil servant as his adviser, it does not necessarily follow that he will take his advice.  He may do so or may decide to use his own judgment.  I refer to those remarks particularly because I want to put this fact on record.  First of all, I do not think any Deputy here wants knowingly to injure the character of another.  Whatever hostility we may have to each other politically, I do not think we are anxious to go that far, and I want to put on record that, far from the Minister for Finance doing anything in the nature of preventing me from getting the case which I put to the Government advanced, he was one of those on the Government who gave me most help in the consideration of the facts which I had to put before them.</P>
      <P>The Government did consider this Bill over quite a long period of time. It was necessary that they should do so, to examine the pros and cons of the claims that were put forward.  The claims were very wide and very extensive. On the occasion that I met a deputation which put these claims before me in the first instance, I suggested to the deputation at that time that these claims could not be covered by a sum less than about £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I held out no hope that the full claims amounting to that vast sum of money could be met.  I do not think <Col N="328" /> the deputation realised the vast cost of their proposals.  I say that because they were inclined to pooh-pooh the idea that they would run into any such sum as that, but my first duty in handling that claim was to have it costed. That is a necessary preliminary in the examination of a case of that kind by a Minister before he attempts to put it to the Government, and the costings I was given amounted to over £1,500,000, so that the rough estimate of my own that it would run into a figure of almost £2,000,000 was not far out.</P>
    <P>The question then was how the Government should get down to coming to decisions on a matter of such very great concern to such a large number of people.  We referred to a Bill which was brought in in 1950 by the former Minister for Finance.  It was a Bill which applied to quite a number of people&mdash;teachers, civil servants, the Gardaí, I think, and others&mdash;and it was an effort to bring up the pensions of these individuals to a sum which the then Government regarded as fair and reasonable.  When that Bill was being discussed here, I made a very strong plea to the then Minister for Finance to include among the beneficiaries the Old I.R.A.  I pointed out that they were the only section of the community capable of having the Bill applied to them who were left out and I urged that he should include them.  He resisted that appeal and gave his reasons&mdash;they were referred to here last evening by Deputy de Valera&mdash; but we in considering the provisions of that Bill came to the conclusion that they could best be applied to the Old I.R.A. claims, and the concessions which the Government has agreed to in this case are the same as those contained in the Bill of 1950.</P>
    <P>A vast amount of play has been made with the small pensions, the pensions of £6 13s. 4d. and so on.  I should like to know in what way can service be measured other than the way in which it has been decided by the Referee.  There has been very considerable reference in this debate to the Referee.  There have been, to my knowledge, at least four Referees, three of whom have been judges of the Circuit Court, and it is reasonable to <Col N="329" /> assume that these men applied their full legal knowledge to the task with which they were confronted.  I am also prepared to say that it is reasonable, again, to assume that men of that eminence are not going to bring to the discharge of their task such personal considerations as it was suggested they do bring.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested here that the Referee, for some reason of his own, did not give one person a pension, while giving one to somebody else similarly circumstanced.  Statements have been made here that in the case of individuals with identical service, a pension has been granted in one case and not in the other.  I can hardly imagine that these gentlemen would, in any circumstance, deliberately go out of their way to refrain from giving justice as between two individuals.  If the individuals concerned were entitled to service, I am satisfied that the Referee would not be so petty or small as to say: &ldquo;I do not like the attitude of this gentleman, and, because I do not, I am not going to give him a pension.&rdquo; I do not think such a thing has ever entered into the examination of the cases by any one of the four Referees who have operated in respect of these pensions.  These men have the evidence before them of the service given by the individuals and the very fact that they have given pensions as small as they have given is a proof of the meticulous examination they have given to the cases which have come before them.  They have granted these small pensions because they were satisfied that the individuals were entitled to some form of pension.</P>
    <P>When Deputies make the claim that there should be a minimum pension of £25 or some other sum&mdash;the minimum which the Old I.R.A. are claiming is in the region of £50&mdash;we must have some idea of what these claims are likely to cost.  A minimum pension of £50 would cost £250,000.  Deputies have assured me during this discussion that the people would not object to that sum being added to the sum which the Government proposes as the limit to which they can go, the sum of £400,000, which is additional, of course, to the sum already being paid to these pensioners.  A minimum pension of <Col N="330" /> £50 would cost £250,000 per year over and above the increases for which this Bill already provides.  I do not know if Deputies when they give me an assurance that the public would not object to that, are speaking with any authority or that they have any means of finding out that that assurance would be honoured by the public.</P>
    <P>In addition there is another claim, a claim on behalf of the 1916 men to a minimum pension of £100 a year.  A minimum pension of £100 a year would cost in their case £90,000.  These are large sums of money.  Those two classes of pensions, which it has been suggested that the Government should concede, would amount to something like £300,000 in round figures, in addition to the £400,000 which the present provisions of the Bill will cost.  I should like naturally if I were in a position to say that I could accept the propositions put forward by Deputies in these respects, but when one gets into the responsible position of being a Minister, one has got to look at the situation from the point of view of extracting that money from the public purse, and the public purse is John Citizen and his wife.  However much we should like to avoid looking at it from that point of view, we must have regard to that position primarily before we can say: &ldquo;Yes, we accept these conditions; we agree to them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is another aspect in regard to bringing this £6 13s. 4d. that was mentioned here, I think, by almost every Deputy up to say £20.  There again I do not know whether the Old I.R.A. themselves would be enamoured of that proposal for the simple reason that £20 represents four years' service to a man who would rank as private. I wonder would the man who would have four years' service be satisfied to remain where he was if the man who had this small pension which represented about a year's service had his pension brought up to £20.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if he had, the point I want to make is that the £20 man would immediately say: &ldquo;Yes, I agree, provided the pension is proportionately <Col N="331" /> raised in my case also,&rdquo; and I feel he would be justified in doing so.  I want to point out to Deputies, although I am sure they realise it as fully as I do, that, as the pensions awarded were increased in the case of certain individuals, it simply meant that these individuals, in the opinion of the Referee, had a greater amount of service or a greater amount of responsibility.  Some Deputies, in discussing the amount of pensions, seemed to speak slightingly of those who have larger pensions than others.  I do not think that is proper.  I think that the men who carried responsibility as officers and who were able to prove to the different Referees that they had that responsibility, if the Referee was prepared to accept their claim and give them that rank, were entitled to what they were awarded.  I do not think there is anything wrong in that.  Do we not all know that men who officered the Old I.R.A. had to take, in most cases, the greatest amount of responsibility? They had to plan the various campaigns that were undertaken by their units.  They had in most cases to lead the men into the particular ambushes or incidents in which the enemy were attacked.  If an officer was a good officer he was respected by his men, and it was not his fault that only one man out of 20 or 30 could be an officer.  If he was selected as an officer and if he carried out his duties in the manner in which he should carry them out, surely no one will suggest that that officer is not entitled to whatever amount of money he is getting as pension?  Something to that effect has been suggested here, and I do not think it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These were the problems with which the Government were confronted. They were fully aware of the fact that quite a large number of individuals would get amounts that would be regarded as small but unless they were treated as in the 1950 Act to which I have already referred, I do not know what else could have been done.  The Government could have, if the money were there&mdash;and in passing I should like to say that perhaps there was never a worse time financially to deal with these claims&mdash;got the actuaries who <Col N="332" /> framed the 1950 grade of pensions to draft another table of increases but all the time, as I say, at the back of the mind of the Government, was the thought, naturally, of the public purse. We were always faced with that limitation.</P>
    <P>Listening to the debate it occurred to me when I heard some of the very severe criticism that was levelled at this Bill that this Government could have taken the easy way out that our predecessors took&mdash;that was to do nothing at all, to put it on the long finger.  I did not give a promise to anyone that I would bring in a Pension Bill if I were returned to ministerial office.  I never even discussed it with anyone and, to do the Old I.R.A. justice, they never discussed it with me so I was under no obligation good, bad or indifferent to bring in a Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>When the deputation came I naturally received them.  I listened to the case which they made, I gave it the fullest possible consideration and, having done so, I produced it to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made certain recommendations and I am glad to say that most of them.  I were accepted.  Some of them were rejected.  I did not expect that all of them would be accepted.  I did not expect that some of the proposals I put forward would have been added to, but I am glad to say that some of the proposals which I did put forward were not only accepted by the Minister for Finance, but in one case he helped to increase a certain concession in this Bill.  In a vague sort of way there was a suggestion throughout the debate that the dead hand of the Department of Finance was reacting on this Bill.  I do not think I need go any further on the question of the yardstick of service.  Service is the only yardstick so far as I am concerned with which we can measure these pensions. If there is any other means by which these pensions could be dealt with I did not hear it referred to in this discussion.  If we were to raise the small pensions to that of the minimum <Col N="333" /> suggested in the course of this debate, then I would be convinced and I am sure every Deputy in this House would be equally convinced that as soon as we did that there would be a claim by all the other people who are entitled to pensions in other grades. They would seek a proportionate rate of increase also.</P>
    <P>There were various references to the Referee.  There was one suggestion that under the 1924 Act a decision could not be arrived at by one individual, that it had to be arrived at by two.  I think that is correct, but it is also correct for me to say that the Referee in practically every case that I know of arrives at his decision after consultation with the advisory body. The advisory body is there and their purpose is to advise the Referee.  They usually advise him in respect to rank and length of service.  As far as I know, he usually accepts that advice.</P>
    <P>In some respects, I think one Referee went too far.  He went so far that the House took the matter up, and as a result of the discussion which took place in the House, the matter was taken to court.  I am referring to the occasion on which he shared the examination of the cases with his advisory body.  The advisory body, having dealt with the cases, came to him and advised him that such and such amount of service should be given.  But because the Referee was not sitting with the particular individuals to whom he gave that power, the court turned him down.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the present Referee is departing in any respect from the custom that was originated by the first Referee, a custom which has been carried on by two or three others and which is now being carried on by the present Referee.  There have been suggestions that the present Referee is hearing appeals against decisions which he himself gave.  They are not appeals in fact, they are petitions. Anyone who knows anything about the 1949 Act knows that all it did was to allow individuals who believed they could prove they had service to petition to be reheard.  They are being reheard, and the proof that the Referee is dealing with these cases <Col N="334" /> without any prejudice whatever as to whether he heard the cases or not is to be found in the fact that about 1,000 applicants have already succeeded.  I think that is as good a proof as anyone can get in respect to the justice which the Referee is carrying out in regard to these cases.</P>
    <P>There was also the question of 28 days' notice.  A notice of 28 days is given to all new applicants or to those who are coming up now as petitioners and who have not had 28 days' notice on a former occasion.  Where the individuals have already been heard and have appealed and got 28 days' notice they are not now getting that notice. I do not think anyone can complain about that.  We do not want to go on giving 28 days' notice every time a rehearing takes place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan suggested that where a person took part in the movement, and who subsequently joined the Guards or the Civil Service, his years of military service should count as pensionable service.  I think that is correct, is it not?</P>

    <P>Deputy Cowan and myself were at loggerheads in regard to the question of a sergeant who later reached the rank of commandant.  I do not think Deputy Cowan was correct in suggesting that that individual first got his pension when he retired as an officer in 1951.  I think there was a suggestion that that was so.  The facts are that in 1941 he inquired about his pension, and it then became known to the Pension Branch for the first time that he had been discharged in 1935.  The Pension Branch took the view that a notional discharge such as this was not a discharge within the meaning of the 1924 Act.  On seeking legal opinion, they were advised that the discharge was an actual one, and that the pension was properly payable from 1935. The officer was informed of the position, <Col N="335" /> including the fact that the pension as granted would be based on a sergeant's rank.  He asked for the pension, and was given it retrospectively to 1935.  He received some payment almost every year as distinct from other officers who had certificates under the 1924 Act.  It was not until he finally left the Army that he questioned the rank on which his pension was based.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick referred to Section 5 and asked if it extended the time limit for petitions.  It deals with those cases where petitions were not made previously. It does not cover cases where petitions have been rejected already or where pensions were granted.  He also said he knew of individuals who were severely injured in the course of their old I.R.A. service but who, despite the fact that they were severely injured, did not receive pensions. Actually, the position would be that if these people received injuries and could prove service they would have been entitled to apply for a disability pension if they could prove that the disability was incurred in the course of service given.  Later, as Deputies well know, if the injuries, &mdash;as suggested, I think, by Deputy Blowick&mdash; prevented such a person from earning his livelihood he could have applied for a special allowance.  Therefore, I do not think there is anything very much in that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick also asked for an extension of the period for making applications to 12 months.  I think Deputy Ted O'Sullivan went further and suggested that there should not be any limit at all: there might be something in that suggestion.  After extending the right to make an application year by year for 28 years in one case, and year by year for 18 years in the other case, there does not seem to me, anyhow, to be much sense in putting any limit to the period now. No doubt there are legal aspects to the matter which I do not see and which Deputies do not see at the moment. That is how the matter appears to me.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy went a little lower in regard to minimum pensions than some other Deputies: he suggested that the lowest pension should be £12. These are all suggestions of ways and <Col N="336" /> means of getting over the difficulty of the very low pension.  They are only suggestions, and I feel that any departure from the yardstick of service will lead me, and eventually the House, into very grave difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am pretty certain that no Old I.R.A. man will object to giving £20 a year as a minimum pension to a comrade, but he will at least feel that if a man with one year's service is getting £20, as against his four or five years' service, his amount should proportionately be increased.  That is one of the grave difficulties which I see in relation to these questions.  As I said on other occasions when I was dealing with these Bills, the various views put forward by the different Deputies in the House will be examined very carefully and will be brought to the attention of the Government by myself.</P>

      <P>I want to thank the Minister for correcting one aspect of the matter which I mentioned yesterday in regard to the sergeant who was promoted to the rank of commandant. The only information which I had was that which I had received yesterday. It was a copy of a letter addressed to the Minister in November, 1952, and the reply from the Secretary of the Department which stated that the date of his discharge determined his pension. I am glad to know from the Minister that the Department's view was the view which I held&mdash;that that notional, as they term it, but fictional, as I term it, discharge was not a discharge at all.  That particular officer acted foolishly in claiming a pension before it had reached its maximum.  I ask the Minister to have the matter examined again.  I can assure him that it will come before him again, because I understand that five or six people are similarly affected and obviously a promotion from the rank of sergeant to that of second-lieutenant is not a discharge from the Defence Forces.  I think the Minister would agree with that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1. To add the following definition:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;restrictive trade practices&rdquo; shall, in relation to the supply and distribution of goods include&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any practices, measures, rules, agreements or acts whether put into effect or intended to be put into effect by a person alone or in combination or agreement, express or implied, with others or through a merger, trust, cartel, monopoly or other means or device whatsoever which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) are designed or likely unduly or unjustly to limit or restrain free and fair competition; or</P>
      <P>(b) are in unreasonable restraint of trade, or</P>
      <P>(c) are designed or likely to have the effect of substantially lessening or interfering with free and fair competition or unjustly eliminating a competition in trade or business or manufacture, or</P>
      <P>(d) unduly enhance the price of goods or promote unfairly the advantage of either manufacturers, producers or distributors of goods at the expense of the consumer or the public, or</P>
      <P>(e)  are designed or likely to secure a substantial or complete control of the manufacture or distribution of goods or any classes of goods, or</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> (f) prohibit or restrict without just cause the supply of goods to any person or classes of persons, or give preference in regard to the provision of or the placing of orders for the supply of goods, or</P>
    <P>(g)  limit or restrict or are likely to limit or restrict the exercise by any person of his freedom of choice as to what goods or classes of goods he will manufacture, purchase or sell or his technique of manufacture or production or the area in which he will sell or distribute his goods, or</P>
    <P>(h)  impose unjust or unreasonable conditions in regard to the supply or distribution of goods, or</P>
    <P>(i) are designed to exclude or are calculated to exclude without good reason new entrants to any manufacture, trade or business, or</P>
    <P>(j) are designed or calculated to secure the territorial division of markets between particular persons or classes of persons to the exclusion of others, or</P>
    <P>(k) are likely to result in injury to the national economy or to operate to the detriment of the public interest, or</P>
    <P>(l) are not in accordance with the principles of social justice.</P>
    <P>Provided always that nothing in the foregoing description of the expression &ldquo;restrictive trade practices&rdquo; shall include any practices, measures, rules, agreements or acts which are</P>
    <P>(a)  <i>bona fide</i> designed and operate to encourage production, or increased efficiency in manufacture or distribution, or the elimination of waste, or orderly markets, or distribution, or a fair and just price for sale and resale or the maintenance and increase of employment and</P>
    <P>(b) which are not contrary to the principles of social justice or the public interest.</P>
    <P>In the course of the remarks which I made on the Second Reading of this Bill I criticised it on a number of grounds.  One of my chief criticisms <Col N="340" /> was the fact that there was no definition or description in the Bill of &ldquo;restrictive trade practices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I may just shortly state the basis of that criticism, I think I can put it into one sentence&mdash;that if we do not know what restrictive trade practices we are aiming at in this Bill then how can the commission that is charged with responsibility of different kinds under this Bill perform effectually those responsibilities on a completely uncharted course?</P>
    <P>I stated, in the course of my observations, that I would on the Committee Stage put forward alternative proposals to deal with those restrictive practices to which all sections of this House are opposed.  I, accordingly, addressed myself to the task, not an easy one, of fulfilling the undertaking, if I may dignify it with that expression, that I gave on the Second Reading. The first task that I was faced with was the task of giving a definition or description of the expression &ldquo;restrictive trade practices.&rdquo;  Now, on the Order Paper here an amendment is down in my name as being &ldquo;to add the following definition.&rdquo;  I am not responsible for the word &ldquo;definition&rdquo; in that document.  It was deliberately left out in my draft and was put in, presumably, by some official in the Dáil office without my authority, I carefully avoided, in the clause to the amendment I put forward, using the expression &ldquo;definition&rdquo;.  In the proviso to the clause, I used the words, in reference to the description of trade practice &ldquo;the foregoing description of the expression&rdquo;, and the way in which it is down here is &ldquo; `restrictive trade practices' shall, in relation to the supply and distribution of goods include&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My purpose was not to define restrictive trade practices, and I want to make it clear that the word in the Order Paper is not mine.  My purpose was merely to give a description of the phrase &ldquo;restrictive trade practice&rdquo;, a method adopted and a method well known to the parliamentary draftsman in various statutes on our Statute Book when he proceeds to put into what is called a definition clause of a Bill or statute a description which is not a definition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> I want to make it clear that I have not set out to give an exhaustive, comprehensive or exclusive definition of the expression &ldquo;restrictive trade practice&rdquo;. What I have done, and what I hope I have fairly well done, is to give a list of those practices which may properly be described as restrictive trade practices of the type that this Bill, I believe, should be aimed against.</P>
    <P>In the clause dealing with private property in the Constitution, Article 43, the right of private property is acknowledged and safeguarded, and provision is made that the exercise of that right of private ownership may be regulated by statute, but must be regulated in accordance with the principles of social justice.  Now, that phrase, &ldquo;the principles of social justice&rdquo; is not an easy phrase to describe or to define, but we start with this assurance, at all events, that our Supreme Court has stated that, notwithstanding the recognition by that court of the difficulty of ascertaining what those principles of social justice are or may be, that court will, if and when the occasion arises, undertake the task, in a particular case, of saying whether or not those principles have been abrogated by statutory regulations.  Therefore, we have the fact that our courts are prepared to undertake that task, and, knowing that, I set out in the proposals that I have made in this particular amendment, and in some other amendments that I have put in, to secure what I also said in my Second Reading speech was essential, that our courts should have some control and some say in determining whether or not a particular individual had been a party to or privy to restrictive trade practices.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, this description which I have put in here in the first amendment is integrated into some other amendments that I have down to later sections dealing with the proposed power to the courts to grant an injunction. Dealing, however, with this descriptive passage that I have put in here, I want to make it clear that I do not claim for the descriptions which I have given here of restrictive trade practices that those descriptions are comprehensive or exclusive or that they catch everybody or every kind of <Col N="342" /> restrictive practice to which objection might lawfully be taken.  The way it is put in as a description does not preclude the court or anybody else from saying, in a given set of facts, that these facts constitute a restrictive trade practice.</P>
    <P>I am fully conscious that human ingenuity, legal ingenuity, if you like, and certainly commercial ingenuity will be able, no matter what is done in this or any other Bill, to find methods, ways and means of getting round any machinery or any plan that may be devised to prohibit restrictive trade practices.  But, at all events, I do claim for the effort I have made that at least it gives some guide, some indication of the way in which the commission which is to be appointed under this Bill, if it be appointed, should act. It gives them a headline, it gives them something by which to regulate their conduct and something to which their consideration should be directed on particular facts brought before them where it is alleged that an individual or group of individuals are engaged in restrictive trade practices.</P>
    <P>I objected very strongly, and I still object, to Section 3 of this Bill.  That section, as it stands, purports to permit the commission to frame and publish fair trading rules.  How can that commission publish these fair trading rules if they have not got the remotest idea, or some guide, as to what are restrictive trade practices?  How can the commission, when they purport to act under subsequent provisions in the Bill, if they become law, in advising the Minister&mdash;how can they justly frame and do justice between various citizens if they have no guide to direct them as to what are restrictive trade practices?  They are left completely at large to do what they like.</P>
    <P>A particular commission, in its outlook on what are restrictive trade practices, must have a different idea from another commission that may subsequently be appointed by a different Minister.  In other words, as I have said, there is no guide, and the commission inevitably must change in accordance with the political complexion of the Minister that appoints it. A conservative Government, if it ever was in this House, might take the view <Col N="343" /> that restrictive trade practices should be merely restricted, and the people appointed by such a conservative Government, with an outlook on private enterprise of a character that would permit the operation, the unrestricted and unrestrained operation, of trade practices to which we object, might very conceivably appoint to this commission people who had <i>bona fide</i> held the view that restrictive trade practices were to be very strictly confined in their scope.</P>
    <P>It will be observed, when an analysis is made of the various clauses that I have put into this description, that underlying the whole of them there are two principles: one, that there should be permitted as full and as free and as fair competition in industry and trade as possible, that anything that unduly, unfairly or unjustly interferes with the right of the individual citizen of this State freely and fairly to trade as he thinks fit should be very carefully regulated.</P>
    <P>The second principle underlying it is an endeavour to reconcile two conflicting interests.  I am anxious, and I think most of my colleagues on this side of the House are anxious, that there should be as restricted as possible any further interference by the State in the conduct of trade, business and industry.</P>
    <P>We do not want to let out from this House, if we can avoid it, a measure which will give power to any Minister or any Government, whatever Party they may belong to, unduly to interfere again in trade, industry or commerce.  Accordingly the underlying principle is to protect the public interest and the interest of the consumer while at the same time giving a measure of justice and security to the right of people to carry on their own business as they like, in the manner that they wish.  Private enterprise should have free scope without undue interference provided always that the exercise of that right of free enterprise does not transgress the principles of social justice that are referred to in the Constitution or unduly prejudice the right of individual citizens to free and fair competition or prejudice the right of the consumer in connection with his purchasing of essential goods.</P>
    <P>As I say, the description that I have <Col N="344" /> given here of the phrase is an endeavour to reconcile these two interests and, accordingly, while in the first part of the description lists are set out in paragraphs of a variety of matters which can be properly regarded as restrictive practices, at the end of it I have inserted a proviso that nothing in the description of the expression &ldquo;restrictive trade practices&rdquo; shall be deemed to include any practices, measures, rules, agreements or acts which are <i>bona fide</i> designed and operate to encourage production, or increased efficiency in manufacture or distribution, or the elimination of waste, or orderly markets, or distribution, or a fair and just price for sale and resale or the maintenance and increase of employment and which are not contrary to the principle of social justice or the public interest.</P>
    <P>That proviso as drafted is an effort to take out from the scope of this commission any such measures or practices which most of us will agree are not restrictive trade practices but which some particular Minister with a particular social or political outlook might very conceivably think was a restrictive trade practice.  It is an effort again to reconcile the interest of the public and the consumer and the right of the individual carrying on a trade, the right to free and fair competition and the right of free enterprise.</P>
    <P>In the course of observations that were made by spokesmen representative of business and industry when this Bill came out first, attention was directed to and emphasis was laid upon the allegation that there was a number of these trade practices which might appear to be restrictive but which in fact were good for industry and trade and good for the public and good for the consumer.  If there be, and I think there are, such practices and measures and acts, whether done by an individual or any combination, then they ought to be protected.  There is no protection in the Bill as it stands at the moment.</P>
    <P>I urge upon the House the necessity for having some such description as is here.  I do not put it forward as perfect.  I do not put it forward as anything approaching perfection.  I put it forward as suggestions.  The <Col N="345" /> Minister can get his experts to examine them, dissect, analyse them, add to or subtract from them, but I do think it is fundamental, if this Bill is to have any effect whatever, that there should be some sort of description as a guide to the commission and to the courts as to what in the opinion of the Oireachtas will constitute restrictive trade practices.  Otherwise, the commission is completely free; it has no guide, it is completely without any notion as to what are restrictive trade practices and, accordingly, each particular commission will decide in accordance with the personal views of the personnel of that commission, which must vary from time to time, what are and what are not restrictive trade practices.</P>
    <P>I feel so strongly on this matter that I have no doubt that if something of this character is not inserted in the Bill and if something of the scheme that I have outlined to meet the situation as I see it is not inserted in this Bill and if the Bill goes on to the Statute Book as it was introduced into this House, then this is a measure of little if any value to the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Bill was being prepared I did not consider it necessary to insert in it any definition of restrictive trade practices.  I did not see that such a definition was required except to the limited extent that it appears by implication in Section 7.  It seemed to me that there was danger in attempting to define, a danger of which, apparently, Deputy Costello became conscious when he himself set his hand to that task.  If we define restrictive trade practices, we are taking the risk that our definition will be incomplete, that it may exclude the possibility of action against objectionable practices which do not fit into our definition and the further risk that the intentions of the Dáil may become distorted in the course of time as courts of law proceed to interpret the wording that we may choose to adopt in defining these practices.  In so far, then, as there is a desire to have a definition of restrictive trade practices which could come in any way within the purview of the courts, I think it is undesirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I received Deputy Costello's <Col N="346" /> amendment, however, and being anxious to go as far as is reasonable, in my view, to meet various views which were expressed here during the Second Reading debate, I asked myself whether there would be any objection to having in a Bill a definition of restrictive trade practices as a headline, to use Deputy Costello's phrase, for the fair trade commission, and I came to the conclusion that there could be no objection.  For that purpose, therefore, I am prepared to take Deputy Costello's amendment and, subject to certain changes in it which I will indicate, to have it inserted in the Bill as an indication to the fair trade commission proposed to be established of the kind of practices that the Dáil had in mind when enacting the measure as a headline to which they should have regard, particularly in the framing of voluntary fair trading rules.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello admitted that the task that he undertook in attempting to define these practices was a difficult one and he indicated that he was not satisfied that he had, in fact, been able to produce definitions which would be watertight or satisfactory from every point of view.  I think that we can adopt, in the main, the various paragraphs of his amendment, subject to some redrafting.  But there are some observations which I think I must make, because they refer to objections which are wider in character than those that might be made to the actual phraseology used in the drafting points which I have in mind.  I think that if we are to set out in a Bill a definition of restrictive trade practices as a headline to the fair trade commission we must find a form of words which will make it quite obvious that we are not limiting in any way the kind of practices that they are there to deal with if they consider them objectionable.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I do not think we can attempt to put into legislation, even as a headline, references to the principles of social justice.  As Deputy Costello says, they are not easy to explain or to define.  I think we should confine our definition to specific trade practices which we know or believe to exist, and which we desire to eliminate and try to get a form of <Col N="347" /> words which will make it clear that the fair trade commission is there to deal with any practices which operate to restrict competition, restrain trade, or involve resale price maintenance.</P>
    <P>In my view, Deputy Costello spoiled this whole draft by putting in the proviso.  It seems to me that the proviso rather nullifies everything in it.  In my experience, every restrictive trade practice, even those that we all agree are objectionable and should be eliminated, is defended by those who operate it on one or other of the grounds set out in the amendment, and if this definition is to be used as a headline to the fair trade commission the proviso is not necessary, because it will be precisely their function to decide and to report their view as to whether a particular trade practice, which in some circumstances might be objectionable, might nevertheless be permitted in others because it promoted efficiency, eliminated waste, stimulated production, or did any of the other things set out in the proviso.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello had in mind something different from the section of the Bill.  As it stands, nothing will come before the courts except the question whether a statute has been broken. Any Order made under this Bill by the Minister on a report from the fair trade commission will have no legal effect until it has been enshrined in a Bill passed by the Dáil and put on the Statute Book as law.  Then and only then do the courts come into the picture, and they come in to the extent of determining whether in a particular case an individual firm has violated a provision of that law.  They will not, therefore, it seems to me, be called upon to decide themselves whether a particular practice is restrictive of trade or contrary to the principles of social justice or otherwise objectionable. That will have been decided by the Oireachtas when it has enacted the legislation confirming the Order and made it a matter of law.  That being so, it seems to me that this proviso and general qualification cannot be left in, that the only thing we need, as the <Col N="348" /> Deputy put it, is a headline to the fair trade commission, an indication to them of the type of practices that they are to have special regard for, both in framing fair trading rules and making their report under Section 7.</P>
    <P>On that basis, I would be prepared to have this series of definitions considered and redrafted so as to provide for what I have in mind.  However, a further change would be necessary. The Deputy in some of his sub-sections has a reference to manufacturers.  The aim of the Bill is to deal with restrictive practices in regard to the supply and distribution of goods.  I think it is desirable that we should confine this intended legislation to that.  In fact, we have not got any monopolistic condition in industry of which we are not fully aware and which we have not ourselves either established by law or impliedly sanctioned by the provision of protection in one form or another. The aim of the fair trade commission will be to deal with the supply and distribution of goods.  I think it would be wise to confine the series of definitions set out in the sub-section proposed by Deputy Costello in conformity with the title of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister has gone a considerable distance to meet the point of view I put forward.  I want to assure him that I have no undue pride in my draftsmanship and that he is at liberty to make any change which the expert draftsman advises.  I think I could not possibly pass by the phrase that the Minister used in reference to the courts.  His notorious objection to the courts of justice having anything to do with this has emerged on this occasion.  I wonder does the Minister ever advert to the fact that our courts are courts of justice and that they are there for the purpose of every citizen getting justice under the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister objected to the courts having anything to do with these matters.  One of the reasons he gave for his objection was the risk of the intention of the Dáil being distorted by the courts.  What risk of a character of that kind can be compared to the risk that may be run by individual citizens whose rights may be invaded <Col N="349" /> by the political commission set up under this Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Let us start with the fundamental proposition that this commission is appointed by the Minister.  Under the provisions of the Bill as it stands at the moment any appointee can be removed without an instant's notice.  That is a political commission. It is true that the commission cannot of itself act, but when it gives advice to the political Minister that appointed it, and if that advice is of a character that commends itself to that Minister, then the Minister presents that to the Dáil, and in theory, of course, it is the Dáil that gives that Order statutory effect, and the Order thereupon becomes an instrument with statutory effect, as the Minister himself said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is, as everybody knows, that that Minister would have to go out of office unless he had a majority behind him here politically supporting his political views.  Therefore the whole of this matter is impregnated with the particular views of the particular Minister who appoints the commission politically to reflect his views and whose opinion will not be accepted unless it is in accordance with that Minister's view.  That Minister cannot get those views through this House unless he has behind him a political Party to walk into the Lobby in support of him.  That is the practical effect of this proposal.  I, therefore, insist that there is far greater risk of injustice being done by a commission of that kind than there is in allowing our courts of justice to decide, our courts of justice which have been set up under the Constitution to give an individual whose rights are impaired a chance of making his case in&mdash;let me <Col N="350" /> again emphasise it&mdash;our courts of justice.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point made by the Minister that the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; should be left out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am prepared to agree with the Minister's point of view to a certain extent but I want to advance one argument against his point of view.  It occurs to me that the word &ldquo;supply&rdquo; in its ordinary and natural connotation would include &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo;. One cannot get a supply of goods unless one gets them from the person who produces them.  He gives them to the wholesaler, the wholesaler supplies them to the retailer and the retailer supplies them to the consumer. Therefore, the word &ldquo;supply&rdquo; must include manufacture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister thinks the phrase has gone too far, I am not wedded to any particular letter, word or comment of that description. The Minister said I spoiled the effort I made in the beginning of the suggested definition.  I put that in for the <Col N="351" /> purpose of making it clear that I had not overlooked the fact that people claim that their particular trade practices, though they may in some senses be regarded as restrictive, can in other senses be regarded as conducive to the public good and even to the good of the consumer.  I do not want these particular practices to be swept into the net and my effort in that proviso was merely an attempt to safeguard these proper practices and at the same time to assure those people who are risking their money and their energy in industry and commerce and business here that there will be no undue interference in their particular practices.</P>
      <P>I thought I had safeguarded the point made by the Minister, namely, that paragraph (a) would be descriptive of the kind of practice that these gentlemen very frequently refer to as the only kind of practice they are indulging in, and that they indulge in it for the benefit of the community.  I thought I safeguarded that by putting in paragraph (b).  I thought I had got both in that.  If the Minister can produce an alternative scheme, plan, definition or description which will safeguard private enterprise, business, manufacture, trade and commerce here from undue interference by the State in its affairs and permit of the regulation of such business by agreement between the interested parties in a manner that is not contrary to the interests of the consumer, to the interests of the public or to the principles of social justice, then I am quite satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will withdraw his amendment, I will produce an alternative amendment on the same principles on the Report Stage and the Deputy can then have the pleasure of pulling that to pieces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand this amendment is not being accepted.  Will it be redrafted in such a way as to safeguard the position, because I can see danger along the lines of redrafting in the light of the Minister's speech?  The Minister said this might affect the scope of the inquiry of the fair trading commission.  That is not so.  As I understand it, Deputy Costello explained that he did not put <Col N="352" /> down the amendment as it stands and that he did not intend that this was to be a definition.  He wanted it to be an explanation or an exposition of these things.  The Minister will see that, even taken as a definition, it cannot restrict, and it does not restrict. The phrase is that &ldquo;it shall include&rdquo;. It does not say it shall mean.  There is a vast difference between the two.</P>
      <P>I think that gets rid of one point made by the Minister in his halfhearted acceptance of this.  The second point indicates to me a greater danger still.  There is an objectionable framework built into this unsatisfactory Bill. The Bill is unsatisfactory, because it merely sets up a commission and asks them to make inquiries.  They may make a report and submit it to the Minister; the Minister may or may not make an Order and the Oireachtas may or may not pass the Order.  It is only then the matter becomes law, but the outcome of all these long, drawn-out inquiries by this circuitous route is an approach to the courts.</P>
      <P>The Minister says the courts may distort the law.  If they are suspect of being able to employ prejudice in favour of traders that may distort the law, they will distort the law that will have to be passed under Section 8. I understood the Minister to make that point against Deputy Costello's arguments. How do the courts operate in other matters in regard to legislation passed?  The courts have the power to make decisions on such legislation. In the present instance the Minister's Bill will eventually go before these maligned courts, who again will have the power to distort.  If the Minister's arguments that they are ever able or likely to distort the law are valid, it is clear they can distort these Orders confirmed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister takes amazing objection, from my point of view, to Deputy Costello's bringing in the principles of social justice.  Where did this phrase first get legislative sanction?  In the Constitution?  The courts have in the Sinn Féin funds case laid down as a rule that they, after that case, would be the judges of what such things as social justice demand.  If the courts continue to construe a Constitution <Col N="353" /> where they may have to decide what the principles of social justice are, why can they not construe these at the second remove if a fair trading commission has construed what in their view are the principles of social justice and have decided for or against trade practices as to whether they are in accordance with the principles of social justice or contrary to them?</P>
    <P>I personally would like to see the phrase in and remaining in because I would like to see Orders based on those principles, so that the courts again would get the opportunity of enlarging the general view expressed in the Sinn Féin funds case.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to refer to the Minister's objection to manufacturers. Deputy Declan Costello had raised here the precise point on the Second Reading, as to whether supply did or did not include manufacturers.  The point was pressed several times, and people eventually spoke on the understanding that supply did include manufacturers and there was no denial of that.  In column 816, Volume 134, of the Dáil Debates of Friday, 31st October, 1952, the Minister said in regard to price maintenance arrangements:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That term is applied to agreements made between manufacturers or wholesale suppliers and retailers...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand it is accepted that the word &ldquo;suppliers&rdquo; does include manufacturers. Why should we exempt manufacturers from this?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not exempted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister object to Deputy Costello's phrase which includes that to a greater degree than his legislation might?  Why exclude them specifically.  They will only come in if something in the nature of restrictive trade practice is found to be practised by them, and if such is found to be practised by them why should they not come under whatever the limited effect of this measure may be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as Deputy McGilligan's amendment is concerned, we will discuss that when we come to <Col N="354" /> it and consider then whether the Bill, as I have introduced it, is not better than he proposes to make it.  Let me be quite clear about my attitude to the courts in this matter.  As to whether a law is in accordance with the Constitution or not is something to be decided by the courts but decisions as to whether it is desirable that petrol pumps should be supplied only to garages or should also be supplied to hotels, or whether the Guinness brown label is a fair trade practice or not, or whether the retail price maintenance of tobacco manufacturers are in accordance with the public interest, in my view the Dáil is a far better body to decide such questions than the courts of justice. Therefore, the procedure of this Bill is to have these questions of public policy decided here and, if decided here, legislation enacted to give effect to that decision.  That legislation will be enforced in the courts.  They will have the duty of deciding whether an individual manufacturer or trader in a particular case has violated that law or not.  They can, of course, also decide whether the law as a whole is contrary to the Constitution but decisions of public policy, what constitutes the public interest in trade matters arising from decisions here, cannot be a matter for the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. J.A. Costello Mr. J.A. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be no objection to the statement made by the Minister, that what constitutes public policy is a matter for the Oireachtas alone.  The courts do not interpret matters of policy.  They only interpret legislation.  What I am urging and what the Minister overlooks entirely because his mental attitude will not let him appreciate it, is that the courts are there to prevent injustice, and injustice may be done by the procedure proposed here, and for this purpose of seeing that injustice is not done I wish to have resort to the courts, whether by the machinery which I have suggested or by some other machinery.  We will deal with that when we come to the particular amendment I have down.  I put that amendment down for the purpose of tying the procedure I suggested in with the procedure of this <Col N="355" /> Bill.  I could suggest half a dozen other methods but I will deal with the whole matter when we come to the amendment.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to understand by this commission, which is a political commission, whose decisions are ultimately to be translated into statutory effect by a majority of the Dáil, that there is something entirely different from public policy and that people can be very seriously prejudiced and wrongly affected by the procedure for it and have no remedy.  What I want to do is to ensure that this Bill will make people confident that they can have resort to the independent tribunals of the court if they feel they are unjustly treated by the machinery of this Bill.</P>

      <P>That the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be deleted and the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>It is just to give the commission a freer hand in this matter.  As the Minister said, this is to a certain extent experimental and the commission will be feeling their way.  It would be wiser, I consider, not to tie the commission's hands, that it ought, at the request of an association, to publish rules.  There may be circumstances in which it would not wish to publish rules or there might be circumstances in which they thought that the request for such rules was reasonable.  The hands of the commission would be less tied by the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; than the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view it would not be a desirable thing at all.  The purpose of Section 3 is to empower the commission to prepare fair trading rules for any trade, rules which would have no statutory effect but which may become recognised as a code of conduct for those engaged in that trade.  The hope is that trade associations which are operating objectionable restrictive practices at the moment will, rather than face an inquiry under Section 6 of the Bill, voluntarily abandon those practices and come to the commission, in so far as they believe that some rules are necessary for the conduct of their trade, and to have fair rules prepared by the commission which they may adopt.  It is desirable that any trade association that decides to adopt that course should know that the commission will do it for them, that it will not be merely a matter at the discretion of the commission.  If any recognised or reputable trade association decides to adopt that course, they can come to the commission and request it to prepare these rules, and the commission <Col N="357" /> will be obliged to do it.  I think that if we, by effecting the change suggested by the Deputy, create doubt in the minds of trade organisations who are trading on that basis, it would be an undesirable step and would discourage the voluntary movement which I hope may emerge as a result of the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see the purpose of the section &mdash; or, in fact, of the next three sections.  In the main the experience anyone has had with any of these associations is that they publish rules for their members and these rules are designed to protect the interests of the members.  In the main, membership results in a particular individual accepting these rules.  That is a prerequisite of the granting of membership.  Invariably the objectives are the particular matters which this Bill is designed to eliminate.  Associations of that sort may prescribe rules which will prevent members selling <Col N="358" /> particular goods below a price fixed by the association or by the supplier; it may prevent them seeking to trade in an area where another member already is trading.  There is a whole variety of practices of that sort.  I do not think any case has been made that these rules can assist the public, if the particular practices are not prevented by the operations of the fair trade commission. In other words, if any association complies with the requirements of the fair trade commission in connection with a supply or distribution of goods, what is the necessity for fair trading rules?  Most of the regulations I have mentioned were designed to protect the members of the association rather than assist or protect the public.  The activities of the commission will be directed towards preventing any abuse on the part of individuals or on the part of an association.  If abuses are brought to light or if some action conflicts with the definition which it is proposed to insert in the Bill, then the association or the individual will, after the passage of the required statutory instrument here, be obliged to discontinue the practice.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister say what beneficial result will flow from the publication of fair trading conditions or rules as provided for in Section 3 and the consequent review under Sections 4 and 5?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As I saw the Minister's argument for Section 3 on the Second Reading, it amounted largely to the point that it was not possible to list restrictive practices.  I understand that, while I was out trying to arrange amicably certain matters which we got a bit hot about to-day, the Minister agreed to the principle that some of them should be listed, as in Deputy Costello's amendment. It seems to me that, once that is accepted, the necessity for Section 3 disappears entirely.  As the section is phrased at present, it seems far more likely to enshrine restrictive practices rather than prohibit them and will not do anything whatever to prevent them. It is far more likely to set them up within limits &mdash; and within those limits those practices can easily be operated by persons engaged in the trade.  For <Col N="359" /> example, there is a well-known device that lists of people to be supplied are circulated by an association and everybody in the trade or who wants to get into the trade is on that list; but they are in a certain order, and everybody in the trade knows that you do not go beyond page three or four, as the case may be.  This type of rule will be set up, and it will be very much easier for those who want to operate that restrictive practice to operate it under the type of rule set out in Section 3 than if there were no section there at all.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, I want to add this to the point that Deputy Dockrell made.  As the section is phrased, an association representing only 1 per cent. of those engaged in a trade is entitled to seek a mandatory Order. The section does not say that the association is to be representative of persons engaged in the trade, but that it is to be an association representing persons in the trade.  There is a vast difference there.  An association that represents only 1 per cent. would be entitled to take action, possibly without the concurrence of the other 99 per cent.  So far as that aspect goes, Deputy Dockrell is absolutely right. It is unnecessary to go into his amendment on this section, as the section is a bad one and should be abandoned &mdash; particularly since we have accepted amendment No. 1, subject to drafting changes &mdash; as the only result of what is left would be the enshrinement of restrictive practices in the trade rather than their abandonment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the section as much as the amendment, but perhaps that is not undesirable.  While the amendment may not of itself be of greater importance, it does bring up this question of how we intend the fair trading commission to work under Section 3.  May I say straight away that I do not contemplate that the drafting of fair trading rules under this section by the fair trading commission would be undertaken only where the majority of the trade so desired.  I have no objection whatever to the commission proceeding to draw up fair trading rules of a non-statutory, <Col N="360" /> voluntary type at the request of a minority, provided the commission are satisfied that they are a responsible minority or group who desire to have proper rules of conduct established for their trade in which restrictive practices may be prevalent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>As the section is drafted, there is no such proviso.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the difference between myself and Deputy Sweetman, if I understand his point of view, is that, while I am anxious to eliminate from trade every objectionable restrictive practice, every practice which, on examination, is held to be contrary to the public interest, I recognise the possibility that there are some practices which, even though restrictive of competition, would be held, after objective examination by an impartial commission, to be desirable and in the public interest.  I think Deputy Costello came to the same conclusion when drafting his amendment because that is the implication of his proviso. He recognised that in some cases practices which might be generally condemned might nevertheless be justified in the particular circumstances of an individual case.  It is the job of the body carrying out the examination to decide whether, in fact, that justification can be fairly advanced and should be accepted in a particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me tell the House how I think this will work.  Suppose we here at the moment are members of a trade association engaged in the sale of some goods and we have rules which confine membership of our association to traders who have stores of a certain size or which contain certain equipment or who employ workers with particular qualifications, rules which they can justify, whatever their motive in making them, on the ground that they eliminate distribution costs or ensure better service to the public, or in some other way serve the public interest. We would not know now whether we were going to be brought before the fair trading commission, made the subject of a public inquiry and have new rules forced on us by law.  We would not wish that to happen.  We <Col N="361" /> would prefer voluntarily to comply with the public interest in the matter and therefore it is desirable that we should have this channel out of a public inquiry; this right to go to the commission and to say: &ldquo;Here are our rules.  Do you think they are objectionable or not?  If you think they are, revise them in the way you think they require to be revised in the public interest and we will undertake to apply voluntarily in our trade the rules you think should be applied or make the changes in our existing rules which you think should be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the idea behind Section 3, that right of voluntary action to trade associations who want to get their record clear and to adjust their rules and regulations in accordance with the views of this commission as to what constitutes the public interest.  I think it desirable that that means should be available to them, rather than that the only method by which these practices could be changed under the Bill should be by a process of a public inquiry leading to legislation.  If that is so, I think it is desirable that any group of traders who want to get that improvement in their rules and regulations made voluntarily should have an assurance that, if they go to the commission, the commission will not refuse to hear them.  That is why I prefer the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a case for the free access of a trade association to the fair trading commission and that is perfectly reasonable, but the reason I seek to alter the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to &ldquo;may&rdquo; is that it is not the access of the association to the fair trading commission that anyone wants to interfere with but the mandatory obligation on the fair trading commission under this section to publish or make rules when in fact it may not, for a variety of reasons, be desirable in the public interest to make rules for the particular section who come before it.  Under <Col N="362" /> this section, the commission will have to do it, even if the body is entirely unrepresentative and if there are reasons which would, in the ordinary way, preclude the commission from wanting to make these rules.  I think the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; gives the commission all the powers it needs and it does not force it to publish rules.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the point Deputy Dockrell has made is clearly a good point under the circumstances of the draft and it could easily be met by putting in clear language what is obviously the Minister's intention. He wants to have it voluntary if the movement is made by a body of people who really represent people engaged in supply, not necessarily being a majority.  The Minister's interjection seemed to indicate that he wanted it to be the decision of the commission whether or not the association did represent persons engaged in supply. That can be very easily met &mdash;&ldquo;an association who, in the opinion of the commission, represent people engaged in or who are a representative body of the people engaged in a particular business&rdquo;.  If that were the case, I understand that Deputy Dockrell would not be bothering about whether the word was &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash; so long as the people who put the commission in motion are really representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have got a new light on this Bill.  I thought the Bill was not worth much, but it has receded in any estimation I had of it since the Minister's last speech.  He contemplates under this a whole heap of what I call whitewashing inquiries.  It was represented to us last October that the Minister was out to smash trade rings, and he spoke several columns of the Dáil Debates with regard to all the restrictive practices which existed in the country, about which most of us knew, and about all of which he knew.  These were the things he wanted to smash. They were things we all had a clear idea of, and things which were contrary to the public interest.  Now it appears that this is to be used mainly for one purpose &mdash; to enable a group of traders or people engaged in supplying <Col N="363" /> goods to go before the commission, and to get them to say: &ldquo;Your rules are grand.  They are all right.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Why should they come in, if they are all right?  Presumably, then, there is no public annoyance or, if there is annoyance the Minister is going to say that that annoyance is misdirected, and he wants these people whitewashed.  I did not think that was the purpose of this piece of legislation.  It seems to be ineffective because again I understood that what it aimed at, in the end, was making the buying and consumption of goods easier for the community, that it was aimed at cheapening supplies and services of goods to the community. It is notorious that one group of people who cannot move the commission are the consumers, and that the only people who can move in this are people who are in some way in the general line of supply, and who are irritated by something done above them in the line of supply.</P>
      <P>There is an old saying about big fleas having lesser fleas on them and apparently one must be a flea to put this machinery in motion.  The people who are bitten, however, cannot do anything and that was one of the great objections I had to the section.  I would have moved in the opposite direction from that taken by Deputy Dockrell, in the direction of giving a right to a body of consumers, if they could make it clear to the commission that they were really a representative body and not merely some people who were annoyed in a particular small area over something which might not be general through the country.  As it is, I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that neither Section 3, 4 nor 5 is worth anything except in so far as it may lead eventually to some sort of Order being made later under which people can be prosecuted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister might be well advised to look at Section 3 again to see if he could not find a more sensible approach to the problem.  If the commission feels that a body really represents persons engaged in the distribution and supply of goods and they are anxious to make fair trading rules for the association then under the terms of the amendment they may make these rules or they may not do so until they are satisfied that the body is really representative and that it is in the public interest to do so but as the section is drafted it would appear that the commission must make fair trading rules.  That would mean that even if the application is made by a minority of suppliers the commission must make these rules.  It is conceivable, firstly, that an application from a minority of suppliers should not be entertained.  They should be told to run away, get themselves organised properly and come back when they speak for a representative body of suppliers and that then the commission, if it deems it prudent to do so in the public interest, will make fair trading rules for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's case for the section was that he wanted a body to go into the commission and to be able to say to them: &ldquo;Here is what we have been doing.  Will you make fair trading rules for us and take the necessary steps to have them put into operation?&rdquo;  That was the Minister's case for the section.  I do not think a small body, not really representative of suppliers or distributors, should have the right to appeal to the commission to make fair trading rules for that trade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Though they are not representative, the Minister wants to ensure that they will have the right to get rules made.  Even if all the members of the commission take the view that in the public interest and until the <Col N="365" /> whole position clarifies itself in respect to the supply of particular goods, it is not desirable to make any rules in that particular case, nevertheless under the section as drafted, once an association representative of a microscopic minority seeks to get rules made, the commission must entertain the application from that unrepresentative minority, and is bound, willy-nilly, to formulate rules.  I do not think the commission should be put in that situation.  If the section is drawn in such a way that the commission may do it, the initiative rests with the commission; if they think it desirable to do so they may do it.  If the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is inserted in the section, they may not do it, if they do not think it desirable to do so.</P>
      <P>I do not think that a body which represents only a very small group who may want to get away with something very quickly should be put in a position to coerce the commission.</P>
      <P>I could understand a representative body of people going in and saying: &ldquo;We want to get some decent rules prepared and published.  Let us draw them up so that they may get general acceptance.&rdquo;  I think that is a reasonable approach if the body is really representative provided the commission has the right to say: &ldquo;Look here, in the public interest we do not think it desirable that we should formulate rules.&rdquo;  The commission should have the right to say that, but under the section as drafted the commission has not that right.  The commission must prepare rules, under the section as drafted, once an application is made to it by a body no matter how unrepresentative it may be.  I do not think the commission should be jockeyed into the position that it must prepare rules where an unrepresentative body applies to it to do so.</P>

      <P>I do not think this amendment is important enough to spend much time arguing it.  If that is the point which Deputy Dockrell has in mind, a point which appears to arise in his next amendment, and if accepting this amendment would cover the next amendment and keep the section so framed that the commission may <Col N="366" /> refuse to hear people who, they think, do not represent anybody then I am prepared to meet the Deputy.  Let us, however, be quite clear.  I contemplate that under this section approach to the commission may often be made by some body which has been denied a rate of discount or freedom of access to some things which some particular association is confining to its own members.  I should not like by any means to see the section so framed that only a majority of traders in a particular trade would have the right to apply to the fair trade commission to prepare and publish rules.  It is far better that the commission should have the right to have regard to the character of the applicants.</P>

I am willing to allow the commission to <Col N="367" /> make rules, if they think it is wise to do so, but they should not be compelled in all circumstances to prepare rules even when it is not in the public interest to do so.

      <P>I failed to make my point of view clear to the Minister. It was probably my own fault.  Under Section 6 there is a particular way in which existing trading rules will be investigated.  It will be decided whether those rules are unnationally and fairly restrictive.  There is a specific procedure set out under Section 6.  There is a mandatory provision in Section 6.  There is to be an inquiry into those rules.  My objection to Section 3 is that it by-passes the particular provisions in regard to an investigation of the rules which are provided for in Section 6.  If the Minister wants to have the method of dealing with it in two ways, then he should make it mandatory on the commission to deal with any application under Section 3 in the same way in which they dealt with it under Section 6.</P>

      <P>No, no &mdash; as one side only wants.  Suppose an inquiry is ordered under Section 6 and the commission decide, under Section 6, that the restrictive practice is perfectly fair.  Then there is no further action because if the restrictive practice is not against the national interest it is O.K. and it is left under Section 6.  But there are opportunities under Section 6 of advancing arguments that the <Col N="372" /> restrictive practice is against the national interest.</P>

      <P>That is begging the whole question.  The whole purpose of the commission is to decide whether a practice is fair or unfair.  If it is unfair, the Minister said on the Second <Col N="373" /> Reading that he wants to terminate it. I want to be sure that, in the examination as to whether it is fair or unfair, there is a proper examination.  I do not think Section 3 can provide that, and I think that the effect of Section 3 is to provide that the commission will have their hands tied if they are asked to hold a similar inquiry under Section 6.  Therefore, if you are going to have Section 3 at all, you should have it in exactly the same fashion as Section 6.</P>

      <P>I think it is quite clear that Section 5 also provides that the commission will keep under review the rules established under Section 3, and if they are satisfied that these rules are in any way unfair or operating unfairly the Minister can take appropriate action under the subsequent section.  Therefore, there is no question whatever, as Deputy Sweetman suggested, of the hands of either the commission or the Minister being tied by this particular section.  All it seems to do is to regularise the operations of a particular association.  It might be no harm if the legal profession were brought under this Bill and their rules and operations reviewed with a view to regularising and reforming them.  I think Deputy Sweetman is simply trying to kill time.  Surely the first step in regard to reforming and improving&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think it knocks the sense out of the section. It gives the commission the right, in the face of certain requests, to refuse to concede to them.  I was in the course of saying that there might be circumstances in which an association would apply for fair trading rules and would have those rules endorsed, and that then there might be some minority section of that association, or some group which would break away from it, which would try to get rules accepted by the commission which would not necessarily be in the public interest.  It would be advisable, I think, to give the commission power to deal with such a request in the quickest way possible, and not put them, perhaps, to the trouble and expense of drawing up a new set of rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4: &mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 21, after &ldquo;goods&rdquo; to add: &mdash;</P>
      <P>Such fair trading conditions shall be prepared and determined with due regard to the necessity for the prevention of restrictive trade practices, the maintenance of free competition in the supply and distribution of such goods: and the safeguarding of the public interest.</P>
      <P>This amendment follows on the description or definition, if you like to call it that, which I had proposed in the first amendment.  I object to Section 3.  I think it is entirely unnecessary and can be harmful, but if it is in the Bill I think there should at least be a direction given to the commission that, in preparing and formulating and publishing fair trading rules those rules should be &ldquo;prepared and determined with due regard to the necessity for the prevention of restrictive trade practices, the maintenance of free competition in the supply and distribution of such goods; and the safeguarding of the public interest&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want this commission to have as its task, if it be given the task and I hope it will not, that in formulating fair trading rules there should be some description of what are fair trading rules.  In the Bill there was no definition of restrictive practices.  This section introduces a new phrase &mdash; fair trading rules.  No one knows what they are.  There, again, they will be subject to the peculiar views of the particular commission that may be there.  One commission may consider or may think that it has one set of fair trading rules.  Another commission, in a week's time, may think these were not fair trading rules.  The commission have no headline, no directive and no principle to go on.  My amendment proposes to give them some headline and some principle on which to act. Much the same purpose is behind this amendment as that which I had in proposing in an earlier amendment a description of fair trading practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section, as it stands and as the Minister has stated, and as the hedge <Col N="376" /> lawyer, Deputy Cogan, has misstated, does not give legal effect to fair trading rules.  That is quite clear, except indirectly through portion of the machinery of the Act, where as Deputy McGilligan has pointed out they will obtain a certain sanction using that as a neutral word.</P>
    <P>As the section stands at the moment, it can be operated at the instance merely of people engaged in trade, manufacture or industry, alone or in combination.  There is nobody on the commission to watch the interests of the consumers or the public.  The Minister says that the fair trading rules may be formulated voluntarily. But that will be done without anybody being there to represent consumers or the public and put their case.  Of course, I realise that Section 4 provides that an opportunity may be given to persons interested, but there is nothing in the section to make it mandatory on the commission to take the slightest notice of any representation that may be made, no matter by whom.  Therefore, it comes down again to the fact that there is an uncharted course, with complete liberty of action allowed to this political <i>quasi</i> tribunal.</P>
    <P>Earlier to-night the Minister referred to the function of the Dáil and the Oireachtas generally in reference to matters of public policy.  The phrase he used, perhaps, as we say in court, <i>per incuriam,</i> implied that the commission, in considering and formulating the publication of fair trading rules, would give their imprimatur that the fair trading rules were unobjectionable in the public interest.  This political body will say that in reference to these fair trading rules.  The consumers and the public will have no say.  That is objectionable in the public interest. They are to take over a function which the Minister will not give to the courts to safeguard the public interest.  The commission is to formulate these fair trading rules with no principle to direct them and no headline to follow.  The purpose of my amendment is to secure that they would have that directive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My position is that I do not think the amendment is really necessary if we proceed on the common <Col N="377" /> sense assumption that we will have at all times Governments which in the matter of the appointment of personnel to bodies of this kind, will act with responsibility and will choose them from an intelligent section of the community and not from our mental homes. If there is thought to be the danger at some stage of having a commission of people from our mental homes with straws in their hair, and that it is necessary to protect the community against that, I have no objection to putting in safeguards against that remote possibility.  The general provision is that in the preparation of fair trading rules the commission shall aim at the elimination of the practices which will be set out in the Bill following the adoption of Deputy Costello's amendment No. 1. I think it is almost inconceivable that any commission likely to be appointed would not have that aim.  I have no objection to making it a statutory obligation, but I think that for the present we had better leave it over.</P>

I see a certain danger in the second part of the amendment. Suppose there was a general practice in a particular industry or a particular distributing service that all shops in an area or particular town agreed to close at 6 o'clock in the evening, and that somebody there said they were going to keep open until midnight&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think I can meet the Deputy's objection by saying that the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; was left out of the amendment inadvertently.  The amendment should have read &ldquo;the maintenance of free and fair competition&rdquo;.

      <P>What I am contemplating is that there will be inserted in this section words which will say that, in preparing these fair trading rules, the commission will have the aim of preventing the operation of the restrictive practices which will be defined earlier in the Bill.  That, I think, is what Deputy Costello wants.  That, I think, is what Deputy Costello has in mind.</P>

You have big combines who will not allow small traders to work together.  I regard as free competition that they should be allowed to work notwithstanding the big combines.  That is my notion of free competition and fair competition, and it is to that that I aim in the definition or description I have given of restrictive practices.  In this clause I left out the word &ldquo;fair&rdquo; inadvertently. That is what I am aiming at. I am also aiming at this &mdash; I do not want a particularly big combine to buy up a certain line of goods from a particular manufacturer, under-sell it, and then prevent that man from selling it at a fair price, having regard to the cost of production.  It will work both ways &mdash; in one case the small trader prevented by the big trader from freely carrying on his trade and, in another case, the big man coming in and getting one line of manufacture out of a factory, under-selling it, and preventing that manufacturer from ever selling a halfpenny worth of those goods again. That is what I mean by that phrase.</P>

I thought the idea at the back of this was to make things easier for the consuming public. The only effect now of the section is, outside the commission moving on their own initiative, that, say, a trader or group of traders who get annoyed at something done in the chain line above them from the manufacturer down, can make representations and may move the commission.  I thought it was the intention to give people who were affected in the end by these restrictive practices, namely, the consuming public, a right.</P>

      <P>From my experience of this matter, every day since this Bill was circulated I have received a very large number of letters complaining about different trade practices.  Some appear to be serious complaints, some frivolous or unfounded.  There must be some sieving process.  There is only one that I can see, that is, by letting the commission decide the complaints that they will investigate or, under Section 6, letting the Minister decide what complaints he will refer to the commission, knowing that he has to answer here.</P>

      <P>If you are allowing an association at least to approach them with the hope of getting them to move, why confine it to an association engaged in the supply and distribution? I do not care what the formula may be, how rough and ready it may be or how it may seem to include folk who may be putting forward vexatious complaints. The commission is the boss now.  It is only &ldquo;may&rdquo;, not that they shall be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another objection to the section. I think the section never was any good, but of course, it is now dangerous.  I gather from the Minister's speeches here that what he foresees of the use to be made of this section is the regularising of rules already in operation by various trading associations.  I do not see why they should be regularised at all. I do not see why they should be given the sanction of the commission. It will be a sanction when they describe them as fair trading rules, and the commission may take a view of it at one time and, when they see the rules in practice afterwards they may not appear to be so good.  It is a <Col N="382" /> strange omission.  The commission is given power to review how the rules may be observed but not given power specifically to review the rules.  That appears to be an omission.  What is the necessity for sanctifying these rules?  If rules appear to be all right, that is all right, pass them but do not publish those as fair trading rules.  If a group of people once get a commission to say that these are fair trading rules then they are protected from any sort of action thereafter.  They can always plead the commission's sanction. I do not think that should be given to them.  Let them operate them if they have operated them up to date; let the commission say: &ldquo;It would be better if you put in such and such a change,&rdquo; but I do not see why formal sanction should be given to them and that they should be described as fair trading rules.  That is a danger.</P>

      <P>As I have indicated on the Second Reading and to-night, I have strong objection to Section 3, the principal one being that I believe it will be operated for the purpose of giving sanction, not statutory, but some kind of sanction by reason of the fact that the commission has given its benediction to rules which in fact may be restrictive trade practice rules.</P>
      <P>A commission of this kind should not be left on its own to decide a matter of that kind.  They should not be judge and jury, operating without anybody assisting them by way of defence or prosecution.  What will happen is this: an association of traders will come in before this commission and say, &ldquo;There are our rules.  Will you give it your benediction?&rdquo;  Reading down the rules the commission may say, &ldquo;That looks perfectly fair.  That is grand.  O.K.&rdquo;  They go out as fair trading rules and there is nobody before that commission to point out a particular rule and to show what is really behind it although on its face it appears to be perfectly reasonable. There is no <i>advocatus diaboli</i> before that commission.  They have to perform a whole series of functions themselves. They have to investigate the rules; they have to adjudicate upon the rules and to publish the rules.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister explain the position in relation to the fair trading rules once they have been made?  Section 3 enables the commission on its own initiative or at the request of an association representing persons engaged in the supply and distribution of goods to prepare and publish rules which are referred to as fair trading rules.  Suppose that is done in the month of March.  The rules are published and are then current.  In the month of June it is discovered that the rules are, perhaps, unduly restrictive or are drawn up in such a manner as to permit certain abuses.  Where has the commission power under Section 3 or under Section 4 to revoke in whole or in part the fair trading rules made under Section 3 or Section 4? There is power under Section 5 to keep the rules made under review.  Suppose the rules have been made, are being observed, and that there is no departure from the operation of these rules but the commission subsequently discovers it is desirable to amend the rules, under what section have they power speedily to alter the rules they have made should they find it necessary to do so in the public interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On that I am advised that the commission will have power to amend the rules.  A commission which is given power to makes rules in a case <Col N="384" /> such as this is <i>ipso facto</i> given power to amend them.  We have, of course, discussed this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  We have first to discuss the section as a whole. May I say that I on my part provided for its insertion in the Bill because I recognised that if we intend to clear up the situation in respect of trade practices, we have to strike a balance between doing a good job and doing that job quickly.  I do not think we can do it very quickly.  Having regard to the complexity of trading arrangements nowadays and the desire not to change things until one is certain that one is changing them for the better, it is wiser to proceed slowly rather than proceed in a slap-dash manner.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful &mdash; I will not put it any stronger than that &mdash; that the most expeditious results will be secured through this section because of the general desire of traders in organised associations to avoid the possibility of their being brought into a public inquiry under Section 6, by proceeding to get their rules drawn up in consultation with the commission so that the objectionable feature of them can be eliminated.  It does not seem to me that there is any danger there at all, proceeding on the assumption that in many trades rules are necessary in order to enable a trade to be conducted at all and frequently have the effect of reducing the cost to the public or giving the public better service or some other advantage in the public interest.  If that is so it is better that we should have this organisation for the preparation of these rules concerned solely with the public interest rather than that the rules should be left to the trading associations themselves which bodies would inevitably approach them from the point of view of their own particular interest.  This Bill would be very slow in producing results if it was to operate solely by the process of public inquiry followed by legislation.  It is because there is a desire to get more expeditious improvement of the situation that I think it is a good idea to have this provision for voluntary action in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it would be a great mistake not to give the associations and organisations engaged in various trades an opportunity of coming before the fair trading commission. I have some experience of commercial matters and I know that there are many firms and associations which genuinely do not know at the present time whether certain rules they have in their various organisations may or may not contravene this Bill or the spirit of the Bill.  It is a very difficult matter to define what is a restrictive practice.  We know that from the reluctance there is on the part of the Department to define them.</P>
      <P>How much greater is the difficulty on the part of businessmen to know exactly whether certain things will or will not contravene fair trading conditions? I think it is very desirable that the business community should be given this opportunity.  I do not think this House wishes the business community to be brought forcibly before any type of commission if it is possible to permit them to go voluntarily before it and come to an amicable agreement. There is the further point that this Bill is the first step we have taken in an endeavour to go into the question of restrictive practices and trading conditions generally.  I think we will have to proceed very carefully because I am sure that nobody wishes to upset unduly recognised methods of trading provided such methods are fair and in the public interest.</P>

      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment Deputy MacBride gave notice to raise the subject matter of Question No. 54 on to-day's Order Paper.  Perhaps I should read the question: &mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that, owing to the continual increasing unemployment the present employment exchanges in Dublin are inadequate; and, is so, if he will recommend improvements in the present buildings and the provision of extra exchanges.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>As you, Sir, have kindly read the question, it might be as well if I read the answer which the Parliamentary Secretary gave to Deputy T. Byrne, whose question is was: &mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I am satisfied that the Dublin employment exchanges are adequate in normal times.  The present pressure is temporary and is mainly due to work arising out of the implementation of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which became fully operative on the 5th January, 1953. <Col N="387" /> Seasonal unemployment is responsible for some of the cause of complaint. Certain improvements in the women's exchange, Victoria Street, are at present being made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of a supplementary question I asked the Parliamentary Secretary whether, having regard to the unemployment crisis which existed at the moment in Dublin City, he would be prepared to consider opening additional employment exchanges or providing transport for those who are unemployed, particularly from areas in my constituency of Dublin South-West. At the moment unemployed men and women have to travel from Crumlin, Kimmage, Drimnagh and Terenure as far as Werburgh Street to register at the employment exchange.  They have to make this journey on a number of occasions during the week and it is quite a considerable distance.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in reply to that supplementary said that a number of people in country districts had to cycle eight or ten miles and to walk three or four miles to the employment exchanges.  I think that that reply cannot have been well considered by the Parliamentary Secretary and that it is not one which he would like to stand over in the City of Dublin. Conditions are different in the country from those in the city; special provisions are made in the country by allowing persons who have long distances to travel to use local Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I do not propose in the course of this debate to raise the major question as to the causes of unemployment, but I will have to point out that the Parliamentary Secretary is mistaken when he alleges that the present unemployment is due to seasonal reasons or to the implementation of the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  Since Question Time to-day the latest unemployment figures for last week have been made available and they show that the present unemployment total for the country is 87,283.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <P>Inasmuch as the Parliamentary Secretary says that there is no abnormal pressure and that this is a temporary matter, I only want to deal with the figures.  That figure is some 22,000 higher than in January, 1951.  The conditions during the week ending on the last Saturday in January, 1951, and during the week ending on the last Saturday of January, 1953, were the same: they were the same seasons of the year. Therefore, the figures are comparable and it is no answer to say that this is a seasonal increase.  Likewise it is no answer to say that the work has increased by reason of the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1952&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to point out that the figures which I am quoting are the total unemployment figures, which include unemployment insurance claimants and ordinary uninsured claimants and any change in social welfare legislation does not affect the total.  It may affect the number of persons who are insured claimants as against uninsured claimants, but it does not affect the gross total, so that the Parliamentary Secretary must have been mistaken in the reasons which he gave in his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in Dublin is extremely serious at the moment.  I have had an opportunity of actually seeing the queues outside the three unemployment exchanges in the City of Dublin and I have received a great many complaints as to conditions in these exchanges and they are appalling. People are kept waiting for four or five hours, the women being very often badly clad while the men's clothes are certainly not fit for this weather.  A great many claimants are elderly women who are unemployed and I think it is ridiculous for the Parliamentary Secretary to suggest that they can <Col N="389" /> walk four or five times a week from Ballyfermot to and from Werburgh Street which is the employment exchange at which they have to sign on.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should re-examine this question in a non-Party sense.  I said that I did not propose to widen the scope of the debate by going into the causes of the steep increase in unemployment.  I merely make an appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take measures which will alleviate the lot of the 87,000 people who are unemployed at the moment.  I have not got the full total of unemployed in Dublin, but it is very substantial and represents a large percentage of the total.  The accommodation in the three exchanges is entirely inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has overlooked the fact that the City of Dublin has grown and expanded at a tremendous rate in recent years and that most of the wage earners in Dublin have moved from the centre of the city to outlying districts forming a ring around the city.  Surely it is not too much to ask that some effort should be made to provide employment exchanges in these new areas some of which are many miles away from the present exchanges.  The situation has been rendered even more acute by reason of the increase in bus fares in Dublin which has placed an additional burden on the claimants amounting to over 1/- a week in many cases.</P>
    <P>Again I want to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to approach this question not as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party but to approach it as the responsible Parliamentary Secretary who is faced with a crisis in this respect.  The St. Vincent de Paul Conference, who are doing tremendous work to try to alleviate the sufferings of these people, have considered the problem on a number of occasions recently and have made some suggestions as to how it could be dealt with. One of them is that transport should be made available through C.I.E. for unemployed claimants so that on presentation of their cards issued at the labour exchange they would be able to get free transport between certain <Col N="390" /> hours.  I do not think this would cause any particular burden on C.I.E. because the hours could be so regulated as to allow workers to avail of the non-peak period on those particular lines when the buses are very often empty or half empty.  There is no reason why the claimants should not be able to travel at times when the traffic is very light. They need not travel at the ordinary business hours, so that it would not involve any additional expenditure on the part of C.I.E. and would do a tremendous amount to relieve the situation.</P>
    <P>We all hope that the present unemployment crisis will not continue for long.  I am not asking the Parliamentary Secretary to make any admission that it is likely to continue although I am afraid there are certain things which indicate that it will.  Even on the Parliamentary Secretary's own assumption it will certainly continue for the next few months and that is the worst period of the year for these people.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to consider taking some steps of that nature.  I have dealt with the problem so far as it affects Dublin South-West &mdash; Crumlin, Kimmage, Terenure, Drimnagh Ballyfermot, and so on, but it applies to the whole working-class area that is around the City of Dublin and it applies to Cabra and every other district in the city from where the bulk of the unemployed have come.</P>
    <P>Conditions have changed considerably in the city and it does seem fantastic if you examine the areas of the city to find that the labour exchanges are situated miles away from the working-class areas of the city.  I do not think that the cost of providing additional exchanges in these areas would be very much.  We all hope that there will be no necessity for labour exchanges but unfortunately we have to deal with the situation as it is. I can see one difficulty in dealing with the situation immediately.  It will probably take some time to acquire premises to provide suitable employment exchanges, but in the meanwhile I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to adopt the suggestion made by the St. Vincent de Paul Conference that some arrangement should be come <Col N="391" /> to with C.I.E. whereby unemployed men and women could, during certain hours when the traffic is light, obtain free transport to and from the labour exchanges.  I do not think it is an unreasonable request.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to approach this problem in an atmosphere of reason and to consider the situation objectively.</P>
    <P>Another problem which arises is that at present the actual staffs and facilities in the employment exchanges are inadequate to meet the upsurge that is taking place in the course of the last few months.  I do not think the staffs or the buildings were ever intended to cope with this upsurge.  These are the highest unemployment figures we have had in ten years and these premises need to be increased in size and additional staffs employed to deal with the work and to ensure that claimants are not kept waiting, very often in queues, outside in the cold.  Possibly if the Parliamentary Secretary has time he might go to some of these employment exchanges and examine the position for himself.  If he did that he would realise very quickly that something had to be done, and done urgently.  If he could also make contact with some of the unemployed persons in Cabra, Ballyfermot and Crumlin and hear their views on their difficulty of reaching the employment exchange he would also appreciate the urgency of doing something.  If he cared to walk, for instance, from the far end of West Cabra or from the far end of Ballyfermot to the Werburgh Street exchange, he would realise that it is not a thing he would ask any unemployed man or woman to do.  Many of the unemployed are elderly women who are badly handicapped; having regard to the increases in bus fares, the possibility of taking buses is completely removed.</P>
    <P>I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will receive this motion objectively and will try to deal with the position and not merely deny that the problem exists and do nothing about it.  He can do something about it by providing buses.  That can be done by arrangement with C.I.E. at a negligible cost <Col N="392" /> if the buses are used at periods when traffic is light in the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not detain the House more than two minutes to give the Parliamentary Secretary an opportunity of getting in.  A fortnight ago I was asked to visit the Victoria Street women's employment exchange, and I can assure the Minister that at one time there were 800 to 1,000 girls in the street in the rain, and many passersby had great sympathy for them.  The queue moved in very slowly.  The employment exchange for women in Victoria Street is too small.  They have a most courteous staff there doing everything that is humanly possible, and those who go in to sign on pay tribute to the staff that is in that department but they say it is too small.  The claimants are there from half-past eight to 9 o'clock in the morning until 2 o'clock, and the day I saw them it was in the rain.</P>
      <P>A lot of people passing by sympathised with them and asked if nothing was going to be done.  I understand now that the Minister is going to put up an extra shelter, but the place is not big enough and the staffs cannot cope with the work.  It is well to inform the House that there are two exchanges for women workers of the north side&mdash;one at Beresford Place&mdash; and I think there is only one on the south side.  I would ask the Minister to visit them himself and see the queue that has to wait for many hours.  The day I was there, unfortunately, the ambulance was called to take two people away because they stayed so long in the queue that they had become tired out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day something has occurred at the employment exchange in Beresford Place where, I understand, 300 female workers were left without their money. I had a deputation here to-night of three women workers who said they spoke for 300 women workers who to-day were left without their money. Whether it is because of the taking in of cards or the issuing of new cards I do not know, but the Minister is aware of the fact and Deputy Byrne, Dublin North-West, has made a report to his Department who promised to go into it early in the morning.  I am sure they <Col N="393" /> will rectify whatever grievance is there. It is most unfortunate that 300 girls should expect to get paid and to-day, with only one hour's notice, they get nothing.</P>

We have got no complaints of any serious nature except in the case of Victoria Street.  We are erecting shelters there and we are making better provision.  There is no use closing one's eyes to the fact that the upsurge to which Deputy MacBride refers is due to the changes under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, which became operative on the 5th January of this year.  Here is one small example.  A person who heretofore found that 26 National Health Insurance stamps was very little good to him or her now becomes a beneficiary to full unemployment benefit for six months.  I do not begrudge them that.  I wish we could give them more &mdash; but the fact that that is available for them has brought, in many cases, a big rush on our labour exchanges.</P>

      <P>Under the other benefits we had a card which was in the hatch, which was presented to the claimant and was signed and the operation was automatic.  Now he has to fill in a new form since the 5th January &mdash; this form in my hand.  It is a very laborious job and there are 80,000 cases in which we have had to refer to the central statistical records of our Department to find out exactly what benefits the claimants are entitled to, because now we have the one stamp which covers national health and unemployment insurance.</P>
      <P>There is no difference at all between the country and the city in this matter. The man below in Ballinacargy in County Westmeath has to cycle 14 miles to Mullingar to register in the labour exchange.  Similarly, if he were under Westport exchange he may have to come in from some small town outside to register.  He is facilitated after that by means of the Garda station, but he probably has to go five or six miles to that &mdash; just the same distance as the city person &mdash; and the amenities there in bad weather or rough weather are not nearly as good as those in the exchanges in Dublin.</P>
      <P>This Social Welfare Department is a new Department, only in existence for about six years, and we are building it up and trying to improve the conditions. We have done an immense job in the last Social Welfare Act.  Heretofore, to get certain benefits in national health you had to have 104 stamps.  Now with 26 stamps you get the same benefit.</P>
      <P>I categorically deny the statement by Deputy MacBride that any claimant had to wait four or five hours.  I put an officer of our Department to watch one of our principal exchanges when this rush came on.  There was a wait of 50 minutes but this has died down and the time is becoming quite normal. On this idea of providing buses and motor-cars for the unemployed to come to the exchanges, I wonder if we are realists or where the cost is to come from.</P>

      <P>We have codded nobody in this.  There is not a rural Deputy facing this with any honesty who does not know that the statement I am now going to make is true.  We have streams of farmers going into exchanges who would not bother their heads for unemployment assistance heretofore, but because of this system of one stamp on the card for the two benefits they are now lining up and drawing it.  Time will prove that.  The very fact that we have 20,000 more <Col N="396" /> insurable workers put into employment, according to the last return in October, is proof that this problem is not as big a problem as the figures would indicate. It is the fact that money is made easier to get and that there is more money available, that has brought about the increase in the number of claimants.</P>
