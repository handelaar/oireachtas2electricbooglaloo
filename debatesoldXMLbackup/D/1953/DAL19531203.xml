      <P>Under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, an increase of benefit is payable in respect of a qualified child or each of two qualified children normally residing with the beneficiary.  The Act provides that any question regarding the normal residence of a child must be determined in accordance with subsection (2) of Section 5 of the Children's Allowances (Amendment) Act, <Col N="1547" /> 1946, and the rules made under that sub-section.  Under these rules, the child of an unmarried mother must be regarded as normally residing with the head of the household of which the child is a member.  If, therefore, the unmarried mother is the head of the household she is entitled to an increase of benefit in respect of the child.  Otherwise the increase could be granted only to the person who is, in fact, the head of the household.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary is not right in saying there is any change under the recent Act.  The position has been the same since 1946.  The general idea under all these Acts was that the head of the household would be the person to whom the number of children would be attributable.  I do not know how we can alter that very easily.</P>

      <P>The migration of the Innishark islanders is not a scheme which the Land Commission would normally undertake.

      <P>Because, as the Deputy knows, if these islanders were to be transferred to the mainland they would probably have to be given economic holdings.  The island, being seven miles from the mainland, it would be impossible for them, conveniently at any rate, to work Innishark from the mainland, and there is acute congestion at Cleggan, the point of the mainland nearest to the island.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House has any progress been made in the efforts which the Department of Agriculture were making to get the Cork milk supply pasteurised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to answer a question on that subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond  Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Desmond</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture to state if his attention has been drawn to the report of a meeting of the Cork Workers' Council in a Cork newspaper on the 20th November which stated that there were numerous complaints about sour milk being delivered for domestic consumption in Cork City and suburbs; and, if so, if it is the intention to have the milk intended for domestic consumption in Cork City and suburbs pasteurised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a newspaper report of the meeting referred to.  The report indicated that the council decided to take up the matter with the chief medical officer of the Cork Corporation, which is the local authority responsible for the administration of the Milk and Dairies Act in Cork County Borough.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, proposals which have been put forward by the Cork Milk Producers' Co-operative Society for undertaking pasteurisation of the city's milk supplies would involve granting sole rights of pasteurisation to the society and prohibiting the sale of unpasteurised milk in the city.  As I understand that there would be considerable local opposition to these provisos, I am hopeful that the society will be able to proceed without them. There is every reason to believe that the demand for pasteurised milk will satisfactorily expand in Cork, as it has in a number of other urban centres, once a supply becomes available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the feasibility of a middle way, that is, to provide that the prohibition on the sale of milk other than pasteurised milk in Cork City would not come into force for, say, five or even ten years but that it would be made clear that at some future date any person wishing to sell milk for human consumption in the City of Cork would be required to pasteurise it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There is no prohibition on the sale of milk anywhere in Cork City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely I am not going to come in and prohibit people selling their milk if there are people anxious to buy it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to get cross.  The problem is to get the milk pasteurised.  The Minister finds himself in the difficulty that the farmers' co-op. say that they will not go forward with the pasteurising of milk if he does not give them a guarantee that nobody else will be allowed to pasteurise milk in the city and that there will be no milk allowed to be sold in the city forthwith <Col N="1563" /> other than pasteurised milk. Would it not be a practical proposition to seek a middle course in order to get the milk supply reformed, that is, to forecast that at some future date, when there was ample opportunity to have milk either raised to Grade A or pasteurised, only Grade A milk or pasteurised milk might be sold in the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should there be any necessity to introduce any prohibition? If the people wish to have pasteurised milk, there is no difficulty in getting it.  Some people will go into Cork City and pasteurise the milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday a number of Deputies appealed to the Minister to relax the means test for old age pensions.  The suggestion was supported by all sides of the House that the means test is too severe.  A case of means test enforcement has come to my notice.  I put forward a case for an old age pensioner who ceased work and claimed a pension at the age of 70 and for some reason or other the small pension of 6/- was granted instead of 21/6.  It went to the Minister, apparently, on appeal, and a new suggestion which would be of interest to the House came forward.  I asked what was the cause of the delay in deciding the old age pension appeal and the answer I got was: &ldquo;Oh, we are investigating the prospects of the coming year's employment for the old age pensioner concerned.&rdquo;  Can you believe that because the investigating officer thought that the claimant might get temporary work in the coming year he is to decide not to give the person the full old age pension in anticipation of work that he may get?  I have heard here of investigating officers asking for a count of apples to see how much they would be sold for, and of an investigating officer asking a person how many eggs half-a-dozen hens will produce in the little backyard so as to put them against the old age pensioner's claim, but now a new idea is brought forward&mdash;what employment might the pensioner likely get next year.  That is the worst I ever heard, and I hope that the Minister will investigate and see that that kind of situation will not be put across in order to prevent an old age pensioner getting the full allowance, the most inadequate allowance, of 21/6 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do support the appeals that came from all parts of the House that the Minister might this coming year try to make good a sum of money to the old age pensioners, the contributory pensioners, widows and orphans and those on national health.  He ought to take into consideration the increase in the cost of living in the past 12 months brought about first by the Budget of <Col N="1567" /> 1952 and repeated this year.  You gave the old age pensioners a few shillings increase but you took it back from them in the price of the loaf.  You raised the loaf from 6d. to 9d., so that if they only use two loaves a week you have taken 6d. back from the old age pensioners by increasing their cost of living.  Take the old age pensioner.  The old man has to do without his tobacco because he says he cannot buy half an ounce of tobacco now at the price.  I think something ought to be done.  In the case of widows and orphans there is a bar on the widow getting, or trying to get, certain employment to help towards the pension in order to keep her family.  In most cases they found that it would be better to stay unemployed than to take one, two or three days' work that would be offered to them during the week&mdash;that the amount that would be stopped from them in their widows' and orphans' pension would be nearly as much as they would earn by going out to work for three or four days.</P>
    <P>I often wonder when one is talking about widows' and orphans' pensions will the day ever come in which we will put up a plaque somewhere in the City of Dublin to the man who first thought of widows' and orphans' pensions.  I refer to J.P. Dunne of the typographical society, who preached and spoke about it for many years before the widows' and orphans' pension was introduced.  I only mention that in passing in memory of the man who first brought it forward, J.P. Dunne of the trade union, the typographical society.</P>
    <P>Even though what we have to-day is a step in the right direction I do say that we have nothing to boast of in the House.  I heard members yesterday boasting of achievements because one sided voted 2/6 and the other side said that they voted 2/6 too; but when you gave it you took it back instantly in the increase in the cost of living.  The same thing applies to those in receipt of national health benefits.  You took back in taxation from those people what you gave them.  As I say, the loaf was raised from 6d. to 9d.  Butter has gone up from 2/- to 4/2, so I just <Col N="1568" /> put it that none of us in the Dáil have anything to boast about when we talk about giving the unfortunate old age pensioners an extra 2/6.</P>
    <P>There has been a demand by many sections of my colleagues in the Dublin Municipal Council and other councils who have sent letters and passed resolutions in favour of an increase in the unemployment benefits.  A man on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance with a family to-day is not enjoying anything in the way of the freedom that this country boasts of.  That freedom brings prosperity to a certain number of people.  It leaves 25 per cent. of our population enjoying the benefits to a great extent, but another 25 per cent. is suffering hardships, and it does not mean much to them if they have to continue to suffer those hardships from lack of employment in their own country and are drawing inadequate benefits.</P>
    <P>I have heard family allowances talked of in the House with great pleasure.  It was a very fine gesture, a step in the right direction, but the allowances are still inadequate.  As we all know, the producers of milk have to get a fair living out of their work, and the price of the pint or the bottle of milk is the same to people who are on unemployment benefits as it is to the well-to-do classes in the city, so from that angle I would ask the Minister to reconsider the whole position and see if it is not possible to give some further facilities.  I do not know whether it would be in benefits or in reductions in certain things that they have to use; but in the case of those people who were mentioned on all sides of the House yesterday&mdash;old age pensioners, widows and orphans, those on unemployment and national health benefit&mdash;anything we gave them we have taken back from them by increasing the necessaries of life.  With other members of the House I do implore the Minister to do something again within the coming year to see that all those who are on those benefits, especially those who are unemployed, on inadequate benefits, are entitled to share in the prosperity that is being shared in by 50 per cent. of our people.  The other 50 per cent. are not sharing to any great extent in <Col N="1569" /> the prosperity or in the freedom that this country has.</P>

      <P>First of all I would like to refer to the fact that there is a feeling among the people and there are rumours that instructions were issued to pensions officers and investigation officers that when investigating claims for old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and blind pensions they were to be stricter in connection with the means test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the statement and I repeat it.  I believe from my own experience that there is something radically wrong recently in connection with the making of awards.  I shall give you an example, though I cannot name the person concerned.  A pension was awarded to a widow and she received £10 in respect of arrears. A few days afterwards she received instructions that she was to return her book and she was informed that her pension was being withdrawn because of her means.  It is rather peculiar that the official who investigated the claim in the first instance felt that this woman was entitled to a widow's pension and that on further investigation it was withdrawn.  Cases like that make people feel that some new instructions have been issued to tighten up matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of 1/6 that was given in old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and blind pensions, when the increased taxation was imposed in the 1952 Budget, was not in any way sufficient to meet the increased cost of living occasioned by the withdrawal of the subsidies.  Certainly it is impossible to expect that widows who are solely dependent on their pensions could live in any kind of decent comfort on the amount they are receiving at present.  In fact, they could hardly be expected to exist on that miserable sum.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, in reply to a question put by Deputy Lehane on Tuesday last, told us that it would take £1 to purchase the same quantity of goods as 5/- purchased in 1906.  When the old age pensions were first introduced about 1908 the amount of the pension was 5/-.  It was never intended of course that that 5/- would be sufficient to maintain an old age pensioner; it was given merely as a help. It can be easily understood that in those days, where an old age pensioner was a farmer or had some livelihood of that kind or was living with members <Col N="1571" /> of his own family, 5/- would be a considerable help.  There would always be sufficient food in a farmer's house. In the case of those, however, who are solely dependent on the pension and who have to pay rent out of it, it will, I think, be agreed that it is impossible for such people to live on the present amount of the pension.  The very least that an old age pensioner or a widow should get at the present time would be 30/- or £2 a week if that were possible.</P>
    <P>By retrenchment in other Departments, or by savings in administration, it should be possible to make available a sufficient sum considerably to increase the present pensions of these people.  In the case of blind pensions there are certain applicants who may not be totally blind but who are prevented from carrying on their ordinary occupations owing to weak sight.  Even if such people are only partially blind I think their cases should get the fullest consideration and that they should get the full pension. For instance, a tailor or a carpenter would require almost perfect sight and when his sight fails to any great extent it is almost impossible for him to carry on his work.  Such people should get special consideration when their cases are being investigated from the medical point of view.</P>
    <P>The amount paid by way of unemployment assistance at present is certainly inadequate to support a person who is genuinely anxious to work and cannot get employment.  I, of course, would have no pity for people who are work-shy and who, in fact, would prefer to draw unemployment assistance rather than work.  I would say that the amount of pensions on the whole are entirely inadequate owing to the present high cost of living.  I would also urge that when officials are investigating claims they should exercise some common sense as regards the question of means and other matters.  Where officials come from cities they have not a proper understanding of conditions amongst the farming community and the manner in which they assess means in <Col N="1572" /> such cases is entirely wrong.  Take a poor area like South Kerry.  Surely they cannot assess the same value on cows or live stock of any kind in an area such as that as they would in the Midlands.  Yet I believe that is the basis on which the investigation is carried out.  As I say, there should be reason and common sense in all these investigations, not that I have any grievance against the officials.  I have never heard any real grievance expressed against the officials.  I am sure they do their duty conscientiously but I think they should not receive any instructions, such as I referred to in the beginning of my speech, from the Department to restrict their work in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible to cover a very wide field on this Estimate and on the motion proposed by Deputy Norton.  I think the Estimate is the most important that has been before the House for a considerable time, since it deals with the amounts payable to the aged, the blind and the unemployed.  I cannot see for the life of me why some Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party and their new associates can congratulate the Minister on the Social Welfare Act.  No doubt, we would all gladly congratulate him if he came into this House with a Supplementary Estimate to meet the demands of the old people, the blind people and the unemployed.  No matter how the Minister's supporters may boast about the amounts payable to old age pensioners, a reply which I received to a question which I put to the Minister to-day proves that many of these old people are unable to live on their present pensions.  In that reply, the Minister stated that the amount collected from old age pensioners who had to go into the county home, now St. John's Hospital, reached a figure of £6,000.  If these people were given sufficient to enable them to maintain themselves outside the county home, it would be far better than making paupers of them at the end of their days.  It is sad to reflect that, after all the years during which we have enjoyed self-government, the old and the blind are still in want.  Their condition has been greatly worsened by the withdrawal <Col N="1573" /> of the food subsidies which placed the cost of living beyond their reach.  Since I put down a question here about a week ago asking the Minister to provide some additional help for these poor people, I received letters not only from my own constituency but also from Cork and other places throughout the country in reference to this important question.  Anyone reading these letters must feel that these poor old people are suffering severely at the moment.</P>
      <P>I do not know how Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy Dr. ffrench-O'Carroll are going to trot into the Lobby after reading this plan, with Senator Noel Hartnett's photograph, of their policy in 1947 when they were telling what they would do for the old people of this country and condemning Fianna Fáil for not giving the old age pensioners a substantial increase.  With the present cost of living, an old man with a pension of 21/6 per week cannot afford to get 1 lb. of butter if he has to pay rent for a local authority house, as many of them have to do in my constituency.  At the same time, the local authority have to provide 6/-per week for blind persons to help them over their difficulties.  Old men and old women have to try to exist on 21/6, and then, of course, the Minister says that his Bill was better than Deputy Norton's Bill.  Deputy Norton's Bill proposed to give pensions at 65 to men and at 60 to women, while the present Minister said that these people could sign on at the labour exchanges until they are 70.  Very few people want to employ a man of over 65 years and what he would get from the labour exchange would not keep him.</P>

At that time you could buy butter for 2/8 per lb. which is now 4/2; a 2 lb. loaf for 6½d. which is now 9¼d.; 1 lb. tea for 2/8 which is now 5/-; 1 lb. sugar for 4½d. which is now 7d.; a stone of flour for 2/8 which is now 4/6.</P>

There was money to be got for all these things and no one asked where the money was to come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not then a Minister, he was a Deputy, and he voted against an increase for old age pensioners.  Then we hear talk about the Border.  If we want to bring the people of the Six Counties into this State the first duty of the Government is to make the social welfare benefits as good as the people get across the Border.  I would not like to bring in poor old people in the Six Counties and take what they have off them and give them 21/6 per week.  There are people living here now who went to Great Britain for a few years and who now enjoy pensions which they got at 65 years of age.  A married man gets an additional allowance.  I have signed certificates for some of these people in my constituency.  One of them is an Old I.R.A. man and he is drawing 34/-per week as a single man.  When he <Col N="1576" /> went to the labour exchange, what did he get there?  Two shillings per week. What remark did he make?  &ldquo;I fought for de Valera in 1916, but I went to earn money in John Bull's country and I am now getting 34/- per week.&rdquo;  Is not that a nice state of affairs?  Any man like that who comes home and registers at the labour exchange because he has a British pension only gets 2/- per week benefit.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister is aware of these things.  He got vexed with Deputy Palmer because Deputy Palmer spoke of the way in which officials investigate old age pension cases.  Some of these busybodies almost turn up the bed to see what is in it.  If a person has a pig or a chicken or is anyway thrifty at all he gets no pension.  Then we hear of the great things the Social Welfare Act has done.  In a question which I had down to-day I raised the matter of throwing the onus on the head of the household for the maintenance of dependents and not getting any money at the labour exchange for them.  That has had a very serious effect in my constituency.  The local authority have to provide assistance for these people because they are cut off at the labour exchange.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to say that everything is lovely and that old age pensioners were given an increase of 1/6 to make up for the increase in the cost of living.  It means semi-starvation for these people.  It is a shame to have to get up in a Christian Parliament to expose these things.  The old people are suffering.  Mothers and fathers have to carry on and will not get an old age pension until they are 70 when they are on the verge of the grave.  The Minister said it would be bad encouragement to give them a pension at 65, that he would rather see them working.  Who wants a man to-day after 70 years of age?  Very few employers want a man after he is 68 or 69.  He is asked to get out and they get a younger man.</P>

    <P>What we should do&mdash;and what the Labour Party will press to do&mdash;is to see that the old people, the blind people and such like will be provided for and get the necessaries of life, no matter what else has to go and no <Col N="1577" /> matter where the money comes from. No one will object to paying taxes if the money is going to the right quarter and is helping someone.  What the ratepayers are grousing about is the giving of money to people who do not want it, who are well off and very snug.  A motion was brought in here for high salaries for judges and district justices.  We are trying to fight for the plain people that we know and whom we have the honour to represent and who sent us here.  They cannot make ends meet at present and they are starving, with the high cost of living, the Budget and the withdrawal of the food subsidies.</P>
    <P>We have less this year for the free boot scheme and less in the grant for free milk for necessitous cases.  It is cut down.  Why does the Minister not give the county councils more money for these schemes for necessitous people in the country?  Half the people this year will not receive any free boots as the money will not go around.  It is the same as it was last year and the year before, but boots have gone up with the result that there will be less boots for the poor people.  These are the things the Government should be interested in, to cater for the plain people who put them in in 1932.</P>

      <P>We may meet again, next year.  I am not afraid.  It is very hard for a man who knows the position to listen to some of the artificial speeches made here, especially from the Government Benches.  They have no idea what unemployment means, but I have.  I had to sign up at the labour exchange <Col N="1578" /> during the slack periods.  I know what it is to depend on national health.  I wonder how many T.D.s sitting behind the Minister know that. Did they ever have to queue up at the labour exchange as I had to do?  It is experience teaches.</P>
      <P>I hear professional men congratulating the Minister.  I hear Deputy Cogan congratulating him on social welfare and saying how well off the people are now.  He forgets how it was when he was in opposition.  There is not a word about the blind pensioners.  Deputy Cogan said there was £21,000,000 spent in social services.  It is not enough.  If there were a war to-morrow and an emergency were proclaimed, the Minister for Defence would not ask this House where the money would come from as the Minister for Social Welfare is doing now.  The money would be got.  It was got for seven years of the emergency.  Are we going to stay here and be silent while a big number of our people are starving or entering county homes and those who have not been able to get in there and who find they cannot get work are fleeing out of the country as they cannot exist on the donation they are getting?  A man, no matter how many youngsters he has, gets only 50/- to keep a family.  That is a bad substitute for work on housing schemes at £5 16s.  That is the progress that Fianna Fáil has made&mdash;mass emigration, unemployment and starvation, in 1953.  It is very hard to have to listen to some Deputies ridiculing Deputy Norton of the Labour Party. I suppose we are a menace here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will read this letter, a Cheann Comhairle, from an old age pensioner in Carrick.  I would like to bring it before the Minister, Deputy Dr. Ryan. <Col N="1579" /> It is one of many.  I have another here from Cork.  This one reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I sincerely appreciate your most Christian feeling for the people by asking in the Dáil a question of Dr. Ryan about a rise in our pension. Sorry that you wasted your breath to ask that so-called gentleman who broke his heart when he got into power with a rise of 1/6.  How did he manage it, when his boss could not see his way for 15 years to do likewise until he was losing power? He then raised it to 15/-.  He lost his place and then the inter-Party Government got in and gave £1, which helped us to live.  Now he is asked again but he is silent.  Then we have the threat to put us to starvation by raising our cost of living. He is a most wonderful man to give thousands to other nations in distress, to get his name up.  I am not grudging it to those poor victims, but why should we have any of the native Irish starve in their old age at 21/6 when they cannot buy at such high prices and still keep alive? They want the North to come in. Surely they are no fools when they can live nicely on the pension the same as in England.  He can find money for Tulyars, for prize bulls and indeed millions for Dublin Castle.  Where are all the yes-men now?  Why are they so silent, without a word for our cause?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister will be down there shaking hands next year, asking for their votes.  It is about time that the question of old age pensions was dealt with.  It should have been dealt with earlier and a big increase given to meet the cost of living.  Everybody gets an increase except the poor old people and the blind people. Skilled and unskilled workmen can claim through their trade unions for an increase and can go to the Labour Court and get an award there, but the people for whom we are fighting-the old age pensioners and the blind&mdash;have nobody to fight their battles for them except their representatives in this House.  I am quite certain that the smallness of the old age pension is a painful matter to any honest and fairminded Fianna Fáil Deputy who is as well aware as I am that the old age pension and the blind pension are not sufficient to keep their recipients alive. Everybody admits that that is the position.</P>
      <P>The Government should not hesitate to get the necessary money immediately to meet the crying demands of the poor old people and the blind, who are in a desperate plight.  Their cause is the most deserving cause that has been pleaded in Dáil Éireann in this year of 1953, at a time when we have reached the highest peak ever attained in the cost of living in our country. How can anybody honestly expect an old person or a blind person to eke out an existence on 21/6 per week?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that he should consider the abolition of the means test so far as old age pensions are concerned. <Col N="1581" /> Anybody who has attained the age of 70 years and has worked in this country all during his or her lifetime is entitled to receive the old age pension.  It costs a great deal of money to administer this means test. In my own area we have old age pension officers who are paid by the State.  In the course of their duties they sometimes hire taxis and travel 40 or 50 miles around the area&mdash;paying 1/- a mile, I suppose.  They have their subsistence allowance as well. The sole purpose of their journeys is to find out whether Mrs. Murphy has ten hens or 40 hens.  If Mrs. Murphy is 70 years of age and has spent her whole life working in this country she is entitled to receive the old age pension.  No means test is applied in the matter of children's allowances. Wealthy people receive children's allowances just the same as the poorer classes and there is no means test whatsoever.  They do not, however, get the relief in income-tax to which they would normally be entitled.</P>
      <P>If we did away with the old age pension means test we could adopt a principle similar to that adopted in regard to children's allowances.  The State would then be saved a considerable amount of expense which is incurred at the moment by investigation officers and it would not lose as much as it is losing in the case of the wealthier sections of the community who are drawing children's allowances.</P>
      <P>I want to refer now to a statement which was made in this House by a responsible Minister of the Government on the 5th February of this year in relation to an officer of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>A good deal of lip service has been given by Deputies on all sides to the welfare of the old and the sick, of the widow and orphan and of blind people.  I suggest that the motion tabled by the Labour Party gives an opportunity of expressing this sympathy in a very practical and concrete form.  A vote for our motion will mean a lot more than promises of future help because it will impress on the Minister the solidarity of Deputies in their wish to see old age pensions increased.  Coming to the festive season of Christmas I suggest that if this motion is passed it will bring <Col N="1586" /> greater cheer and greater happiness to all who receive benefit from State funds in the form of old age pensions, and so on, under the Social Welfare Act than all the promises and all the lip service we have got in the past.</P>
      <P>It is always strange to me, as a Labour Deputy&mdash;admittedly here only a short time&mdash;how the Government Party, who when they were in opposition and out of Government were so loud in their demands for increased social welfare benefits can, on returning to Government, become again conservative and miserable in their outlook towards these benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that Labour&mdash; perhaps the Minister would like to contradict this&mdash;whether in Government or out, were consistent in both their demands and their pressure for increased benefits, and I may say that the Labour Party take no small pride in the fact that whatever progress was made was shared in by them in so far as the main pressure came from them, whether in Government or partly in Government, as they were, or outside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A little consideration of the value of present-day money compared with 1939 will make a case that will be admitted by Deputies on any side for the need for an increase in old age pensions. I presume that the answer of the Government or of any Deputy who does not desire to give these increases will be that &ldquo;we understand there is a need for increased old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, blind pensions and unemployment benefits but the country cannot afford them until&rdquo;&mdash;as I noticed the Minister said in his opening speech&mdash;&ldquo;we have more production.  We are paying as large an amount as the country can afford and it would be disastrous to go beyond it.&rdquo;  I feel it my duty in whatever humble way I can to draw attention to the value of the pensions as <Col N="1587" /> they are now and to stress and to underline the need for an increase and, not only that, but in a small way to make suggestions as to what I think my Party would support by way of increase, if necessary, to meet what will be admitted to be a genuine claim.</P>
    <P>There are ways and means whereby the economic life of this country does not have to be endangered in any way, while still providing the extra £2,000,000, or even more, necessary to meet a limited increase in the various benefits to different categories.  For almost a week, we listened here to a debate on the Estimate for the Department of Finance, during which pretty well every Deputy who spoke dealt glibly with millions of pounds.  We had many references to the investment of millions and one would think that £1,000,000 was a very small sum.  If a loss of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 in income emerged from certain discussions, it was very easily glossed over and a very little amount of explaining was sufficient to satisfy the House; but when it comes to a question of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 for a vital and essential investment, the health and the lives of disabled people, the old, the blind, the widows and orphans and the unemployed, the people who are deprived of an opportunity of earning an income by reason of an act of God, old age or the fact that work is not available, we find that it then becomes a very large sum.  It again becomes an actuality and is impossible to obtain. Even a much lesser sum than £1,000,000 becomes a sum of enormous size.</P>
    <P>We find, for instance, that a sum of £16,000,000 extra was invested by the banks last year in foreign investments. Had some system of taxation been introduced that would not permit that investment of £16,000,000 by the banks, but which would reduce that amount to £14,000,000 or £12,000,000, is it possible that anyone will suggest that the whole economy of the country was going to crumple up as a result?  I find it difficult to believe that it is not just as important to invest in keeping the afflicted people of this country in some standard of comfort as it is to invest our external assets.  If I am <Col N="1588" /> wrong in that my whole conception of Christianity must be wrong.  Let us be open and blunt and say we are materialists and all that matters is the making of a profit and securing out of industry as much as we can for ourselves while ignoring the weakest section of the community.  I would not like to believe that any Government or group of Deputies would believe in such a policy.  If we do not believe in it&mdash;and we do not believe in it because we are contributing £21,000,000 already &mdash;what is the use of spoiling the ship for a ha'porth of tar?  If it is necessary to provide another couple of millions to bring the level of the benefits even up to that of 1948, I would support any proposal the Minister might bring before the House by way of an increase on cigarettes, petrol, drink and the excess profits tax.</P>
    <P>It would not be a bad idea at all if the Minister or the Cabinet devised some budgetary system on three lines. One line would deal with capital expenditure. Another would deal with the ordinary housekeeping of the country and the third would cover social services.  In regard to social services, a tax could be put on excess profits, cigarettes, drink, cinema seats and entertainment.  If that were done and even though cigarettes were dearer we would have the satisfaction of knowing that the last 2d. on cigarettes went to provide a pension for the blind.  If we have to pay something more for petrol we will know that some old age pensioner is at least in comfort.  If cinema seats cost more we know that some orphan is the better off for it.</P>
    <P>There should be some such clear-cut policy and the Minister should see to it that a decent standard of comfort is given to those people.  He should make those who work provide that decent standard of comfort by some such form of taxation.  However, I suggest that the need is not there.  It is a strange thing that in 1947-48 profits of £18,000,000 yielded a sum of £5,000,000 in taxation but, due to the fact that the excess profits tax was removed in 1952-53, profits amounting to £28,000,000 yielded only a tax of £2,500,000.  That is to say, an extra <Col N="1589" /> £10,000,000 not only did not yield more or as much but £2,500,000 less.  That is due to the removal of the excess profits tax.  My Party is prepared to support the Minister if he desires to reimpose that tax.</P>

      <P>The Minister has no responsibility for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>He has not, I quite agree. The Minister could, however, convey the suggestion to his colleagues that our Party would not vote against any decision in that respect.  We have a loss of £10,000,000 this year through removing that tax which would go a considerable way to meet the losses that would be sustained by reason of the increases.</P>
      <P>The value of the £ at the present moment is 8/8 and it is quite easy to see what increase would be necessary in the various benefits given by the Department to make them equal to what they were prior to 1939.  In that year the old age pensioner received 10/-.  That was admitted to be the lowest amount they could possibly be given.  Another Party decided 9/- was enough.  I am satisfied that anything lower than 10/- would have been criminal.  Twenty-three shillings at present-day rates is equivalent to 10/-in 1939.  Unfortunately, the old age pensioner receives only 21/6.  An unemployed single man has at the present moment 24/-.  Expressed in terms of money in 1939 that is equivalent to 10/7, but in 1939 an unemployed single man had 15/-.  Instead of the unemployed single man receiving an increase he has been cut down from 15/-to 10/7, having regard to present-day prices and the cost of living.  He would require an extra 6/- per week in present-day money to compensate him and bring him to the level he was formerly at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits proposed by Deputy Norton are pretty well on a level with what are paid at the present time by the Minister.  If that scheme were introduced by Deputy Norton at the present day, to get the same value all benefits would have to be increased by 25 per cent. when you view the matter against the background of 1939 prices. <Col N="1590" /> There was an increase of 25 per cent. since 1949.  If the index figure in that year is taken on base 100, it will be seen that it is now 125, so that there is no disputing the fact that an increase of 25 per cent. would only be the barest justice for the people drawing State benefits.  I think that sums up pretty well all I can put forward at the moment in support of the motion.  If any words or assurances of mine or of my colleagues would get from the Minister the smallest promise of even reconsidering the position, I would be pleased.</P>
    <P>I would like to say just a few words in connection with the Estimate itself and in particular with regard to certain regulations made by the Minister in connection with social welfare benefits. I put a question on the Order Paper some weeks ago addressed to the present Minister asking him the reason why a certain widow received only half benefit on the strength of the stamps put to her credit by herself and no benefit in relation to two dependent children.  I was surprised to discover that, under a regulation made by the Minister when this House was not sitting, a contributory widow, who had by virtue of her husband's stamps an entitlement to a pension which could not be interfered with and to which no means test could be applied, found, when she built up a credit such that if she were a single woman would give her a certain rate of benefit when unemployed, she was forbidden to get it in full and would only receive half benefit.  Because of the fact that she had an entitlement to a certain amount under the stamps contributed by her late husband, the Minister decided that her dependent children should receive no additional benefits.  Regulations such as that should not be brought out by a Minister.  They merit, and should receive before being introduced and put into effect, the approval of this House.  I have no doubt the Minister knows he could, with the majority of support he has behind him, secure the approval of the House, but it would at least give us an opportunity of putting before the public that act which, I believe, is one of the worst that has been committed under the regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> There was also the case that was brought to our notice of an unmarried mother with dependent children who, due to the fact that she was living with her mother and not independently in a house of her own, was not entitled to benefit.  Again I think that is a regulation which should not have been made and that the opinion of this House should at least have been sought before it was brought into force.  I am aware of the rights we have as Deputies in regard to regulations when they are made, but it is pretty difficult for Deputies to keep on examining the different regulations. Even if you had the time and the knowledge, it would be almost impossible to comprehend the various effects the regulations would have until a particular case was brought to your attention and an illustration given as to what could happen under it.  It is most unfair that advantage is taken of the absolutely necessary proviso which the Minister has in the Act whereby he can make regulations, to make such sweeping regulations which are a negation of the actual Act under which he is working.</P>
    <P>The working out of the Social Welfare Act and the different benefits given under it is, as far as I am concerned, not satisfactory.  I have some small knowledge of the national health insurance schemes and of the working thereof.  I have come across in the past ten years in my position as trade union organiser quite a number of cases of claims for benefits for unemployment, but I can say&mdash;and I am one of the Deputies who has taken advantage of the Minister's offer to communicate to him any delays which I notice or are reported to me&mdash;that never have I seen so many delays and so many mistakes as in the past six months.  That is not just one of those wild statements.  That is a statement I can stand over before any officer of national insurance and prove with facts and figures, including membership numbers.  I know that some of these are due to the country agents not having an adequate knowledge of the new regulations.  Branch managers, small labour exchanges, and so on are not expected to have as <Col N="1592" /> comprehensive a knowledge as fulltime officers, but I do believe there is considerable delay both at headquarters, as well as below, in arriving at decisions, so much so that I have known of cases in which, for instance, one married person was deprived of benefit for a period of 18 weeks.</P>
    <P>On reporting the case it was investigated at headquarters and strange to relate someone must have been wrong because, notwithstanding the Dáil reply from the Minister that the person in question was not entitled to benefit, on the same day the Minister gave me that reply the person was paid benefit in full and back money at £40.  Someone made a mistake somewhere.  I am quite prepared to give the Minister the name and address of that person&mdash; Joseph Organ, Senior, T.J. Murphy Place, Abbeyside, Dungarvan.  The Minister can do any checking he likes on that.</P>

      <P>It is an ill wind that does not blow somebody good.  I would like to make a plea to the Minister in connection with some of his officials.  These are not the higher paid officials but the relieving officers under the Dublin Board of Assistance.  I understand that a recommendation from the chief executive officer is actually with the Minister at the present moment in which he is asked to bring the cost-of-living bonus of which they are in receipt up to 30 per cent.  They are at present in receipt of a cost-of-living bonus of roughly 20 per cent.  I am told all officers under the Department of Social Welfare have been on that reduced cost-of-living bonus but all employees in similar clerical jobs under the Department of Local Government are actually receiving 30 per cent.  I feel that these men are entitled in justice to have their claim accepted especially when they have the recommendation <Col N="1593" /> of the board which is mainly responsible for looking into their case and into their service, and they are as much entitled to it as the clerical officers of the Department of Local Government.</P>
      <P>I understand that in other Departments of State there is an increment bonus of £25 given for long service, but that that is not given in the case of the officials of the Department of Social Welfare.  The Minister would only be doing what is just if he saw to it that those who work in his particular Department get at least as much as they are entitled to.  As I say, a recommendation has gone in from the chief executive officer of the board of assistance in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I would like to conclude by making a special appeal to all Deputies in the House who are in favour of an increase for those most deservedly in receipt of benefit under the social welfare code, to add their voice to ours not with a view to attempting to put the present Government in a wrong light in relation to benefit but with a view to disentangling this from the political advantages that could accrue on either side. If it could be treated as an all-Party measure, if we in this House could believe that there is a need for an increase and if the various sides would agree between themselves that all political comment on the methods of securing that increase or making that increase possible, whether by taxation or in some other way, should be cast aside, we would be approaching the problem in the light that there are people suffering who cannot help themselves and that it is our duty to help them.  In this regard the House should combine, throwing aside all political strife and making one effort to give these people at least the maximum the country can afford but the minimum on which they can live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion:-</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in view of the high cost of living, the following benefits under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, should be substantially increased, i.e., old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, <Col N="1594" /> blind pensions, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>I think the majority of Deputies will agree that a review of the rates of social services is, and has been, too infrequent since social services were introduced here, and since the establishment of an Irish Government.  I do not think that the case that was made by Deputy Norton, by members of this Party and by other members of the House, could be too strongly stressed, especially when we have regard to how defenceless those people are who are in receipt of social services.  Workmen, whether skilled or unskilled, are served by their trade unions, and likewise business people by their associations.  Each possesses a certain strength in bargaining power. Those in trade unions can give their labour or withhold it.  Their unions can come to certain agreements with regard to the wages which their members should be paid.  Similarly, in the case of business people.  Manufacturers and industrialists, generally, have a bargaining power which I think we are all agreed they wield pretty well and pretty frequently for their own advantage.</P>
    <P>It has, therefore, as Deputy O'Leary has said, been left to the public representatives to fight the case on behalf of recipients under the Social Welfare Act with the strength that a trade union, or an association representing business people, would fight a case on behalf of those whom it represents.  I wholeheartedly support the view that was expressed by Deputy Kyne, on behalf of this Party, namely, that the Minister ought to consider the introduction of a special Budget for the raising of money, through taxation or by other means, for the financing of the bill for social welfare that is presented to the House annually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I mention that because Deputies on the Government Benches taunted us with this: that while we are very prone to ask <Col N="1595" /> the Minister to increase certain benefits we never attempt to suggest how the money could be raised to meet the cost of them.  In any case I do not propose to develop that point beyond saying that if the Government and the Minister for Finance have any particular views with regard to the raising of money through taxation especially for the purpose of increasing the social services, they will find the Labour Party, to put it mildly, rather sympathetic in their attitude to any such proposal.</P>
      <P>There have been some protests, halfhearted in some cases, with regard to the amount that is being spent here on social services.  Deputies from both sides of the House have mentioned that we have already reached the limit, or the ceiling, with regard to social services. I wonder when they say that do they mean that we have reached the limit or the ceiling with regard to the amount of money that we are now spending on social services, or that we should not go into other branches of social services and that the services which we have now spending on social services, or that we should not go into other branches of social services and that the services which we have now are quite sufficient to meet the needs of the country?  I would suggest that in neither respect have we reached the limit.  The House, as a whole, has accepted responsibility for old age pensioners, widows and orphans, blind people, people unemployed and people who are sick.  If we have accepted in principle that responsibility I think we should also have the responsibility of seeing that these various classes of people get adequate allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bill of £21,000,000 for social services presented by the Minister does not frighten me and does not frighten the Labour Party, because the Deputies who, in the early part of their speeches, said that we had reached the limit with regard to social services, were the Deputies who also suggested that old age pensioners, blind pensioners, people in receipt of disability benefits were not getting enough. Apart from the fact that I do not believe we have reached the limit in social services in this country, as far as the amount of money that we are spending on them, is concerned, I am <Col N="1596" /> of opinion that there are other avenues which could be exploited with a view to helping financially people who cannot help themselves in that respect.  I do not want to develop that point at any great length, but surely in the field of social services there is still open the question as to whether or not a non-contributory widow's pension should be applied to widows who are under the age of 48 years.  That is an improvement which could be effected. I believe that the Minister and the Government have not closed their minds on that particular subject and that they are still open to be influenced on it.</P>
    <P>Will anyone suggest that we have reached the ceiling in the matter of social services, and that we should put from our minds the consideration of granting old age pensions at the age of 65?  To do that would not be revolutionary. I suggest that we are still entitled to consider, and I hope that any Government that we may have will consider, making some provision for spinsters who have reached a certain age.</P>
    <P>I have given three examples of ways in which we could still further improve our social services, and I hope that the present Minister or his successor will give thought and consideration to the three proposals I have mentioned.  I have said that, in my opinion, a review of the rates paid to recipients under the Social Welfare Act has been too infrequent.  It is only at particular times, especially times of political crises, that Governments or Parties are prone to have regard to the plight of such people as old age pensioners, widows and orphans, people who are unemployed and people who are sick. I would suggest in all seriousness to the Minister for Social Welfare, whoever he might be, that he should review these rates when the Budget is being introduced.</P>
    <P>The history of social welfare in this country has been mentioned in this House on several occasions.  In my view, our record with regard to the payments made, especially to old age pensioners, is not one of which we as a Parliament can be proud.  I would, <Col N="1597" /> therefore, repeat my suggestion that, on the introduction of every Budget, and having regard to the cost of living, whether it has gone up or gone down, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Social Welfare should review these allowances from the point of view of granting increases if the cost of living so demands it.  This particular motion asks that the different benefits under the Social Welfare Act will be increased and we suggest in this motion that, in view of the fact that the cost of living has gone up by about 23 or 25 per cent. since the Act was first introduced, consideration should be given to increasing those rates by a similar percentage.</P>
    <P>The withdrawal of the food subsidies and the consequent increase in essential foodstuff prices has been a very big blow to people in receipt of benefits under the Social Welfare Act of 1952, because I think it is pretty well agreed in this House that the foodstuffs in respect of which the subsidies were withdrawn were the items of food that mean life or death to old age pensioners, widows, sick people and people unemployed.  The compensation given in the Budget proposals of 1952 &mdash;take, for example, the 1/6 a week given to the old age pensioners&mdash;could not be regarded as adequate compensation for the increases in the prices of tea, bread, butter, sugar, flour, cigarettes, stout and, in some cases, the glass of whiskey.  The 1/6 a week did not at all compensate them, because tea, bread, butter, sugar and flour were things which were absolutely essential to people in receipt of benefits from the Social Welfare Act of 1952.</P>
    <P>There is another big item of expenditure especially at the present time and that is the rents of houses.  All of us on the Vote for Local Government bewailed the big rents being demanded from people who go into houses that have been newly constructed, and surely it is not suggested &mdash;and nobody will agree if one were to give absolute thought and perfect consideration to it&mdash;that a person in receipt of 24/- a week by way of sickness benefit, or even 36/- a week provided he is married, could afford to pay a sum ranging from 10/- to 20/- a week <Col N="1598" /> for rent.  It is inevitable that he would go into arrears and it is a fact that when his period of sickness was over and he could get his normal wages again it would take him quite a considerable time to pay off the arrears accumulated when he was in receipt of a mere 36/- a week.</P>
    <P>Under a scheme which I think is administered by the Minister in his capacity as Minister for Health, that is the infectious diseases maintenance allowances scheme, there is provision for the payment of rent allowances. Persons suffering from T.B., and who are eligible for the infectious diseases maintenance allowances can be given, and are given, in most cases rent allowances to tide them over the period in which they are incapacitated. I would suggest that in respect of benefits given under the Social Welfare Act of 1952 the Minister should seriously consider making provision for a rent allowance.  It is one of the principal items of expenditure every week and if a man has not his home he has nothing.  It is the one thing he cannot give up, and I think one of the first considerations in regard to benefits under the Social Welfare Act should be the provision of rent allowances for old age pensioners, widows and orphans, blind pensioners, those in receipt of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance and those in receipt of sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>No useful purpose would be served by my travelling ground that was travelled by Deputy Norton when he introduced this motion for consideration by this House, but it might be no harm to mention the rates which are paid in some cases.  I would be wholeheartedly behind the proposal or suggestion made by Deputies McQuillan and Lehane that there be no means test for old age pensions.  I would not be at all satisfied with the reply or quip that when we were part of the Government we did not abolish the means test.  That would be the obvious crack to make but as we go ahead, we advance in our ideas and we accumulate much more information.  The suggestion has often been mooted that if an old age pension were given to a <Col N="1599" /> person who did not really deserve it, some other method such as income-tax ought to be devised to balance up or take a substantial portion of the pension of that particular person.  I think that an approach to the question in that way might meet the objections that would be raised to the abolition of the means test in respect of old age pensions.  The children's allowances are applied to all families who have two or more children and are balanced up when income-tax is being assessed and if it can be done in respect of the payment of children's allowances to everybody irrespective of means, I would suggest, therefore, that the Minister would do well to consider a similar approach to the granting of old age pensions to people who reach a certain age.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters on administration or on some of the regulations that I would like to raise with the Minister.  Up to the operation of the Social Welfare Act of 1952, on January 1953 certain people who had been voluntary contributors could avail of the dental benefits and had applied to them national health insurance and the benefits in respect of widowhood or orphanhood in their families.  Under the present Act the only benefit which they can claim arising out of their voluntary contributions is widows' pensions in respect of their wives and orphans' pensions in respect of their children.  I think the Minister ought to reconsider his decision in that respect and have applied to these voluntary contributors the benefits that have been conferred on them up to January 5th, 1953.</P>
    <P>With regard to delays in the payment of benefits, I think most of the delays occur where applications are made for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit where the applicants had stamps to their credit in Britain.  I find on inquiry at the Department of Social Welfare that in the vast majority of these cases it is not the fault of the Department but it is the fault of their opposite number, the Ministry of Pensions or the Ministry of National Insurance in Great Britain.  The Minister's predecessor <Col N="1600" /> made a reciprocal agreement with regard to insurance payments. The present Minister made a reciprocal agreement with regard to the payment of insurance in both these countries, but I think there ought to be some sort of complaint made or some inquiry suggested by the Minister for Social Welfare in this country to the Ministry of Pensions in Britain that applications which involved the transfer of credit from Great Britain have been unduly delayed to the detriment of unfortunate people in this country waiting for unemployment assistance benefit or national health insurance benefit.  The general opinion here is that the Department of Social Welfare is to blame, but, in my experience, these delays are the fault of the British Ministry of Pensions, which does not have the credits transferred from Britain in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>I want to raise now a matter in which I believe the Minister can be very helpful.  I refer to the practice of certain people here, shall we say &ldquo;common informers&rdquo;, who, in certain cases, try to do their unemployed colleagues harm by sending in anonymous letters to the labour exchanges stating that so-and-so was working on a particular day or days.  It is true that in some cases men have been charged in the courts and found guilty of working and drawing unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit at the same time.  No one condones that, but for as long as I can remember the Department of Social Welfare has tolerated the writers of anonymous letters and I hold that that is tantamount to encouraging the practice of informing on one's neighbour.</P>
    <P>To my own knowledge there have been cases where an individual had a grudge against another man and, in order to do him harm and delay payment of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or disability benefit, took up his pen or pencil and scribbled a note to the manager of the local labour exchange saying that this particular individual had been working and drawing dole at the same time. In that way payment of assistance was held up whilst the circumstances of the case were being inquired into.  If anybody <Col N="1601" /> has any information about any irregularity he should at least have the decency to append his name to the letters he writes.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to bring the attention of the Minister, and that is the attitude of what used to be called the Court of Referees; I do not know what particular term is applied to it now.  I refer to the hearing of cases in the presence of an appeals officer from the Department in relation to disallowing a man unemployment assistance on the ground that he is not looking for work.  Veiled suggestions have been made here that numbers of men would prefer to draw dole rather than work.  It has been said that we could save a lot of money if we were more rigid in our attitude towards the granting of unemployment assistance. We all know that in our own constituencies and in our own home towns there is a very small percentage who would prefer to suffer the indignity of appearing at the labour exchange every morning in order to qualify for unemployment assistance rather than be employed.  There is a very small percentage which would prefer to suffer the indignity of being questioned and cross-questioned by the appeals officer rather than do a day's or a week's work for decent wages.  Extensive evidence that the applicant has been looking for work is usually asked for. He has to produce letters from all types of employers to the effect that he has sought work and has been refused.  The people who sit with the appeals officer and who are usually people from the particular locality in which these cases are heard, are in a far better position to tell the appeals officer what the situation really is with regard to employment.  That would be preferable to having the unfortunate man going around for weeks or months before his case is heard asking at least ten employers whether or not they have work.</P>
    <P>A question was asked here to-day and, despite the reply given by the Minister, the position still appears to be very unsatisfactory.  I refer to the refusal of the Minister to give unemployment assistance to an unmarried <Col N="1602" /> mother and an allowance in respect of the child or children.  I think a regulation was made to the effect that before an unmarried mother and her child or children can get unemployment assistance she must be living in a separate house and must be, in effect, the head of the household.  If she is living with her parents, or with a parent, she is not regarded as the head of the household for the purpose of obtaining unemployment assistance.  Surely the Minister will admit that it is most desirable that an unmarried mother and her child or children should live with her parents and that it is entirely undesirable that she should live in a house apart from her parents.  On moral grounds, I do not think there is any justification for such a regulation. I will put it no further than that.</P>
    <P>The Minister represents the same constituency as I do and I am sure he is as interested as I am in the condition of the local offices of the Department of Social Welfare, usually called the labour exchanges.  I have not had any complaints from any of the officials but as a result of my visits to Wexford labour exchange I can say it is certainly not a credit to the Department for Social Welfare.  It looks to me to be in bad repair.  It is badly lighted.  It is not ill-kept; indeed, it is scrupulously clean, but it is certainly not the kind of office in which the affairs of the Department of Social Welfare ought to be conducted.  I do not know whether it is the function of the Minister or the Board of Works, but I think he should ensure that the existing labour exchanges are put into proper repair or an attempt made to secure better premises.</P>
    <P>A question arises in connection with certain officials who come under the jurisdiction of the Minister, namely, the home assistance officers.  It seems to me that the conditions applying to home assistance officers differ from county to county and even from area to area.  I would suggest, therefore, that a regular scheme and regular scale of salary or wages should be established for home assistance officers and that the conditions of employment of home assistance officers throughout the that the conditions of employment of home assistance officers throughout the Twenty-Six Counties should be regularised <Col N="1603" /> and that the same conditions and the same rate of wages be applied.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that because the Social Welfare Act of 1952 created so many changes it is very difficult to devise a regular scheme in a short time.  A large number of officials find great difficulty in making themselves conversant with the provisions of the Act and the regulations that have been made since the operation of the Act.  I would suggest that the Minister ought to have prepared, printed and distributed a booklet giving the main features of the regulations and the provisions of the Act to the general public and to public representatives. The book which has been published by the Department of Social Welfare under the title <i>Summary of Social Services</i> has proved extremely beneficial to me and to any person who has been lucky enough to get a copy but such sweeping changes have been made in the Act by regulations that the Minister would be well advised to publish another booklet embodying the contents of this summary and in addition giving the main features of the regulations that have been introduced since the operation of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are prepared to support the motion tabled by the Labour Party with a view to securing increases for the sections of the community referred to in it.  Over the past ten or 12 years all Parties in this House, from time to time, have sponsored similar motions. It must be agreed that there has been a big change in the past ten years in respect of old age pensioners and widows and orphans, inasmuch as they have got in some instances 100 per cent. increase in pensions.  It must also be recognised that there has been a corresponding increase in the cost of living.  It was because of the increase in the cost of living that motions such as that now sponsored by the Labour Party were tabled.  It is generally accepted that where the recipient of these pensions has to depend wholly on the allowance given by the State, the allowance is not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although we may claim that <Col N="1604" /> £21,000,000 is a large sum of money to spend on social services, if we are shouldering certain responsibilities we must face the fact that we have to make further efforts to secure extra provision for these people to enable them to meet the cost of living and to give those who are unable to help themselves a bare means of existence.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to labour the position of the old age pensioner, the widow or the orphan because that has been stressed over the years by all groups in the House.  I do not suggest that sincerity is not more than skin deep. I do not suggest that there is anything other than a desire to help these people.  Let us hope that a desire to help these people is the object of the motion before the House and that it serves no other purpose and was introduced for no other purpose.  If that is so, the sponsors of the motion can be assured of our wholehearted support.  It is only natural that that should be the case in a motion coming from the Labour Party but similar motions have come from every other Party over the past ten or 15 years, seeking aid and assistance for the sections mentioned in the motion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to the fact that certain Deputies referred to the sum of £21,000,000, which indicated that in the opinion of these Deputies we had reached a ceiling or saturation point in the provision of moneys for these services.  We must bear in mind that it is a large sum of money for a part of a nation, such as this is, and for such a small population.  One cannot describe our population as comprising the very rich.  A big percentage of our population are very poor.  Our population is mostly comprised of small business people and working-class people.  By direct and indirect taxation they contribute £21,000,000 towards the people mentioned in the motion.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputy Blowick would not be a party to any suggestion that we would not in the near future consider the needs of old age pensioners, widows and orphans.  What he intended to convey last night was that there could be economies within the administration of the Minister's Department <Col N="1605" /> which would go a long way in helping to make the increased provision which we have in mind for these people which would help to relieve the present strain.</P>
    <P>I have in mind the considerable sum we spend in the form of unemployment assistance.  I would not for one moment advocate abolition of unemployment assistance but I do say that we are making very little effort to reduce the number of recipients of unemployment assistance by the provision of stable employment.  If this Government or future Governments could provide stable employment the money now spent on unemployment assistance could be utilised to increase old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that, Sir, but I am replying to the interjection by the Parliamentary Secretary. I am not permitted to go into that by the Chair, as you will appreciate, but I could very easily give you an explanation as to where the money would come from for the provision of employment. I would not consider that a big obstacle at all.  However, it may seem a big obstacle to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Party he has the honour to be a member of.  That I do not know, but I do say that when this <Col N="1606" /> section of the House had the honour to be the Government of this country for three years and three months they set a good headline in that direction by the provision of employment and the reduction of the number on the unemployment register during that particular period.</P>
      <P>However, I do not want to cross swords with the Chair and I will try to keep to the few points I intend to make.  I do say that that would be one way we could find to reduce the number of recipients of unemployment assistance.  While on that point I wish to bring another matter to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary, and I am glad it is he who is here in the House rather than the Minister, because I believe that he is more conversant with it, living as he does in the country down in Westmeath and with no strained relations between himself and the country district that he represents.  I want to ask him candidly does he approve of the system where, if a young man to-morrow morning goes out to seek work on a minor employment scheme which may be under way for the past few weeks, he has to cycle six, seven and sometimes ten miles to secure a card and present that card to the ganger in charge of that job before he can get employment?  Is it fair that if he goes out to-morrow morning and presents himself to the ganger and is asked:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Have you a card?&rdquo; and he replies: &ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; he has got to go by bicycle, if he has one, or if he has not got one, he must walk ten miles to secure a card before he is considered a suitable person to be employed on that temporary minor employment scheme?  I think it is wrong, and something should be done to change that system altogether.  It is outdated and out-moded and primitive in every sense of the word and it is time that it was changed.  I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary and his predecessors over the years have had it brought to their notice that something should be done, but they do not take any interest.  I hope it will be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I want to say this about another matter which I think is wrong: <Col N="1607" /> there are in my constituency and, I am sure, in every other constituency young men who detest the idea of presenting themselves as applicants for unemployment assistance.  They would rather go out and wash bottles than come down to that level.  However, through no fault of their own but due to circumstances outside their control they are forced into that degrading situation. These young men who have come home from England perhaps in the back end of the year, coming home early in November and remaining at home until the end of February or the middle of March, have not a hope during that period of getting a job of work, one day's employment, unless they sign on at the local labour exchange and thrash out with the manager of the labour exchange and the investigation officer all their particulars and their whole life's history, what they have and what they have not got, in order to become the recipient of those few shillings that they get, and to qualify for a day's work.  I think the time is here when any man prepared to take off his jacket and pull up his shirt sleeves and do a day's work should get it, and there should be none of this red tape preventing him from taking part in any particular scheme wherever it may be in operation.</P>
    <P>There are young men in rural Ireland living on small uneconomic holdings, especially in the West of Ireland, rearing large families of six or seven and sometimes ten or 11 children, who are in receipt of unemployment assistance the whole year round and without warning some Monday morning by post or otherwise they are notified that they must report three or four miles away for work.  It is argued that if such a man fails to report for work he is malingering, a slacker, just in receipt of this money because he wishes to be in receipt of it, and never has any intention of working, and there are some who say that he is one of the corner boys or idlers who never intend to do an honest day's work.  That is untrue.  You might find a few of those gentlemen in our cities or our very large towns, but they would be very few, and they are far rarer in the country areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider carefully the case of a married man with a family who has been in receipt of unemployment assistance the whole year round and is living may be on a holding of £2 10s. or £3 10s. valuation and is called out to work just at a time when he cannot go, due to circumstances at home.  It may be just the time when he is fully occupied with his little bit of land during the haymaking or the harvest or getting the turf in which is to provide fuel for his family, but if he fails to report then for work he is disqualified and no longer in receipt of unemployment assistance which he cannot very well get on without.  The single man is totally different, except in the case where the single man is actually shouldering the responsibility of a head of a family, we will say where the father has died and the eldest son has taken on the responsibility of the care of the home and helping his mother out to maintain the younger members of the family.  In that case he is in every sense the head of the house and he should be so considered, but where there are a lot of young men in receipt of unemployment assistance I would not very well consider them if they did not report for employment.  I would like that consideration would be given to each case in accordance with its merits.</P>
    <P>I have no time for the Referee Court at all.  It is only a matter of form and a waste of time to bring Tom, Dick or Harry before it to state their case, because they are condemned, judged and the verdict passed before they ever arrive there.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the national health.  I do not know how that functions at all.  Every Deputy in this House from time to time gets letters from people who seem to be, so to speak, lost.  They do not know exactly where they stand, and they can be for weeks and weeks and weeks sending in certificates but nothing coming in, no money.  They may be all their lives employed and, due to sickness or some other reason, fall out of employment.  They sign on for the national health and nothing is done. It goes on like that for months.  I do not know where the mistake is or who <Col N="1609" /> is at fault, but definitely it is a widespread complaint.  I am not saying that the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister or his staff are at fault, but somebody is definitely at fault, and I would like that that would be looked into and corrected, whoever is at fault.</P>
    <P>As regards the widow, I understand that you do not qualify for the widows' pension unless you have reached the age of 48 years, unless you have dependents&mdash;that is, unless you have a number of children.  There are a number of young women who may have no family and their husbands have died, and nowadays it is very hard even for a single woman or a single man to find a partner, and a widow or a widower would find it hard to secure a second partner.  Such a young woman if she remains on as a widow will find life difficult.  Say she married at 24 or 25 and that her husband died at 30 and that she has a very small holding which she is anxious to cling on to, but she has no family and cannot secure a partner to help out in the cultivation of the holding, and even if she had an income out of it it would not be an awful lot because her husband, if he had lived, would likely enough be in receipt of unemployment assistance on such a small holding.  He could not exist otherwise.  Now she is expected to subsist on a pension which is reduced by 50 per cent. although she has no income.  If she desires a little bit of tillage, she must pay somebody to put it down.  She has no chance of getting any further assistance from the State unless she applies for home assistance, which is the last thing she would dream of doing except in very extreme circumstances.  I think that the provisions of the Act should be changed or that something should be done to meet that type of case.</P>
    <P>I stated that I would not delay the House and I do not intend to do so because it is rather late in the day to discuss Estimates when the money provided under them is almost spent.  I should like the Minister, however, to consider the few points I have made in relation in particular to unemployment assistance and to the necessity of having to travel such long distances for <Col N="1610" /> cards to enable a man to secure employment on the little jobs that are going on throughout the country at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>A few years ago, a reciprocal agreement was made with the British Government in regard to the payment of social welfare benefits of different kinds to residents in this country who worked for a period in Great Britain, Scotland or the Six Counties.  Many of my constituents are people who work across the Border in the City of Derry or in the town of Strabane, and I find that when they become unemployed or fall ill, there are very long delays in the payment of unemployment benefit or sickness benefit. I realise, of course, that this agreement has been in operation only a short time and possibly there are snags in it, but I would suggest that, having had a few years' experience of the working of this agreement, a meeting should now take place between the officers of our Department here and officials of the Social Welfare Department on the other side, with a view to straightening out some of the snags that experience has brought to light. I do know that very serious delays have occurred.  I know of cases where unemployment benefits have not been paid three months after the application was made and in regard to sickness benefits I know cases where the delays are even longer.  I would suggest therefore that a further meeting should take place between the officials concerned on both sides so that these matters could be remedied.  I was told that in some of the cases our Department wrote to the officials in Belfast, that a reminder was sent later on, and that no reply was received.  That is a situation that I am very sure could be remedied, and I would suggest that it be remedied fairly soon, because there should be no difficulty in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have figures here which show the increase in social welfare benefits in the past few years and the increases are fairly substantial.  I think myself that in regard to children's allowances, sickness benefit and disablement benefit, etc., a great improvement has taken place because a number of years ago these benefits were only nominal <Col N="1611" /> while nowadays I think they are pretty good.  There is one social welfare benefit which I should like to see increased and that is the benefit payable to old age pensioners.  That is still too small.  Another grievance, I think, is the fact that the limit in the means test is too low.  A third grievance is that when a person who has been employed reaches 70 years of age and applies for an old age pension, his earnings for the previous year are taken into consideration in assessing his means.  I think that should not be the case as everybody knows that it is not very much use when the 31st December arrives in any particular year, to go looking for one's earnings of 12 months previously.  They are all gone.  When a man reaches the old age pension age I think it is not right to hold against him his earnings for the previous year.  If it is apparent to the social welfare officer that he is not now employed and that his income is under the statutory limit, I think that no question of his income for the previous 12 months should be considered and that he should be given the pension automatically.</P>
    <P>I think the question of the remuneration and conditions of service of managers of employment exchange offices and sub-offices should also be reviewed.  I am not quite sure of the exact details of their grievance but I know they have a grievance.  The position of officials of the national health insurance organisation who were taken over by the Department should also be reviewed and these officials should be given full Civil Service status.  I do know that there are a number of grievances there that should be remedied and I think their case should be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have experience, such as the last Deputy mentioned, of very long delays in the payment of sickness benefits to insured persons.  There should be no delay or if some delay is inevitable, it should be as little as possible because it is during the period of sickness that benefit is most needed.  It is not much consolation to a person who is ill to find that he has to wait three months before getting sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> A final point that I should like to make deals with the wives of men who are permanently disabled.  I do know that some time ago the wives of men who were not fit to work or who were permanently disabled were entitled to unemployment assistance.  I find now that, as is the case with unmarried mothers, the wives of permanently disabled men are being deprived of unemployment assistance.  I do not think that is right.  If the husband is not fit to work, although he may be the head of the household, I maintain that the wife of that person should receive unemployment assistance.  I do not know whether this is a new regulation but I am inclined to think that it is not.  I think the wording of the Act remains the same but that there is now too strict an adherence to the letter of the law.  The law is being interpreted more strictly now than it was previously.</P>
    <P>That is also the case in respect to unmarried mothers.  Some of these mothers who have two children are in receipt of children's allowance. Yet, for the purpose of receiving unemployment assistance such a mother, in many cases, is not regarded as the head of the household and, therefore, does not qualify for unemployment assistance. I agree with the point made by Deputy Corish when he said that the unmarried mother who is living with her parents or with another relative should be regarded as eligible.  When an unmarried mother is living in a house of her own she gets unemployment assistance. Yet, when she is living with a father or with another person who is the head of the household the assistance is not paid.  I think that that should be remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to enter into this debate except to refer to one particular matter.  Several Deputies, Deputy Corish in particular, raised the question of unemployment insurance for an unmarried mother.  I wonder if Deputies are aware of the fact that in certain places in this country there have been very suitable institutions provided in latter years for unmarried mothers where first-class hospital accommodation exists, where the mother and child are taken care of, <Col N="1613" /> and the mother is trained in cooking and in domestic economy and various other matters.  The good nuns in charge of these institutions go out of their way to get employment for these women and have done so successfully. They have turned out so many good girls in these institutions that there is a big demand for them; in fact, they cannot cope with the demand for the employment of them.  If Deputies were aware of this fact, I think that the problem of the unmarried mothers would be solved very quickly.  A woman, instead of feeling debased in the county home as heretofore, is looked after from her entry into the institution before the birth of the baby until she is trained.  The baby is there with the mother for two years until the mother goes out to employment. If that fact were well known to Deputies, I think this question would not come up so frequently in the debate.</P>
      <P>Unemployment insurance benefit and unemployment assistance are for those genuinely seeking employment. When they prove that they cannot get employment then they get either unemployment insurance benefit or unemployment assistance benefit.  There is no hesitation in giving it to them.  If they are in the unfortunate position that they become unmarried mothers, then the institutions in Roscrea, Kanturk and various other places train them properly and get them employment. They are no longer unemployed and many of them are very happily married afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading over the Book of Estimates in connection with the Vote for the office of the Minister for Social Welfare one finds that a sum of £2,324 was provided in the Estimate last year for an adviser to the Minister while there is no provision in the Estimate for 1953-54 for such an adviser. The Minister did not tell the House what had become of the adviser to his Department.  Has the Minister dispensed with the services of his adviser? Does he no longer need the services of an adviser?  As the sum of £2,324 was provided in the Estimate for the financial year 1952-53 for an adviser, has the Minister arrived at such a stage <Col N="1614" /> now that no adviser is necessary to give advice on the running of the Department?  If the Minister considered that he required the services of an adviser last year, what has happened since that no adviser is required to advise the Minister this year?  I would like to hear from the Minister the reasons for the change and why he has discarded the services of an adviser; whether the Secretary of the Department is filling the rôle of Secretary to the Department and adviser to the Minister.  I think we should have a statement from the Minister so as to clear the air in regard to that matter.</P>
      <P>The Department of Social Welfare seems to be a very extragavant Department.  It seems to be a Department in which endless sums of money are being spent on administration.  In other words, we are reaching the stage where the Department of Social Welfare is becoming the most expensive Department of State.  One Minister is in charge of the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health yet in the Department of Health it only costs something like £156,000 to administer £10,500,000 while in the Department of Social Welfare the administration of £22,000,000 costs £1,500,000.  It costs £1,500,000 to administer £22,000,000, yet it will be within the memory of the Ceann Comhairle and the older members of the House that many years ago the Department of Local Government administered old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and the various branches of social welfare as well as the affairs of the Local Government Department itself efficiently at a considerably lower sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there is room for great economy in the Department of Social Welfare.  It has the services of a Minister and of a Secretary&mdash;it had the services of an adviser&mdash;and it has the services of a Parliamentary Secretary at the present time.  One can compare that to the manner in which those services were catered for&mdash;in my opinion, competently and capably&mdash;in the Department of Local Government up to a few years ago at a much lower cost of administration to the taxpayer. <Col N="1615" /> In connection with various services for which the Minister is responsible&mdash; children's allowances, old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, and so on&mdash;we must give consideration to the fact that a very large section of the community is in some way depending on this Department.  That is so more particularly at the present time.  If we calculate the number of old age pensioners, add on the number of widows and then add the number of orphans, add again those in receipt of children's allowances and add again those in receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit, we will come to the conclusion that a very large percentage of the population is in very close contact with the Department and is greatly dependent on the funds provided and on the manner in which they are administered.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of talk about old age pensions, widows' pensions and blind pensions.  Let us not be wool-gathering.  Must not every Deputy admit, without fear of contradiction, that never in the history of the country since the pension was introduced by Lloyd George have the old age pensioners been worse off than they are to-day?  Is it not true to say there is a graver plight, more poverty and greater gloom in their homes than ever before in the history of the country?  Yet various Deputies supporting the Government will vote and will speak loudly about the administration of the present Government and will boast of the improvement they have effected in social services.  They will speak loudly and bravely and without a glimmer of shame of the manner in which the Government has increased these old age pensions and has introduced widows' and orphans' pensions, blind pensions and children's allowances.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is, however, that we are not dealing with what we did or what these pensioners had but what they have to-day or should have. I am glad that Deputies are concentrating on that.  Our advice to the Minister should ring on what those pensioners should have.  If they had 10/- per week pre-war&mdash;that is what they had&mdash;we must not forget that 10/-in <Col N="1616" /> 1939 had the purchasing power of 23/6 to-day.  The pension is only 21/6 to-day and all the old age pensioners do not get 21/6.  How can any Deputy tell us, then, that he supports a Government that has introduced better times and has provided a greater measure of prosperity for the old age pensioners?  It can be proved beyond yea or nay that they are worse off to-day than ever before.  One would be inclined to hang one's head low with shame on considering that the majority of our citizens, after working hard and providing for their families for close on 70 years, whether they have been employed on the fields, in factories, in mills, on the roads or elsewhere, must fall back on 21/6 per week.</P>
    <P>It is very sad when we find that when people are young and in the prime of life there seems to be a place for them all, if they are prepared to occupy that place&mdash;many who are employed in factories and businesses may be described as the white-haired boys when they are able to work and employers can make good use of them &mdash;but the moment old age creeps on them, the moment they find the bones commence to stiffen, the moment the hair turns grey or falls out completely, they come under the eyes of their employer and they are no longer looked upon as citizens who can yield a good return, they are looked upon as outcasts, as old crocks, as ready for the scrap heap.  As soon as they reach 70 years of age they are thrown on that scrap heap and left there, despite all the appeals made to the present Government and to past Governments.</P>
    <P>We here in Ireland, typical for its kindliness and hospitality to the old and aged, should be able to set an example to every Government and every country in the whole world, by providing sufficiently for the aged.  Are we not very far behind the times? Have we not done very little in that respect?  We seem to be giving the blind eye and the deaf ear to the feeble calls and feeble voices from the old and aged asking for help to assist them in their last days on the earth. But no, we provide 21/6 for them and <Col N="1617" /> if they cannot exist on that and have no friends or relatives, there is a place for them where they will end their last days.  It will not be in the comfort of a very comfortable armchair, enjoying the heat of a good coal or turf fire, but in the body of some workhouse, lining up in the long queues for three meals per day in tin mugs, sitting in to their evening meals and evening prayers and lying in the cold iron beds of the work-house&mdash;because 21/6 could not keep them outside the walls of the county homes.  Does not everyone know that to-day there is no boarding-house or lodging-house of standing, capable of taking in a boarder, particularly at the age of 70, and fully providing for all his requirements and necessities for 21/6 a week?  The only alternative he has is to die in the workhouse.  The old age pensioner will not die leaving money.  When he does die, that is not the end of it.  He has the iron wheels of the workhouse hears to sound along the roads until they reach the grave; and there, at the graveside, there may be one or two mouners and he will be lowered down deep into a pauper's grave.  That is the treatment which is well known to many old age pensioners who have no relatives or friends and who would be very anxious to end their days outside the walls of a county home and to be independent.</P>
    <P>Is it any compliment for any Government to provide fully, decently and sufficiently for its old citizens?  I would like to see the old age pension not 21/6 per week but at least £4 10s. per week, so that the pensioner could live independently of everyone and would not be signing on the rolls of the St. Vincent de Paul Society for a bag of fuel or a voucher for Christmas.  I often wonder&mdash;and I am sure Deputies in close contact with rural Ireland wonder&mdash;have the various Ministers or the Head of the Government any idea whatever as to the way these old age pensioners have to live at present.</P>
    <P>A very short time ago, the old age pensioner could purchase a loaf for 6 1/2d. If he requires a loaf to-day he must pay 9d. for it.  He is paying more for his bread to-day than it ever cost him. That goes to show that when the present Government gave a miserable <Col N="1618" /> increase in old age pensions they gave it at a time when the prices of essential commodities were much cheaper than they are now.  Having given that miserable and meagre increase to the old age pensioners, they then raised the price of the loaf from 6 ½d. to 9d. and they raised the prices of other essential commodities as well.  A short time ago, the old age pensioner could purchase a pound of butter for 2/10, but to-day he must pay 4/2 and in some cases 4/3 per pound for it.  How, then, can it be asserted that the old age pensioner is better off to-day than he has ever been in the light of these outrageous and exorbitant prices?</P>
    <P>Many old age pensioners throughout the country are living on two meals per day from Sunday to Wednesday, one meal on Thursday and one meal on Friday morning.  Then they proceed to draw the miserable 21/6 pension. They enjoy two good meals on the afternoon of the Friday, three good meals on Saturday and then they may cut themselves down again until the following Friday.  Just consider the position of these unfortunate people and bear in mind the loud talk of the Minister about all that he has done for the poor.  Is it not true to say that the only thing the present Government have done is to make the poor poorer and to make beggars paupers? Instead of increasing the pensions payable to old age pensioners, to the blind and to the widows and orphans, Fianna Fáil have actually put their hand into the pockets of these unfortunate people and taken money from them. Is there any difference between confronting a very poor man with a pistol and robbing him and taxing his food? Is there any difference between threatening him with a pistol and keeping down his pension and keeping him in misery and want and poverty?  What is the difference? There has never been a greater wave of poverty in this country than there is to-day.  There has never been such a cutting down on the consumption of food, especially by the old age pensioners, as there is in this country to-day.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that a widow is expected to live on a non-contributory pension of £1 per week.  That means <Col N="1619" /> that she is even worse off than the old age pensioner who has 1/6 per week more than she.  The Department of Social Welfare must be aware that there are widows in receipt of the widows' pension to-day who are on the borderline of starvation.  These women would probably be living in comfort and be enjoying the full fruits of a decent family income if the breadwinner had not been taken from the home.  The greatest cross that can befall any family is the death of the bread-winner.  Whilst her friends may sympathise with her, the hard fact is that the widow has to face the world and rough it.  The only assistance she will get will be the £1 a week noncontributory pension.  She must then suffer the humiliation of seeking home assistance or calling on the St. Vincent de Paul Society for help.  What becomes of the unfortunates who say unto themselves: &ldquo;To dig I am unable; to beg I am ashamed&rdquo;?  What becomes of that section of the people?  Then we talk of the services provided by the Department of Social Welfare.  The widows and orphans and the old age pensioners are worse off to-day than they ever were.  It is only within the past two years of the present Government's administration that these decent people have been reduced to the level of paupers.  It took Fianna Fáil to do that to them.</P>
    <P>Let us recall some of the promises made from time to time by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I remember that at one stage Fianna Fáil were promising old age pensioners to the tune of 50/- per week.  We all remember the retiring allowances which the present Minister was promising.  There were to be retiring allowances at 65 for men and at 60 for women.  There was to be a general improvement in services. Instructions were to be issued by the Department to local authorities so that home assistance would be substantially increased.  There were to be magnificent schemes for the poor&mdash;on the eves of general elections.  The moment the general elections were over and past the poor were forgotten again.</P>
    <P>Let us consider another injustice which Fianna Fáil have inflicted on <Col N="1620" /> the old age pensioner.  In rural Ireland&mdash;I suppose that the same can be said of our cities and towns&mdash;the old age pensioner took a delight in purchasing a pint of stout on the day of the week he drew his pension.  The Fianna Fáil Government were not satisfied until they increased the price of a pint so that whereas formerly the old age pensioner could get a pint of stout for 8d. he must now pay 1/- for it.  It is absolutely amazing to hear Deputies such as Deputy Cogan stand up in this House and assert that the old age pensioners, the blind and the widows and orphans are better off to-day than they ever were.</P>
    <P>I am far from being satisfied with the treatment the present Government have meted out to the poorer sections of our people and I want to protest even more vigorously in connection with blind pensions than I have done in connection with either widows' or old age pensions.  What greater affliction, what greater discomfort and what greater trial can there be than to lose one's sight?  In view of the fact that blindness is recognised as the greatest trial possible, one would expect that blind pensions would be even greater than widows' and orphans', old age or any other pensions, but we find that large numbers of people who have only the sight of one eye and who are completely and totally disabled as a result, do not qualify for blind pensions.</P>
    <P>The blind pension is usually paid or approved on certificates from the medical authorities and from oculists who have been requested to make a report as to the blindness of the applicant.  I have known cases in which applicants for blind pensions have been turned down where it has been proven beyond yea or nay that the applicants were totally blind in one eye and losing the sight in the other. Because they were not completely blind they did not qualify for the pension.  How does the Minister think a person can eke out an existence completely blind in one eye and half blind in the other?  Yet the Department turns a deaf ear to that person's claim for justice and fair play.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> The whole matter of blind pensions needs to be reviewed.  There are various tests which applicants are put through before being certified as qualifying for the blind pension.  They are called into a room and numbers are placed on a blackboard easel and they are asked to identify the number. There are other tests, but the real test is that a man cannot earn his livelihood. It is not a question of his being able to see the letter A or the figure 8 on an easel, or whether he can distinguish between a two shilling piece and a half crown.  The real test is his inability to provide for himself. I do not know whether the Minister gives a special bonus to the officers of his Department who can prove to him that various applicants are not entitled to blind pensions or old age pensions, but the Department seems to exercise the greatest possible care to put every possible hindrance and obstacle in the way of an applicant being awarded a pension.</P>
    <P>I have even greater fault to find with the administration of blind pensions than I have with the administration of old age pensions.  I think we have reached the stage in relation to blind pensions when, if a doctor issues a certificate&mdash;there is no doctor who will lower the honour of his profession by giving such a certificate needlessly&mdash; saying that an applicant in his opinion is suffering from defective vision, that, in itself, should be sufficient to warrant the blind pension being granted.  The spectacle of blind people being hauled into meetings, up the steps of courthouses, into ambulances, into and out of hospitals and into rooms with blackboards and easels and asked to distinguish between a two shilling piece and a half crown is degrading and one which speaks badly for the Department.</P>
    <P>I take it this is all part and parcel of the £1,500,000 which it costs to administer the £22,000,000 services provided by the Department and when one realises this, one does not wonder at the Minister having to have had the services of an adviser last year.  The Minister would need a school of advisers, but there is very little use in having a school of advisers, unless one <Col N="1622" /> is capable of taking and acting upon their advice.  What better advice could there be than the advice of the elected representatives in Parliament?  From long and practical experience, they can speak of conditions with which they are much more closely and intimately associated than the Minister.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the manner in which the various pensions are investigated, one wonders what has become of State Departments and whether Ministers have any say whatever in the long-drawn-out investigations of such claims.  I have often wondered why it has been necessary for old age and blind pension claims to await decision for as long as six and eight months. Would it not be cheaper to give the old age pension or the blind pension on first application than to have hordes of officials, inspectors, doctors and oculists trailing around the country? Is that not a penny wise and pound foolish policy?  The Department will spend endless money on oculists and doctors, on the provision of waiting-rooms and dispensaries for the interviewing of applicants and will lash money out on investigation officers and social welfare officers.  Would it not be far wiser and would it not result in greater economy if, instead of using all these advisers, all these investigation officers, with hordes of doctors and long processions of oculists, whom the applicant must pass, the pension were granted on first application and so save the Exchequer all the trouble, loss of time, inconvenience and the cost involved in the provision of all these officials and professional men?  We do not know what steps the Department have taken to exercise economy and reduce their staffs in this connection. Even in the case of the old age pensions there does not seem to be one official or inspector to make a report. The old age pensioner, as laid down in the Old Age Pension Acts, must first appear before the local old age pensions committee.  He must then present himself for the closest possible examination before the pensions officer.  He has to have a further examination by the pensions officer and then by the head pensions officer from the Minister's Department.  In <Col N="1623" /> the case of an appeal he will have a call from two inspectors who are sent down to the most remote parts of the country for the purpose of investigating the claim.  One would consider that in the interests of economy it would be far better to give out the pension and save the State the cost of all those inquiries and investigations.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the members of this House are far from being in a position to express satisfaction with the rates for old age pensions, widows' pensions, orphans' pensions and blind pensions. We have the Minister shedding tears for the poor and at the same time robbing them.  I fail to understand what sort of a conscience he must have which prevents him introducing legislation to provide amply for those people in accordance with the wishes of the majority of our people.  Not a single voice was raised in this House giving approval to the present rates for old age pensioners, widows, orphans and blind people.  On the contrary, every Deputy who spoke, including the last Deputy, who said that most of his constituents were employed in Derry City outside the jurisdiction of the Republic, emphasised the fact that the rates are too low.  Even the members of the Fianna Fáil Party strained their vocal chords in no small way to emphasise the necessity for immediate increases in those pensions and benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not tell the House in the course of his opening remarks whether the widows, the blind, the orphans, the aged or the invalid could expect any increase in their pensions before Christmas of this year nor did he hold out any hope of an improvement in their condition for the coming year.  There is no provision whatever in the Book of Estimates for increases in blind pensions or old age pensions during the coming year which commences on the 1st April, 1954, and ends on the 31st March, 1955.</P>
    <P>How on earth can any responsible Minister increase the cost of living on the poor and at the same time keep down the miserable, mean, mangy, meagre, poor and pauperish allowances? I do not know how it can be <Col N="1624" /> done.  We seem to have reached the stage when the Minister and the Government are more concerned with the well-to-do, the rich and those who are in a position to invest money in Government loans than they are with those who depend on Government funds to eke out a miserable existence.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Labour Party, together with other members of his Party, has placed on the Order Paper of this House a motion which is under discussion at the present time in connection with the Department's Estimate. The motion reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in view of the high cost of living, the following benefits under the Social Welfare Act, 1952, should be substantially increased, i.e., old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, blind pensions, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, sickness benefit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there a single Deputy in this House opposed to that?  Does the Minister not consider it time to increase those pensions, which have not been increased since the cost of living substantially increased last?  In connection with sickness benefits, the poorer sections of the community have to endure very great hardships because of sickness.  Because of the illness of the head of the household, the mother and children of large families have to suffer very severely.  I fail to understand why the sickness benefits could not be increased forthwith.  If we have the same Minister responsible for those benefits as is responsible for the health of the community, how does he consider that we can have a healthy community or that a man can be restored to health on the miserable allowances paid out at the present time in sickness benefits?</P>
    <P>When certificates are submitted by the various agents administering the national health insurance scheme they are usually sent to the Minister's Department.  In many cases, it is well known, particularly in rural Ireland, that the sickness benefits are often held up six weeks, two months, and in many cases three months while investigations are being carried out.  During the hearing of the investigations not one <Col N="1625" /> penny enters that house except, perhaps, 10/- or 12/- home assistance which is paid at the discretion of the county manager on the recommendation of the home assistance officer.  As soon as the national health benefits come every penny paid out in home assistance will be taken from that sum.  When a person is certified as being medically unfit for work and is an insured person entitled to sickness benefits provided under the Insurance Acts, I fail to understand the regulation under which the amount of the home assistance paid is deducted from the amount of insurance benefits.  I want to lodge a vigorous protest against such a regulation. It leaves the sick person worse off.  It means that his family is driven into debt and it means that the value is completely taken from the amount of sickness benefit.</P>
    <P>I think that in these hard times the Minister should at least issue instructions&mdash;or make an Order&mdash;and see to it that the local authorities do not deduct from the moneys due to an applicant in respect of national health benefits the amount paid in home assistance pending the decision on the claim.  I had some very hard cases in that connection and I am sure other Deputies had similar cases.  County managers will make the excuse that the law is there and that they are bound to make the necessary reductions. If the Minister is of opinion that there are cases of severe hardship, if he did not want to make an all-round Order he could at least examine cases on their merits&mdash;because most of these cases are deserving of meritorious consideration&mdash;with a view to having an Order made asking the local authorities not to deduct the amount of home assistance from the national health benefits that would be due.</P>
    <P>A few moments ago, the Parliamentary Secretary, in the course of a few words in reply to Deputy Cafferky, hinted that it would be as well that there were unemployed people and that it would be much better to get the funds to provide unemployment benefits than to provide work.  That was the gist of Deputy Kennedy's remark while Deputy Cafferky was speaking. <Col N="1626" /> I think that moneys paid out in the form of unemployment benefits are at entirely too low a rate to enable the worker to exist during his period of unemployment.  Steps should be taken, in order to comply with the terms of the motion on the Order Paper moved by Deputy Norton, to increase the rate of unemployment benefit and to give consideration to the amount of wages earned by the worker prior to his unemployment. It is disgraceful to see a man who would be in receipt of from £5 to £6 per week, on finding himself unemployed, reduced to the allowances that are available under the various Unemployment Assistance Acts.  At the present time there are some thousands of people unemployed in the building trade.  There are thousands unemployed in agriculture; we have over 1,800 unemployed in the transport industry; there are over 1,800 people unemployed in the distributive trades; in connection with food and drink, 1,500 people are unemployed; in the engineering industry we have over 800 people unemployed; in mining and quarrying we have 700 people unemployed.  Along with that we have Bord na Móna adding to the list considerably, not in scores but in hundreds.</P>
    <P>These men would much prefer to be in receipt of a decent week's wages rather than be in receipt of unemployment benefits.  I want to say this, in the hearing of the Minister for Social Welfare, because he was a party to it, that the present Government disturbed the minds of the working class people very much from the very day they took office because they promised them work and promised them wages.  They failed to give work; they failed to give wages, and the next thing they introduced was free beef, free boots, free vouchers and half crowns added to this and half crowns added to the other. There is no Irish worker who wants free beef, free boots or free milk and the sooner the Government realises that the better.  It is very demoralising and it is wrong for the Department of Social Welfare to be advocating schemes of free this, that or the other when all the people want is work and wages.  If they do not provide the work, if they do not provide the wages, <Col N="1627" /> it is the duty of the Government to provide the alternative to work and the alternative to wages.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Department of Social Welfare can give consideration to various schemes and to the payment of unemployment benefits and unemployment insurance. It would be far better that the time of everyone concerned in the Department would be devoted to providing work and decent wages rather than to be engaged in the provision and distribution of the mean and meagre unemployment benefits that are now being paid. The Government has a responsibility to provide work and if they do not provide the work the full alternative to work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is travelling away from the motion.  The present Minister is charged with the responsibility of administering the Department of Social Welfare and the benefits provided under legislation. The provision of employment is not relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that, Sir.  The point to which I was endeavouring to draw the Minister's attention was that in the case where he does not succeed in providing employment at least he should provide unemployment benefits equalling remuneration as if the applicant was in receipt of full-time employment.  I want to protest once more against the low rates of benefit being paid to these unemployed workers.  It is high time it was increased and I trust the Minister will accept the terms of the motion tabled in that respect by Deputy Norton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like also to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that some of the labour exchanges throughout the country from which these people are paid are a disgrace.  Anything at all seems to be good enough for the unemployed.  There seems to be a fire provided, a suitable table and suitable lighting facilities for the officers who are inside, but the unemployed people must remain either <Col N="1628" /> standing in the halls or in a long queue outside and have their business disclosed to the whole public.  Some of the labour exchange buildings throughout the country are a disgrace and there are much better stables and piggeries than there are labour exchanges in many areas.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister tell us what he proposes to do in connection with the old age pension means test?  If my memory serves me right, during the Galway by-election it was reported&mdash; not alone was it reported but it was sounded loudly and it re-echoed in every part of the South Galway constituency&mdash;that the means test for old age pensions was about to go and that everybody would qualify for the old age pension.  That travelled quite a long distance and had the desired effect, I may say, and we would be very glad to hear now whether the Minister proposes to abolish the means test in connection with old age pensions, whether in connection with old age pensions and the means test he has ever had his attention directed to cases where the wives of county council workers reach the age of 70 and whilst they would probably be in the 67 to 70 years' region, their wives would not qualify for pension because of the fact that their husbands were in the employment of local authorities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Fheórais, I think, referred to the question of calculating the previous year's income.  That is very wrong and I would ask the Minister to give consideration to the question of abolishing the means test with regard to old age pensions.  In the long run it will represent an economy because there will be a considerable saving on administration, and it will ease a great amount of uneasiness that prevails to-day in regard to the old age pensions administration.  Everybody who is over 70 should, in my opinion, have the pension.</P>
    <P>The National Health Insurance agents have had their case presented to the Minister, and have asked for sympathetic consideration of it on more than one occasion, but very little seems to have been done for those people.  They cannot make a complaint except through their superior officer. <Col N="1629" /> I would ask the Minister to obtain the advice of the officer in his Department in charge of these agents with a view to finding out from him what improved conditions can be provided for these agents.  Their rates of pay are small, the amount provided for offices is small and the amount provided for clerical assistance is practically nil.  The number of applicants for sickness benefit is greater than it was, but the rate of pay which the agent is in receipt of is by no means in accordance with the services which he renders to the Department.  I would ask the Minister sympathetically to consider, as far as possible, the question of providing better conditions for these agents.</P>
    <P>In connection with the payment of national health insurance benefits, I would like to impress on the Minister the necessity of giving some consideration to the dependents of insured persons who are patients either in sanatoria or in mental hospitals.  I have known of cases of insured persons who were entitled to the full benefits under the Insurance Acts, but because they were patients in one or other of these institutions, the benefits were not paid to them, while at the same time their dependents at home were in very poor circumstances.  I think that, in such cases, a large proportion of the benefit should be paid to the dependents to enable them to provide some little extra comforts for their relatives while patients in a sanatorium or in a mental hospital.  I know that the Minister's attention has been directed to cases of this kind, and I would ask him to give them his consideration.</P>
    <P>I want to recommend to the House two aspects of the present debate. The first is, that the manner in which the Department has presented this Estimate to us for the current year is unsatisfactory in that it does not provide sufficiently for the administration of the Department during the year, and, secondly, that Deputy Norton's motion, taken in conjunction with the Estimate, is worthy of the support of the House.  I am sure that, having regard to the high cost of living and the low standard of living of old age pensioners, unemployment benefit recipients and others, the Government <Col N="1630" /> will accept the motion moved by Deputy Norton.  In order that the homes of those people may be made more happy and may have an air of contentment in them during Christmas, I hope that the Minister will be in a position to announce that he has given consideration to the question of increasing all those benefits.</P>
    <P>I want to say, however, how disappointed I am.  I feel that the Minister has failed miserably in his job and does not deserve congratulations.  Instead, angry demands have been brought to his notice on behalf of those unfortunate people who are put to the pin of their collar to exist on their present poor, mean allowances.  I want to say, lastly, that if Fine Gael were in office, or if the inter-Party Government were in office, no time would have been lost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We prepared the schemes, and the present Government walked in at the time when these benefits would have been payable by the inter-Party Government, so that the present Government was committed by the inter-Party Government to pay those benefits.  Therefore, it is only right that we should now place on record that if the inter-Party Government were in office&mdash;and having regard to the bad management and the mismanagement of the present Government in failing to keep down prices&mdash;they would have lost no time in increasing old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, sickness benefits and the rates of unemployment benefit.  We would have a smaller number in receipt of unemployment benefit, because there would be more thousands of people at work.</P>

      <P>What I have to say on the Estimate will be related not only to it but in particular to the motion that has been moved by Deputy Norton.  The debate on the Estimate has taken a very long time, so long as <Col N="1632" /> to merit what people in the country term an American wake.  I should like to refer for a moment to the remarks that were made a moment ago by the Minister.  I was surprised and disappointed to find that his memory is so short.  It seems surprising that the Minister should say that, during the régime of the inter-Party Government when this Department was under the control of Deputy Norton, no increases were given to the people on whose behalf I intend to speak here this evening. Surely, the Minister cannot expect us to believe that his memory is so short that he forgets that in January, 1949, not only did old age pensioners, and such people, get increases in their pensions but that, in addition, they got what must be admitted to have been the largest single increase ever given since the establishment of native government here.  While, perhaps, the Minister may not be interested in that, I am simply making it clear that I want the record to show that I for one, as a member of the Labour Party, have no intention of believing that the present Minister's memory is so short when such an important matter is up for discussion.  I will not dwell on that except to say that in connection with that increase, we made it perfectly clear at the time that we were proud to be associated with a Government that could give the increase, but never did we say that we were satisfied that that was the final figure that should be given to these people.  We say now that these people, the old age pensioners, the blind pensioners, the widows and orphans are not getting sufficient and we are trying in our own simple way to point out why we believe the rates paid are not sufficient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing the Estimate of this particular Department we must all realise that far and away above every other Department of State this particular Department has to work in connection with the over-all policy of the Government, and it is a clear reflection of the policy of the Government when we consider the Estimate of this particular Department.  As each member of the House is supplied at various periods during the year with the number of people who are unemployed <Col N="1633" /> under various categories, then we know that the Minister for Social Welfare has not alone the problem of dealing with his own Department but he must also accept the fact that through the inactivity of his Government as a whole he must meet part of the bill. When we realise that on this particular Estimate we are provided with headings such as &ldquo;people having unemployment benefit claims,&rdquo;&ldquo;people having unemployment assistance applications&rdquo; and &ldquo;persons with means&rdquo; and &ldquo;persons without means,&rdquo; we realise our responsibility in offering any suggestions whatsoever on this Estimate and &mdash;let me make it quite clear&mdash;the Labour Party has no intention of either trying to go off on a wild goose chase to demand something that we must consider fantastic.  We believe that our policy is one that has direct sympathy with the position of these people who can be affected and who are affected by the policy in operation by this Department.  We maintain that the claims we are putting forward are worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated according to reports in this morning's newspapers&mdash;it was given under a very large heading in a certain daily paper&mdash;that his work was crowned with success.  I suppose he was justified from his point of view and from the point of view of those supporting the Government in drawing attention to the fact that between the years of 1932 and 1953 the amount of money provided through this Department went from £3,250,000 to £21,000,000.  It is quite natural that papers supporting the Government would give prominence to these figures but we cannot agree that the work of these 21 years has been crowned with success to the degree we would wish for, because constantly and consistently in this House a prominent Minister of the present Government has been laying particular stress on the important fact that for a number of years back the £1 has devalued to an extraordinary degree.  We know that.</P>
    <P>While the Labour Party at all times supported the present Government, even prior to 1947 when the question of providing any advantages for people, such as old age pensioners and all <Col N="1634" /> others, was under consideration, I think it must be remembered that it is not correct, in my opinion at any rate, to say to the people of this country that all benefits given in all the activities of the Department have been increased to such a degree as between £3,250,000 and £21,000,000. Three and a quarter million in 1932 meant a great deal more than £3,250,000 would mean now.  We know that.</P>
    <P>The Minister laid particular stress on another point in his speech.  It was that while the Department carried out the duties imposed on it so well, yet it had consistently shown a reduction in the number of staff employed.  We can come to that stage perhaps later when I shall have some remarks to make to draw attention to this particular aspect of the Department, but what did surprise me this morning was to see that while such prominence was given to the work that has been &ldquo;crowned with success&rdquo; apparently no space was found for the views expressed by the leader of the Labour Party in moving a most important motion in connection with this Estimate.  I am entitled to ask why is it, when we are dealing with such an important Estimate because of its direct connection with the people, and with sections of the community which, whether they like it or not, we must be prepared to do our utmost to help, why is it that such important matters are apparently not worth printing?  Had that not been the case I would have believed that the Minister was sincere&mdash;not alone the Minister but the Government&mdash;in trying to improve the present situation. But if every form of constructive criticism such as that offered by Deputy Norton and other speakers in connection with this motion is to be hidden from the public, then I cannot see any justification for the Minister saying that the work has been &ldquo;crowned with success&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not any responsibility for what is published in the papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the words used by the Minister when he stated that the work had been <Col N="1635" /> crowned with success, and I am simply drawing attention to the fact that, in my opinion, the work has not been crowned with the success which some members here would wish.</P>
      <P>I had no intention at this stage of going into any details of the various numbers of people who are listed as unemployed and who are signing on the registers of the employment exchanges in this country.  There is no need to do so.  Perhaps at a later stage we might draw attention to the over-all figures, but the Minister, when speaking on this Estimate, drew particular attention to aspects of the activity of his Department under the new Social Welfare Act of 1952.  I may be wrong, but again I say I cannot agree when he says he believes that people who are disallowed unemployment assistance during employment periods may qualify for unemployment benefit now.  Perhaps it is because he is trying to hold on to that particular line of argument that he maintains that the present live register is as it is according to the figures.  The Minister went so far as to say that a claimant who has been disallowed&mdash;that is, in the case of unemployment&mdash;can continue to register now under the 1952 Act.  It is important to remember that contributions for weeks of approved unemployment can be credited to such a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to approach this matter in a clear-cut way.  Things that are there to hinder rather than to help ought not to be hidden from the people.  Does the Minister realise that while this suggested benefit in the 1952 Act can apply in certain cases the words &ldquo;approved unemployment&rdquo; are of vital importance?  I can relate certain cases here for the Minister's benefit.  I know of one case where a young girl was employed in a restaurant during the summer months. She was unemployed during the winter months.  When she applied for unemployment benefit, having the requisite number of stamps, she was told she was not entitled to such benefit because there was work available for her.  That work was not available within a reasonable distance of her home.  It was available at a distance <Col N="1636" /> of roughly 70 or 80 miles away.  Where is the use in our quoting Acts and telling people there are certain benefits available to them when under the rules and regulations we are doing our utmost to prevent them from getting these benefits?  It is no use telling the people there are certain advantages when the hidden hand of officialdom&mdash; I am not blaming the officials&mdash;is there offering, on the one hand, and taking away, on the other, any advantages that there are.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have already drawn attention to delays experienced in the operations of different sections of the Department.  I am interested in the problem of inspectors dealing with special allowances for blind persons.  I have no intention whatsoever of laying any blame or responsibility on whoever may be the inspector, but I do want to draw attention to the statement made by the Minister when introducing his Estimate.  He said that he took pride in being able to reduce, for the sake of economy, the number of staff employed in his Department. I do not for a moment suggest that he takes pride in sacking anyone.  He is proud of the fact that the Department is operating efficiently and well with a smaller staff than it hitherto carried. Now, I reported a certain case to his Department last November in relation to an unfortunate old age pensioner in Blarney who applied for the special allowance for the blind.  I was told in November that an inspector would call on her as soon as possible.  Up to a week ago the inspector has not been heard of in Blarney.  I am not blaming the inspector but I am wondering if the reduction in staff has been made at the expense of these unfortunate people.  I am not advocating an increase in staff, if that is not necessary, but I am not satisfied with the position. Last November I approached the Department and I have heard nothing since.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No. November, 1952. I am not blaming the officials, but I have to ask myself is it possible we have not enough officials or inspectors? <Col N="1637" /> Deputy Norton very competently and very capably raised the question of the wages and conditions of employees in branch offices.  The Minister may say that responsibility in that matter rests with the manager. The manager in these local employment exchanges cannot pay proper wages or give decent conditions of employment because his own salary is insufficient.  I am not satisfied that that is the case.  Only recently I heard of one or two vacancies and the number of applications received was overwhelming.  Before anyone is appointed as manager in a branch office there should be an agreement that such a manager will in turn give decent conditions of employment and wages to those who work under him. While they may be employed by a private individual, as it were, they are doing very important State work. The present unsatisfactory condition of affairs should be altered.  These people should not be expected to work extraordinarily long hours at very low wages.</P>
      <P>I wonder are the managers of the employment exchanges fully conversant with the rules and regulations. Quite recently it was brought to my notice that road workers have to travel eight or nine miles once a week to the nearest labour exchange to sign on for unemployment benefit.  I know that when they are putting in the first claim they must visit the employment exchange.  After that, I understand they can notify the exchange in writing.  In this particular case, however, the manager insists on these men cycling in that long journey once every week.  Are these managers really conversant with the rules?</P>
      <P>I have not yet had an opportunity of reporting to the Department the extraordinary delay that occurs in connection with the payment of national health benefit.  I do not believe the fault lies with the Department.  I believe it lies with the local manager because he fails to carry out his duties properly.  I would like to have these matters fully investigated and I intend to send the particulars to the Minister and his officials as soon as possible. These things are important to the affected people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1638" /> I have also come up against the problem of the widow drawing a widow's pension who, on reaching 70 years of age, qualifies for an old age pension. In one particular instance I received the greatest co-operation from the Department in connection with this matter and I give the officials credit for that.  I believe, however, that it would be better and more advantageous to the widows if, on reaching 70 years of age, they were automatically transferred to the old age pension rather than putting them through the old routine of sending in claims.  I have in mind two particular cases.  One widow, through ignorance of the procedure that should be adopted, lost between five and six months' old age pension.  There is another case where a person will probably lose nine or ten weeks' pension.  Arrangements should be made for the automatic transfer of a widow, on reaching the age of 70, to the old age pension.</P>
    <P>My colleagues, Deputies Corish and Kyne, drew attention to the problem created by regulations.  A Government Deputy mentioned the importance of the booklet that is at present on sale.  Deputy Corish also spoke highly of it.  The value of the booklet is completely nullified by the extraordinary number of regulations coming into operation every day.  No Deputy can be familiar with every regulation. These regulations sound harmless and the ordinary Deputy may not know of their existence until he hears of the deadly effect they have when operated.</P>
    <P>At present there is correspondence between the Minister's Department and the South Cork Board of Public Assistance dealing with the case of certain women who have been denied certificates this year in connection with benefits to which they believed they were entitled under the 1952 Act. I shall quote a letter that is in the Department, asking for a reply.  The letter is dated 13th October, 1953.  It is to the following effect:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Board&rdquo;&mdash;that is the South Cork Board of Public Assistance&mdash;&ldquo;knows that under the provisions of the Public Assistance Acts, 1939, a poor person who is unable <Col N="1639" /> to provide by his or her own industry or other lawful means the necessaries of life for himself or herself, or for any persons whom he or she is liable to maintain, shall be eligible for home assistance, and that every woman is liable to maintain such of her children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, as are under the age of 16 years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The children referred to are, therefore, legal dependents of their mothers under the Public Assistance Act, 1939. A Minister cannot have the time to scrutinise every regulation that he has to sign.  The tragedy is that he did not realise what the regulation in this particular case would mean to certain people in South Cork and other areas. The Minister turned down the request of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance in the first instance.  The Minister is standing by a regulation that is contrary to and counteracting not only the benefits provided by the 1952 Act but the Public Assistance Act of 1939.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister in introducing the Estimate, emphasied the fact that about £21,000,000 is being provided for this important Department. The difficulty arises from the huge number of people involved.  The Labour Party, in advocating increased benefits for old age pensioners, blind pensioners, widows and orphans, fully realise the problem.  We do not advocate increases as a mere catchcry, whether we are in opposition or otherwise.  Is it correct to say that there are about 166,000 old age pensioners and blind pensioners in this country, that there are over 60,000 widows and orphans and about 65,000 unemployed?  It is only fair that we should understand and, what is more important, that the people should understand that the number of people benefiting by the social services is in the region of 290,000 to 300,000, excluding children who qualify for children's allowances.  The higher the number involved in the share-out the smaller the amount everyone receives.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the problem of the old age pensioner trying to exist on 21/6 a week.  Deputy <Col N="1640" /> Hickey told the House what the old age pensioner receives per meal.  Let us consider the amount deducted from the wages of an agricultural worker of 20 years or over, in respect of board. The worker pays his employer out of his wages 1/4 for breakfast, 1/11 for dinner. 9d for what is classified as afternoon tea and 1/4 for supper.  A farmer is allowed, on that basis, 5/4 per day for the feeding of a man.  Most of that food is at cost price, except, perhaps, tea and sometimes white bread that may be bought in the village or town.  Most of it is at cost price, yet there is an allowance made by a Department of State of 5/4 per day for such a man.  If we take it for seven days we come to the figure of £1 17s. 4d.  Surely, then, we are entitled to say that if such an allowance is made at cost price by a State Department for keeping a man 21/6 is not adequate for an old age pensioner. Deputies have quoted the costs as regards old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>They may perhaps have added on a little of what some people may regard as luxuries, but I have no intention of doing that.  When we take into consideration that out of the 21/6 as well as food there is the question of light, heat and clothing&mdash;including no more than just the bare necessaries of life&mdash; it is a contradiction of everything we speak of here when we say that an old age pensioner can pay rent, feed himself and clothe himself for 21/6 while we admit that it costs £1 17s. 4d. to keep a worker in another capacity. The Minister may say that the money is not available.</P>

The Minister may say that the money is not readily available, but as I said at the outset&mdash;I am not sure if the Minister was in at the time or not&mdash;when we are speaking on social welfare and the Department of Social Welfare we can never or should never be prepared to say: &ldquo;So far and that is enough.&rdquo;  We must be prepared always to draw no limits.  In this particular instance two Deputies in this House spoke on it before the right honourable Deputy Burke, God <Col N="1641" /> bless the man, came in to let us know he was here.  Deputy Corry, I think, said to Deputy Hickey in the course of an interjection in this debate: &ldquo;You gave nothing,&rdquo; but I would say to Deputy Corry and to Deputy Burke: &ldquo;Just look over the figures themselves and find what was given.  We gave an increase in 1949, an increase which, in my opinion, was at that time the best that could be given.  It was not sufficient, but it was the largest single increase ever given to the old age pensioners in this country.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In your estimation, of course.  They were getting 10/- down the country.  It was increased to 17/6, and do not let us play with this figure. I am telling the Minister that the Labour Party are behind him in saying this much, that we are not going to bow the knee to anyone if we can provide more for the old age pensioner or the widow or the orphan.  There was a Deputy in this House from South Cork who tried to say that the Opposition and the Government are vying with each other to know which of us will be the most socialist in our outlook, a Deputy who apparently believes that all Parties in this House are squandering money.  Let us get away from those Deputies and realise, as Deputy Kyne did say this evening, that we must be prepared all the time to go to the very limit of our resources to try to give to one section of the community who cannot unfortunately have sufficient by their own ability to keep them going in this life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan did mention the great importance that should be attached to our treatment of blind persons.  Is it not right for us to say that we cannot just give lip service to <Col N="1642" /> the Christian ideal in this country? Who but a blind person knows the handicap of such a case?  While we may have difficulties at times I believe and I will say to the members of the Government Party that we should stand up against certain people in this country who would begrudge any increase we gave to those unfortunates. I will say to the Government that they will have the Labour Party solidly behind them in any case for giving an increase to the old age pensioner, to the blind or to the orphan.  Let us realise that while this is, perhaps, a young State, we cannot afford to put up with cranks outside who do not know the hardships placed on members of the community who are grouped in that category of old persons.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I delayed too long, and I would simply add that it is useless to say: &ldquo;We will go so far and no farther.&rdquo;  There is an obligation placed on every one of us.  The old are entitled not to lip service or to respect alone, but can claim from us as a right that we should give them in their old age sufficient not only to give them a mere existence but to give them the little comfort which they are entitled to in a Catholic Christian country.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Desmond, and I think everybody in this House agrees, that we should never say with regard to social services &ldquo;thus far and no further&rdquo;.  I have never heard anybody say that in this House, and I do not think that it will ever be said by any Party.  We can all subscribe to that.</P>
      <P>I just want to mention a few of the points which Deputy Desmond raised towards the end of his speech.  He mentioned the case of a contributory widow who got 24/- a week and when she reaches 70 is reduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  What the Deputy said was that she should automatically get the old age pension&mdash;is that right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that, legally, it cannot be done, but we have tried to make it as easy as possible for the widow to pass on to the old age pension in this way, that if she makes the application in the ordinary way under the regulation we do not investigate the means, so that there is no delay whatever as far as that woman is concerned if she makes the application and gives proof of age.  I do not think that is asking too much, and that is all that we are asking at the present time&mdash;that she should hand us over that proof of age.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond said that he rereported a case in November, 1952, of an applicant for blind pension and that nothing has been done on it so far.  I do not know what can have happened in this case, I must say, but I just want to mention for the benefit of Deputies who may not know exactly what the procedure is&mdash;that where a person applies for a blind pension it goes before the local committee which deals with old age pensions and blind pensions.  Those Deputies from the country know that wherever there is a fair a <i>priori</i> case at all the local committee is likely to recommend a person to get a pension.  If it does the person must get examined by an ophthalmic surgeon.  I am told that that seldom takes more than about four weeks, seldom more than a month, and should never take more than six or eight weeks.  If he says that in his opinion the person is blind according to the Act, then as far as that is concerned no official has anything to do with it. The only thing that arises for an official then is to ascertain the means and the person's means would be examined, and if the means justify the pension then the pension would be given.  I would like Deputy Desmond to let me know something about this case so that we may trace what happened in the particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a good lot of comment&mdash; not as much as there was last year, because I think it would not be justified&mdash;about delay in the payment of benefit.  For some reason the complaint appears to arise nearly always in the case of sickness benefit.  It was raised very much last year and, as I <Col N="1644" /> mentioned in introducing the present Estimate, I did make an appeal last year to Deputies to let me know cases of delay so that I could have them investigated. As I said in introducing the Estimate yesterday, Deputies did not co-operate very much with me during the year in trying to get the system running as smoothly as possible. I should not like Deputies to be under the impression that these delays are widespread.  Of course, I know that if there are a couple of thousand people in an area drawing sickness benefit, and if there are a dozen or so who have to complain about delay, people get to know about the dozen and even that dozen may cause a certain amount of trouble to Deputies and others.</P>
    <P>During the year on three occasions I had a very full investigation carried out and I shall just mention what the result was.  In Limerick City and County I had a very full investigation carried out on one occasion during the year.  I find, on report, that there were 2,117 persons drawing benefit at that particular time.  Of these, 36 complained, when asked if they had any complaint, that there was delay.  When we examined the 36 cases, we found that only ten persons had any genuine complaint.  In other words, in the other 26 cases the delay was due to negligence, or if not negligence maybe some mistake on their own part. Therefore, in that particular instance, out of 2,117 cases, there were ten cases in which I could say that the Department or its officials were to blame. That number is too many, if you like, but I just wanted to give the figure to show that, though there may be a very big number of people drawing benefit, you will hear nothing about them if everything goes smoothly; but in regard to the very small percentage indeed who have a complaint, the Deputy for the district is likely to hear all about it.</P>
    <P>There has been a good improvement since last year and I am very anxious to improve the position still further during the coming year.  I would, therefore, ask Deputies to co-operate and let me know when they hear of cases of delay.  I have the figures here for the other investigations carried <Col N="1645" /> out.  We carried out an investigation of local agents' districts, that is, outside the cities, on two occasions during the year and the number of genuine complaints found amongst them was comparatively small.  In one case there were 31,000 drawing benefit &mdash;that is practically the whole country &mdash;and only .74 per cent. had cause for complaint.</P>
    <P>There were many matters raised in the debate and I can deal only with some of these matters in a general way.  Deputy Dr. Esmonde in opening said he was dissatisfied with the system obtaining in the case of blind pensioners. I think the Deputy was under the impression that officials could interfere with the opinion of the ophthalmic surgeon.  They cannot.  If the person concerned is dissatisfied with the report of the ophthalmic surgeon, he may ask for the opinion of another ophthalmic surgeon.  In other words, applicants can appeal or, alternatively, if the social welfare officer is dissatisfied, he can appeal against the decision of the ophthalmic surgeon if it was in favour of the applicant.  Then the opinion of the appeals ophthalmic surgeon must be taken as final so far as the degree of blindness is concerned. He follows the wording of the Act and he makes his report accordingly, but he does not submit his report to an official to interpret.  His report is: &ldquo;This person is entitled to a pension,&rdquo; or &ldquo;This person is not entitled to a pension,&rdquo; so far as sight is concerned. As I explained already, the officials, of course, have the obligation after that of investigating means and a person who is passed as blind according to the Act may be turned down on the question of means afterwards.</P>
    <P>I am fully in agreement with Deputy Dr. Esmonde that we should, as far as possible, rehabilitate the blind, that is, that we should wherever possible find work for them in whatever occupation we can possibly place them.  I suppose Deputies are aware that up to a few years ago the only work that was given to the blind, on the male side, was making baskets, leather-work and things of that kind and on the female side, principally knitting.  Well, we <Col N="1646" /> have made some progress since.  We have in the last few years placed some young blind persons as telephonists and others have been trained, I believe &mdash;I do not know with what success up to the moment&mdash;as physiotherapists. The work open to blind people is widening as time goes on.  I am certainly in favour of placing blind people in employment, so far as it can be done.</P>
    <P>I suppose I can say truthfully that most of the debate was directed towards the level of benefits.  Let me say this, and I have often said it before: I am not saying, and never did say, that the blind person, the old age pensioner or the non-contributory widow has enough to maintain him or her in comfort.  I can say at the same time, and I think I can prove it, that if members of the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party condemn the present scale of benefits, the condemnation will come back stronger on them on the benefits they were satisfied with when they were in power themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to say that the old age pensioner is well off.  I remember saying here before&mdash;I was reading up the famous debate of 1947 to which Deputy O'Higgins referred, and I came across what I said then&mdash; that the amount of the pension was never regarded as providing a decent living for the old age pensioner.  The pension was 5/- in 1908 or 1909, and it has varied up along the years since. There are members of the Labour Party who do not seem to realise how it has varied since 1947.  I do not want <Col N="1647" /> to accuse these members of telling untruths. Therefore, I say that they do not appear to remember what happened in the case of the old age pension since 1939, if you like.  The old age pension was 10/- at the beginning of the war.  Certain increases were given since and for certain classes of old age pensioners there was a food voucher given.  Some of these &ldquo;toploftical&rdquo; Deputies in the Opposition are inclined to sneer at food vouchers. But at the time it was recognised that a food voucher was more valuable than cash, because the old age pensioner had the advantage of being able to get certain foods on the voucher which an ordinary person could not get.  For instance, he had the option of getting butter in addition to the ration supplied to him by his own family.  He also could get other things; at any rate, he had the food voucher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Try and listen for a minute and allow yourself to be educated if you can.  On the 31st March, 1947, these food vouchers were converted into cash.  From the 1st April, 1947, old age pensioners got in cash 15/- in the cities and towns and 12/6 in the rural areas.  Deputy Desmond whom, as I say, I would not accuse of making a deliberately wrong statement because I regard him as an honest man, said that Deputy Norton had raised the old age pension by 7/6 in 1949.  That is not true.  The old age pension on the 1st April, 1947, under Fianna Fáil, went up to 15/- in the cities and towns and 12/6 in the rural areas.  If any Deputy has any doubt about that let him put down a question to me asking for the rates of old age pensions from 1939 to the present time.</P>

      <P>Is that significant?  Are Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Kyne innocent enough to believe that any Party or Government could go back on a thing like that?  Fine Gael Deputies wanted us to accept what Fine Gael proposed to do and which they never did.  Now they are doubting what we did because we did not substantiate it by legislation.  I said at the time we were doing it that we were bringing in a comprehensive Social Welfare Bill and it would be made right in that.  As I proved on another occasion, the heads of that Bill were there when we left office and it was ready to be put into operation and Deputy Norton took them over and issued the proposals.</P>

Fine Gael, when they took 1/- off the old age pension, were fired out and that was a lesson to everybody.</P>

When the Coalition came into office the old age pensioners in the cities and towns had 15/- and in rural areas 12/6.  I want to repeat that I did not accuse Deputy Desmond of telling a deliberate falsehood because I know he would not be capable of doing it, but his memory is wrong.  On 1st April, 1947, the pensions were increased in cash in the rural areas to 12/6 and in the cities and urban areas to 15/-</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the rural areas that I am conversant with was it not from <Col N="1649" /> the home assistance officer that the old age pensioner had to get 2/6?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer that.  If the Deputy will look at the Dáil Debates at that time he will see that the Dáil voted £2,000,000 on the last day of March, 1947, to cover the increase and from that date the post office books were over-stamped, because it was done in a hurry, and the Post Office paid out to old age pensioners in the cities and towns 15/- and in rural areas 12/6, and the local authorities were told that they could pay another 2/6 in addition to that if they liked.  I invite Deputy Desmond or any other Deputy to put down a question to me and I will give all these particulars with day and date for them.  Deputy Norton came along and he raised the old age pension to 17/6 in all areas in 1949.  We came along in 1951 and we raised it to £1 for everybody, and in 1952 we raised it to 21/6 for everybody.  That is the history of the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What are we told about the cost of living?  The cost of living when we came into office was 109 and it is now 125.  If we liked to argue the point that the pension was 17/6 a week when we came into office, the cost of living has gone up 16 per cent.  But we raised the old age pension by much more than 16 per cent.  Therefore, I say that the Labour and Fine Gael Deputies who talk about the miserable pittance of the old age pensioners are condemning themselves because they left the old age pensioners in 1951, even taking the cost of living into account, with a lower and more miserable pittance than they have to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true.  The Deputy knows well it is true but he will not admit it.  It is all right for Deputies to talk about the miserable pittance, but they left them with 17/6 when going out in 1951 and now they have 21/6.  I will go this far.  We will admit that they were taken very shortly, that the Labour Party believed that Fine Gael were with them in giving 2/6 to <Col N="1650" /> old age pensioners and did not know that Fine Gael were going to play a trick on them when they brought in the 2/6 by having a general election.  We will admit the Labour Party were sincere in giving the 2/6.  Even so, when Deputy Norton brought in the 17/6 in 1949, he said&mdash;Deputies can go back and read the speeches&mdash;that the old age pensioners were now being looked after as they should be.  In other words, everything was properly done in 1949 and they had as much as they could expect, under the circumstances, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take the effort of the Labour Party in 1949 as being a sincere and generous effort and forget about 1951 and work up from there. The cost of living is 25 per cent. higher now than in 1949.  Therefore, if we were to do as well as the Labour Party who gave this Magna Charta to the old age pensioners in 1949 we should add 25 per cent. to the 17/6.  What is that?  I think it is about 4½d. more that we should be giving.  It is extraordinary that the Labour Party which was so satisfied in 1949 should now have held us up for two days talking about the miserable amount we are giving to the old age pensioners.</P>

      <P>We know, of course, that you will do it again.  This talk has been going on for two days because we have given 4 ½d. less than we should have given according to Deputy Norton's Magna Charta of 1949.</P>

      <P>That is all it comes to&mdash; 25 per cent. on the cost of living.  There was a Deputy speaking yesterday&mdash;I think it was Deputy Rooney; he would be capable of it&mdash;who said that the cost of living had gone up on the old age pensioner by 7/4.  He took a loaf of bread, a stone of flour, a pound of butter, a pound of tea&mdash;imagine a pound of tea in the week for an old age pensioner&mdash;and a pound of sugar and <Col N="1651" /> he added them up and got 7/4.  It was a nice simple way of doing it, I must admit.  These are the sort of mathematics we get from Deputy Norton, Deputy O'Leary and other Deputies of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you remember when you said in the Budget that 1/6 would meet the cost of living on the old age pensioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, meet the cost of living, as the Budget of that year had changed it.  As I said already here, no Party in this country&mdash;I do not know about any other Party in any other country&mdash;Cumann na nGaedheal from 1922 to 1932, the Fianna Fáil Government after that or the Coalition Government, at any time purported to give the old age pensioner what would cover his rent, rates, tobacco, Deputy Flanagan's pint a day and the diet that Deputy Desmond laid down that would be given to an agricultural labourer.  It was never contemplated that that would be given.  When Deputy Norton brought in his Bill in 1949, which had the full approval of the Labour Party, it did not cover all that, even at what those items cost at that time.  He did not cover in 17/6 what it would cost for food for an agricultural labourer.  It was 3/4 per day for an agricultural labourer at that time; seven times that would be 23/-.  That exceeds the 17/6 already.  Then there is the pint a day, the two or three ounces of tobacco, the rates and all the rest. No one ever contemplated doing it. The most we can do for the old age pensioners is to help them.  You may use that against us if you like.  The most anyone can ever do is to help them.  The great majority of old age pensioners have help through relatives and so on.  I admit that some of them have not, that some have nothing else to get, but what can we do about it? We are helping them as much as we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go through these other things as well.  I could take the sickness allowance.  There was a lot of criticism about that.  Deputy Flanagan said a man should get the full wage when sick.  Deputy Hickey was talking about 4 ½d. for a meal.  That was the sort of <Col N="1652" /> stuff we had.  Take a man with a wife and two children, the most favourable case for myself&mdash;I do not see why I should not, as the Labour Party and Fine Gael were not behind the door in that, either.  He gets 50/- a week and there would be also 2/6 for the second child&mdash;more than he had in 1951&mdash;that is 52/6.  If he was a sick man in 1951 he got 22/6.  He gets 52/6 now.  That more than covers the cost-of-living increase. If Deputy Hickey is right&mdash;I did not check his figures&mdash;in saying that a man with a wife and family has only 4 ½d. per meal now, what had he in 1951 per meal&mdash;and why was Deputy Hickey silent in 1951 about it?  I could say the same about the unemployed men.  I want to repeat that I am not saying this because I think the sick man or the unemployed man is getting enough.  I am saying this to expose the hypocrisy of certain Parties who, when they see that social welfare benefits are increased considerably over what they did, attack us as if nothing at all was done.</P>

      <P>She got an increase of from 26 per cent. to 72 per cent.  That covers the cost-of-living increase.  The non-contributory poor woman who was not insured at all and who had two children, had 22/- to 26/- then ; she has now 32/-.  She has not fared as well as the other lady, but she has got an increase of from 20 to 30 per cent.  Take unemployment assistance.  The man with a wife and two children, if he was living in a town, had 28/-: now he has 38/-.  That represents an increase of about 26 per cent.  If he was living in a rural area, he got 18/-: now he has 28/-.  That represents an increase of 38 per cent.  All round, every one of these increases would more than cover the increase in the cost of living since 1951.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> I have been asked what did we do in 1951.  Deputy Davin constantly asks me that question and Deputy O'Higgins tackled me with it yesterday. They accused me of voting against an increase in old age pensions in 1947.  I should like to deal with that.  It is the only thing that they can cast at me.  Last night, when I heard Deputy O'Higgins talk, I felt that I must have a great record for social welfare when the only thing that they can cast against me is that I voted against a cock-eyed motion which was moved by Fine Gael in this House on 20th March, 1947.  It was the silliest and the most cock-eyed motion ever moved in this House.  This is how it read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the basis upon which income is assessed for the purpose of the means test in the case of persons entitled to old age pensions, blind pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions, requires revision and in particular that in assessing income for such purpose, no cognisance should be taken of (a) gratuities paid to a pensioner by members of his or her family whether in cash or in kind; (b) any benefits received otherwise than in actual cash, and (c) casual moneys earned by the pensioner, and requests the Government to take all necessary steps accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That motion was in the names of the late Deputy Dr. O'Higgins and Deputy Costello.  Deputy O'Higgins described him last night as the &ldquo;Leader of the Opposition&rdquo;.  I suppose I can accept that from all Parties&mdash;that Deputy Costello is the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

I said that (a)&mdash;gratuities paid to a pensioner by members of his or her family, whether in cash or in kind&mdash; was already allowed, but that Fine Gael did not know it.  They brought in a motion which showed their interest in the old age pensioners.  With regard to (b)&mdash;any benefits received otherwise than in actual cash&mdash;I said that the old age pensioner is already allowed that, too, but that Fine Gael did not know it.  They put down a <Col N="1657" /> motion in order to create a bit of trouble, I suppose.  They did not know what the old age pensioner was entitled to receive.  They wanted me to accept a cock-eyed motion that did not mean anything, because the old age pensioner had it already.</P>

      <P>I will read out (c) for the House again&mdash;casual moneys earned by the pensioner.  Bear in mind that that is what the Fine Gael Party wanted us to accept.  I said that I did not agree with the motion.  I further said that if the Fine Gael Party would put up a proposition to do away altogether with the means test we would discuss it but <Col N="1658" /> that we would not agree to the sort of proposition contained in the motion which they moved in this House on 20th March, 1947.  I pointed out the position of an old woman who continues to work for an old client by doing two days' charring a week and who gets 6/- per week for it.  I pointed out that, under law, that 6/- counted against her as means.  If the Fine Gael Party wanted to change the law, why did they not tackle the case of the poor charwoman?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary always tries to defend Fine Gael.  When I was explaining to the House what the motion meant, I looked up to the press gallery and saw the journalists there. Of course, there were different people there then.  I asked the House to take as an example a journalist who has retired from regular work and who, let us say, has a large pension.  If that man writes an occasional article he will get five or ten guineas for it but that will not count against him.  I asked the House if I was expected to vote for a cock-eyed Fine Gael motion, and to please Deputy Davin, which would debar a poor old charwoman who is regularly getting 6/- per week for doing two days' charring for an old client while a casual worker such as a retired journalist or a retired barrister can do occasional work whenever they feel like it without being affected.  If a retired barrister gives an opinion and charges ten or 20 guineas, that will not count against him.  If a retired journalist writes an occasional article for a newspaper and gets ten guineas for it, that will not count against him. However, a poor old charwoman who is getting 6/- a week for doing two days' charring would have to submit to having that amount put down against her as means.</P>

Some Deputies tried to give the impression that the means test is more severe now than when we came into office in 1951. When we went out in 1948, the means test in respect of old age pensions ranged from £21 to £29, according to the area.  If a person had anything more than that, it counted against him for pension purposes.  Deputy Norton made that £29 to £39, and in our Bill we made it £52 10s.

      <P>I dealt with that before the Deputy came in and I do not want to deal with it again.  I do not think that Deputies would wish me to do so. The Deputy can read all about it. These figures refer to the widows' means test.  It was £59 in 1947 and was raised to £96, and in our Bill it was £130 15s.  In the case of the old age pension, it was £15 12s. 6d., and anything over that began to count against the applicant, up to 1949. Deputy Norton raised it to £22 12s 6d., by £7, and we raised it to £52 10s., or by £30 over that figure.</P>

      <P>We heard about the 1951 proposals, and we are told that we voted against them.  We brought in an amendment because they were not as good as they should be, and we argued that they should have remembered children's allowances, old age pensions and widows' pensions in the scheme. By the time the Bill reached the Dáil, Deputy Norton had embodied a proposal in relation to old age pensions.</P>

What was the attitude of the Labour Party?  It was: &ldquo;We will not give anything to the widows or in respect of children's allowances.&rdquo;  To our suggestion that the then Minister should withdraw the Bill, the Parties opposite said no.</P>

      <P>Look it up and you will find that it is a fact.  It was a bit of debacle, so far as the Labour Party were concerned.  The general election came along and that was the end of it.  Such as the proposals were, they dealt with sickness, unemployment, unemployment benefit and old age pensions, but did not deal with widows or children's allowances.  These were brought into our scheme, and, even though Deputies on the Fine Gael and Labour Benches may say to me: &ldquo;Look at our proposals,&rdquo; the fact is that there was nothing done for widows and orphans or for children's allowances in these proposals and, what is more, nothing was intended to be done for these people.  Even in their motion to-day the Labour Party have shown their bias against children's allowances.  They did not include them to-day.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy of Cork complained that Dáil Deputies had not the right of approach to the appeals officer in the case of old age pensions. I must say that I am against that.  We should aim at seeing that every person in this country who is entitled to a benefit, whatever it may be, should get it without the intervention of a Deputy or anybody else.  I hope we will be able to do that before long.  That is why this Act was drawn up in that way so that there would be an appeals officer and so on.  I can tell Deputies &mdash;they will be able to find out whether I am telling the truth or not&mdash;that I never interfered&mdash;I have not the power to interfere&mdash;with any decision made by the appeals officer.  I often asked for a report.  If a Deputy writes to me in connection with the case of some person, I ask for a report and I send the report on as I get it.</P>

For half an hour Deputy Flanagan gave me a lecture on doles and charity.  I cannot understand the plea on behalf of this man.  Why does not the man support his wife when he is working?  Why should he get an old age pension when he is working?  Why should he not support his wife?  I cannot see any case at all for an old age pension in that case.</P>

      <P>We have heard Deputies here from Fine Gael and Labour in the last two days making the allegation that Fianna Fáil did nothing for social services.  As a matter of fact, if we took the global figure&mdash;I suppose it is the only figure we could take&mdash;of what we paid out through the Exchequer from 1932 we would find that it has increased by £16,000,000, and during the term of office of the Coalition Government <Col N="1669" /> it increased by a little less than £1,500,000.  Therefore, if you take the years we were in office as against those in which the Coalition were in office, we could now sit down for 14 years. That is a long time.</P>

The only promise they ever carried out was to take the 1/- off the old age pensions in 1929.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so.  I move:-</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1954, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach (No. 16 of 1924; No. 40 of 1937; No. 18 of 1938, and No. 24 of 1947).</P>
      <P>This motion is to enable the Opposition to use their customary right of criticising the general policy of the Government on this Estimate.  I do not think, so far as the terms of the main Estimate are concerned, it is necessary for me to go into any detail. The total of the original Estimate was for £26,590, showing a net increase of £340 on the previous year.  There is an increase of £440 under sub-head A, mainly due to the usual incremental increases in salaries, and there is a reduction of £100 under sub-head C. That leaves a net increase of £340.  I do not think it is necessary for me to give any detailed explanation of the Estimate.</P>
      <P>As I said, this is a motion which is intended to enable the Opposition to criticise or deal with Government policy in general.  It is customary to allow the Opposition to choose their ground.  At certain times in the past we attempted to get some agreement as to the points that were to be raised, but my experience was that these points were never adhered to and that the discussion, in fact, ranged over practically everything that occurred to any particular individual Deputy, whether in the main they were items covered by the agreement or not.  I propose, then, to leave it to the speakers of the Opposition to choose their ground and to indicate clearly the points which they have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not necessary, as it might be at other times, to give a general survey, since the statistical survey and the other statistical information required has been made available.  It is coming very near the end of the year now, <Col N="1677" /> and the position is not as it used to be on former occasions when the Estimate would be taken about the middle of the year.  For that reason, I think it is better that those who put down the motion to refer the Estimate back should themselves choose the ground for the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  If this Estimate were the normal Estimate instead of a token Estimate it would be quite natural to expect the Taoiseach to give us a review of the Government's general policy.  This year we have been denied that facility because of the fact that we facilitated the Government in putting through the Taoiseach's Estimate without discussion in order to avoid another Vote on Account.  But, if we did facilitate the Taoiseach in that way in respect of the main Estimate, surely we ought now to get on this token Estimate a review of his Department's work and of Government policy in the same way as we might legitimately expect such a review on the main Estimate had it not been put through in a special way in order to facilitate the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any differentiation as regards the type of Estimate in relation to a general review.  In fact, that review would be little more than taking up the work of the different Departments and correlating it, but the work of the different Departments has been discussed in detail and at great length, and for that reason I think it is quite unnecessary now to give a general review.  Besides, as I have already said, in the past it was the custom to allow the Opposition to indicate clearly the topics they wished to have discussed.  That was for the purpose of giving those who would have to answer the points raised an opportunity of getting the statistical or other information necessary for a reply.  That has never worked and, indeed, I am not departing from my custom&mdash;in the main, at any rate&mdash;in allowing the debate to run in the particular way I have suggested.</P>

He has stated that he sees no difference between the procedure adopted this year, when we are discussing a token Estimate, and the procedure adopted in previous normal years when the Taoiseach's main Estimate was under discussion as the last of a series of Estimates for the year.  I think the Taoiseach is correct in that.</P>
    <P>This token Estimate was put down to afford us the same opportunity of reviewing Government policy as we have always had in this House; but we are equally entitled to expect, particularly in the very special circumstances that exist at the present time, that the Taoiseach would give us an indication of Government policy, the policy by means of which the Government proposes to deal with the very serious financial and economic problems confronting the country in the difficult conditions existing at the moment.  I think there is no justification for the Taoiseach saying that it is not necessary for him to give a general survey of Government policy.  There was never greater urgency for some indication of Government policy than there is at the present time.</P>
    <P>In the country at the moment there is a condition of serious unrest and anxiety.  To put it very mildly, business people are scared, fearful and timorous of the future.  They do not know what the Government will do. We, on this side of the House, can only guess what the Government proposes to do.  We were entitled to expect to-night&mdash;and the House and the country is now being denied that opportunity&mdash;an indication from the Taoiseach of the manner in which the Government proposes for the future to deal with the very difficult conditions they have deliberately brought about as a result of deliberate Government policy in the past.</P>
    <P>We have just ended some two and a half years of the operations of the present Government's policy.  That policy when it was put into operation was a radical departure from the <Col N="1679" /> policy which had been devised, conceived, designed and put into operation by the inter-Party Government during a period of a little over three years.  For that policy the present Government had no mandate whatsoever. Neither during the general election, before it or after it, was there the slightest indication to the people, or to this House after the election and before the present Government was formed, that the policy that Government intended to put into effect was a policy of high taxation, austerity and restriction under which this country has been suffering for the last two and a half years. In addition to that we had recently a speech of a very major and important character delivered by the Minister for Lands, deputising for the Minister for Finance, a week or so ago at the annual dinner of the Institute of Bankers.</P>
    <P>In any circumstances the country is entitled to expect and we here in this House are entitled to expect, and to demand, from the Taoiseach some indication as to what his policy is for the future.  Will it be different from what it has been over the last two and a half years?  Is it the fact, as most people in the country at the moment believe it to be the fact, that the only policy the Government has at the present moment is the policy of saving their political lives from inevitable extinction?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands, deputising for the Minister for Finance, made a speech to the bankers and in that speech he threw out certain hints.  He spoke about Government loans and the Government scheme for borrowing.  He made a significant reference to the neglected resources of this country and he hinted that the Government intended to borrow from the banks. He hinted that the policy of the restriction of credit, which every business person in this community knows has been in the most active operation over the last two and a half years, should be eased up.</P>
    <P>The reference to the neglected resources of the country come well from a Government that has been in complete <Col N="1680" /> charge of this country for a period of 17 or 18 years.  If the resources of this country were neglected, then it is the Fianna Fáil Party and the Governments formed from that Party that are responsible for that neglect in the year 1953.  Members of the present Government have in the last two or two and a half years repudiated the suggestions made by this side of the House that they were responsible for the restriction of credit, a restriction which was widespread throughout the country.  That such restriction existed is beyond all doubt.</P>

      <P>If, as the Taoiseach says, it is not true, why, then, the hint to the bankers to cease their restriction of credit?  If there is no such restriction, why the hint to the bankers from the Minister for Lands, deputising for the Minister for Finance, to ease up on their restriction of credit and to give a reasonable extension of credit facilities?  If there was not such a restriction of credit why should that hint, if not that direction, be given by the person who is acting as the authorised spokesman of the Government, in a most solemn and formal way; and why, if that hint was given in the last few weeks, was it not given in the last few years when it was perfectly apparent that private investors were starved of capital?  The medium through which they normally secure the necessary capital, not merely to carry on their business but to maintain employment and to expand and increase employment, was cut off from them at its source, namely, the banks.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Milk Prices&mdash;Motion.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That having regard to the greatly increased costs of milk production <Col N="1681" /> and in view of the fact that the findings of the costings commission may not be available for a considerable time, Dáil Eireann is of the opinion that the price of milk to the producer should be reviewed and increased immediately.&mdash;(Deputies Patrick D. Lehane, Patrick Cogan, Patrick Finucane.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDesmondLehane" hpid="Mr. Lehane Mr. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion was tabled some 12 months ago.  It is unfortunate that the Government did not accept the motion and deal with it when it was tabled because, if the Government had dealt with it, a good deal of unpleasantness that occurred in the meantime would have been avoided. We know that there was a milk strike brought about largely because of a stupid letter written by the Department of Agriculture to the Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, to the Leinster Milk Producers Association and to the Cork Milk Producers Association.  If this House had dealt with the motion when it was tabled a lot of the unpleasantness that occurred in the early months of this year would probably have been avoided.</P>
      <P>In asking for an increase in the price of milk, I want to make it quite clear that the agricultural community are very concerned with the cost of living and the cost of butter.  We know from the reports on the nutritional survey that the agricultural community buy a very considerable amount of butter that is produced in creameries.  All over the country farmers now send their milk to the creamery, and when the price of butter is increased the farmers have to pay the increased price.  It has been shown in the report on the nutritional survey that the agricultural community buy more than half the butter that is produced and consumed in this country. Consequently, every increase in the price of butter increases the household budget of the farmer as well as everybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmer does not want to increase the price of butter; he does not want to increase the cost of living; but, if the Minister and the Government increase the farmers' costs the <Col N="1682" /> farmer has no redress except to ask that his increased cost of production be put on the price of his milk.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Government have increased the cost of production considerably.</P>
    <P>The circular that was issued by the Minister for Local Government last May, dealing with rates on agricultural land, imposed an additional burden of £500,000 on the farmers.  The farmers who are producing milk have nowhere to get that £500,000 except by increasing the price of milk.</P>
    <P>To produce milk you must have cows, you must have grass, you must have fertilisers to grow the grass.  The Government have imposed a tariff on fertilisers, which is a tax on milk production.  The Government, last June, imposed a heavy tax on barbed wire, ordinary wire, that is necessary for fencing a farmer's holding.  If the farmer has to pay more for his roll of barbed wire, he has no place to get that money except in the price of his milk.  The Government have imposed taxes and tariffs on milk cans and cotton-wool pads for straining milk. For everything the farmer buys he is paying an inflated price due to the action of the Government.</P>
    <P>The farmer in the Twenty-Six Counties has to buy all his requirements in a protected local market and to sell his product at something approaching world prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister, through his Department, has affected the yields of the cows in dairy counties by imposing on the farmers in these counties a Livestock Breeding Act which lays down that every bull kept by a farmer, if he wants to produce milk, will be a type of bull that is sanctioned by his Department for its purely beef characteristics. In imposing this bull on the dairy farmers the Minister is reducing the yield of the dairy cows in Ireland and is increasing the cost of production on the farmers.</P>
    <P>I understand that at the moment there is an application before the Agricultural Wages Board for an increase of 12/6 a week for agricultural workers.  I do not begrudge the agricultural worker a decent wage.  I think the agricultural worker is our greatest national asset and I do not think he <Col N="1683" /> should be paid less than a person who is engaged in the manufacture of razor blades or in any other calling.  If the costs of producing milk are to be increased by Orders and rules made by bodies, the only way in which the producer can be compensated for that is by increasing the price of his product.</P>
    <P>To produce milk a dairy farmer must have cows.  At times he has to change his cows and to sell old cows when they have ceased to be capable of producing milk economically.  Even at that point the Minister comes in again and puts a tax of 50/- on the hide of that old cow.</P>
    <P>A letter was published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of November 22nd, 1953, headed, &ldquo;Price of Hides&rdquo;.  It said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Sir&mdash;Thanks to Mr. Dillon for his questions regarding hide prices. Very few receive 1/- per lb., as the average is 8d., less commission and carriage amounting to 3/- per hide. In Derry the price paid is 1/7 per lb.  Thus we are compelled to sell our hides at at least a loss of 50/-each, yet our boots and shoes show no reduction in price.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All along the line this is what I am trying to argue&mdash;that the Minister and the Government are increasing the cost of production, and I suggest to the Minister that if he wants to get milk produced cheaply; butter produced cheaply, he should remove all the factors that are hampering production at the moment.  I have tried to indicate the ways in which as I see it the Minister and the Government have increased the cost of production during the past 12 months.  I want to reiterate the fact that as far as the farmers are concerned the increase in the price of butter is affecting them as much as it is affecting anybody else, but I want the Minister to discontinue imposing extra costs of production on the farmers and let us produce our milk and butter as cheaply as we can.  We have in this country the best farmers in the world.  We have the best agricultural workers in the world, and if the Minister will not increase the cost of production we can produce the commodity in competition with any country in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I wish to second this motion as I believe that the present price of milk is completely inadequate and far below the cost of production.  To prove that, I would say that I know that in the Munster counties, in the dairy counties, complete herds of dairy cattle have been disposed of and in many cases the herds have been reduced considerably. The dairying industry is described, and rightly so, as the foundation stone of Irish agriculture, and over the past number of years the different Governments in this country have very reluctantly, or you could say very grudgingly, given any increases to the dairy farmers.  I would ask the Minister and the Government to review the whole dairy position and to adopt a long-term policy which would indicate to the producers that milk production was a sound investment and would encourage the producer to sink the necessary capital in the business.  I would also suggest that we should get away from methods hampering increased production.  I would further suggest to the Minister to subsidise butter.  I think it will relieve the present position.  Prices are very high, and it would bring butter within the reach of the poorer sections of the community to buy.  I would like an assurance from the Minister when he is replying that he would look up these facts.  This motion has been down several months&mdash;long before the milk strike&mdash;and I know that the cost of production and collection of milk in this country is not in keeping with present prices.</P>

      <P>Not in the slightest.  The purpose which I am sure actuated the three Deputies who put down this motion has not been in the slightest interfered with or affected by anything since the motion was put down, because as any increase was granted so were production costs increased. Deputy Lehane and Deputy Finucane have already referred to some of these costs, but surely it is apparent to everybody, nor is it too long at all since the Taoiseach spoke at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis and indicated that as a result of the removal of food subsidies compensatory benefits had to be given to every section of the community, and he mentioned the sum, which was quite considerable, that he stated was spent by this State in providing those compensatory benefits.  I claim that the agricultural community contributed in no small measure to the provision of that sum, but I cannot see where any benefit accrued to the dairy farmers to give them some opportunity of meeting the increased cost of living. Let it be noted that those people work hard in the open seven days a week every day of the year, with no holiday, no limitation of hours, having to work in every weather.  The farmer, his wife, his sons, his daughters and his workmen and those female labourers employed&mdash;all those people require nourishment.  They require food, and a lot of it.  Those are the people who consume butter, who eat bread, who drink tea, and we know that because of the nature of their work, away from the house as they have to be for many meals, they have need to consume more in the way of bread and butter than the ordinary workman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not a fact that an increase was given in agricultural wages so that the agricultural labourer would be in a <Col N="1686" /> position to assist his housekeeper in meeting the drastic increase in the cost of living as a result of the practical abolition of food subsidies, but that the farmer had to find that increase and also find an increase for his own wife because she also had to meet practically every item that was increased by the abolition of food subsidies? She also had to face that difficulty. That is merely in relation to the ordinary cost of living, the necessaries of life, but there has also been a very active attack on the simple luxuries of life, and in that respect, again, the farmer and his family have had to meet very high commitments. I am sure that many people would class whiskey as a luxury.  They definitely would not regard it as a necessity, but perhaps if they travelled seven or eight miles to a market on a very cold morning, leaving in the very early hours, they might think that they could very well do with a hot drop.  On many occasions when they go to fairs and have to go out in all kinds of weather, in all kinds of conditions, they have to take nourishment, so that there again there has been an attack on their little savings.</P>
    <P>Let us come now to some of the actual production costs, some of the very large increases that have occurred as a result of deliberate Government policy.  The Minister for Finance having brought in that Budget, which was designed to extract the last penny possible from the taxpayer, found that there was a limit to what he could get and then had to turn to his colleagues to devise various means to supplement revenue for the Exchequer.  One of those who was asked to contribute was the Minister for Local Government. He tried a double-edged weapon.  He cut the Local Authorities (Works) Act grants which were of considerable benefit to farmers in the dairying areas.  The Minister is, I am quite sure, aware that when water becomes stagnant it breeds fluke and many other evils affecting young cattle. The cessation of work under that scheme involved a sorry loss for the farmers.  Then there was a deliberate attack on the cost of producing milk when the tax on the ordinary little <Col N="1687" />&ldquo;convert&rdquo; was increased and when the price of petrol was increased.  The co-operative society, the Dairy Disposals Board, the chocolate factories, the dried milk concerns and the other ancillary industries had their costs increased to a great extent by that deliberate action of the Minister for Local Government.  As the dairying people have to meet these everincreasing costs they naturally feel that, they, like every other section of the community, are entitled to an increase in income to cover these increased costs.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the increased cost of fertilisers.  We know that there was a considerable amount of fertilisers brought in and stored here some three and a half or four years ago, and they were sold later at a tremendous price to the farmers. There has never been a satisfactory explanation as to how the increase in price came about, but a considerable sum had to be paid by the farmers as a result of the increase.  No doubt production costs affect all branches of agriculture but they affect dairies more than any other section.  We see that the grain growers very properly looked for protection from the falling price of maize, which might affect the price of oats and barley here at home. Is it not a fact that the action taken to support grain prices is one of the things that militate against a reduction in the production costs of the dairy farmers?  I am not saying that such action was not necessary but yet it results in placing a burden on those who have to feed cattle and produce milk.  Remember it is the farmers who can grow less in the way of grain crops who have to face the longest winter-feeding and who are faced with considerable expenditure if they have to maintain their live stock in that degree of productive capacity which the Minister regards as desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D.J. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, no doubt, will get a chance of speaking to this motion later.  That was a deliberate action on the part of the members of the present Government when they were in office formerly.  Be it noted that one of the first actions of Deputy Dillon was to see that that business was discontinued and the result, of course, was that cattle were saved to the industry.  Furthermore, the ancillary industries were considerably improved.  We can recall that the <Col N="1689" /> price of dry stock improved considerably after the trade agreement was made in June, 1948.  Since that time we know that milk was used by farmers for rearing poultry, turkeys, etc., and now just at this time of the year when they need most help many of these dairy farmers' wives and daughters find themselves facing a very bleak Christmas.  It is only a few years ago since they were able to supplement the income they got for milk by the receipts from the turkey trade, the prospects for which are not too rosy at the moment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government failed to give to the dairying industry the recognition that was afforded by his predecessor when farmers' vehicles were exempted from heavy taxation and when farmers were allowed to transport their neighbour's milk for reward at a low price.  To-day the farmers find that the tax on these vehicles is practically prohibitive.  The period when the industry is facing such great difficulties is surely not the time to reimpose a tax that had been considerably reduced.</P>
      <P>In recent debates here figures were given of the vastly increased numbers who fled from the land in recent years, numbers in which, unfortunately, there was a rapid acceleration last year. That fact makes it still more difficult for farmers in the dairying areas to continue their work, to improve their holdings, perhaps increase their herds and to bring about that increased production to which everybody pays lip service.  Is it not a fact that one of the outstanding features of the improvement in our balance of payments was the big increase in the value of live stock exported from this country and that in this industry we have the cradle of that live stock export trade? I was referring, Sir, to the fact that so many workers have left the land.  There are many parts of the country in which farmers find it extremely difficult to compete with the inducements given to people to leave the land and to enter other walks of life.  That fact is contributing to a great extent to the many difficulties which farmers are encountering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The young boy who is employed by <Col N="1690" /> a dairy farmer, after he leaves the national school, and at a time when he knows very little about the work he has to perform, may be said to be serving an apprenticeship but, far from having to pay a fee, such as would be required in other trades, this boy is paid.  He is kept in the farmhouse, he eats with the farmer's family and he grows up with the farmer's own sons.</P>
    <P>In the course of four or five years he learns something about the work and becomes of some value to the farmer. During that time he is paid, not as much possibly as many people would desire, but yet something better than what Deputy Desmond said is given in industrial employment in this country. What happens?  He sees some very attractive posters, the cost of which is defrayed by his employer and every other person in the community, inviting him to leave the land and join the Army in which he will have limited hours and all sorts of games on which to expend his energy.  In face of that, many hundreds of young men that were of very great help to this country were taken off the land and put into barracks.  I wonder what increase of production will come about as a result of that change.  That is only one of the difficulties which farmers have to meet.</P>
    <P>This motion is one which deserves the support of the House.  When we consider the difficulties encountered by those engaged in milk production and the fact that the cost of living has increased, it is unfortunate that the buffer which existed during the time of the inter-Party Government between the cost of marketing butter and the price to the public was wiped out completely by the abolition of the food subsidies.  The result has been that when dairy farmers mention the getting of an economic price for milk immediately we have the consuming public up in arms.  But when the producers brought it home to these people, and unfortunately they had to resort to extreme means to do so, it was amazing the amount of understanding which prevailed amongst people far removed from the dairying areas when they realised the difficulties which dairy farmers have to contend with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> In face of these difficulties, surely the Minister will be in a position at least to give an assurance to the House that neither he nor his colleagues will in the course of the coming months do anything to aggravate the position more than they have done.  We are told that the cost of cold storage is to be removed, the Minister says partially, from the Exchequer, that the profit on the imports of butter will now relieve the Minister for Finance of that obligation. That, presumably, is one of the things foreshadowed in the Minister for Finance's Budget statement when he said that taxation rests lightly on the land and that the farmer could very well meet this.  But surely, in face of that, the Government cannot stand over a policy of requiring this section of the community to carry on as they are doing or to extend their way of living and produce more and thus make unnecessary the imports which are being brought in by the Government in such substantial quantities unless they give some indication that they in turn will do something to ease the production costs.</P>
    <P>We know that the intention of the Government was to rook the farming community by the attack that was to be made on the rate abatement for agricultural land.  If any change has occurred in the intention of the Government in that respect it was brought about by the very decisive result of two by-elections.</P>

I have cited some of the increased costs which have arisen during the past two years and most of them can be attributed to deliberate Government policy.  Therefore, in supporting this motion, we demand that the Government should, by a deliberate policy, assist those who are engaged in the production of milk to meet the increasing cost of living and the increased production costs.</P>

      <P>This motion was put down on the Order Paper as far back as November, 1952, and many changes have taken place not merely in this House but outside this House since the motion was put down.  I may have been wrong when I suggested that Deputy O' Sullivan trooped into the Lobby gaily behind Deputy Dillon and I am sorry if I was.  But I do know that Deputy Madden, Deputy Rooney. Deputy O. Flanagan, and Deputy MacEoin walked into the Division Lobby and voted against an increase in the price of milk.</P>

      <P>In addition to that, we made provision for an inquiry into the cost of production, and I say that this motion is now out of date because of the changes which have taken place since it was put down and because the costings committee, which was set up in October, 1952, has not yet sent in its report there is very little purpose in discussing the motion.  However, I think it is necessary at this stage to point out that we increased the price of milk in 1951.  The price of milk went up again last March, not because it was increased by the Government at that time, but as a result of Government action in permitting an increase in the price of butter.  The mover of the motion, and also Deputy O'Sullivan, should realise that the Government do not fix a price for milk. The Government have fixed a price for butter and because of that the creameries increased the price given for milk.  Let us be clear on that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been the way since 1st March when the subsidies were withdrawn.  No longer can it be said that the Government fix the price of milk.  The price of milk is governed by the price of butter and the price paid by a creamery is governed by the efficiency of the creamery and of the creamery manager. We have throughout the country various prices for milk depending on the efficiency of the creamery, on the overhead expenses, on the locality in which it is situated, and on the butter tests.  All these are factors which must be taken into consideration before you can say what the price of milk is in any particular district.  In the past we had variations from 1d. to 2d. per gallon, even in well managed creameries.  In some cases it was because the supply might be lower, although the management was good; others had low expenses with a large supply and as a result a reasonably good price was paid.  Even though this motion was put down in November, 1952, changes have taken place since then.  We had an increase of 4d. per lb. in butter, which enabled well managed and efficient creameries to pay anywhere from 1.6 to 1.7 pence more for milk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>That increase was worth £1,500,000 to the dairying industry.  No reference was made to that by the mover of the motion or by Deputy O'Sullivan.  It is conveniently forgotten that that £1,500,000 went into the pockets of the dairy farmers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The average yield has gone up and if the average dairy farmer wants to maintain his income he does it, as I have pointed out on many occasions, not by having increased prices but by better feeding, better breeding, greater use of fertilisers and lime, as we have had this year.  There has been a greater supply of milk this year than in any <Col N="1694" /> year since 1936.  What was responsible for it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The weather was not responsible for feeding the cows.  It gave better grass to feed them&mdash;that is the difference.  The use of more lime and fertilisers was responsible for the increase in the gallonage of milk that went into the creameries.  What I have advocated during the past two years, since I came into these benches, was that farmers should increase the income by increasing the gallonage per cow.  I have pointed out on many occasions that an increase of 1d. per gallon was of little use to a dairy farmer, but it meant 3d. per lb. on the price of butter.  These are the things that have been happening in the past. You have evidence of what can be done if greater use is made of the land&mdash; more use of lime and fertilisers, more grass, better winter feeding and, as a result, a greater income per cow for the farmer.  That is the only way in which this can be done.  You have to-day the consumer to decide whether he is going to pay that price for butter or not, whether you are going to maintain the consumption of butter or not. If the consumption goes down as a result of high prices, the farmer's income goes down.  The only way in which he can maintain his income is by increasing his supply of milk.  He can do that by greater use of artificial manures or fertilers and the use of lime.</P>
      <P>When I set up the costings committee it was done with a view to finding out what it cost to produce a gallon of milk.  That committee has been working since 1952.  It finished the field operations in October, 1953, and will submit a report by April of 1954. If, as a result of the findings of that committee, a review of prices must be held, the Government will review those prices after receiving that report. Until then I see no purpose in a motion of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1695" /> There are two means by which the price could be increased&mdash;one is by the old system of subsidies for butter and a subsidy means taxation.  Do Deputies opposite stand for greater taxation? Surely Deputies are not that dense they do not know there are two ways &mdash;one is taxation and the other an increase in the price of butter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Madden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a recognised philosophy in the world to-day that increased production is essential to the well-being of any country and any community.  There are two headings under which production can be brought about&mdash;industry and agriculture.  There are limitations in this country under the heading of industrial production due to the fewness of skilled industrial workers here and also due to the fact that raw materials are limited, to a degree.  It is axiomatic, therefore, that if the economic structure of this country is to be maintained and if it is to flourish it must ultimately be brought about by increased agricultural production.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to indulge now in any kind of a political argument across the floor of this House on the question of milk.  This question ought to be approached in a broad and democratic and national spirit.  For the past 16 years I have been a member either of this House or of the Seanad and I have given a great deal of serious thought to the question of the dairying industry. Looking on the matter dispassionately, I can only see the country as a whole and I can say, without any fear of contradiction, that I am afraid that none of our Governments seem to have made a real and a sincere effort to implement to the maximum degree the ideas they expressed on the economics of the country.  They have paid a good deal of lip service and they have given the impression that their view is that agriculture is the basis of our economy, but, as I say, a real and a sincere effort does not ever seem to have been made to implement the views which various Ministers have expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How many times have we heard Ministers say in this House that the economic well-being of our country is <Col N="1700" /> based upon agriculture and that the foundation on which the agricultural structure must be built is the dairying industry?  I was amused to hear a man of the Minister's experience say that the dairy farmers are satisfied. Are our farmers satisfied?  Is the industry in a flourishing condition? Surely the Minister will admit that that is not the case.  Surely he will admit the veracity of statements by authorities whose facts and figures cannot be disputed?  We have been told that 80,000 persons have left the land.  How many times during the past week have we heard it said in this House that 22,000 more left the land between 1952 and 1953?  We have also been told about the reduction in the dairy cow population.</P>

      <P>There was a decrease in the number of in-calf heifers and dairy cows.  The dairy counties are located in the South.  There is a scarcity of skilled agricultural workers there.  I submit that the technique is very skilled and that when skilled agricultural workers leave the land it is not easy to replace them.  If 130,000 of them have gone from the dairying industry in the few southern counties in which that industry is centred, does it not indicate that there is something radically wrong?</P>
      <P>It is axiomatic that no country can continue to spend money indefinitely faster than the source of wealth can provide it.  Our chief source of wealth is our agricultural industry.  If you exhaust the source of wealth, then the source of supply must suffer.  If the sources of supply and wealth suffer, would that not be most prejudicial to the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have here a document issued by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, which contains an extract from a speech by the Taoiseach. <Col N="1701" /> Tattered as it is I have kept it, and I propose to quote one or two passages from it.  I may have done so before, but there is an old hunting maxim: &ldquo;Cry back is good hunting&rdquo;.  Point No. 5 of Mr MacEntee's seven-point policy was that an increase in production for our exports, particularly agricultural, was urgently needed to reduce the trade deficit, but I am more impressed by the Taoiseach's remarks, which clearly demonstrate how essential the dairying industry is to the continued economic success of the country. If the preservation and continuity of the dairying industry hinges upon an increased supply of milk, as the Minister has told us, there is something radically wrong with the present state of affairs.</P>
    <P>I was reading to-day a booklet which set out in respect of various herds in England&mdash;Ayrshires, Friesians, and so on&mdash;the milk yield, butter fat content and maximum supply per year.  The yield was in the region of 800 to 900 gallons.  The herd which came nearly lowest in the matter of production, of milk yield and butter fat content, was the Shorthorn.  The Minister asked us for a solution.  Let him listen to the Taoiseach who, on the Vote for his Department on 19th July, 1951, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The main aim of the economic policy was to utilise the natural resources of the country to the fullest extent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No one will disagree with that, but the creamery suppliers in a comment on that statement say that no expansion of consequence in exports can come through cattle and sheep production, except with the certainty of further rural depopulation, with its adverse social effects.  That is sound, is it not?</P>
    <P>There is clear and unmistakable evidence that there is a necessity for an increase in the price of milk and for the Government to handle the matter as they ought to handle such a very important economic factor.  For this reason, I give my support to this motion.  A further comment the creamery suppliers make is that the only alternative is the development of substantial exports in dairy produce, and <Col N="1702" /> a condition precedent is a favourable adjustment of milk and butter prices in relation to cattle and sheep prices. That is a true economic and agricultural philosophy.</P>
    <P>We must have an increase, but how can we get that increase when the dairying industry is rapidly declining? How is the Minister to increase the milk yield, which stands at about 400 gallons, to 900 gallons?  Since the days of landlordism, there has been no observable constructive and progressive movement in the development of our agricultural industry.  Our population is declining rapidly, whereas the population of smaller countries, with less fertility and enjoying less favourable atmospheric conditions, has increased, as has their wealth.  These countries are an example of the scientific development of agriculture.  It is a surprising fact that in June, 1949, the dairying counties of Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary and Cork afforded employment on the land to 128,183 persons, while the employment given by all other industries was 124,301.</P>
    <P>Look at the position with regard to store cattle.  I know the price they are making.  It is very remunerative, but how is that end of the trade to be continued if the source of supply, the dairying industry, remains in the decadent state it is in?  Dairying is in a very serious condition.  The Minister spoke about lime and fertilisers being essential and the combination of these two ingredients would improve the quality of our grass and possibly increase the milk yield.  The Minister should not take all the credit for the abnormal increase in milk last summer. Last winter was a very mild winter and we got one of the most beneficent spring and summer seasons that Providence could give and the Minister will not contradict me when I say that, so far, this winter has been like the month of June.  A creamery manager told me that there was an increase of about 40,000 gallons of milk in his own creamery.  He told me that was due, in the main, not to the application of fertilisers but to a kindly and beneficent Providence.</P>
    <P>The dairying industry is in a bad state.  The cost of production is high <Col N="1703" /> and the price of fertilisers is excessive. I use a lot of fertilisers myself and the price is prohibitive.  A few nights ago I mentioned a factory built by a Dutch firm.  I understand they produce fertilisers.  The factory is in the County Wicklow.  The Minister should do something in the way of subsidisation under that head if he wants to make the maximum use of agriculture. Whatever may be the price of butter the Minister should take whatever steps necessary to give the farmers the essentials to increase the production of milk.  Of course, that would ultimately increase the price of butter.</P>
    <P>Look at the plight of the dairy farmers for the past couple of years. Salt, which is an essential, has been increased by 69.8 per cent.  Oil has increased by 16.7 per cent., testing of materials, 10.9 per cent., electric power, 25 per cent., cartage and carriage, 17.8 per cent., repairs, 24 per cent., machinery, 18.5 per cent., salaries and wages, 26.6 per cent.  All that has happened since the end of 1951.  To that has to be added the incidence of ever-increasing taxation. Taxation rates have increased.  Anybody who has to pay considerable rates can see the gradual increase over a number of years.  The cost of labour has gone up and the cost of machinery and replacements has gone up.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell me that in not voting for an increase one time I was actuated by political expediency rather than by agricultural economics, but my approach to this matter is a national one.  Something must be done by this or the next Government.  We all agree that agriculture is the basis of our whole economic set-up.  If that industry continues to decline rapidly, some Government in the future will, in the words used by the Minister some minutes ago, have to approach the matter in a serious and realistic manner.  I think one of the ways to do that would be to meet the motion tabled by Deputy Lehane and give the increase in the price of milk.  That would encourage greater production and would provide more employment. Indeed, it might well help to prevent <Col N="1704" /> another 20,000 skilled agricultural workers leaving the land this year.</P>

      <P>The motion on the Order Paper in the names of Deputies Lehane, Cogan and Finucane states:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great regard for the sincerity of Deputy Lehane in tabling this motion 12 months ago when the situation regarding the dairying industry was altogether different from what it is at the present moment.  I also have regard&mdash;it dates further back&mdash;for Deputy Patrick Finucane of North Kerry because I do not think that those engaged in the dairying industry in Munster were ever made aware of the part he played behind closed doors during the period of the Coalition Government in helping to counteract the policy of the then Minister for Agriculture because of his action and his treatment of the dairying industry. I say that with full inside knowledge. It is on the milk issue and that alone that Deputy Patrick Finucane severed <Col N="1705" /> his connection with the Clann na Talmhan Party.</P>
      <P>I listened very carefully to the speeches made by the proposer and seconder of this motion and by the Deputies in the Fine Gael Benches who deem it well at this stage to support the motion, whether genuinely or not I do not know.  My colleague from West Limerick made a speech on this issue on a well selected text.  He said that the whole discussion should be based on the philosophy of increased production and that political dissertations and taunts across the floor of the House would not serve the matter we are about to discuss in any way.</P>
      <P>I had hoped that he would have kept rigidly to the text and gospel which he outlined, but he rambled a bit further afield and endeavoured to argue that the dairying industry and the entire agricultural economy suffered very seriously since the advent of the present Government.  He admitted that the effective and well-recognised solution for that industry was to encourage, by the proper use of lime and fertilisers, increased milk production.  That is a sensible method, and it is quite correct.  I will give an example in support of the point made by Deputy Madden.</P>
      <P>Suppose a farmer supplies at the moment 100 gallons of milk daily to a creamery, say, in the County Limerick at the minimum price of 1/6.  By a better method of husbandry and farming and by a liberal use of crushed lime now being made quite readily available at the highest subsidised price or by fertilisers he can increase his milk production by 25 per cent. at the very least.  Therefore, that man can carry 125 gallons of milk daily to the creamery at the minimum guaranteed price of 1/6 and possibly at a higher price.  Depending on the proper management and efficiency of that creamery, he could possibly get up to 1/7, 1/7½ or 1/8 a gallon with the same overhead costs.  That can be done.  It is one of the things we should all try to bring home forcibly to our dairy farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was strange to have to listen to some of the Fine Gael speakers who tried by subtle ways and means on <Col N="1706" /> selected points to cash in on the whole position.  Deputy Madden, for instance, said that the condition of the dairying industry in Limerick, Cork and Kerry was never worse than it is at the moment.  I would like to ask Deputy Madden did he think seriously over that statement before he made it and compare the dairying position in Limerick, Kerry and Cork of 1950 with the position to-day.  In March, 1950, we had a motion such as this introduced by independent farmer Deputies, and I think we discussed it for at least a week.  We all know exactly the line taken then by the Fine Gael members from West and East Limerick and other Munster dairying counties.  They trooped into the Lobby under the leadership and direction of their Minister for Agriculture and they voted against that increase proposed in the motion of these independent Deputies.</P>
    <P>We had the same line-up and the some backing from Fine Gael for the suggestion of the then Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Dillon, that our dairy farmers should accept 1/- a gallon for milk over a period of five years.  That announcement by the then Minister was hotly and seriously challenged in every dairying county in Ireland. Deputy Dillon then went to Limerick, and it is in the records that he met in Limerick City representatives from every dairying area in County Limerick and told them that if they were not prepared to accept 1/- a gallon they could have a running jump at themselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of what Limerick did in voting for John Carew or otherwise does not enter into this particular motion we are discussing. Since the Deputy has tried to introduce the question of by-elections into this issue, let me say that he might not be experienced enough in the political life of this country to realise that you have ups and downs in by-elections and that the success of a Party in a particular by-election depends solely on the results given in a previous general election.  If you have any doubt in your mind as regards <Col N="1707" /> what the people of Limerick will do when they get their chance, I can assure you that they will give us what they always gave us since 1932&mdash;they will send four Deputies into Dáil Éireann to support the policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches cannot be at least consistent, why they speak with divers tongues in various areas.  I remember being in Dublin during the North-West Dublin by-election campaign and reading some of the placards which were demonstrated to the voters there and which read: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil butter at 4/2 a lb.; the Fianna Fáil Government enriches the dairy farmers of Limerick.&rdquo;  That was the attitude of Fine Gael in the Dublin North-West by-election campaign and they come in here to-night to cry and bemoan that the farmers of Limerick, Kerry, Cork, and Tipperary are not getting a sufficient price for their milk. They are pretending that they are sincerely and genuinely behind Deputies Finucane and Lehane.  That, to my mind, is gross political dishonesty. In every walk of life, whether it be in our private capacity or in public life, we should at least have one thing and that is common decency founded on truth.</P>

      <P>It is very seldom I speak in this House, but when I do I know what I am speaking about.  If Deputy Rooney could have the same boast he could feel very happy about it.  Deputy O'Sullivan went on to state that the killing of 147,000 calves in 1947 is responsible for some serious set-back in our agricultural economy <Col N="1708" /> at the moment.  I do not think the Minister for Agriculture understood very clearly Deputy O'Sullivan when he made that point.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture thought that Deputy O'Sullivan was referring to the slaughter of the calves during the Blueshirt campaign because he mentioned that matter very often in the House.</P>

      <P>Be that as it may, that was a very remunerative policy for the people engaged in the veal trade during that period.  The figures at the moment&mdash;and you cannot beat the force of figures&mdash;show that in this year of 1953 we have an increase of 92,000 cattle; as against 1950 we have an increase this year of 72,000 sheep; as regards the pig industry, there is an increase of 132,000 as compared with the last year of the Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>If we had, through the hand of God or by the inclemency of the weather, in the 1946-47 period lost 147,000 cattle it would not affect our agricultural economy at the moment, and if any of the Fine Gael Deputies doubt my figures they have a means of checking up.  Our cattle population has increased by 92,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Madden went on to bemoan and bewail the losses and the decrease in dairy cattle in County Limerick. Deputy Madden is a well-established and respected auctioneer, especially in West Limerick, where he has conducted many valuable sales of dairy cattle.  At any of those sales where he had been privileged to dispose of any dairy herds, I think those herds were almost 100 per cent. bought up by other farmers and that the loss of dairy cattle in County Limerick is not <Col N="1709" /> anything like as great as he tries to establish.  It might mean that a certain man would go out of business and sell a herd of some 20 to 25, but that generally means that his next-door neighbour or his neighbours around have purchased three or four extra dairy cattle.</P>
    <P>As the Minister mentioned a while ago, if there was something to support the point which Deputy O'Sullivan made as regards a recession or a decrease in our dairy cattle or in the point made by Deputy Madden, he could still prove&mdash;again with the force of figures behind him&mdash;that milk production has increased for last year. Deputy Rooney, in his own inimitable way, said we had better grass because we had better weather, which will show you exactly how Deputy Rooney generally misses the bus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">

      <P>You cannot have better grass if you are depending on the weather.  You will have better grass if you have a more liberal use of fertilisers and, of course, you will have it for a longer period if you have fine weather.  The Deputy should not miss that point.  If you have a mild spring, you will have the grass much earlier than if you have a harsh spring. Deputy Madden said that we should not have dissertations here on politics or taunts by Deputies across the floor of the House.  He did base his philosophy on increased production alone.  I am prepared to support him to the extent of 100 per cent. on that. I believe that the Minister for Agriculture is going on the right lines by seeking to increase production.  Increased production is the cure for all our economic ills, whether we are considering the agricultural or the industrial arm.  Speaking from my experience of, and of my association with, the farmers in West Limerick, I am satisfied that they have come to realise that it is the only solution, and they are grateful to the present Minister and Government for placing at their disposal unlimited quantities of crushed limestone to be used generously on our lands.  It is there, I <Col N="1710" /> believe, that we will find the real solution for all our economic ills.</P>

      <P>Deputy Madden gave the House some quotations from statements made by the Taoiseach last year, I think he said.  The Taoiseach was dealing generally with the economic position of the country, and Deputy Madden quoted some very sound advice which the Taoiseach gave on various aspects of our economy. Deputy Madden, I am sure, will agree that the dairying industry is of fundamental importance.  The Deputy and myself will agree on that.  We often agree to differ and we often do not agree at all but we do agree that the dairying industry is of fundamental importance, and that everything that is related to production, and the wealth of the country, rests on it.</P>
      <P>I want to challenge Deputy Madden on a few points.  When I refer to Deputy Madden, I know that I am referring to a man who belongs to the old school of politics, to the old, well learned and experienced school of politicians. I venture to think that there is no member of this House who could imitate, as well as the Deputy does, some of the great and notable speakers of the past, of such men, for example, as John Philpot Curran; but I cannot agree with the Deputy when he says that there has been a complete exodus of agricultural workers from the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to give credit where credit is due, and if I could believe that the Deputy was sincere in all the things he says I would be very pleased.  Last week, when the Estimate for the Department for Local Government was before the House, Deputy Madden challenged the Minister on some points on his Estimate that possibly at the moment, are <i>sub judice.</i> The Deputy on that occasion referred to the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill which has still to come before the House.  This, perhaps, may <Col N="1711" /> not have a very direct bearing on the motion we are discussing, but I am referring to it because Deputy Madden dealt with it in the course of his speech last week.  I believe that the theory he advanced when referring to that Bill is a fallacy.  He said it did not matter whether the amount of relief a farmer gets under that Bill is £13 or £17 because, he argued, how could any farmer afford to employ an agricultural worker at £4 a week if the only inducement offered to him is relief in his rates to the extent of £17 or £13 a year.  That was the bald naked statement made by Deputy Madden.</P>
      <P>I do not think that many farmers would agree with him.  The Deputy's whole argument was, why should a farmer employ an agricultural worker who will cost him £4 a week if the amount of relief in rates set out in that Bill is the only enticement offered to him to do so?  I want to say, most emphatically, that that is not the view of any dairy farmer in West Limerick. He knows that the agricultural worker, getting £4 a week will, in fact, be paying for himself when he gives an honest return for his wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy then went on to bemoan the flight, the exodus, of agricultural workers from the land.  We hear a lot of that glib kind of talk from the benches opposite.  It is employed for purely political purposes in an endeavour to score points against the Minister for Agriculture and other Ministers whenever an opportunity offers of arguing that there has been a reduction in employment in some sphere of our economic life.  Are we sincere in what we say?  If we want to keep the agricultural workers on the land, the only way to do that is by showing that we are prepared to give them a decent wage.  I am speaking from my experience and consultations with farmers in the West Limerick area, an area in which there is a great density of population, where many people are living under difficult conditions on uneconomic holdings.  These are farmers who made an effort to employ extra men in making drains on their land under section (A) of the land project scheme.  They do their utmost to provide work for men in the spring-time <Col N="1712" /> and in the saving of the harvest.  I suggest that is the policy which should be applied generally to encourage the further employment of agricultural workers at a decent rate of wages, and that the compensatory value that is guaranteed to them under the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, whether it be £13 or £17, should not enter into the matter at all, because the more men a farmer employs the better return he will get both from his men and from his farm.</P>

      <P>I am afraid Deputy Rooney has a very poor conception of farming conditions as they apply in West Limerick, Kerry, Cork and Tipperary compared to his own experience in the County Dublin area. It had not been my intention to intervene at this early stage in the debate. I was hoping to hear some more of the Fine Gael speakers in support of this motion.  I think that our people in Limerick, Cork, Tipperary and elsewhere should not be credited with having short memories.  The Fine Gael Party are doing their utmost to marshal support for this motion from eloquent speakers on their benches. They are doing so just for political reasons to try and embarrass in some way or other the present Minister and Government.  Later they will go to the cross-roads and to the chapel gates and say that they supported this motion in the name of Deputy Lehane, and that, while they did that, Fianna Fáil Deputies marched into the Division Lobby to vote against it.  But mind you I know down in Limerick anyhow it did not take long for the farmers of Limerick to pull the teeth of such Fine Gael propaganda, and of all such Fine Gael speeches.  In March, 1950, when the dairying industry was in a crippled condition and when some relief was needed and a motion was put down, I think, by Deputies O'Reilly, Cogan and Lehane&mdash;I think Deputy Lehane also figured in the motion at the time&mdash;it got the fullest support of the Fianna Fáil Party at that period.</P>

      <P>The entire weight of the Fine Gael machine in that area put him out because he was the prime mover of that motion, and it was he who focussed attention on the serious position of dairying as it then existed, and exposed the Fine Gael humbug of that time.  They made sure he would not come in here.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finucane, too, did not get the credit he deserved.  They may try to cover up their footsteps and their traces by attributing their defeat and the burst-up within their own ranks in the inter-Party Government in May, 1951, to Deputy Dr. Browne and the Health Bill, but there was something as important responsible for the burst-up of the then Coalition Government in May, 1951, as the Health Bill and Dr. Browne.  It was the attitude of Deputy Finucane when he went to the Minister for Agriculture's office and told him that he was going to vote and, by his vote, help to throw the Fine Gael Party into the political wilderness if they were not prepared to give increased prices to the dairy farmers of Munster.  After a severe tussle within their own ranks, and the dangling of the bait of 1/- per gallon for five years, and after Deputy Rooney said he supported that because it was guaranteed for five years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy was not in the House when I started off.  I quoted the philosophy as announced by your colleague, Deputy Madden and the text on which he said he would make his speech.  That was that the solution to the stability of the dairying industry could be achieved by increased production.  If Deputy Madden had kept himself solely to that particular text I would probably follow on similar lines.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows &mdash;especially Deputy Barry&mdash;that when a Deputy starts off with very pious platitudes like that and does not stick rigidly to them and, when he turns to the right and to the left, and makes other little diversions and brings in things which are not accurate and introduces matters with no direct relevance to the issue we are discussing, surely my right is not denied to analyse all those points made by one of Deputy Barry's colleagues with whom I am not in entire agreement?</P>
      <P>I know this much about Deputy Barry.  It seems to be characteristic of some of the Cork Deputies that they are inclined to be a bit impetuous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not know how I will get a chance of doing a little parsing and analysing with Deputy O'Sullivan.

      <P>With all due respect to your ruling, when a Deputy on the opposite side stands up and says that I am conducting my little contribution to this debate on lines which I did not suggest at the start, I suppose I am entitled to be somewhat diverted.

      <P>Both Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Madden have spoken to this motion.  Even Deputy Lehane made some point&mdash;I was inclined to forget it&mdash;that I was in entire agreement with.  He went on to state &mdash;very honestly I thought&mdash;that this motion was tabled twelve months ago and did not come up for discussion and in the meantime, notwithstanding increased prices given for milk, the overhead costs of production had increased to the farmers.  He did not mention salt and oil and petrol and other things that Deputy Madden mentioned as regards increases that have taken place in the running of creameries.  But Deputy Lehane went on to make other points in support of matters which he said were adversely affecting the cost of production.  He spoke about many things, but I think the main point he made was the cost of fertilisers.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind Deputy Lehane and other Deputies that prior to the putting down of this motion by Deputy Lehane and others in October or November or December of 1952, we had not on record that the same amount of crushed limestone was available to&mdash;and if available was used by &mdash;the farmers of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since December, 1952, and all through the spring of 1953, and subsequently, the increased tonnage of ground limestone made available to and bought by the farming community for use on the land was something like 500 per cent. more than was used in the period that Deputy Lehane had under review when he introduced this motion.  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned that the reduction of the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the proposed change in the method of the agricultural relief grant to the various councils would have a very serious effect on the farmers, especially those in the dairying industry.  But the Minister for Agriculture has clearly demonstrated and proved that the increased price he allowed for butter last year, and that, of course, is the medium through and the <Col N="1716" /> criterion by which the price of milk can be fixed, of 4/2 per lb., brought to the dairying farmers the remarkable sum of £1,500,000.  Deputy O'Sullivan lost sight of that fact and proceeded to bemoan some serious losses suffered because the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act have been reduced to the local councils in the respective counties.</P>
    <P>I do not want to introduce the Local Authorities (Works) Act into this debate.  As a member of the Limerick County Council I have studied this matter very closely and while I have much to say in relation to the value and utility of works carried out under that Act in County Limerick I have a good deal of censure and adverse comment to make on some of the schemes where the vast amount of money spent gave no return and had no utility value whatsoever. Deputy O'Sullivan spoke of water stagnation and so forth being responsible for causing diseases in cattle.  I do not know exactly how the farmers in North Cork come out in that matter but before we in Limerick ever received any grants from the Local Authorities (Works) Act, or from any Department of State, I can say that the farmers in West Limerick would never have allowed such water stagnation in or near their premises or pastures as would have interfered in any way with their cattle.  I believe that because Deputy O'Sullivan was simply picking any rod he could lay his hands on to belabour the Minister for Agriculture in relation to milk prices such matters as the reduction of the grants under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and the proposed change in the grants under the Agricultural (Relief of Rates) Act were introduced into this debate.  I am perfectly satisfied that I am expressing the convictions and views of at least 95 per cent. of the farmers in County Limerick.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked me why I did not say 100 per cent., and he is entitled to an answer.  When I do not say 100 per cent. and quote <Col N="1717" /> a figure of 95 per cent. instead I am not losing sight of the fact that we have a certain percentage of graziers in County Limerick who possibly do not indulge in dairying to any extent. Now I am talking for the dairy farmers, the working farmers.  They are very pleased with conditions at the present time in relation to the price of milk.  Since the Minister authorised the increase in the price of butter by 4d. to ensure the farmers would be paid a minimum of 1/6 per gallon for their milk, I have met many of these farmers, some of them of different political affiliations from my own, and the only fear they have at the moment is that the price of milk might be reduced.  They are satisfied with the average present price prevailing and operating.  Nearly all the County Limerick farmers during the lactation period got as much as 1/7½ and in some cases 1/8 per gallon for their milk.  These men are hard-headed, sensible men, sound businessmen in their own respective callings and they are satisfied to work and take full advantage of the schemes the Minister has made available for them, especially the crushed limestone scheme which he initiated and which he and his Government intend to expand until, as the Taoiseach said, the full lime requirements of the land are provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Madden stated that we had <Col N="1718" /> not increased the export of our agricultural products during the last 18 months.  I do not know what papers Deputy Madden reads, but any sensible man who keeps himself in touch with the economic development of this country must readily admit that our agricultural exports increased more than they have ever done in the past over the last 12 or 15 months.</P>
