      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether a method, by which yearly net emigration figures for this country can be determined, has yet been devised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will now make arrangements for the keeping of records each month of the number of emigrants leaving this country for (1) Great Britain, (2) Canada, (3) Australia and (4)  United States of America in view of the importance of having correct figures of emigration available for the Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>A satisfactory method by which annual net emigration figures could at present be determined has not so far been devised, despite the most careful consideration.  The investigation of the matter is, however, still being pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adequate particulars are recorded in respect of persons who emigrate by sea, through either Irish or British ports, to Canada, Australia and the United States of America.  In addition, information is available as to the numbers of new passports issued to persons who state they are going to employment or permanent residence in these countries.  As I have explained in replies to previous questions, the keeping of records of those who emigrate to Britain would involve the <Col N="750" /> setting up of elaborate controls which would be expensive and would interfere with normal passenger traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would not be considered dictatorial or out of place if people who intended to go to Britain or to any other country were compelled to register at some Government office in their respective towns or cities for the purpose of compiling adequate emigration figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O. Flanagan Mr. O. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it is a fact that the Government has certain information at its disposal concerning these emigration figures and that the figures are so alarming the Government refuses to let them out to the general public and their representatives in this House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>That entire matter has been considered before and I think the Deputy should realise that it would be undesirable to do anything like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has received representations from mineral water manufacturers protesting against the charge of 35/3 per gross for 7-oz. mineral water bottles, which <Col N="756" /> are being sold by the same firm at 22/3 per gross in Great Britain and Northern Ireland; and, if so, what steps he proposes to take to ensure that supplies of these bottles will be made available to Irish mineral water manufacturers at prices comparable to those charged to mineral water manufacturers in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a question on this subject last week, the affairs of the company engaged in the manufacture of glass bottles in this country have been the subject of inquiry by the Prices Advisory Body on a number of occasions.  The prices charged on the home market have been arrived at after taking into account all relevant considerations, and represent a smaller proportionate increase on pre-war prices than the average increase in manufacturing costs during the same period.  I am satisfied that, if for any reason, the company is unable to maintain export sales, an increase in home market prices will be unavoidable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the preliminary report of the Census of Industrial Production for the tobacco industry for 1952 indicates that profits increased substantially over 1951; and, if so, if he will take steps to have the price of cigarettes and tobacco investigated at a public hearing by the Prices Advisory Body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that total salaries and wages in the tobacco industry increased by 9 per cent. from £906,975 in 1951 to £986,797 in 1952, while the remainder of net output as defined in the Census of Industrial Production and which includes profits increased two and a half times from £797,817 to £2,010,541; and, further, if he will state whether this increase of £1,212,714 in the remainder of net output can be regarded as a measure of the very substantial increase in the profits accruing to the manufacturers over this period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions No. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the &ldquo;Remainder of Net Output,&rdquo; as shown in the Census of Industrial Production, includes a substantial amount for overhead costs in addition to the actual net profit.  Consequently the increase of approximately £1.2 million between 1951 and 1952 consists in part of increased overheads and in part of increased profits.  The profits earned by tobacco manufacturers in 1951 were substantially below the level permitted by the arrangements by which the net profits of tobacco manufacturers are restricted.  An increase in profits in 1952 was, therefore, to be expected.  I should add that the profit position of the principal tobacco manufacturers is kept constantly under review by the Prices Advisory Body, and the retail prices of the popular brands of cigarettes and of tobaccos are fixed by Statutory Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the figures for net output bear a very close relation to the profits of the cigarette manufacturers? Further, will he not agree that the one penny allowed to cigarette manufacturers and announced in the Budget Statement, 1952, rather than making up the alleged losses of the cigarette manufacturers, provides them with a very generous increase in profits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The profits permitted are calculated in the same way as they have always been calculated since this control was established.  In 1951, however, a situation arose in which it would not be possible for these manufacturers to earn the permitted profit and a rather serious situation arose as far as some of the manufacturers were concerned.  The increase in profits in 1952 did not bring them above the level permitted by the arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed that there may have been a case for some of the Irish concerns but would the Minister not agree that, in respect of some of these concerns that are not Irish, the increase in net output from £800,000 to over £2,000,000 in one year <Col N="758" /> was very, very great?  Further, will the Minister refer his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to a statement he made in this House on the 1st May, where he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Deputy Corish, by some method of calculation, has arrived at the conclusion that this additional 1d. per packet on the price of cigarettes means £900,000 per annum to the tobacco manufacturers.  I do not know how the Deputy has arrived at that figure.  It is in any event too fantastic to be correct.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think the figures given in the <i>Trade Journal</i> show that the estimate was not fantastic but rather that the profits were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I wish to indicate.  One is that during these two years there was an increase in the value of the gross output as well as the net output.  Secondly, not all the profits of these manufacturers are subject to the statutory price control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Beegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question refers to the cargo of Russian timber which arrived recently in Dublin port.  The amount of foreign currency allocated in respect of this cargo was £85,000.</P>
      <P>As regards the circumstances under which the currency was allocated, I would refer the Deputy to the answers which I gave him on 27th November, 1952, and 5th February, 1953, in reply to similar questions.  I would remind the Deputy that exchange control approval for imports of Russian timber was given by direction of the Coalition Government on the basis, which still subsists, of giving the timber trade facilities for the purchase of essential requirements in the cheapest market.  The payments are effected in sterling and as exchange relations between the sterling area and Russia are easy, there is no justification for refusing the necessary facilities on foreign exchange grounds.</P>
      <P>Other aspects of the matter are being dealt with by the Tánaiste and the Minister for External Affairs in reply to questions addressed to them. I may add, however, that experience has shown that as long as Great Britain and other European countries continue to trade with Russia and her associates any attempt on our part to exclude imports from these sources by means of currency control would be ineffective.  The net result would be that these essential imports would arrive via Great Britain or some such country, giving them a profit at our expense on the transaction and thereby increasing the price to the Irish consumer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with Section 4 (4) of the Central Fund Act, 1949, any sums from time to time paid out of the Central Fund for the payment of principal and interest on money borrowed by the Minister for Finance from the Government of the United States of America or any agency thereof shall be repaid out of the American Loan Counterpart Fund to the Central Fund.  The income of the Exchequer from the American Loan Counterpart Fund in future years will consist of these repayments, the ultimate source of which will be the principal and interest derived by the fund from its investments in Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer and stock of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
      <P>According as principal repayments fall due from 1956 onwards in respect of the dollar borrowings it will be necessary to redeem Ways and Means Advances so as to enable the fund to make the repayments to the Central Fund provided for in the Act of 1949. The principal liability at the present rate of exchange is £45.8 million whereas the total investments of the fund at 31st March last were £41.13 million.  A net deficiency is, therefore, in prospect on a winding up of the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lest there should be any confusion, <Col N="769" /> I think it right to emphasise that the net effect of the transactions regarding Ways and Means Advances is that the interest charge on £40.5 million of the dollar debt has to be borne by the Irish taxpayer and also that principal repayments, not only to this amount but to cover the prospective deficiency as well, will be a burden on future revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together, and to make a full statement in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>The Letterkenny railway ran from Letterkenny to Farland Point, a distance of 16½ miles.  It was built with the aid of two loans advanced by the Commissioners of Public Works to the Letterkenny Railway Company over 70 years ago and totalling £85,000.  One of the loans amounting to £35,000 was the subject of a baronial guarantee, and was paid off in 1924; but repayments on foot of the other loan, one of £50,000, which was the subject of a first mortgage on the property, had by the year 1887 fallen into such arrear that the commissioners decided to take possession of the line as mortgagees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should, perhaps, explain that at Farland Point, where the Letterkenny line terminated, there was no station or siding; the rails of the Letterkenny <Col N="771" /> company and of the Lough Swilly railway, which ran on to Derry, simply joined each other to form a continuous line.</P>
    <P>The Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company worked the Letterkenny line from its opening in 1883 under an operating agreement between the two companies, and after the Commissioners of Public Works took possession of the Letterkenny line as mortgagees, they entered into an agreement in 1888 with the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company for the working of the line on terms which provided for the retention by the company of a percentage of the gross receipts on a sliding scale and for payment of the balance to the commissioners.  This agreement was expressed to be for a period of 30 years from the 1st July, 1887, and thereafter from year to year.</P>
    <P>Following the 1914-18 War the railways were brought under Government control from 1917 to 1921 and under the terms of the control agreement between the British Government and the Irish Railways the annual amount to be paid to the Commissioners of Public Works in respect of the Letterkenny line was stabilised at the actual amount paid in 1913.  This arrangement was continued after decontrol by the Irish Railways (Settlement of Claims) Act, 1921.  Under these provisions, the position was that the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company became liable for an annual payment of approximately £2,200 to the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Letterkenny railway has been worked at a considerable loss for many years past.  The annual payment to the commissioners of £2,200 fell into arrears almost from the start; and by 1934 the arrears amounted to £28,000. These arrears, and all subsequent annual payments, had to be written off.</P>
    <P>Let me come now to the circumstances which led up to the sale of the Letterkenny line to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company. The company was still working the line (in conjunction with its own railways) under the old agreement with the <Col N="772" /> commissioners to which I have referred when, in February, 1951, they intimated to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that they desired to terminate the train services operated by them on their own railway lines, from Bridgend to Buncrana and from Tooban Junction to Farland Point, and also on the Letterkenny line.  Deputies will be aware of the provisions of the Railways Act, 1933, regarding the termination of rail services and that it is therein provided amongst other things (1) that an Order under Section 9 of the Act terminating any such services shall not be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce unless the railway company had authority to carry on a road transport service and gave public notice of the establishment of, or intention to establish adequate road transport services in substitution for the rail services to be terminated; (2) that the Minister's Order would not relieve the company of the liability for the maintenance of bridges, level crossings, fences, drains and other works, etc., and (3) that employees rendered redundant by the closing of the rail services would be compensated by the company on terms prescribed by the statutes.  In so far as the company's own sections of the railway system were concerned, the provisions of the Railways Act, 1933, were applicable, but this was not so in respect to the Letterkenny line.</P>
    <P>The Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company served notice on the Commissioners of Public Works terminating the working agreement of 1888; and the position then was that the company would cease to have any responsibility for the Letterkenny railway, while the Commissioners of Public Works would likewise have no responsibility, being merely mortgagees in possession, which they took of the property in 1887 in an endeavour to recover as much as possible of the debt due to them.  This debt, which amounted to £108,000 (including interest) at 30th June, 1953, had long since been regarded as irrecoverable. An order terminating the rail services on the Bridgend to Buncrana and the Tooban Junction to Farland Point sections would effectively close the rail <Col N="773" /> services on the Letterkenny line; but whereas the statutory obligations of maintenance and to redundant employees, and of providing substitute road services, to which I have referred, would remain with the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company, in so far as their own railways were concerned, no such obligations would attach to that company, or to any other body, in respect of the Letterkenny line.  It was in these circumstances that it was decided, in consultation between the commissioners and the Department of Industry and Commerce, to negotiate with the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company with a view to the sale to them of the Letterkenny railway property.</P>
    <P>The negotiations were opened on the 14th November, 1951, between representatives of the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Commissioners of Public Works and the railway company and were resumed on the 18th November, 1952, after the Transport Tribunal, to whom the matter of the closing of the lines had been referred by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for advice, had reported in favour of the company's proposal to close their own sections of the railway system and also in favour of the closing of the Letterkenny line.  The negotiations concluded on the 14th May, 1953 when it was agreed, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance, to convey the property to the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway Company for a consideration of £12,500.  That amount was agreed upon following (1) independent valuations by competent persons, made on behalf of the company, and the commissioners respectively, of the buildings and land, and (2) competitive quotations for rails, sleepers, poles and scrap metal, etc.  The figure agreed upon for these assets was £26,475; and the offsetting liabilities which the company, on purchase, would assume in respect of the obligations of maintenance and compensation to redundant employees to which I have referred were assessed at £13,975 on the basis of estimates of cost made, following inspection, of the maintenance of bridges, level crossings, <Col N="774" /> drains, culverts, etc., and of quotations obtained from insurance companies for the provision of annuities to cover the compensation to redundant employees.  The sale to the company on the terms indicated was sanctioned by the Minister for Finance on the 2nd June, 1953 and was finally completed on the 30th June, 1953.</P>
    <P>It is considered that this afforded the only practical and satisfactory solution of the problems and difficulties arising.  The offering of the property by public advertisement for sale in lots, apart from the grave doubt as to whether it was within the competence of the commissioners to take that course having regard to the provisions of the Railways Acts, would have left the problems of maintenance, compensation to redundant employees, etc., in the air.</P>

If this section of the railway line running from nowhere to nowhere which had come into the possession of the Board of Works as mortgagees in possession had been sold to the Lough Swilly Railway Company, no compensation would have been paid to the employees on the termination of the service nor provision made for the maintenance of the bridges and permanent way.  May I add that if anybody else wants to buy any old sections of railway line throughout the country, publicly or privately, I shall be glad to see him in my office?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the exercise of that discretion, Donegal County Council recently decided to fix at 5/- per week the allowance payable to certain single persons without dependents who are being treated and fully maintained free of charge in institutions at the council's expense.  The council also decided to fix at 5/- per week the allowance payable to a limited number of single persons undergoing treatment at home who are in receipt of National Health Insurance benefit of 24/- per week.  The total income of persons in that category is, therefore, 29/- per week, which is <Col N="776" /> the same as that of single persons without other income who are granted the maximum allowance of 29/- per week under the regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I moved the appropriate resolutions yesterday and gave some information concerning the changes in the amounts required under the various sub-heads of the Votes.  Then I proceeded to say that there had been a general improvement in the conditions as compared with last year, that the temporary trade recession which was experienced internationally in 1952 because of the liquidation of stocks which had been accumulated on the outbreak of the Korean war had ended, <Col N="791" /> and our records show that industrial production here is moving up again to new records.  While I say that our industrial expansion is proceeding, as some 68 new firms came to the notice of the Department as having begun business during the year which ended on 31st March last, and some 200 new proposals are at present before the Department, many of which, it may reasonably be expected, will result in the setting up of factories in the near future, that rate of progress is hardly sufficient to justify any feeling of complacency and, if we are to achieve the main objective of our industrial policy, some more substantial progress must be achieved.</P>
      <P>However, the all-round circumstances are now favourable for greater progress, particularly the improvement which has been effected in the balance of payments during the past year.  The improvement which was recorded in 1952 has continued into the present year.  The deficit on invisible trade, the excess of the value of imports over the value of exports to the end of August this year, is about £10,000,000 less than in the corresponding period of 1952, and about £50,000,000 less than in the corresponding period of 1951.  As the total deficit in our balance of payments last year was under £10,000,000, these statistics suggest that the position this year should be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said recently that from this on emphasis must be put in an increasing degree upon the development of export business in industrial goods wherever that is possible.  In many of our industries the stage of development to the point of supplying the whole of our home market requirements has been reached and continued expansion depends upon export markets being secured.  We have been giving a great deal of attention to that aspect of industrial policy during the present and past years.  Investigations have been carried out and the outcome of these investigations, together with the success which some enterprising Irish firms have already secured, suggests that an expanding export business in industrial goods is possible.  That result however requires <Col N="792" /> that firms seeking exports should regard it as a separate development of their business in most cases.  The styles and designs of Irish products, their packaging and marketing arrangements, will require to be adjusted to suit the requirements of the export market and it is clear that some assistance from the Government will be needed to get that started. That assistance is of course being provided under various enactments, but I do not think that we can regard the present degree of assistance as answering all the requirements of the situation and we are free to consider any other proposals or suggestions that may be made provided that they are practical and are likely to lead to worth-while results.</P>
    <P>Last year we had the inauguration of the Irish Pavilion at the Frankfurt Trade Fair and that represented a step towards developing increased industrial exports to Western Germany and the continental markets. Perhaps it is interesting to note that that step has already proved beneficial to a number of Irish firms.  The Pavilion was again utilised by these firms during the Spring and Autumn Fairs this year and considerable business was secured by Irish exporters.</P>
    <P>Apart from that special facility afforded for the purpose of directing the attention of Irish exporters to the possibility of the West German market, there is no special assistance at present being given to encourage firms in respect of any continental markets. The organisation which we set up to encourage exports, Córas Tráchtála, is at present confined in its operation to dollar markets.  Early this year, that organisation organised an exhibition of Irish goods at the Toronto Spring Fair.  That was regarded as successful.  A number of firms which participated in the exhibition secured substantial orders and are now showing a definite interest in the Canadian market and in the facilities provided at that particular fair.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of Córas Tráchtála, however, is to provide a general service for dollar exporters as well as <Col N="793" /> supplying them with information on market prospects, prevailing prices, suitability of their products and their packeting arrangements in relation to marketing needs, import restrictions, rates of customs duties in force, the transport facilities available and similar data of that kind.  The demands which have been made upon Córas Tráchtála for that type of information cover quite a wide range of products and indicate a general interest amongst Irish firms in the possibilities to which Córas Tráchtála is directing their attention.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that Córas Tráchtála employed an American expert team to survey the dollar export potentialities in certain selected industries. The relevant sections of that report were circulated some time ago to all the firms concerned and an abbreviated text of the report, excluding only those parts which deal with the affairs of individual firms, was published.</P>
    <P>It is true that the report did not encourage any hopes of speedy or spectacular results.  It was, however, published because it was believed that it was better to approach this problem of expanding industrial exports in a realistic spirit, fully aware of the improvements required in Irish production techniques as well as the changes in the style and designing of products which would be necessary before substantial business could be realised.</P>
    <P>It has not operated to discourage any of the firms concerned from exploring these market possibilities, but it has brought to their attention the need for making changes in respect of these matters to which I have referred before incurring trade promotion expenditures.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála have now opened offices in New York, Montreal and Chicago and, through these offices, they are providing information and similar services to Irish exporters as well as to their American agents.  The decision to open an office in Canada was taken following a prospective tour of that market carried out by Córas Tráchtála representatives which <Col N="794" /> showed that sales opportunities for our goods existed there and, indeed, to an extent which suggested that progress might be easier in the Canadian market than in the United States market, although it has to be recognised that the far greater size of the United States market makes it potentially the more important.  It is difficult to forecast at this stage the extent to which the services provided by Córas Tráchtála may need to be expanded in order to give to Irish firms engaged in the export business all the help they require.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that there is no objection in principle to expanding the help which Córas Tráchtála can give if it is clear that it is worth while doing so.  They have been entrusted with certain special tasks which bear upon their main activities.  They are at present undertaking special market surveys in relation to whiskey sales in the United States of America and are having consultations here with distilling and exporting firms with a view to seeing how increased export sales of whiskey can be secured.  Similar consultations are proceeding with the producers of other commodities, and in a few instances they have succeeded in getting firms here to combine in marketing a joint product which, through their joint efforts, could be made available in sufficiently large quantities to make an impression upon the American market.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The office in Chicago was opened for the same reason as the offices in the other centres in the belief that, through that office, contacts could be established with important business possibilities and help given to Irish firms to avail of these possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other aspect of the general industrial position to which, I am sure, the House will wish me to refer and that is the progress made by Foras Tionscal in encouraging the <Col N="795" /> development of new industrial concerns in the former congested area.  In that connection, some explanation may be required in regard to the amount asked for in the Estimate.  The grant proposed in the present year is £100,000, which is less than the £250,000 which appeared in the Estimate for 1952-53. Last year, of course, the figure put in the Estimate was arrived at by guesswork. There was no reliable data existing upon which to prepare a firmer Estimate and no real idea existed as to how the Undeveloped Areas Act would work out.</P>
    <P>In preparing that Estimate in 1952, sufficient allowance may not have been made for the delays which inevitably occur in the development of industrial projects, the preparation of plans and specifications, the acquisition of plant, the construction of premises and so forth.  According to the annual report furnished by Foras Tionscal, the actual payments made up to the 31st March of last year amount only to £31,000 but in the same period Foras Tionscal had approved projects involving grants by it to a total of £105,000.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in this year a number of new projects have been approved of by Foras Tionscal and the amounts of grants have been decided upon. The amount of assistance to be given to those undertaking developments has been made known to them but it is not known to what extent payments may arise in the present year.  It is assumed that in many cases the full amount of the grant decided upon will not have to be made by the 31st March next.  I think it will prove to be the case that the £100,000 provided for in the Estimate will cover the actual outgoings of Foras Tionscal during the financial year.  If that does not prove to be the case, a Supplementary Estimate will be taken.  There is certainly no desire to slow down, in any way, the developments which Foras Tionscal has approved, and if the need for additional funds for Foras Tionscal should arise it will be met.</P>
    <P>A number of new industries, some <Col N="796" /> of them important, have been either begun or are about to begin in some of these western towns.  Deputies will excuse me if I do not specify the individual concerns.  In so far as final decisions are made and announced, details of them are contained in the annual report of Foras Tionscal, but, in regard to cases which are in progress, there are always dangers in dealing here with the plans of private firms, and of course, there is always the possibility that circumstances may arise which may prevent a particular project from going ahead, and so it is better to avoid arousing hopes in any locality as to the possibility of industrial development there until the last element of chance has been eliminated. But the indications are that the rate of progress in industrial development in the West, in consequence of the passage here of the Undeveloped Areas Act, will be greater this year than last year, and may possibly expand still further next year.</P>

      <P>I can understand what the Minister has said and so I am not asking for the names of projects coming in, but could the Minister say if the proposals either put in or the proposals already approved are spread over all the counties in which there are undeveloped areas, or are they confined to one county?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that one of the drawbacks in regard to Foras Tionscal is the interpretation of the Act, which was passed in this House, by civil servants&mdash;that is to say they interpret it in this way, that an industrialist must prove a loss by going to the West of Ireland before he can get a grant.  When this House <Col N="797" /> passed the Act it was to be an enticement to those people to go to the West of Ireland instead of the present policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Act about that.  It was I who said here that the policy, in my view, should be to offset any commercial disadvantages arising from the location. I have had some discussions with the chairman of Foras Tionscal as to the interpretation of that policy, and I would agree with the Deputy that it is not nearly sufficient to strike an exact balance of advantages: that there should be, because of the general policy of the House in this regard, an inducement to adopt a western location if there are no very substantial objections on wider grounds to that course.  I have already said that I have been struck by the fact that quite a number of industrial concerns prefer to choose an eastern location and to forgo any assistance that might be forthcoming to them from Foras Tionscal for practical and commercial reasons.</P>
      <P>It is quite clear that there are some industries which, because of their characteristics, are not likely to be developed in the West at all and that no amount of help would induce them to go to the West; but there are a number of concerns, particularly those proposing to engage in branches of the textile industry, to whom a western location has no real disadvantage and to whom the inducement of the Undeveloped Areas Act is decisive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make some reference to the various organisations for which the Department of Industry and Commerce is responsible, and to do so without making my statement too long.  I want to make special reference to the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards, because I contemplate introducing legislation to amend the Act which was passed in 1946.  The Act setting up the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards provided for its financing by means of a fixed statutory grant of £15,000 a year but, having regard to the changes in money values which have taken place in the meantime, it is quite clear that that <Col N="798" /> amount is now altogether inadequate to enable the institute to do even a fraction of the work which we contemplated in 1946.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it never was.  I propose to avail of the opportunity of the amending legislation to effect some changes which have been found desirable in the Act, particularly in regard to standard specifications and standard marks.  The House is aware of my interest in the work of the institute in the preparation of standard specifications and of my desire to see Irish industrial firms using the standard mark to an increasing extent.  There are a number of Irish standard specifications now in force.  Also 38 standard mark Orders have been made during the past year.  The manufacturers of commodities for which standard specifications have been issued were contacted by my Department with a view to getting them to produce commodities in conformity with these specifications and to prove to the public that they were doing so by attaching the standard mark to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that the response to these representations has been disappointing, and one of the matters which I have under consideration in connection with the forthcoming legislation is what further steps can be taken to popularise the use of the standard mark? In a protected economy like ours, the danger of protection being utilised to put on the market goods which are not fully satisfactory in respect of quality must be recognised, and the best assurance which the public can have that a manufacturer is not availing of the help given to him by the Government to pass on inferior goods to the Irish public is to get standard specification Orders made for his goods and the use of the standard mark in connection with them.  Any manufacturer who adopts that course is protecting himself against any possible criticism in respect of the quality of his products. It is a matter for regret and comment that a larger number of Irish manufacturers have not adopted the standard <Col N="799" /> mark and secured the advantages which its use would confer on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that be due to opposition to the adoption of the mark or would it be just indifference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say it is more a matter of indifference and a dislike of accepting all the obligations involved in the use of the mark.  Of course, a manufacturer who uses the mark renders himself liable to prosecution if the goods bearing the mark are not up to the standard specification. Even though some manufacturers claim that their goods are of higher quality than those of standard specification, they have hesitated to use the mark on these goods because of the possibility of a few articles being inferior, thus leaving themselves open to the sanctions of the statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the way to make it really effective is to educate the public, the consumers, as to the significance of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>One way I hope to get that result is by securing, with the cooperation of ministerial colleagues, that where standard specifications have been made for any class of goods involved in a public contract, only goods bearing the standard mark may be supplied under that contract.  I think that would be the most effective means of all of getting use for the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act was passed during the year and the Fair Trade Commission was set up under it.  To meet the expenses of that commission the sum of £17,000 was included in the Estimate.  That Estimate is in a sense only a guess but I should think that it will prove to be reasonably accurate.  The Fair Trade Commission have reported to me that they have received a large number of applications from different trade organisations for the preparation of voluntary fair trading rules and that up to the present they have been mainly concerned with the consultations necessary to the preparation of these fair trading rules.  But there have been <Col N="800" /> other representations made to them which may involve public inquiries under the Act and some of these are likely to be held in the near future.</P>
    <P>One of the matters we discussed last year was the arrangements for the importation of tea.  I had hoped that changes in these arrangements would be operative by now but circumstances did not permit it.  Tea Importers Limited, therefore, continues to bear responsibility for importing all our tea requirements direct from the producing countries in accordance with Government policy in that regard.  The measures that might be taken to restore to the wholesale tea trade the greatest practicable measure of freedom to import their own supplies, subject to compliance with that policy of buying direct from origin, have been under examination in consultation with the Wholesale Tea Dealers' Association and the directors of Tea Importers Limited.  It was found to be both a difficult and complicated matter, not the least of the complications being the existence of reserve stocks built up some years ago.  It is hoped, however, that these consultations will result in the early preparation of a suitable scheme.  In fact it is now fairly clear that there is a considerable measure of agreement as to the form that scheme should take.  It is clear also that the adoption and operation of that scheme will involve legislation.  That being so no changes can be made in the present importing arrangements in the immediate future.  Tea Importers Limited will, therefore, continue to be the importing organisation for all our tea supplies.  However, I have in mind the possibility of getting legislation passed and the new scheme in operation before the next buying season opens which will be about June of next year.</P>
    <P>It may be interesting to note that the expectation held out that the withdrawal of subsidy on tea and the abolition of all rationing and other controls over its sale would result in the marketing of tea in a wide variety of prices, some of which would not be substantially above those prevailing when the subsidy was in operation has proved to be correct.  The consumption of tea has risen since the <Col N="801" /> abolition of rationing and is now probably above pre-war levels.  The variety of blends of tea on sale is considerable and includes blends available at retail prices ranging from as low as 3/6 per lb.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of policy that must come up for consideration in the early future concerns our price control arrangements.  At present price control is enforced under the Supplies and Services Act.  As I shall be informing the House when the Supplies and Services Bill is under consideration, the Government has taken the decision that that Bill will be the last to extend the Supplies and Services Act.  It is supposed to extend it up to March, 1955, but every Minister has been directed by the Government either to get rid of the controls which are still operating under the authority of the Supplies and Services Order before then or else to produce legislation to give him on a permanent basis the powers which he still wishes to retain.  So far as the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned, the most important of these powers is that of controlling prices, and it is clear that before March, 1955, we must have reached and given effect to decisions as to permanent price arrangements because the Supplies and Services Act will then have ceased to be operative.</P>
    <P>The Prices Advisory Body is still in existence.  It must be said, however, that they have not had a great deal of work to do.  Meetings are held infrequently and not very many cases are coming before them.  The stability of prices which has prevailed over the present year is, no doubt, responsible for that situation.  There is still a number of Orders fixing maximum retail prices or traders' profit margins in force.  There are now 44 such Orders in operation, but the number of occasions on which they come up for review is few.  That is one of the aspects of this question to which I am at present giving attention, but I have not yet made a decision.  The possibility of linking in whatever permanent price control arrangements are deemed necessary with other activities such as was contemplated in the <Col N="802" /> Industrial Prices and Efficiency Bill, 1947, is one of the matters to which attention is being given.  It is possible that in the meantime some alteration in the present interim arrangements will also be justifiable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the question of reviving the Prices Efficiency Bill under consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that if it is decided that some permanent organisation to supervise prices is required, then legislation for that purpose will have to be enacted next year. If it is agreed that prices are far more likely to be affected by costs than by profits and that any system of price control which is to be effective must include supervision of costs as well as profits, then something more than the old Prices Commission will be required. I think it is likely that the decision will be in accordance with that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to commit myself to that because that Bill was fairly wide in its scope and contained some provisions which were not directly relevant to that matter of price control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister contemplating a variant of that Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a very deep affection for that Bill.  There is a sum of £26,000 provided for continuing the mineral exploration scheme at Avoca. As the House will remember, it was necessary to take a Supplementary Vote of £58,500 during the course of the year and before the main Estimate came up to be debated.  That brings the total expenditure up to £85,000 in this year and that is the most that can be provided having regard to Section 5 of the Minerals Act of 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Supplementary Estimate was under discussion here, I explained fairly fully the stage which had been reached in that exploration scheme and I do not want to go over that ground again.  Mianraí Teoranta are proceeding with the exploration work and have <Col N="803" /> amended their proposals for the final stages of the work in accordance with the Government's direction that they should ensure that the maximum number of men with mining experience should be retained in their employment. The company will continue underground work at Avoca and at the same time initiate the diamond drilling programme from the surface to supplement the information which is being gained by the underground work.</P>
    <P>I cannot now state how much the full exploration scheme is going to cost or how long it will take to complete it.  The company was directed by the Government to submit a progress report before the Estimates for next year are prepared, and it is on the basis of that report the Government will decide further expenditure on the scheme.  It is clear, however, that we are now reaching the end of the exploration work in Avoca, and while the results to date justify a certain amount of optimism, they are not yet conclusive.  However, it is clear that within a matter of some months we will be taking decisions as to the commercial development of the mineral resources found to exist there.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty of a legal character arising in that connection. I mention Section 5 of the Minerals Act of 1947.  That Act fixed the total amount to be spent on that exploration scheme and the maximum amount that could be spent in any one year. So far as this year is concerned, £85,000, which is the maximum fixed by the Act, will be sufficient to meet the actual outgoings of Mianraí Teoranta on that work in this year, but by the end of the year we will have reached the limit fixed by the 1947 Act. I do not think it is worth while going through the procedure of passing amending legislation to provide whatever additional amount may be required to complete the scheme, which itself will only involve a matter of some months.  Instead, therefore, of providing for amending legislation I propose to ask the House to vote sufficient funds in the ordinary way to enable that work to be done without <Col N="804" /> any special legislative authority other than that which is provided by the Appropriation Act.</P>
    <P>Last year I asked the House to approve a Supplementary Estimate for £21,000 in respect of the Slieveardagh coalfield.  I said then that I would introduce a Bill later to regularise that payment in relation to the Minerals Acts.  Since then, as the House knows, the Ballingarry colliery, together with the lease of the Slieveardagh coalfield, has been sold to a private concern by Mianraí Teoranta.  The legal formalities connected with the sale have not yet been completed, but when they have I will bring before the Dáil proposals for the regularisation of the payments which were made to the company out of the Supplementary Vote and which were required to keep its activities going at that period.  I think that those Deputies who are familiar with the increase in activities which have taken place on that coalfield since the sale will agree with me that it was fortunate that we were able to find as a purchaser of that colliery the very enterprising firm which has taken it over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why were we not able to do it ourselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not advise the Deputy to raise that issue.  I am afraid that the experience of Ballingarry will be quoted from time to time as proof of the superiority of private over public enterprise.  That is certainly true as far as a competitive industry is concerned.  Our experience to date shows that if the State comes into a business it has to be the only person engaged in it so that standards of comparison will not be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced earlier this year the initiation of a scheme for the exploration of three mineralised areas in the country.  A certain sum of money was provided for the purpose of carrying out mineral exploration work and an expert consultant was asked to advise as to the three areas regarded as the most promising.  The expert consultant employed by the Department examined all the information available about the mineralised areas <Col N="805" /> in the country and made recommendations following that survey.  Based on his recommendations, I decided that exploration by way of drilling should be undertaken first on the lead and zinc deposits at Abbeytown, County Sligo.  These deposits, as the House is aware, are being worked commercially but there are indications that they are more extensive than was estimated originally.  It is these indications which are being followed up by the diamond drilling programme and so far expectations have been borne out, so much so that I have authorised an extension of the diamond drilling in that area.</P>
    <P>The second area chosen for exploration is Murvey in County Galway, where it is thought that deposits of molybdenite of commercial importance exist.  The third area to be investigated under that scheme has not yet been chosen.</P>
    <P>A Deputy had a question to-day about our coal reserves.  That is one of the matters that arise naturally in the debate on this Estimate.  Coal deliveries are, in theory at least, still subject to international allocation, while in fact no difficulties have been experienced during the course of the past year in obtaining adequate supplies. How long that situation is likely to continue is anybody's guess. Deputies will have seen recent announcements by the British Minister of Fuel and Power that stocks in Britain appear to be adequate to meet British needs over the winter&mdash;stocks which have been augmented to some extent by imports.  He also said that the continuation of exports of coal from Britain depended upon securing an increase in output.</P>
    <P>Our trading circumstances are such that the stocks of coal normally held by way of trade are not very substantial, and it is a matter of policy for decision whether it is necessary or desirable that the Government should continue to hold any reserve stocks of coal.  There are some who think we should rely entirely upon private trade to carry the stocks required from time to time; and there are others who feel that the effect on the country of any <Col N="806" /> cessation of coal deliveries, even a short one, would be so serious that some reserve against that risk should always be retained.  However, there is a stock of 286,000 tons of United States coal now held by Fuel Importers, Ltd.  That coal was purchased in 1951 when it seemed clear that continuing difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies from England were likely to be experienced.</P>
    <P>When, following certain discussions which took place in London early in 1952, an assurance of adequate deliveries from Britain was forthcoming, steps were taken to stop the purchase of American coal although the quantity in transit at the time had necessarily to be brought in.  I believe most Deputies would feel that 280,000 tons are more than enough to hold as an emergency reserve, even assuming that the principle of holding a reserve is agreed.  In any case, the Government's view is that we should liquidate some part of that stock and a decision has been taken to dispose of about 80,000 tons of it.  That does not preclude the possibility of a further decision to get rid of all of it, but there is a feeling that we should not be too expeditious in disposing of this stock until the future position is clear.</P>
    <P>The coal was purchased at a higher price than that at which coal is now available.  It has been accumulating charges, both interest and storage charges, since it went into stock, so that a loss on the sale of the coal is to be anticipated.  We are assuming that loss may be around £3 per ton.  The procedure for disposing of the coal, whether it will be offered to coal merchants for purchase by them or made available to anybody who wishes to purchase it at a stated price, is under consideration.  The coal is probably too good in quality to be used by the public utilities.  It is more suitable for domestic use.</P>
    <P>The much easier fuel situation which now exists has, of course, led to the need to restrict the special schemes for the production of turf by semi-automatic machines which Bord na Móna have operated for the past five years. That scheme, as the House knows, is entirely separate from the permanent <Col N="807" /> operations of the board under the Turf Development Acts.  It was undertaken at the request of the Government when emergency turf production by county councils and other local bodies ceased. The scheme was considerably reduced in scope in the present year.  It was continued only in areas where some special circumstances made it desirable to do so.  In this year bogs on which any difficulty had been experienced in securing local labour or where there was alternative employment available on the board's permanent schemes were excluded.  It may, I think, be assumed by the House that that scheme will end permanently this year.  Practically none of the turf which is produced by these semi-automatic machines is saleable except at a very heavy loss having regard to the price at which machine turf is available or hand-won can be supplied by local private producers.</P>
    <P>No provision is being made this year for the turf-marketing section of Bord na Móna.  Henceforth it will be a matter for the producers of hand-won turf for sale to make their own marketing arrangements.  We are now out of the emergency situation so far as fuel is concerned and it is better that we should get back to normal methods of working.  I would, however, urge fuel merchants and consumers requiring hand-won turf to make their requirements known to suppliers well in advance so as to ensure that sufficient quantities will be produced to meet all demands.  It is not necessary at present to stimulate private turf production beyond normal marketing needs and accordingly a guaranteed market for hand-won turf is not provided this year and the operations of the marketing section have, as I have said, come to an end.  No precise figures for hand-won turf production are available but it is estimated that the tonnage produced for sale runs between 200,000 tons and 250,000 tons in a normal year.</P>
    <P>The restoration of normal coal supplies during the past year brought about some difficulties for our anthracite producers and I had to take steps to curtail imports of anthracite.  Normally, there are no restrictions upon <Col N="808" /> coal imports, and the curtailment of imports of anthracite was effected by means of an arrangement with the National Coal Board in Britain and was adopted because our home producers were finding difficulty in disposing of their output due very largely to the high level of stocks accumulated by consumers and others during the threatened scarcity of 1951-1952.  Imports of anthracite have, therefore, been reduced to half what they were last year and, from the reports which are reaching me, it seems clear that the position in the anthracite collieries, which was causing some concern earlier in the year, has now been remedied.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to refer in any detail to the working of Bord na Móna, because I gave a fairly full review of its plans and progress when the Turf Development Act was before the House during last session.  It will, however, be necessary to introduce a Bill in the near future to make provision for the financing of the activities of the E.S.B., and on that Bill the board's activities can be discussed in detail.  I do not, therefore, propose to deal at any length with the board's work now because that further opportunity of discussing it more effectively will be available to the House.</P>
    <P>I want to say one last word about fuel.  Last year on this Estimate I referred to the tendency to convert industrial and other plants to the use of fuel oil to the detriment of total turf consumption.  That matter was pursued directly with a number of industrial concerns and also through the Departments of Health, Local Government and Education.  I am glad to say that in some cases at least a reversion to the use of native fuel has taken place.  I had to stand firmly by my announcement that I would not consider applications for State assistance from industries located in the turf areas where the use of turf as fuel would be shown to be economical and in quite a number of instances firms which might have qualified for some form of State assistance were refused it during the course of the year because they were not equipped or were not willing to equip themselves for the use of turf.  It is only by taking <Col N="809" /> a firm stand that we can get results.  It is not proposed to ask any industry, any institution or any similar concern requiring boiler fuel to use turf where it can be shown that there is any economy or any advantage, having regard to costs of operation, in using any other fuel.  In every case where it was necessary to refuse facilities it was possible to demonstrate that native turf fuel properly utilised with the right type of equipment would actually reduce costs and that in forgoing the opportunity to reduce costs the firm was acting contrary to its own commercial advantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the basis of objection after demonstration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Mainly that they had decided to purchase oil burning equipment and did not want to incur the additional expense of converting it to the use of turf.  I should say that nine times out of ten the objection was removed. In some cases they had to be convinced that economy was possible through the utilisation of turf.</P>
      <P>It will be noticed that the Estimate for Transport and Marine Services shows a decrease of £850,000, compared with last year.  The House is aware, however, that the financial position of C.I.E. continues to be a cause of concern.  A Supplementary Estimate for £1,100,000 had to be taken in February last, making the total provision for the 1952-53 financial year £2,400,000.  The provision for the present year is £1,500,000 and there is now fair reason to think that C.I.E. may be able to work within that figure.  That is due almost entirely, I think, to the reduction in fuel costs which occurred during the year and to the bringing into service of the new diesel railcars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government had before it the need for an increased subsidy last year it decided to direct C.I.E. to produce proposals for its reorganisation and re-equipment, such proposals to be of a character likely to lead to a position in which the amount required by way of subsidy from public funds would be progressively reduced until it <Col N="810" /> disappeared.  I received from C.I.E. its reorganisation proposals.  They involve the modernisation of rolling stock and the extensive use of diesel traction.  The total cost of the programme which C.I.E. has prepared is about £10,500,000.  I should, perhaps, make it clear that that is additional to the £2,500,000 which the board raised earlier this year.  Most of that expenditure is earmarked for new rolling stock.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated by the board that the net improvement in the revenue position as a result of that reorganisation and after allowing interest on the additional capital that has to be raised to make it possible will be in or about equivalent to the present losses. Because of the magnitude of the capital expenditure involved, that estimate of the board was not accepted without very careful investigation of the board's anticipated costs and savings and I may say that the investigation bore out the accuracy of the C.I.E. estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean it will be additional to the present loss of £1,500,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I am saying is that the improvement of the revenue position will, it is estimated, be equivalent to the present loss and therefore wipe out that loss, assuming other costs remain the same.  Before finalising proposals regarding the future of C.I.E., I, as the House knows, thought it well to solicit the views of the representatives of the trade unions who have members employed by the undertaking.  I asked these trade unions to set up a consultative council to prepare and submit to me their proposals for the improvement of the C.I.E. position whether these proposals did or did not involve legislation.  The terms of reference of the consultative committee which the trade unions formed were drawn as widely as possible and their report, which was submitted to me in July last, has since been published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reorganisation proposals of C.I.E. and the recommendations of the <Col N="811" /> Trade Union Consultative Committee are now being examined in detail with a view to submitting to the Dáil proposals for legislation to give effect to the Government's decisions regarding them.  The legislation will, I hope, be available to the House, if not in this session, then early in the next session.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that the negotiations for the establishment of a joint board to operate the G.N.R. undertaking reached satisfactory conclusions and the new board came into operation in September last.  A Supplementary Estimate has been circulated and is being taken with this Estimate.  That Supplementary Estimate is partly required by reason of the fact that the money made available under the main Estimate is for payments to the G.N.R.  Company; it is not possible to use the balance left available to make payment to the board.  It is as simple as that&mdash;merely to extend the authority which the Dáil has given to make payments to the company to cover payments made to the new board.  In fact, however, it is also necessary because of an anticipated increase in the losses incurred by the G.N.R. undertaking during the present year.  The estimate of losses upon which the figure in the book was based was prepared in January last.  It is clear, however, to date, that the losses are likely to be higher than was then assumed and consequently some additional payment will be made.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that I told them that under the provisions of the Great Northern Railway Act and the agreement which was scheduled to that Act a scheme is to be prepared for the apportionment between the two areas of the profits or losses of the undertaking.  The responsibility for preparing that scheme rests in the first instance on the board of the undertaking. The scheme has not yet been submitted for approval and consequently it is necessary for the purpose of this Supplementary Estimate to assume that our share of the estimated losses of the undertaking will be calculated on the same basis as that adopted prior to the agreement, up to 30th August last.  On that basis, an <Col N="812" /> apportionment of the estimated losses shows that a sum of £310,000 falls to be met by this House and, as the balance remaining in the sub-head amounts only to £124,000 the net amount to be provided under the Supplementary Estimate is £186,000.</P>
    <P>If it should turn out that payments made to the company before the transfer of the undertaking to the board were in excess of the actual losses accruing up to the date of the transfer, then a credit against that sum may be available.</P>
    <P>There is a provision in the Estimate for £541,000 for improvement works at harbours.  That provision represents a substantial increase on the amount actually expended upon harbour works in the previous year.  During the previous financial year, works towards which State grants had been made were in progress at Arklow, Ballina, Cork, Dublin, Rathmullen and Fenit, while the works at Killybegs and Sligo were completed.  Preliminary arrangements were also made at a number of other harbours for carrying out works for which State grants had been approved.  It may be of interest to the Dáil to know that since it was decided, in 1946, to adopt the principle of making State financial grants available for harbour improvement works&mdash;and that was decided solely as a special measure intended to deal with difficulties that had emerged from the war&mdash;improvement schemes have been carried out at 20 harbours, and the total cost of these schemes to date is over £5,000,000, towards which State grants of nearly £2,500,000 have been made.</P>
    <P>In some cases these harbour works could not have been made possible at all if local authorities had not given valuable help generally by means of guaranteeing loans raised by harbour authorities for improvement works. It is, I think, desirable that in all cases local authorities should show their confidence in the future of the harbours in their areas by assisting in the financing of their improvement in that particular way.  At the present time there are proposals from seven harbour authorities before me which involve substantial expenditure and which contemplate heavy State subventions. <Col N="813" /> However, in some cases at least the adoption of these proposals will be dependent upon the local authorities agreeing to carry some part of the risk involved.</P>
    <P>The expansion of our merchant shipping fleet is Government policy, and in consequence of that Irish Shipping Ltd. has placed orders for approximately 40,000 tons of new shipping.  Some of these are due for delivery in 1956 and some in 1957.  One oil tanker of 3,000 tons is due for delivery next year. There is one dry cargo vessel of 9,000 tons also due for delivery in the near future.  An additional collier of 1,400 tons is also being built.  The existing collier was placed on charter to C.I.E. for the cross-Channel coal trade. When the new vessels have been delivered the Irish Shipping fleet will total 118,000 tons.  Deputies will, no doubt, have been pleased to note that Irish Shipping Ltd. made a profit on their recent year of operation notwithstanding some difficulties prevailing during the period, and I hope that that situation will continue, because it will, of course, facilitate the process of financing the new building programme, which is estimated to cost about £6,250,000.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps worth mentioning that the first large ship to be built in this State since 1937, that is the new vessel, the <i>Isolde</i>, built for the Irish Lights Commissioners, was completed at a Dublin dockyard during the year. Everybody concerned and in a position to offer expert opinion paid tribute to the workmanship and finish of that ship, which was stated to be of high quality and a credit to the Irish craftsmen.  It is a splendid advertisement for the capacity of Dublin ship building, and I hope that it will lead to increased business in our yards.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Aviation and Aeronautical Services shows a decrease on last year.  Aer Lingus continues to expand their business.  There was an increase of 9 per cent. in the passengers carried in the year which ended March last, but in that year there was some slight reduction in the number of flights.  Unfortunately, the operations concerned did not produce <Col N="814" /> a profit.  There was, in fact, a loss from the company's operation of £83,813 and it is possible that that loss may be repeated in the present year. It is, however, a measure of the company's confidence in the future that, instead of looking for subsidies from the Exchequer to cover that loss, they have decided to carry it forward in their accounts in the hope of wiping it out by future profits.</P>
    <P>One of the most remarkable developments so far as civil aviation is concerned was the increase in traffic at Shannon Airport which occurred during the year.  There was a substantial increase in both the number of aircraft landings and in the number of passengers passing through Shannon in 1952 and that increase has been repeated in the present year to date. Shannon Airport is, however, still operated at a loss in the sense that the total revenue received from the airport services is less than the total expenditure involved in providing those services but, of course, it is necessary to take into account, before any fair picture can be drawn, the many indirect benefits which result from the existence of the airport and which it is not always possible to evaluate in terms of money.</P>
    <P>The House will remember that last year I got a Supplementary Estimate to provide funds in connection with an arrangement then in contemplation for the operation of a transatlantic service by Aer Linte in partnership with an American company called Seaboard and Western Airlines.  The agreement between Aer Linte and Seaboard and Western Airlines contemplated the leasing of aircraft from Seaboard and Western for an initial period of about 3½ years.  It was contemplated that at the end of the 3½ years' experimental period it would be open to Aer Linte to assess the prospects of the service more accurately and to decide if those prospects seemed good enough to operate it with its own aircraft.  It was considered for a number of reasons that that service should begin in 1953. However, under the practice of the United States, the sanction of the United States Civil Aeronautics Corps was required for that proposed service. The decision of the Civil Aeronautics <Col N="815" /> Corps was considerably delayed.  That may have been due to the fact that there was a change of Government in the United States about that time, or possibly through pressure of business on the board, but it was not given until January, 1953, and at that date it was clearly impracticable to attempt to begin to operate the service in this year.  Further than that, the Civil Aeronautics Board decided to impose a limit of two years on the operation of the arrangement.  The delay in giving the decision made it impossible to commence the service in 1953, and the two years' limitation made it, in our view, impossible to commence it at all, because it was contemplated that the service would probably lose money in the first two years of its existence but could hope to recover those losses if continued over a longer period.  Nobody would undertake the risk of offering a service limited to a life of two years.  Consequently, the whole project was abandoned.  The future possibilities in regard to transatlantic operation are again under consideration by the Government, but it may now be assumed that the arrangement contemplated for operation in the present year will not proceed.</P>
    <P>I informed the House in November last that the Government had decided to establish an airport in Cork with a view to the operation of scheduled air services from that city.  A very detailed technical examination was required so as to enable decisions to be made as to the location, character and cost of a suitable airport there.  A number of reports were received on various sites in County Cork.  The information which was acquired as a result of these investigations is now being embodied in a report which will be submitted to the Government.  The decision to establish an airport in Cork has been taken.  The only questions remaining open for further consideration are where it is to be and the exact form it is to take.</P>
    <P>Further expenditure will be necessary during the course of the year both at Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport which are now too small to handle the increased number of passengers using <Col N="816" /> them.  Therefore, extensions of the passenger-handling facilities at both airports are under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Tourist Traffic Act was passed last year.  An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte&mdash;organisations set up under that Act&mdash;have been functioning.  The Act provided that An Bord Fáilte should be paid a grant not exceeding £250,000 in any one year.  Since then, the board has been extending its organisation and preparing its plans generally and getting itself in a position to fulfil the task given to it to do under the Act. It has not, however, made as much progress as we might have expected. In the present financial year a provision of £140,000 will be required by the board.  I have caused representations to be made to the board with a view to having it consider what measures it should take to expand its rate of progress and to get ahead more speedily with the fulfilment of the task entrusted to it.  I think the House is aware of the importance which should rightly be attached to the development of the tourist trade and we cannot afford to proceed with plans for it on too leisurely a basis.  However, a new grading scheme for hotels was prepared by the board, after consultation with the industry, and has been put into operation this year.  A scheme for guaranteed loans for the construction, extension and improvement of hotels was introduced in December last and, in fact, a number of applications for guarantees under that scheme have already been granted.</P>
    <P>Steps are being taken to promote the formation of local development companies at tourist resorts and a scheme of guaranteed loans for resort development has also been announced by the board.  The importance of promoting local enterprise of that kind in the development of holiday resorts will be obvious.  I trust that the facilities which will be available to the local companies under the board's scheme will be used.  That Act also empowered the board to protect historical places, sites and shrines; to provide access to places of special interest, and to provide notices and signs appropriate to such places.  The board tell me that they have been in consultation <Col N="817" /> with the various other authorities interested&mdash;the Commissioners of Public Works and the National Monuments Advisory Committee&mdash;and have prepared plans of certain historical places such as Tara, Clonmacnoise and Cashel.  I hope that next year it will be possible to record a considerable increase in activity by the board under that head.  Plans for the better sign-posting of roads are also being made and are now being proceeded with.</P>
    <P>The Act provided for a similar grant of £250,000 to Fógra Fáilte, which is the publicity organisation, and it is estimated that a sum of approximately £235,000 will be required to meet the expenditure of Fógra Fáilte during the present year.  The adequate discharge of publicity functions demands the operation of a comprehensive and continuous publicity campaign.  The amount which we can afford to provide for that purpose is small in comparison with the expenditure of other countries but I think it is well spent and that a considerable measure of success has been achieved.  Fógra Fáilte made arrangements for the direction of tourist bureaux both at home and abroad and negotiated an agreement with the Tourist Association for the management by it of the tourist bureaux in this country.</P>
    <P>There are some matters which I know Deputies are interested in and to which I have not referred, but it would take me too long to deal with them in any comprehensive way now. Perhaps I should mention one further matter because I know that I will be asked about it and that it is better to explain the position now than to have it misunderstood during the course of the debate.  A special arrangement had to be made a couple of years ago to secure the liquidation of a debt due by the Irish tanners to the carcase meat exporters.  Under that arrangement &mdash; which had its origins in the time of the previous Government&mdash;certain payments were due to the exporters of carcase meat, payments which were designed to compensate them for the fact that the price of hides abroad was higher than the price at home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> When the price of hides abroad fell &mdash;as they did fall very substantially&mdash; a very difficult situation arose and, in fact, no payments were made until a substantial debt was accumulated. Arrangements were made to liquidate that debt.  A company was formed called Associated Irish Tanners, Ltd. They borrowed money from the bank, paid the amount due to the carcase meat exporters, and then proceeded to recover the amount due to the bank by a levy upon the hides purchased by their own members.  That arrangement has continued in existence since then and it will be necessary to continue it until some date in the middle of next year.  The proceeds of the levy have not yet liquidated the debt due to the banks, and until that debt is liquidated the present controls will have to be maintained.  I have already indicated that it is my intention that when that debt has been discharged the existing system of controlling the prices and the export of hides and skins will be reexamined. I know that some Deputies have misunderstood that arrangement. It is one that I certainly would never have liked to bring about, and it is one that I am anxious to get rid of as quickly as possible.  However, there is no way by which the debt which the tanning industry has acquired&mdash;whether or not they should ever have been saddled with it is another question, but they have the debt&mdash;can be discharged except in that particular manner.  The sooner the situation can be cleared up by collecting enough from the levy to clear off the debt, the sooner I will be pleased and the sooner the industry can be removed from a variety of Government restrictions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has been asking questions about the export policy of certain Irish firms who are selling their products abroad at lower prices than prevail at home.  I have tried to explain to him that the prices charged for the goods concerned at home are regarded as reasonable, in relation to their cost of production, by the Prices Advisory Body.  It is quite clear that goods can only be sold abroad at the market prices prevailing abroad, but if a sufficient volume of business can be built up, export sales, even at lower prices, can help to bring down <Col N="819" /> and keep down the cost of commodities at home.  In the particular case to which Deputy Dillon refers, it is quite clear to me, from my examination of the position, that if export sales ceased, the cost of the goods in the home market would have to go up because the lower output would increase the cost of their production.  We cannot hope to develop export sales on any other basis than getting for our goods the prices prevailing in export markets.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual for industrial firms in every country to develop export markets from time to time by making their goods available in them at prices which they could not maintain for a long period, prices lower than they would normally seek to recover their costs and overhead expenses; but in case there should be any misunderstanding of the position affecting the particular firm concerned, a misunderstanding which perhaps might lead to action against their exports under the trade agreement of 1938, I want to make it quite clear that there is no suggestion whatever that they are subsidising exports from home market prices and that the prices at which they are selling abroad are the highest prices they can get abroad.  If they can get increased prices for these goods outside the country, there will be nobody better pleased than they.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. The procedure of discussing Estimates at this time of the year is unsatisfactory from the point of view of having a proper discussion on the results of the previous year and comparing the figures for the previous year with the prospects for the current year, but a situation has developed here in which business has got into arrears, and I suppose there is no alternative to discussing Estimates whenever it is possible to get them considered by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the results contained in various publications published by different Government Departments, as well as the statistics available, show that it is time to consider what has <Col N="820" /> been achieved in the industrial sphere. Looking back over the results for, say, the past 30 years, a considerable amount has been achieved.  Progress in many directions has been made and, in other directions, maintained, but the overall picture requires definite examination in order to see whether the results that have been achieved and the progress that has been made justify the co-operative complacency which sometimes appears in statements by the Ministers and which is shown by a cursory glance at the statistics for industrial employment, as well as the figures for new industries.</P>
    <P>If the figures are examined, it is apparent that, although there has been a substantial rise, from something over 100,000 persons in insurable industrial employment in 1926, when the first census was taken, to something approximating to 220,000 persons in 1951-52, and although that figure is itself satisfactory, when account is taken of the large numbers who have left employment on the land, it is true to say that those who have been absorbed into industrial employment no more than compensate for the large numbers who have left work on the land.  In fact, the only compensatory feature from an employment point of view is that if the industrial expansion had not proceeded as rapidly as it has, a much larger number would have been obliged to seek work elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, many other advantages from the point of view of trade and from the point of view of the general economic strength of the country in that we have produced here, as a result of the expansion of industry, goods which we formerly imported or goods which we imported to a greater extent; but the position which has developed shows that there has been very little real progress in the sense of providing employment here for the large number each year who reach employable age, because the majority of those people reaching employable age each year seek employment either locally or in our cities and towns, and those who fail to find it emigrate.  The emigration figures, I believe, prove that the trend which has manifested itself over the years has <Col N="821" /> continued in this year and, with a few exceptions in odd years, the numbers emigrating show little tendency towards abatement or substantial reduction.</P>
    <P>When the Industrial Development Authority was established, one of its functions was to examine the effect of protection on industrial development, to ascertain what had been achieved and inquire into what prospects there were of further development or what prospects might be available if certain proposals were adopted.  I believe that, since the alteration in the work of the Industrial Development Authority, no body is charged with that responsibility, and I think it is correct to say that some body, other than the Dáil or Seanad, should inquire into the effect of protection in order to ascertain what has happened and in order to get a general picture, so that the House and the country may have available up-to-date information on the results of protection in particular industries.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to get a complete survey in a short period or a complete survey over the whole field, but, selecting at intervals particular industries, it ought to be possible to get a picture of the effect of protection, the long term prospects before these industries and the incidence of costs and other matters which affect those industries, or which affect consumers or customers who buy in the case of certain industries and who are obliged to pay higher charges because of any assistance which is provided here. That position, if it were examined, would, I believe, reveal information on which it would be possible to assess the future policy which should be adopted and from which useful particulars could be presented to Deputies and to the country as to the effects in various spheres of the industrial expansion.  The Industrial Development Authority is, I understand, now solely confined to an examination of new industrial projects, to assisting the establishment of new projects or the extension of existing projects.  It was certainly understood when that body was established, that while engaged in that particular aspect of <Col N="822" /> the work, it would take into account and examine other matters such as those to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the course of his speech referred to the fact that the Prices Advisory Body was still in existence.  It seems strange that he had to give that assurance to the House.  I had, as one of the matters which I intended to raise on this Estimate, a note to inquire as to what had happened the Prices Advisory Body, had it ceased to function or had it been shorn of its activities, because it is functioning nominally but not effectively and is doing nothing to operate an efficient system of price control. It is, I think, well to remind the House that one of the published terms of the present Government's programme, immediately prior to its advent to office, was to operate an effective system of price control and, incidentally, to maintain food subsidies.  Since then the cost of living in this country has reached the highest level ever known.</P>
    <P>It is true that there was an insignificant drop in the figures for August last of one point.  Is the Prices Advisory Body to be superseded or replaced by some permanent body set up under legislation in the future, or is it to be assumed that its days are numbered?  I believe there is still useful work before it if it is allowed to function effectively and if the general picture of prices, costs and so forth, is placed before it or even if specific cases are referred to it for examination.  When the Prices Advisory Body examined particular cases referred to it either in public or in private, in some cases the public, if they did not get a reduction, at any rate got reasons for the high cost of the commodities in question.  In other cases, they were fortunate enough to get a small reduction and, in one particular instance that comes to mind, a substantial reduction was effected as the result of an inquiry by the Prices Advisory Body.  This year has shown that import prices in almost all countries have fallen and, as a result of the fall in import prices, the cost of living in a number of <Col N="823" /> countries showed a reduction as well. In some cases there was a small increase.</P>
    <P>Recently the O.E.E.C. published the result of a survey carried out by that organisation for the Council of Europe.  That survey showed, for a number of member countries, the position in regard to the cost of living for the first six months of 1953 and for the first six months of 1952.  It is significant that the biggest rise in the cost of living of any of the member countries as published in that report occurred in Ireland.  The figures in that report on page 12 show that for the first six months of 1953 as compared with the first six months of last year, the cost of living had risen in this country by plus nine, or nine points.  Norway and Britain were the two countries, next to Ireland, in which the largest rise occurred and they showed an increase of four points.  In some countries there was a small reduction and in some others the change was negligible.  But the two countries that showed the largest increase in the cost of living other than this country were Britain and Norway, each of which showed an increase of four points.  In this country during the first six months of this year there was a rise of nine points.  We know that the figures published recently for the August indices have shown a drop of one point.  In that situation, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs recently described 1953 as being the best year ever.  In what way the description &ldquo;the best year ever&rdquo; was intended to apply, it is difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>Pending the dissolution or the death of the Prices Advisory Body, and in order that some effort may be made to implement the undertaking given in the programme published by the Government before it was elected, I would suggest that a number of categories of foodstuffs or a number of commodities should be referred to that body for examination.  Even if it may not be possible to get a reduction in prices, at any rate the public will be afforded, <Col N="824" /> by a careful examination by that body and by the report which will be published afterwards, reasons which will enable them to decide what are the factors which are responsible for the rise in the cost of living in the first six months of this year, a rise which surpasses that of any other member-country of the O.E.E.C. and which brought the cost of living to the highest level we have seen since figures were first compiled for the country.</P>
    <P>That high cost of living has had its effect not merely on those people who are in employment but has pressed even more heavily on those who are seeking work.  The whole aim of industrial development, as well as to provide the goods we require, is to provide employment.  Despite the claim which the Minister made that the trade recession has passed, I think anyone who is familiar with the conditions in at least one trade will agree that there is as great a recession, if not a greater recession, in the building industry at the present time than at any time in recent years.  There are fewer people employed at present, according to the figures published by the Central Statistics Office, on house building and construction than in any recent year, either in the immediate past years or in the years since the war ended and the industry got going again when supplies became available. The latest figures show that there are approximately 7,000 operatives, including skilled and unskilled, employed as against 12,000 or 13,000 in the same industry within the last two years. That recession in the building industry has been reflected in a general recession throughout the City of Dublin and in many parts of the country as well.</P>
    <P>As far as the recession in building is concerned, the main effect of it has been felt in Dublin.  There is a paper reduction in the figures on the unemployment register&mdash;and I use the words &ldquo;paper reduction&rdquo; advisedly&mdash;but it is a matter of comment that only this week I saw Gardaí controlling the traffic outside the labour exchanges so great was the queue of those wishing to register.  It is significant in the light of that set of circumstances that any claim can be made that the trade <Col N="825" /> recession has passed.  It is true that it has eased for some businesses.  Some businesses have found conditions easier.  Some of the stocks that were accumulated in the past have been disposed of and more normal conditions appear to be returning.  But as far as the building workers are concerned, and from the point of view of the City of Dublin the building industry is one of the most important if not the most important industry, the effects not only on those directly employed but indirectly on business and trade have been considerable.</P>
    <P>The situation is such that not merely is there no ground for complacency, but I believe the large numbers seeking work, the large numbers registering, according to the published figures of the Department of Social Welfare or the Central Statistics Office, must give the House and the country cause for the gravest concern.  If the trend as shown by the numbers employed in the building industry continues, then the situation which has developed over the last couple of years will have serious repercussions not only on those directly concerned but throughout this city and the other cities and towns where a similar situation has developed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the establishment of Córas Tráchtála and to the reports of the American experts who visited this country and who examined the prospect of increasing exports to the dollar area.  If there is one matter which has been the subject of careful examination it is the possibility of extending and developing our trade to the dollar area.  The reports which were published and which have been circulated by Córas Tráchtála referred to a number of factors and to the difficulties which confront manufacturers in this country and exporters to the United States as well as the problem of maintaining supplies of goods which are already sold there in small quantities.</P>
    <P>What I think the House would like to find out is to what extent industrial concerns in this country have benefited by or paid attention to the reports as affecting their particular <Col N="826" /> concerns.  It is entirely within the choice of any industrial concern whether they decide to sell in the dollar area or not.  But I think that in the case of the concerns which enjoy the benefit of protection and which get from the State any assistance by way of tariff or quota or are in any other way beholden to the State for help and assistance, where an examination has taken place either by officers of Córas Tráchtála or by any of the team of experts who have visited this country and carried out an investigation under the auspices of that body, they should be required to furnish to the Department of Industry and Commerce the reasons why they are not making greater efforts to sell in the dollar area or, if they find particular difficulties, what these difficulties are.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that a number of bodies and organisations and individual firms which have endeavoured to get into the American market have gone to Córas Tráchtála and have benefited by the advice given.  But as the team of experts commented on the fact that it was possible for this country to sell $1,000,000 worth annually of woollen and worsted goods on what was taken to be a conservative estimate, then I believe that the concerns which enjoy any measure of protection here should be required to furnish the Department of Finance an explanation, or reasons if they find difficulty, for not extending their sales to the dollar area.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory to note that in some commodities a substantial improvement has taken place and that exports have been developed.  I note particularly that according to the September issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i>, whiskey is one of the commodities that shows prospects of increased exports.  In that connection, I think it is not generally understood that distillers have particular problems which other concerns are not obliged to face.  They have the problem that when a distilling programme is undertaken in any particular year the whiskey will not be sold that year or the next year, but that in five or seven years' time a particular quantity <Col N="827" /> distilled will be sold either on the home or the export market.</P>
    <P>They have to take into account the effect of taxation in the home market as well as the prospects abroad.  I believe it would be informative to get a statement from the distilling industry as to the effect the heavy rate of taxation at home has on the distilling programme.  There is no doubt that, while the export trade and home trade are entirely different from the point of view of price, the effect of the present high rate of taxation and the substantial drop in consumption, if it continues, must provide problems for the industry which no incentives from the point of view of offering facilities can affect if the high rate of taxation continues and if no accurate estimate of the future trend is available to them.</P>
    <P>I believe that for a variety of commodities we have good prospects in the dollar area if we avail of the facilities, if the quality of the goods measures up to the samples initially sent abroad, and if the production is adequate to the demand.  In a great number of cases these different reports refer to the fact that initial consignments sent abroad were excellent but that when additional consignments were ordered either the quality was not up to standard or the volume of production was not adequate to the demand.  That situation is one which only the manufacturers can remedy themselves.  If it is brought home to them that it is in their own interests as well as in the interests of the country, then we can maintain the market which has already been secured for some commodities and extend the others.</P>
    <P>I should like to have from the Minister, when he is concluding, some account of his visit to the United States and Canada and what he considers are the prospects for a further extension of goods to the dollar area and what the general picture of trade may be for our exporters who wish to develop trade there.</P>
    <P>The establishment last year of two bodies to manage the tourist industry, was, in our view, unnecessary overlapping. I do not think that anything has <Col N="828" /> happened since the bodies were set up last year which would bring us to alter that view or bring anyone who examines the position to alter that view.  The most recent figures show the tourist trade is either static or shows a slight decline.  The year 1952 shows that, although there were probably more tourists or visitors here than in the previous year, the expenditure declined by almost £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>The figures for this year, so far as it is possible to assess from reports, would indicate that there is no substantial improvement.  I believe that there is a great deal of unnecessary overlapping and duplication.  It is not within the rules of order to discuss here any alterations in the legislation but certainly nobody can be satisfied with the publicity arrangements which were made in connection with An Tóstal last April.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I think it is well that serious consideration should be given, between now and the opening of An Tóstal next year, to an altered date for the future.  I know that this matter has been the subject of considerable discussion between the Department of Industry and Commerce, An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte.  In addition, numerous references have been made to it by local organisations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>While one view may be on the basis of local requirements and tradition, the Department, An Bord Fáilte and Fógra Fáilte have to take into account the avowed object of An Tóstal which was to extend the tourist season.  It was initially undertaken, I think, at the behest of the experts who came here from America and examined the whole tourist trade.  Initially, it was to be held around St. Patrick's Day in order to attract visitors of Irish extraction who would come here in order to celebrate the national festival.  This year it was undertaken during the Easter season and, because of the gap between Easter and the beginning of the normal tourist season, a great number of people considered that it was undertaken too soon.</P>
    <P>The results next year may give a better estimate on which to base the decision to run An Tóstal during future years but certainly the decision <Col N="829" /> taken this year before An Tóstal had ended to run next year's An Tóstal without any proper assessment of the results which had been achieved was, I believe, taken without due consideration of the factors involved.</P>
    <P>A number of hoteliers have remarked to me that if An Tóstal could be undertaken immediately prior to the normal tourist season some extension of the season might flow from it.  The general impression appears to be that because it was taken this year at Eastertime and because Easter was fairly early there was too wide a gap between the ending of An Tóstal and the beginning of the normal tourist season.  Certainly, the whole question requires careful consideration and, if possible, the harmonising of conflicting views.</P>
    <P>The publicity arrangements which were undertaken this year in many parts of the Continent and the United States were entirely inadequate and were undertaken far too late to have any effective result.  Many people who came from abroad expressed the view that they saw, except in one or two cases, very little about the arrangements for An Tóstal and very little which would indicate to them that this country was making a serious effort to attract a larger number of tourists.</P>
    <P>The figures appear to indicate that, despite the efforts that have been made, there has been no substantial increase in the number of tourists. There may have been special circumstances this year because of the Coronation in Britain which attracted tourists from America who would normally have come here.  If that is a reason for the lack of any substantial improvement, then it may be understandable. But so far as it is possible to gauge the position, no substantial improvement has taken place in the number of visitors being attracted to this country by the amenities we offer and by the prospects of an enjoyable holiday here.</P>
    <P>I believe that the new grading system which is being operated by An Bord Fáilte should enable people to get a better picture of the facilities which are available in Irish hotels and <Col N="830" /> will generally give a better picture from the point of view of the various organisations in this country to assess the facilities which are available.  In addition, it will provide proper standards which visitors and even people from this country enjoying holidays at home may expect to get.</P>
    <P>In that connection, the loan facilities which are provided under the legislation could be availed of to a far greater extent by hoteliers.  I believe it would pay hoteliers themselves to avail of these facilities.  It is satisfactory to know that some loans have already been made and many hoteliers are showing their willingness to make improvements in order to attract tourists to the country or get greater business for themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that it was proposed to bring in amending legislation in connection with mineral development.  As I understand the position, the present prospecting programme in Avoca will shortly come to an end and the money provided will either be exhausted or exceeded in the near future.  I think that, before further legislation is undertaken, the House should be given a more comprehensive picture of the position.</P>
    <P>The initial reports of the prospecting work which had been undertaken there held out fairly optimistic prospects. The money which was provided over the last few years enabled continuous work to be carried on, and it was anticipated that by now sufficient data would be available on which to base a permanent programme for the future.  Certainly, before amending legislation is introduced, the House should be given more information, and facilities should be provided for a full examination of the position. I hope that the reasonably optimistic prospects that were held out some time ago, of a long time development in Avoca, have not been lessened by recent discoveries or results there.</P>
    <P>The most significant feature of our trade in the past year has been the reduction in the balance of payments deficit.  That reduction has also brought about a change which is worthy of comment.  Last year, of our <Col N="831" /> total exports over 86 per cent. went to Britain and the Six Counties as against 84 per cent. in the previous year.  That figure shows, despite the efforts that have been made to secure alternative markets and despite the various trade agreements which have been negotiated over the last few years that, if anything, our dependency on our nearest neighbour for the bulk of our exports appears to have increased rather than diminished.</P>
    <P>The figure is significant from many points of view, but especially because of the fact that a substantial proportion of our exports are of agricultural origin.  The Minister for Agriculture, in reply to a recent parliamentary question, referred to the fact that, before the British Ministry of Food is disbanded, or handed back to private enterprise for the buying of food, consultations will take place between the Government, or his Department, and the appropriate Departments at the other side.  I hope that as long notice as possible of that decision will be given to Irish exporters.  Mention has been made in articles in the British Press, as well as in statements in the House of Commons, of the intention to wind up the Ministry of Food this year.  What effect that will have on prices, on marketing conditions and on our pattern of trade is a matter of speculation, but it is reasonable to assume that some results will flow from it.  The longer the notice that our people, particularly our exporters and those interested in the live-stock trade, can get of that decision the better it will be so as to enable them to base their immediate plans and aims.  It is to be hoped that the Government will give adequate notice of the proposed decision in so far as it is possible for them to do so.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates this year, there is a reduction of over £2,000,000 in the sum required to subsidise flour and wheaten meal.  I wonder if the Minister can say whether that reduction is due to a reduction in the price of imported wheat?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the total reduction in respect of all food subsidies, but in fact the cost of subsidising flour <Col N="832" /> and bread is somewhat up this year. I should have mentioned that it may mean a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>The Minister, in his concluding remarks, referred to the reserve stocks of coal, and to the fact that it will be necessary to provide a sum in the Estimate for fuel subsidies. The circumstances in which that coal was imported were briefly referred to. It was imported, mainly, during the rush to buy in stocks after the Korean war started.  It is always a matter of opinion as to what may or may not be an adequate stock to provide a reserve against future contingencies.  It is significant that recently the British Ministry of Fuel and Power made an announcement to the effect that it expected that coal supplies this year would be adequate to meet demands. In that connection, I do not know whether it would be worth while trying again to get from the British a reduction in the differential that exists in the export price of coal compared to the price at which it is sold on the home market.</P>
      <P>Since the war ended, we have made repeated representations to the effect that the price differential was unfair to us, and although no reference to price was made in the 1938 Agreement, the differential has operated to the detriment of consumers in this country.  It has raised costs on domestic consumers as well as on industrial concerns, and I believe that we should continue to press the British Ministry of Fuel and Power for the wiping out of that differential.  I know that this is a matter which has been the subject of negotiations and discussions over the years.  The fact that it still continues, many years after the emergency supply difficulties have ended, makes it all the more reasonable why we should continue to press our objections to it.</P>

    <P>There is another matter on which I should like to get, if possible, some further information.  It was referred to to-day at question time and has been the subject of some comment in <Col N="833" /> the Press.  I appreciate that the Department of Industry and Commerce has no control over the imports of timber, and I recognise that, while the situation exists, it is generally not possible to take any effective steps, short of reimposing control.  I know Deputies may say that we have, over a number of years, both during the period of office of this Government and of the previous Government, imported timber from Russia.  Apart from the fact that special circumstances may have operated there for the buying in of stocks after the Korean war started and from whatever source they were available, I believe that the vast majority of the people of this country do not like to have this country importing timber from Russia.  I do not blame the Minister or the Government for that situation; I merely suggest that when supplies are available elsewhere we ought to take them from that source.  If they were imported during the period of office of the inter-Party Government there probably were the different circumstances that there was a rush to buy from whatever source supplies were available, but with the easing up of supply difficulties and the updoubted dislike of the vast majority of our people for the Russian system of government, we ought to decide as a matter of policy not to buy from that source.  That view is reinforced by the fact that although we buy some commodities from Russia and from other countries behind the Iron Curtain, in the main, none of these countries buy any quantity of goods from this country.  We have probably some trade with Czechoslovakia but, by and large, none of these countries buy goods from here.  If supplies are available elsewhere I believe we ought to take them from there.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary situation that less than a year ago we exported from this part of the country to the Six Counties quantities of timber.  Again I appreciate that that matter is one for private enterprise, but in a matter of this sort where currency is provided and where State facilities are freely granted, then I believe the State should enter into the matter and should take a general supervisory view of the whole situation.  The fact that <Col N="834" /> within the last year we had special trains running to export timber that was available here and that in less than a year we imported timber from Russia prompts us to consider the whole question, and I would suggest to the Minister and the Government that the matter should be examined from that point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that it was proposed to introduce legislation in the near future to increase the amount of money made available for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. I believe that proposal will be welcomed by the House.  Experience of that organisation since it was set up would show that the money provided as well as the facilities for research were entirely inadequate, and the fact that the standard specification or standard mark which has been made available under that Act is not more widely used by manufacturers is probably due to the fact that a great number of people do not realise the importance of proper standards and the importance of industrial research.</P>
    <P>This country probably lags behind many European countries in industrial research.  We have undoubtedly skilled technicians and technicians of the highest repute in many spheres who are available to carry out this work and who are anxious to do it.  I know that for a number of years they have been pressing to get an increased grant as well as to get permission to extend and re-equip the buildings which are available for industrial research.  I look forward with interest to the proposals which will come before the House in extension of the work which has already been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that it was hoped this year to make arrangements for future tea imports and that it was not possible up to now to secure agreement on the arrangements for the import of tea by wholesalers and tea importers.  In that connection I think the main interest of the public in tea imports is twofold.  Will it mean better quality teas or cheaper tea?  The public generally are not greatly concerned with how tea is imported if they can get good tea at reasonable prices. Since the ending of control last year <Col N="835" /> there has been a great improvement in the varieties and types of tea made available and of course that has meant teas at different prices.  For a long time different interests have been pressing for freedom to buy abroad.  I do not know whether it is possible to harmonise the different views of the various interests concerned but it is to be hoped that an arrangement will be made which will enable freedom of action and at the same time guarantee continuous supplies to this country in the event of any future emergency or future difficulties.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the experts who carried out mineral exploration had reported on a number of areas and said that it was proposed to start operations in Abbeydown in Sligo and Murvey in County Donegal.  I would be interested to know whether these operations in Sligo will be additional to those of the private company that is operating there.  As I understand the position a private company was established which carried out certain work there.</P>

      <P>In the case of Donegal I would like to know whether it will be carried out by the experts or by private enterprise.  The Minister referred to the position of C.I.E. and to the fact that proposals have been put before his Department for capital reorganisation.  In that connection he expressed the hope that it would be possible to work within the limits of the losses provided for in the Estimate. While it is satisfactory to note that development, a number of people are anxious to know whether the dismissal of staff in C.I.E. is to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the 1950 Act was passed a specific section was put into it and undertakings were given by the then <Col N="836" /> Minister that normal wastage due to retirement or due to particular positions becoming redundant would operate to allow people to retire.  Since then, in the last year or so, a great number of people have had their services dispensed with and at different times very many of the employees expressed concern and alarm at the future prospects for them with the company.  That situation was the subject of comment by these employees as well as by the trade union organisations' representatives.  I think that when the undertaking was given in the House, that undertaking should as far as possible be honoured or adequate time given as well as proper compensation paid to those who had their services dispensed with.  A number of these employees were probably temporary hands who would normally be taken on for particular work at certain periods but the position as I understand it is that greater numbers have since had their services terminated than it was ever expected would be dispensed with in the immediate future when the 1950 Act was passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As I mentioned when submitting the Estimates for my Department in April last, certain increases in the rates of charge for inland telegrams are inevitable, but require new legislation. The reason is that inland telegraph rates are subject to certain statutory limits last fixed in 1915 for Press telegrams and in 1928 for ordinary inland telegrams.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Telegraph Act of 1915 prescribed <Col N="837" /><i>inter alia</i> that the rates for Press telegrams should not exceed 1/- per 60 words, day rate, and 1/- per 80 words, night rate, and that the charge for each additional copy of the same telegram transmitted to another address should not exceed 3d.  The Telegraph Act of 1928 provided that the rates for ordinary telegrams within the State should not exceed 1/6 for the first 12 words, plus 1d. per extra word, and that an additional 6d. might be charged for telegrams handed in on Christmas Day, Good Friday or Sunday.</P>
    <P>At the moment, the Press rates mentioned in the 1915 Act are in operation, but the ordinary inland rates are less than the maximum rates prescribed by the 1928 statute, being 1/- for nine words, plus 1d. for each additional word.  These latter rates were fixed in 1937.  I need hardly say that both the existing rates and the maximum rates I have mentioned are altogether out of line with current costs.</P>
    <P>It is fairly well known that the telegraph service has been a losing one for many years, but by way of background to this Bill I propose to refer again to some of the principal features.  The net deficit in 1939-40 was £141,000; in 1949-50 it was £283,000; in 1951-52 it was £403,000; and for the current financial year the loss is estimated at £430,000 on the basis of existing charges.</P>
    <P>This difficult position has been created by a number of factors operating together over a number of years past.  Firstly, there has been a progressive increase in operating and maintenance costs&mdash;they have approximately doubled since 1944-45 and more than trebled since the current inland rates were fixed in 1937.  Secondly, there is the downward trend of telegraph traffic.  It was stimulated by war conditions but it has been declining since.  The extension and improvement of the telephone service has no doubt contributed to this. Operating, maintenance and overhead costs are fairly rigid, in the sense that they cannot readily be adjusted to declining traffic.  Hence these swollen losses.</P>
    <P>We are not, of course, by any means <Col N="838" /> unique in having a losing telegraph service.  Practically every country in the world has had the same problem, but our difficulties are accentuated by having a sparse and scattered rural population.  In Great Britain, with its far denser population, the loss per telegram is of the same order as here.</P>
    <P>My Department is taking all practicable steps to try to reduce expenditure on the telegraph service&mdash;in particular, by abolition of morse working as soon as possible, by provision of teleprinters at the larger centres, by greater use of the telephone for voicing telegrams and generally by closer integration with the telephone service. It would, however, be idle to hope that we could reduce a loss of £401,000 very substantially or very quickly in this way.</P>
    <P>On the revenue side, charges have not been adjusted at all to help to meet the increased costs.  The present Press rates have been in operation since 1920: the present ordinary inland rates have been in operation since 1937, when they were reduced below rates fixed in 1928.  I would be surprised to hear of any other service which has not increased its rates during this period.  I shall not labour the point that increases in telegraph rates are warranted.  Clearly, increases are fully justified either by reference to the losses on the service, the change in the value of money, or any other standard.</P>
    <P>The purpose and scope of the Bill has been explained in the White Paper which has already been circulated to Deputies.  Briefly, it proposes to repeal the statutory limits on inland telegraph rates and Press telegraph rates contained in Section 1 of the Telegraph Act, 1928, and Section 16 of the Telegraph Act, 1868, as amended by Section 1 of the Post Office and Telegraph Act, 1915, and so enable these rates to be adjusted from time to time in the light of the costs and general finances of the service.  The telegraph service has for years been heavily subsidised by the taxpayer and/or by the users of the other services and while it will probably be necessary to continue to do so to some extent there is no good <Col N="839" /> reason why the users of the telegraph service should not pay telegraph rates which bear some relationship to the vastly increased costs.</P>
    <P>At one time statutory limits similar to those which the present Bill is designed to remove applied to a number of other Post Office charges but they have been removed from time to time, the remaining limits on the postal side being repealed in the Post Office (Amendment) Act, 1951, which was prepared by the last Government.  There is no good reason why telegraph charges should be in an exceptional position and it is, therefore, proposed to bring them into line with other Post Office charges by repealing the limits and with other charges, such as E.S.B. charges, passport fees, etc., thus obviating the necessity for further amending legislation of this kind.  Of course, the statutory regulations providing for changes in telegraph rates, like similar regulations for postal or telephone charges, will have to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, so that the control of the Oireachtas in this matter will not in any real sense be impaired.</P>
    <P>A provisional announcement was made earlier this year indicating certain increases in rates whose effect would be to reduce the deficit of £430,000 by 14 per cent. in a full financial year.  Circumstances have delayed the passage of this Bill.  I have decided that it would be inadvisable to make any decision on rates until I have received the report of the expert committee now examining telegraph administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 members were not present; House counted and, 20 members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and until I have full knowledge of what economies, if any, can be made beyond those arising from teleprinter and telephone handling of telegrams.  The report will enable me to make a more considered decision as to whether under existing conditions the taxpayer or the postal and telephone users should be asked to bear a loss of approximately the <Col N="840" /> value of each internal telegram sent, and to what extent.  So, for the present, there will be no increase in rates.  An announcement will be made as soon as possible, as the committee's work is fairly far advanced.  As I have already said, the proposed increased charges will be subject to parliamentary control by way of special resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has come into the House this evening to indicate that he proposes to throw overboard the existing scale of charges in relation to telegrams.  He has not indicated the scale with which he proposes to replace the existing charges.  He has stated that the loss at the moment is running in the region of £500,000, and he proposes to increase charges in respect of telegrams, including Press telegrams.</P>
      <P>This is yet another device to collect taxation not adumbrated in the Budget.  The Budget was introduced some months ago and heralded triumphantly by the Fianna Fáil Party because it did not make provision for any increases in taxation as compared with the savage Budget introduced in 1952. But since the Budget of this year we have had successive Ministers coming in here informing us that they require yet another £500,000 for this service or that service.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs earlier this year asked for £1,000,000 in respect of increased charges for letters, parcels and telephones. Now he proposes to throw overboard the existing scale in relation to telegram charges.  This is a concealed method of imposing further taxation upon the community.  It was the practice at one time for a Government in its annual Budget to indicate what the financial position was and what the proposals were in relation to increased taxation.  This year we were told there would be no new taxation under the Budget, but since then successive Ministers have come in here with measures involving increases in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister now intends to abolish a deficit of £430,000 and for that purpose he will have to increase taxation by almost £500,000.  He has not made a good case for this increase with the <Col N="841" /> exception of his statement that a number of years have passed since the introduction of the existing scales.  I do not think the Minister has paid due attention to the real need for this service. He has admitted that similar services in other countries do not pay. He has admitted that they show a deficit.  He now proposes to reduce the deficit here in respect of this service, or to abolish it altogether.  This is merely another supplementary budget. The Minister has not given us any specific indication as to when it is proposed to introduce the alteration in these charges.  All he has asked us to do is to give him a blank cheque. When he gets this Bill through, he will then ask for an examination of costs so that he can come in here and impose a new scale of charges by means of an Order in order to abolish the present deficit.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to abolish the maximum 1/6 for 12 words and the specified increased charges for more than 12 words.  At the moment there is a limit of 6d. payable in respect of telegrams sent on Christmas Day, Good Friday and on Sunday.  If this Bill goes through that limit will be abolished.  We must bear in mind that this service is used primarily as a matter of urgency.  It is used in the case of deaths, accidents, serious illness and so on.  These aspects appear to have been ignored by the Minister.  He appears to be interested only in grappling with the deficit.</P>
    <P>In 1939 the deficit was in the region of £140,000.  Comparing that figure with the overall figure of the present time and with present day costs the Minister must admit that, if the abolition of this scale of rates is justified to-day, it would have been equally justified in 1939.  When the Minister comes in here asking us to agree to throwing overboard the existing scale of charges he should at least be able to put before us in a general way some examination of the costs and he should also outline to some extent what his proposals are.</P>
    <P>This will be a very serious matter for the citizens who normally avail of the service in connection with their domestic affairs.  It will affect commercial <Col N="842" /> life.  It is proposed to abolish the scale which applies in respect of Press telegrams.  Section 16 of the Telegraph Act, 1868, as amended by the Post Office and Telegraph Act, 1915, prescribes that the rates of charge for Press telegrams shall not exceed 1/- for every 80 words transmitted between the hours of 6 p.m. and 9 a.m., and 1/- for every 60 words transmitted between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m., and 3d. for each copy of a Press telegram sent out to each additional address after the first address.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, people engaged in commercial life, newspapers who are obliged, for obvious reasons, to avail of this service and private citizens will be obliged, if the Minister decides to close the gap, to subscribe from their resources almost £500,000 in the form of taxation.  It can only be described as taxation if it replaces the existing scale.</P>
    <P>This is a public service which should have been preserved without interference. Other countries do not consider it necessary to close the gap so far as this service is concerned.  They realise that the sender of a telegram could not be expected to bear the full cost, that the spread-over should help to make it easy for all sections of the community.  I have in mind, for instance, the telegram which it may be necessary to deliver in a rural area where there is no telephone service or other means of sending an express message.  The delivery of a telegram may involve a journey of five to six miles.  In those circumstances the service is not economic, but in the absence of a better telephone system and having regard to the need for a telegram service the existing scale of charges should not be abolished and the service should be continued without alteration of rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not make a case for abolition although he did indicate that there is a deficit of £400,000.  It appears to me to be a quiet way of informing the Dáil and the country that it is proposed to increase taxation by almost £500,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I can hardly agree with the viewpoint which <Col N="843" /> has been expressed by Deputy Rooney on this Bill.  I find it difficult to convince myself that Deputy Rooney is convinced by his own arguments.  In the explanatory memorandum which accompanied the Bill it is stated very clearly that at present Press telegrams are accepted at a rate of 1/- for every 80 words transmitted between 6 p.m. and 9 a.m. and 1/- for every 60 words transmitted between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. and that these rates were fixed by the Post Office and Telegraph Act, 1915. That is nearly 40 years ago.  Is it reasonable, in 1953, to ask for organisations like newspapers, who earn pretty substantial sums and in many cases pay pretty substantial dividends, that the community should subsidise the Press telegraph service by charging these well-off companies a fee based on standards operative in 1915?</P>
      <P>So far as newspaper offices are concerned, they are getting their Press telegrams to-day immensely cheaper than they got them in 1915 because the shilling they then paid to the Post Office bought more for the Post Office than the shilling they give the Post Office to-day.  Newspapers were then selling their own product at ½d. per copy but are now getting 2d. and 3d. per copy.  Is it reasonable that they should ask that the scale of charges for Press telegrams should be related to conditions operative in 1915, nearly 40 years ago?</P>
      <P>I do not think that is a reasonable argument.  I do not think that newspapers which maintain a sense of balance and discretion in these matters would attempt to say, in 1953, that they should be charged 1915 rates for Press messages, especially in view of the enormous depreciation in money values which has taken place in that period. I do not imagine that any normal leader writer will attempt to write a leading article decrying a reasonable increase in Press telegram charges in the light of conditions prevailing to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can hardly imagine that the general user of Post Office services feels called upon to subsidise a telegraph service which is providing a special service for newspapers at 1915 rates.  Newspapers <Col N="844" /> will frankly recognise that they have been getting away with these rates for far too long.  A sense of justice and discretion on their part might long ago have induced them to complain about the Post Office administration for continuing to provide a service at such hopelessly uneconomic rates for pretty wealthy organisations, as newspapers have come to be in the past 50 years.</P>
    <P>I do not imagine that there will be any great slump in the stock exchange in newspaper shares as a result of the introduction of this Bill, nor do I imagine that enthusiastic members of the Fianna Fáil Party will take any less pride in the <i>Irish Press</i> because it has to pay increased charges under this Bill.  I imagine any reasonable newspaper owner or shareholder will recognise that they have been doing very well out of the subsidised Press telegrams which they were receiving at the hands of the Post Office administration.</P>
    <P>Charges for inland telegrams were last fixed in 1928.  Values have changed enormously since 1928.  The Post Office telegraph service has had very serious, indeed, deadly, competition from an expanding and efficient telephone service. In every country in the world telegrams have been decreasing, while the telephone service has been expanding. British figures show that in 1938-39 there were 48,000,000 inland telegrams sent in Britain.  That is in a highly industrialised country with a rather complex commercial life.  Notwithstanding all the efforts of the British Administration to develop the telegraph service, the number of telegrams sent fell in the year 1953-54 to an estimated figure of 34,000,000.</P>
    <P>At all events, between those two years there was a constant downward trend in the inland telegrams sent not only here but in Great Britain and in every other country in the world.  In Great Britain, I think, the loss on inland telegrams in 1938-39 was 5d. per telegram.  That loss has increased from 5d. per telegram in 1938-39 to 2/9 per telegram in 1952-53; and no increase in the traffic will cure that growing deficit because the economics of the telegraph organisation both in Great Britain and here show that the <Col N="845" /> more telegrams you handle at the present rate of charge the greater the loss is; so by merely increasing the number of telegrams passing through the Post Office at a time when there is a loss on each telegram merely tends to increase the loss, and there is no remedy, therefore, in either increasing the number of telegrams sent or in any reduction in tariffs.  In fact, the British Administration, I think, in 1935, endeavoured to see what the effect would be of a reduction of telegraph charges, believing then in response to some temporary clamour that reduced charges would result in an improvement in the financial position of the telegraph service; but in a memorandum prepared by the British Post Office recently on that subject this statement is made, and it is interesting lest the same point of view might be put in the course of this debate:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Cutting the tariff was tried in 1935, but although this increased the traffic in the first year by 30 per cent., the net result that year was an increase in the inland deficit by 50 per cent.  In 1938-39, the traffic was 50 per cent. above the 1934 level, but the deficit had increased by 66 per cent.  In fact, the revenue from induced traffic was insufficient to counterbalance the loss of revenue from the cut, and costs were increased to cover the handling of the additional traffic.  There seems to be no prospect, therefore, of reducing the inland telegraph deficit by cutting the tariff.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Indeed, with the present disparity between income and expenditure per telegram, any increase of traffic within the bounds of practical possibility would, even without a cut in the tariff, serve only to increase the deficit.  It seems evident that any worthwhile reduction could be achieved only by a material contraction in the scope of the service or by a steep increase in tariff; to break even, the tariff would have to be more than doubled without any consequent reduction in traffic, a most unlikely result.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is pretty well known that the pattern of our telegraph traffic <Col N="846" /> here is running in miniature much the same as the British pattern of telegraph traffic has been running for many years past.  Therefore I think that in all the circumstances a good case is made for a review of the existing telegraph charges, some of those charges having been fixed in 1915 and others in 1928, so that I do not imagine that the Post Office administration could be accused of viciousness or impetuosity at this stage in asking to have those charges reviewed.</P>
    <P>In any case, I think that the method adopted in this Bill has something to commend it.  In the circumstances of 1868 or 1888 it is understandable that there might be a desire to put in the charges for the services in a Bill, but the modern approach to the problem of fixing charges has been, where the State is the operating authority, to give a Minister of State power to make regulations fixing charges and varying those charges from time to time.  This Bill proposes to do that, and I think that the change is not only desirable but the authority of Parliament is maintained over those charges by reason of the fact that the Minister is obliged in the fixing of new charges to make statutory regulations and those statutory regulations have to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore there is no question of giving the Minister power which he can exercise by stealth.  He has to make the regulations and to put them on the Table of the House. The regulations can then be discussed and annulled by this House, so that the control by Parliament has been preserved to that extent.  I think that that is pretty effective control.</P>
    <P>I would like, however, to have seen this Bill against the background of the report to be made by the committee which is investigating the matter.  The Minister is getting power in this Bill to vary the charges and to make new statutory regulations, but it is a pity that we should not get the report of that committee so that this whole question might be discussed against the background of that report.  However, I suppose we can discuss the report when we see the statutory regulations, because they will provide another <Col N="847" /> opportunity for a debate, and I hope that this report will be made public so that we can discuss the whole position.</P>
    <P>Nobody who has studied the position either here or elsewhere will deny that with the rapidly developing telephone service the telegraph section of the Post Office administration is meeting with very keen competition, and very keen competition from itself.  This is the case because after all the more the Post Office develops the telephone service the more it provides a very keen competitor to its telegraph service; and, over and above that consideration, the public have shown a disposition to avail of the obvious advantages which the telephone service has by reason of the personal contacts which can be made through it and by reason of the speed at which it is now possible in the expanding telephone economy to make contacts between persons who desire those contacts.  In circumstances like that the telegraph service is really in a difficulty, and I do not know whether at this stage the Minister has himself formed an idea as to what the policy should be so far as the telegraph service is concerned. I would like to know, for example, whether the Minister's mind is travelling in the direction that his problem will be solved by restricting the scope of the telegraph service or whether he hopes by methods of expansion or popularisation to be able to bring to the telegraph service, with new tariffs, of course, a greater volume of traffic than is handled by that service at the present time.  It may be, of course, that the Minister has left that to this committee which is dealing with the matter, but it is important that we should know what is the main administrative policy of the Post Office so far as the telegraph service is concerned.</P>
    <P>Quite a considerable number of people in the Post Office are employed in the telegraph service, so that any deliberate policy of restricting its scope will have serious consequences for those people not only from the point of view of the stability of their livelihood but from the point of view of the contraction of their opportunities <Col N="848" /> for advancement in the telegraph service.  I am quite sure that in any report on this subject the conditions of the telegraph staff will be adverted to, and I would like to get from the Minister when he is concluding on this Bill an assurance that in so far as the report of the committee may affect the livelihood and prospects of the telegraph staff there will be reasonable consultation with the organisations representing the staff so as to ensure that the minimum of hardship, if indeed any hardship, is inflicted upon them.  Apart from these considerations I think that a case is made for the Bill, and we propose to vote for the Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rooney in his approach to this Bill was seeking headlines without any sense or description attached to the headlines.  He started off by saying that this Bill proposes to throw overboard the scales of charges, and another of his objections is that the Minister has not indicated the new rates to be substituted.  The Minister said that a committee is presently working on this matter and examining it with a view to coming to the Dáil at a later stage and stating the new rates to be charged and, possibly, giving the reasons.  But that does not satisfy Deputy Rooney.  He says that this is a new and additional form of concealed taxation.  He does not regard at all the position of the rates charged to newspapers for commercial purposes and the loss arising in the Post Office which has to be met out of taxation.  In other words, without knowing it, Deputy Rooney is advocating that the taxpayer should subsidise cheap telegraphic rates for, as Deputy Norton has pointed out, wealthy large business undertakings in the shape of the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why Deputy Rooney does not try to balance his mind on this matter by examining the position that exists so far as the treatment of the taxpayer and the general public by the E.S.B. with regard to charges is concerned.  As a commercial undertaking, they are entitled to make their charges meet their costs, and all their costs, as far as possible.  The Post Office also is run on commercial lines, <Col N="849" /> but Parliament still has an absolute control because, when the Minister comes again to the Dáil to announce the new rates, obviously an explanation will be given as to why these new rates are considered necessary, and so on.</P>
    <P>In effect, Deputy Rooney says: &ldquo;This is concealed taxation and, rather than have concealed taxation, keep the deficit going.&rdquo;  How does Deputy Rooney imagine the deficit is met?  Is it not met out of taxation and not out of increased payment from the users of the service?  When will Deputy Rooney get some clear view of what is going on around him?</P>
    <P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was on the point of the muddled thinking of Deputy Rooney.  In effect, he said: &ldquo;Rather than have concealed taxation it is better to have the deficit.&rdquo;  The deficit has to be met in some form.  We either borrow and give the amount borrowed to the Post Office to make up the deficit and pay the interest charges on it or we vote a sum of money from the ordinary income of the State to wipe out the deficit.  Deputy Rooney wants the deficit maintained and a cheap telegraphic service to all and sundry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The gems of wisdom that fall from the lips of Deputy Rooney are beyond comprehension.  We have heard talk of a &ldquo;concealed&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Supplementary&rdquo; Budget.  Rather than that undertakings such as newspapers should be made pay an up-to-date price for an up-to-date service&mdash;and possibly a much improved service compared with that which existed in 1915&mdash;Deputy Rooney says, in effect: &ldquo;Retain the Budget.  Let them charge four times the price the paper cost in 1915, but give them the service at a loss to the State.&rdquo;  Then, in his confused thinking, he talks about protecting the taxpayer. Does he not realise that this Bill will pave the way for protection of the taxpayer by relieving the taxpayer of what might be termed the subsidy which at present exists in <Col N="850" /> relation to the cost of the telegraphic service for newspapers.</P>
    <P>When this report is being considered, I should like the Minister to convey to the committee, if he thinks it fit, the possibility of having a report that will be so comprehensive that we can examine it here in a variety of aspects when it comes before us.  Perhaps the cost of the different types of traffic can be disclosed&mdash;the number of words used or, if you like, the number of telegrams sent by newspapers and other commercial interests as distinct from the ordinary member of the public who sends an ordinary message. We might then be able to see&mdash;certainly the committee would be able to see&mdash;how equitable charges can be brought about so that a reasonable portion of the burden of the cost will be borne by the ordinary people.  I do not know whether Deputy Rooney is aware that a great deal of the use of the telegraph service is cross-Channel and overseas.  Are the overseas people and the cross-Channel people&mdash;who are the people who use this service&mdash;the taxpayers about whom Deputy Rooney is concerned?</P>
    <P>I should like to put this further point to Deputy Rooney.  If we are to maintain 1915 charges in one case and 1928 charges in another case, does he expect the people who are now working in the Post Office to exist under the terms and conditions and wages that operated in 1915 and prior to 1928?  Does Deputy Rooney not think that the workers in the telegraph service and the Post Office generally are just as much entitled to the benefits and the advances in the standard of living as employees in other spheres of activity and, if he thinks that they are entitled to these benefits, does he consider that the taxpayer should pay the difference in this matter?</P>
    <P>This Bill is a means of removing from the taxpayer the subsidy which has been necessary by reason of the fact that the charges for the telegraphic service have not been brought up to date.  I do not quite follow the reference that was read out by Deputy Norton with regard to a loss being sustained despite the sending of an increased number of telegrams.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> It may happen in certain cases, when some service is uneconomic, that the more the service is utilised, the greater is the loss, but I feel that this committee examining this matter may be able to devise different rates and different charges for different classes of service so that there will not be a greater loss. I do not know what percentage of the traffic in telegrams is represented by newspaper services, but I have no doubt that if we doubled the charges in that respect, we would not double the loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy misunderstood me.  I said that if you continue to get more traffic at the present rates, if you double the traffic at present rates, you do not reduce the loss because each unit is carrying a loss.  The British tried the experiment of reducing the charge, and, while they got more traffic for a time, it was more than counterbalanced by the loss.  The only way in which you can get more revenue is by increasing the charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I misunderstood the Deputy.  I agree that the only way a loss can be reduced is by increasing the charge, even if you do, to a certain extent, reduce the traffic.  Apropos of what Deputy Norton hinted at but did not ask directly, may I ask if it would be possible that the report of this committee would be circulated to members of the Dáil, so that they would have a chance of considering it, and, when it comes up for discussion, giving their views and making suggestions with regard to it?  If the report is kept strictly confidential and if the Minister merely comes in here and tells us that these are the heads of the findings of the committee, it will not be easy for us to judge whether or not there should be changes here and there.  It would be a good thing for the Minister to consider whether some form of report giving a good deal of information should not be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rooney talked about a particular type of telegram, the telegram which is sent to a rural part of Ireland and which has to be carried four or five miles by messenger.  I wonder if, <Col N="852" /> when this report is being studied, there could be a segregation or breaking down of the various types of service provided under this head.</P>
    <P>There are people who have telephones, and these people know that if they want to send a telegram, they can send it over the telephone.  If the recipient is also a telephone subscriber, the telephone should be used for delivery of that telegram, a confirmation being sent only if requested.  That would cut out a great deal of the manpower and cost involved in the delivery of a telegram.  There are other people who send telegrams over the telephone to people who have not a telephone and vice versa, but I feel that, since the Post Office has always made it clear that the service provided is provided on strictly commercial lines, we should ask that a detailed examination be made of its operations and cost of operations, with alternative suggestions for cutting down costs and possibly educating the public to a greater understanding of the use of the telephone service.  This, in itself, would help to bring increased revenue and result in a cutting down of the deficit in the running of the service.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong in the Minister's approach to this House.  He tells us in advance that he has a committee working on this matter which will tell him in due course what changes he should make in charges, in order that the taxpayer may be saved having to meet losses on the undertaking.  He has not come in here, as Deputy Rooney stated, asking for a blank cheque.  He has said quite reasonably, openly and frankly: &ldquo;I am asking you to pass the Bill because I will be coming along with new proposals in this regard, and the House will then have an opportunity of examining them, of discussing them and of deciding on them.&rdquo;  How anybody can stretch his imagination as far as Deputy Rooney does is beyond understanding by me. He reads into this proposal concealed taxation and another Budget.  These are the headlines Deputy Rooney would like to get, but I want to tell him that this is a means of avoiding the necessity for possibly a Supplementary Estimate or a Supplementary <Col N="853" /> Budget, and to lessen the taxation he is talking about.</P>

      <P>I wonder if it would be possible for Deputy Rooney to use the brain power he has to answer a few questions: first, is it fair that the taxpayer, the ordinary man and woman in the street, should be asked to subsidise losses on a service for certain individuals or undertakings?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that some types of machinery operate only in reverse.  I am stating positively that the position is that newspapers, as a group, are causing a serious loss in the revenue of the telegraph service, because they are being charged rates which existed in 1915.  Is it fair that this loss should be made up by Deputy Rooney and myself who are not newspaper owners, any more than are the other taxpayers?  Is it possible that that will sink in and be digested by Deputy Rooney?  Could the Deputy get his thinking out of reverse and think in the way normal people think? This Bill proposes to remedy that situation and when Deputy Rooney goes home to-night and goes to bed for his night's repose, he will perhaps reflect on this Bill and will begin to think that it is going to do what he wants and that its rejection would have the opposite effect.  He will then thank goodness that the Dáil, by a majority, had sufficient sense to rule <Col N="854" /> against him on this occasion.  I believe that a little reflection will bring the Deputy to the frame of mind in which he will understand what it is proposed to do here.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I certainly hope that the Minister will consider asking the committee to present a report which can be published with as much detail as possible.  None of us knows, not even the Minister nor I, what percentage of traffic or what percentage of income results from the service, say, to the newspapers.  I do not know whether he can tell us what percentage of traffic or income results from commercial use of the telegraph services as distinct from what Deputy Rooney had in mind and beyond which he could not think.  A telegram which I might send him congratulating him on the 25th anniversary of his wedding day, or on the birth of triplets, is the type of telegram Deputy Rooney had in mind and no other.</P>
      <P>The Dáil would like to have as much information on this matter as possible. We, the members of this House, are running the postal services, particularly the telegraph service as far as we can, as a commercial undertaking on behalf of the public.  I am very anxious to have information as detailed as possible because I personally have an objection to outside bodies having the full authority and the power in regard to public services and the Dáil having no power to interfere with them.  I believe that if this report is given to us, as frankly and as clearly as I hope it will, it will be shown that it might be better for us to have some control over all our State owned institutions such as the E.S.B., the railways and so forth rather than the system that exists at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that deliberately though I may be quite wrong.  The report when it comes out may show that it would be better to have a board of management such as in the case of the E.S.B., free from any control of the Dáil, free from any questions as to why a postmaster was put in here or a telegraph boy was not employed there, so that the Minister could be in the happy position of saying: &ldquo;I am not responsible. <Col N="855" /> That is the concern of the board of directors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I say here and now that I will be very surprised if when the report is produced it cannot be shown that a Post Office Department run by a Minister of State on behalf of the Dáil, with whatever staff of officials he requires, can be at least as efficiently run and managed as under any form of control of which we have experience in this country.  That is why I am pressing the Minister to make it clear one way or the other. I am in favour of the present system of control of the Post Office and I am against the type of control which has been set up in the case of the E.S.B. I am sick and tired of looking at high walls without knowing what is going on behind them and without getting any satisfaction when questions are asked as to why people should have to pay this or that or why this or that is done.  I do not believe that is a type of control which is in any way superior to that of a Department which is under the control of the Dáil in its day-to-day activities, right down to the appointment of a postmaster, a postmistress or a telegraph boy.  In conclusion may I ask Deputy Rooney to reflect on his approach to this matter and then to consider whether in fact he did not start off in reverse? Maybe he may be able to get into ordinary gear from, say, to-morrow morning and recognise that this Bill is a step in the right direction.</P>

May I point out that there is an enormous amount of business to be transacted before the end of the session, and that many and ample opportunities will arise on the various Estimates which are to be discussed, to advert to the financial policy or the taxation policy of the Government? This is merely a Bill to alter the method of making increases in telegraph charges by way of amending the ancient legislation with which we have had to deal up to the present.  The new rates will be brought into operation by statutory regulations which <Col N="856" /> must be placed on the Table of the House.  There is a vast amount of work to be done and, if we could keep within the limits of the Bill, I think it would be much to the advantage of the Opposition as it would be to Deputies on this side of the House because it would leave more time for the discussion of Estimates on which every aspect of the financial policy of the Government can be adverted to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea underlying this Bill is to ensure that this service will pay its way in all its branches.  I do not think that any case can be made, or has been made, from any side of the House to support the suggestion that certain sections of the community, who derive a considerable benefit from the telegraph services, should be subsidised. I appreciate that in certain isolated cases where people living in rural areas have got to send or <Col N="857" /> receive telegrams, because of the fact that they are not served by the telephone service, they may find it rather costly but it is so rare that telegrams are received by people in remote rural areas that the cost does not very much concern them.  In many cases, the news they receive is not as good as that to which Deputy Briscoe referred.  It is not always congratulatory; it is very often the news of the death of some relative.  In this connection I want to draw the Minister's attention to one point.  That is that in many rural areas telegrams are delivered, not from the nearest sub-post office but from a sub-post office four, five or six miles distant. That I think is due to the fact that there are a number of small sub-post offices which are linked up with the telephone system, which are not regarded as telegraph offices and therefore do not deal with telegrams. If the Minister wants to cheapen the cost of telegrams to people living in remote areas, he might make provision for the delivery of telegrams from the nearest sub-post office.  That is one of the ways in which porterage charges could be drastically cut.</P>
      <P>Very few people in rural areas are living five or six miles or more from the nearest sub-post office which is linked up with the telephone system, but there are a very large number of people living more than five miles from what is recognised as a telegraph office.  I should like the Minister to look into that aspect of the question. It is one of the ways in which a certain saving could be effected and that saving, of course, would be passed on to the person sending or receiving a telegram.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Rooney, in making observations on this Bill, stressed that the purpose of the Bill was to levy taxation whereas in fact, the purpose of the Bill is to alter the method by which charges in the telegraph service can be amended from time to time.  The question of telephone, postal and telegraph charges has been raised in the course of the debate and I do not think that I need repeat again the statements I made at frequent intervals to explain to the public the necessity for in <Col N="858" /> creasing postal, telephone and telegraph charges.  We have had a considerable debate on this matter already on the occasion of the Estimate and there have been other occasions when I have done my best to act as a super public relations officer for what is really a commercial service and to give in detail the financial circumstances of the service, to describe why we view it as very important that the service should pay for itself.</P>
      <P>It would be very easy for us to ignore the constantly increasing costs in salaries, wages and materials which have occurred during the past 15 or 20 years.  If we ignored these increases, we would inevitably reach the position that the entire service would be losing £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 a year and when that point was reached, as I have already indicated, the most magnificent administrative officers and the most loyal workers in the staff of the Post Office would not be anything but human if they said: &ldquo;Why bother about giving good output when we know the taxpayer will pay what is becoming so large a sum of money that no Government would ever dare to impose any charge sufficient to cover that deficit.&rdquo; But perhaps in as few words as I possibly can I can give the reason why every head of postal services throughout the world, who has some regard for efficiency and for spending the people's money wisely and well, desires that the services should pay reasonably well. In fact, the postal services taken as a whole have lost about £500,000 in 20 years, making something in some years, losing in others, and balancing in some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add in that connection that over £1,000,000 in charges was either imposed or sanctioned by the last Government under the administration of Deputy Everett.  I thoroughly approve of every single change that was made.  It was justified.  Whatever our disagreement may be with the Opposition on other matters, they made no alteration in the general tradition of the postal services, just as we made no alteration in the general tradition in regard to the postal services when we first took office in <Col N="859" /> 1932.  As I said, the amount imposed was £1,000,000.  The greater part of it was imposed by way of statutory Order, just in the same way as it is proposed to alter the telegraph charges in future if this Bill passes both Houses.</P>
    <P>In reply to one Deputy, I should say that salaries amount to 70 per cent. of the total cost of the telegraph service. Everyone knows that there have been constant increases in salaries and it is important, as Deputy Norton said, that whatever changes we make are of a constructive character.  I should indicate in that connection that the telephone service is expanding so rapidly that if there should be a redundancy in the telegraph staff as a result of any proposals put forward by the committee and sanctioned by me the staff concerned can without difficulty be absorbed in other branches of the service.  I can foresee no action being taken which will result in any notable or widespread unemployment in the postal service where thousands of our people are employed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rooney asked what we had done to try to make the service operate more efficiently.  I indicated at the time of my speech on the Estimate the establishment of teleprinter routes in place of Morse and that policy is being continued.  The number of internal Morse circuits in operation from 1st October this year is 47 as compared with 68 in 1948.  But before the end of 1953 we hope to convert some 16 more circuits to telephone-telegram working and some four further Morse circuits will be scheduled for conversion to teleprinting work.  That makes for some economy, but before the setting up of the committee I can say that the economy will not be of any vital significance in the sense that it would help to reduce the enormous deficit on the telegraph service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We are gradually establishing other telephone-telegram circuits or teleprinter circuits.  Deputy Norton spoke about the fact that the value of money has changed a great deal and I suppose the best way I can describe that to the House is by pointing out that we provide a fee of 1/9 for the delivery of a telegram for a distance of three miles from the post office.  That means that for each telegram which is being delivered two or three miles in the country the net amount available to pay the whole transmission costs of the telegram is a sum of 3d., and that explains one reason for the very great loss which is suffered in the operation of the telegraph service.  As I have already indicated, it would be impossible to work out accurately what exactly was the loss on each telegram sent, but it would not be an exaggeration to say that it must be at least equivalent to the amount paid for the telegram.</P>
      <P>With regard to the committee which is sitting and examining all these questions, I do not think that the committee's report, which will be of a highly technical character, will be suitable for debate or for publication. But, as Deputies have noticed, I take the course of giving the maximum information in the House with regard to the working of the services, and it would certainly be possible for me at the time of the Estimate to give the main conclusions and the facts that have been formulated by the committee in so far as I agree with them and in so far as they can serve any useful purpose in any discussion that might take place, if and when the increased charges for telegrams are imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe asked for one particular fact which might be of interest to the House and which I can give now, and that is a rough analysis of <Col N="861" /> the number of telegrams sent at the present time.  Approximately, the figures are as follows.  Business telegrams amount to 32 per cent. of the total.  This is in volume and not in value.  It would be impossible for us to estimate the value of them.  Telegrams of a domestic character amount to 47 per cent.  Telegrams of a congratulatory character and telegrams of sympathy amount to 15 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they not domestic telegrams?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The domestic telegrams would be concerned with private travel arrangements&mdash;arrival and departure and similar matters. That is rather difficult, naturally, to analyse in detail.  Telegrams of a miscellaneous character amount to 6 per cent. so that it will be seen that quite a proportion of telegrams are of a purely business character.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton, in making a very constructive and helpful speech, pointed out that there were various methods by which we could alter the method of administration of the telegraph service or the method of operation to bring about economies for justifying increases in charges.  There are a number of such alternative schemes.  We could adopt a greeting telegrams service with special paper and envelopes. In some countries this has reduced the loss on the telegraph service by encouraging people to send their congratulations in a very pleasing form at a much greater cost.  This would apply to people who are being married, people reaching their majority and so on.  We believe that at the present time that particular form of greeting service would not be likely to get us out of the difficulty.  It would be too costly to operate.</P>

    <P>It should be obvious to Deputies that we could charge tariffs defending the rate at which telegrams are delivered. That would be another method of altering the incidence of charges.  We could have charges according to the character of the telegram sent.  That, I understand, is almost impossible to effect.  It would <Col N="862" /> be very hard to ask the staff of the Post Office to classify telegrams.  That it is not a practicable method of altering the incidence of the charges.</P>
    <P>I mention these three alternative methods as ways out of the difficulty. I have made no decision on the question. I could not do so until I see the result of this committee's work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe, apparently, was not aware of the fact that telegrams can be telephoned immediately to a house by a request from the sender and delivered by post afterwards, perhaps with the next delivery of letters.  That makes certain savings in delivery charges.  Unfortunately, even though the system is in operation for a little time, there is no visible sign of any great savings being effected.  No doubt, it must effect some saving under certain circumstances.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan mentioned cases where the centres of delivery for telegrams appear to be rather far away from the house of the person to whom it is addressed.  That is a matter which relates to the general administration of the service.  There may be a very good reason for it.  It depends on the number of telegrams delivered at that post office.  A number may have to be dispatched a considerable distance.  It may relate to the difficulty of getting a casual messenger even though we have increased the fees. <Col N="863" /> The difficulty of getting these casual messengers in certain areas is having the attention of the committee which is examining the whole question of the telegraph service.</P>
      <P>I think I have answered all the points put forward by Deputies.  I recommend the Second Reading of the Bill to the House because it follows precedent already created both by the present Government in its former administration and by the last Government in the Bill which they left me to pass through the House by which there should be a similar method for making alterations in charges in regard to the postal, telephone and telegraph services.</P>

    <P>I am moving a report from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, as set out in the motion, in connection with the premature disclosure of a report of a Select Committee presented to Dáil Éireann on the 14th July, 1953. I am moving that the report be adopted.</P>
    <P>The report is in the hands of all Deputies for some months but it was not possible to order this motion for consideration by the Dáil until now. Deputies are familiar with the procedure adopted in regard to matters of this nature.  The question of a breach of privilege by a certain newspaper, the <i>Sunday Express,</i> was brought to the attention of the Dáil by a member of the Dáil.  Immediately, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was asked to investigate the report.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges met in due course and held more than one meeting to discuss and examine this whole problem in regard to a breach of privilege on the part of the <i>Sunday Express</i> in connection with the report of the Select Committee established by the Dáil to deal with a question of judicial salaries.  After careful consideration and examination of the subject in all its aspects, the committee arrived at this agreed report unanimously.  I present it to the Dáil for adoption.  I herewith <Col N="865" /> move that the report be adopted by the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment in my name which appears on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;adopted&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;referred back for reconsideration&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do so for a number of reasons.  This is a very important matter.  It not only affects newspapers that are published in this country and circulating in it, but it affects the rights of Deputies and, to a large extent, it affects the rights of the public.</P>
      <P>I have endeavoured to get some information in regard to this claim, in the first instance, of privilege, and secondly, in regard to its operation. As Deputies will realise, in considering a matter of privilege, one has to take into account the experiences of other Parliaments and the general principles which they have laid down to guide them in matters of this kind. I believe that I will be able to satisfy the Dáil that there was no breach of privilege in this instance.  In considering this matter of parliamentary privilege, obviously Deputies will refer, as I have referred, to what is the standard work on this&mdash;<i>May's Parliamentary Practice.</i>  I have endeavoured to get from <i>May's Parliamentary Practice,</i> and from the cases quoted in that work, some idea of what privilege is and how it operates. I think it will be agreed that it is almost impossible to list&mdash;that is in the British Parliament&mdash;all the acts that may be considered as contempt, because the power to punish for contempt in the British Parliament is discretionary; but I think I would be stating the law correctly if I quoted this from May:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It may be stated generally that any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any member or officer of such House in the discharge of his duty or which has a tendency, directly or indirectly, to produce such results, <Col N="866" /> may be treated as a contempt, even though there is no precedent in the House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is, in a general way, a description of contempt, and of the power of the House of Commons or the House of Lords to punish for contempt. Those are very extensive powers, and, in the British Parliament, they are based, as far as I can see, on the custom or law of Parliament.  The custom or law of Parliament is of long acceptance in the British Parliament. It is based, as I say, entirely on tradition.</P>
    <P>Under that custom of the British Parliament, they have made matters the subject of privilege, a breach of which they punish.  If I may, I shall just briefly refer to some of the major matters which they have considered to be privilege, and breaches of which they have dealt with as a breach of privilege.  They have so dealt with disobedience to rules or orders of either House or disobedience to orders of a committee.  To prevent, delay, obstruct or interfere with the execution of the order of either House or of a committee is a contempt of such House.  Conspiracy to deceive either House or any committee of the House has also been treated as a breach of privilege.  To attempt to influence members in their conduct by threats is also a breach of privilege.  To molest any member on account of his conduct in the House is a breach of privilege. To publish any libel reflecting upon a member relating to his service therein is considered a high violation of the rights and privileges of the House. Similarly, imputations against a member may amount in the British Parliament to a breach of privilege.  Interrupting or disturbing the proceedings of either House of the Parliament has been considered to be a breach of privilege, and is punished as contempt. Remaining in the House, after being ordered to withdraw, or taking notes of what is passing in the House, and refusing to desist when requested to do so by an officer of the House has been considered a breach of privilege, and is punished as contempt.</P>
    <P>This is important in regard to newspapers particularly.  The following are <Col N="867" /> instances of misconduct in connection with the publication of debates which have been treated as a breach of privilege: publishing a false report of proceedings of the House; publishing scandalous misrepresentations of what had passed in either House or of what had been said in debates; publishing under colour of a member's speech a gross libel on the character and conduct of another member; suppressing speeches of particular members.  I would like to pause on that.  It has been considered to be a breach of privilege.  I have been subjected to that very often myself.  The following are further instances: publishing proceedings which the House had ordered to be expunged from the journals.</P>
    <P>In matters in committee, or in investigations where counsel appears before the House or a committee and reflects on the proceedings in Parliament or upon the members of the House, that has been considered a breach of privilege.  Likewise, witnesses summoned before Parliament or a committee are guilty of contempt if they refuse to be sworn, or to take an oath or some corresponding obligation to speak the truth, or if they refuse to answer questions or are guilty of prevarication or of trifling with the committee by returning insulting answers to the committee, or appear in a state of intoxication, or if they destroy, after a first examination before a committee, a material document relevant to the inquiry.  All these are breaches of privilege, as well as the acceptance by a member of either House of a bribe to influence him in his conduct as such member, or of any fee, compensation or award in connection with the promotion of, or opposition to, any Bill, Resolution, matter or thing submitted or intended to be submitted to the House or to a committee therein.</P>
    <P>In 1858, the House of Commons resolved:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That it is contrary to the usage and derogatory to the dignity of this House that any of its members should bring forward, promote or advocate in this House any proceeding or measure in which he may have <Col N="868" /> acted, or been concerned, for or in consideration of any pecuniary fee or award.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may say that it has been held in respect of a counsel that where he has appeared in criminal proceedings which have finished he would be entitled to participate in a debate in Parliament in regard to it.  The last of the important declarations in the British House of Parliament was on the 15th July, 1947, when it declared by resolution that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is inconsistent with the dignity of the House, with the duty of a member to his constituents, and with the maintenance of the privilege of freedom of speech, for any member of this House to enter into any contractual agreement with an outside body controlling or limiting the member's complete independence and freedom of action in Parliament or stipulating that he shall act in any way as the representative of such outside body in regard to any matters to be transacted in Parliament; the duty of a member being to his constituents and to the country as a whole, rather than to any particular section thereof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the House will recollect that case, that of a member named Brown who was, I think, secretary of a Civil Service organisation.  On the question of the administration of this law of privileges I quote the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The two Houses of Parliament in England are of equal authority in the administration of a common body of privileges.  Each House, as a constituent part of Parliament, exercises its own privileges independently of the other.  They are enjoyed, however, not by any separate right peculiar to each but solely by virtue of the law and custom of Parliament. Each House may declare and expound privileges and may punish breaches of privilege, but it is the law of Parliament that is thus administered. Although either House may expound the law of Parliament and vindicate its own privileges, it has been agreed since 1704&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>and I want to stress that</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" />&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;it has been agreed since 1704 by the House of Lords and the House of Commons that neither House has power by any vote or declaration, to create to themselves new privileges not warranted by the known laws and customs of Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, in a general way, relates to privileges.  The particular matter of the publication of documents has been dealt with in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;By the ancient custom of Parliament no act done at any committee should be divulged before the same be reported to the House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On that principle the House of Commons resolved on 21st April, 1837:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that the evidence taken by any Select Committee of this House and the documents presented to such committee and which have not been reported to the House, ought not to be published by any member of such committee or any other person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am coming now to the particular matter that is for the decision of the House.  Where the public were admitted to a committee that rule was not enforced.  In a case known as Sheehan's case in 1831-32 it was held that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The publication of proceedings of committees conducted with closed doors or of reports of committees before they are available to members will, however, constitute a breach of privilege.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the question of the premature publication of reports May sets out at page 601 of his 1950 edition:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any publication of a draft report, which has been submitted to a committee, before such report has been agreed to by the committee and presented to the House or of the report of the committee before it has been presented to the House is treated as a breach of privilege.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to stress this point.  It is also laid down:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When the report of the committee which has been presented to the House but was not yet available to <Col N="870" /> members in printed form, was communicated to the Press, the Speaker stated that the more regular practice was that the members of the House should be the first to be put in possession of the deliberations of the Select Committee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise the last two points I have made.  First and foremost, where there has been the publication of a draft report, which has been submitted to a committee, before the report has been made to the House, that is clearly a breach of privilege, but where a report has been made to the House of Commons or to Parliament there has been no declaration in the British Parliament that its publication before distribution is a breach of privilege.  That question has been considered by the British Parliament on two occasions. It was considered in 1893-94 and in 1947-48.  I would like to quote for the House these short references.  They are in connection with cases which are exactly similar to that which we are here debating&mdash;the premature publication of a committee's report.  As will be clear from what I have said already, the British Parliament by the custom of Parliament has felt itself to have inherent power to deal with breaches of privileges and there is a whole body of law relating to privilege and breach of privilege.  However, in 1893, when there was what was considered to be the premature publication of a committee's report, the matter was referred to the Speaker of the House in regard to publication in a newspaper.</P>
    <P>The question was raised by Mr. Ellis, a member of Parliament.  At column 811, chapter 14 of the Parliamentary Debates of the House of Commons, 1893-94, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I beg to ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he has seen a very full report in the <i>Yorkshire Post</i> of Friday, 30th June, of the provisions of the Building Societies Bill and the deliberations of the select committee on building societies; and whether, as chairman of the committee, he can explain how these matters became public although the House is not yet in possession of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="871" /> The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. H. Gladstone, Leeds, W.): The report in question, which is practically <i>verbatim,</i> was brought to my notice. As the <i>Yorkshire Post</i> is a Tory journal, published in Leeds I at once wrote to the right honourable gentleman the member for North Leeds expressing, as chairman of the committee, my strong regret that the Building Societies Bill, as amended by the committee, should have been given to a newspaper before being issued to honourable members.  The right honourable gentleman informs me that he is responsible for having given the information to the representatives of the <i>Yorkshire Post</i>, having been under the impression that the report was public property.  He says that if unintentionally he has shown disrespect to the House he is exceedingly sorry.</P>
    <P>Mr. Jackson (Leeds, N.): I hope I may be allowed to explain.  The position of the matter is this.  The committee had been sitting for some time.  Their labours had terminated, and their report had been made to the House.  I was under the impression that when a committee was discharged and its report made to the House there was no longer any reason for reticence with regard to the conclusions at which the committee had arrived.  It is certainly within my recollection that a great many reports of committees have been made public at once after having been laid on the Table.  During the evening of Thursday last one of the Lobby representatives asked me whether I could tell him what conclusion the committee had arrived at, and I did so.  I was under the impression, and still am, that I was within my rights in doing so.  I think it would be convenient if Mr. Speaker would be good enough to guide us with his opinion on the subject&mdash;namely, whether, when a committee to which a matter has been referred have reported to the House, an honourable member is any longer debarred from stating the conclusions <Col N="872" /> at which the committee have arrived?</P>
    <P>Mr. J. E. Ellis: I was about, with your permission, to ask Sir, whether, although a report on amended Bill may have been formally communicated to the House, it is not more regular before communicating their contents to the public, to allow the print to be distributed to members.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is the ruling of the Speaker, which is short:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker: There has been a prevalent impression that when a committee's report was laid upon this Table it at once becomes public property.  That view has been acted upon in several instances; but I am bound to say that the more regular practice is that the members of the House should be the first to be put in possession of the results of the deliberations of a Select Committee. Still, I am quite aware that the contrary practice has prevailed more than once.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, the point I want to make is that the matter was definitely brought before Parliament and the Speaker said what the regular practice ought to be; but there was no question of declaring the publication to be a breach of privilege.  That was in 1893. The other authority to which I have to refer is much shorter than that.  It is reported in the House of Commons Debates, 1947-48, Volume 454, columns 1125 and 1126, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&ldquo;QUESTION OF PRIVILEGE.</P>
    <P>Mr. Kirby: I should like, Mr. Speaker, with your permission, to bring to your notice two items appearing in newspapers to-day, and to ask for your ruling whether or not they constitute a breach of privilege. I raise this matter because on Wednesday of last week the Select Committee on Estimates laid on the Table of this House a report concerning the use of petrol by Government Departments, and although that report was laid last week it will not be printed and published for general knowledge by the public until about Wednesday or Thursday of next week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> The two newspapers concerned are <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> and the <i>Liverpool Daily Post</i> of to-day's date.  On page 1 of <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> there is a small paragraph headed:</P>
    <P Just="Center">&lsquo;PETROL ECONOMY.</P>
    <P>By our Political Correspondent,&rsquo; which reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Criticism of lack of economy and control of petrol used by Government Departments will be made in a report by the Select Committee on the Estimates shortly to be published.  The Select Committee's interest in Government petrol has led to a rapid tightening up in most Departments, and the report will show substantial savings have already been made.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>On page 2 of the <i>Liverpool Daily Post</i> in what is called the &lsquo;London Letter&rsquo; appears this paragraph:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">&lsquo;BEFORE AND AFTER.</P>
    <P>&lsquo;The report on petrol consumption by Government Departments, which, as I said the other day is coming from the Select Committee on Estimates, will have an appendix showing, I am told, a striking contrast of figures.  Each Department's consumption will be given in two sets of figures, one before full checks on petrol consumption were introduced, the other afterwards.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>The point at issue is the fact that that report has been laid on the Table of the House but has not yet been published for the members of the public, and the Press to read.  I ask you, Sir, for your ruling whether a breach of privilege has been committed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Here is what the Speaker says&mdash;and this, as I mentioned to the House, was in the year 1948:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Speaker: I am obliged to the honourable member, who gave me notice that this question might be raised.  Now, had the report not been technically laid before the House&mdash;and it is technically before the House, because it has been presented to the Clerks and, therefore, sent to the printers&mdash;and had the <Col N="874" /> report not been sent to the printers, there would definitely have been a <i>prima facie</i> breach of privilege.  My predecessors have ruled that once a report has gone to the printers it has technically been laid before the House, and a breach of privilege does not exist.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that is very clear, that a breach of privilege does not exist when the report has been laid on the Table of the House, because technically, as it says here, it is then supposed to be sent to the printers.  Mr. Speaker continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But&mdash;and here again I am in line with some of my predecessors&mdash;the fact must remain that it is a wholly undesirable principle that before honourable members themselves have had a chance of reading what is in the report of the Select Committee something should have taken place which ought not to have happened. I regret very much that some of the report of this Select Committee should have been disclosed to the Press; and I also regret that that should have been printed in the Press.  The articles are not breaches of privilege, but they call for my displeasure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, could that be clearer, that they are not breaches of privilege?</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that I have selected here for reading to the House the two authorities that are quoted in <i>May's Parliamentary Practice</i> dealing with this matter.  In the British Parliament there is a very long chain of authorities in regard to privilege and a surprising thing in the British Parliament is that one of the most important matters that comes before it is a matter of privilege.  It is one in which the leaders of the House on all sides participate.  Where a matter of privilege comes up to be debated in the British Commons, there is no question of it being simply thrown in <Col N="875" /> for whoever happens to be there to be discussed as a triviality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested only in the technical definition of laying a document on the Table of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a minute from our own law here. That is the law, as I understand it, in regard to a breach of privilege and clearly from the report which has been presented to us these matters that I am referring to have not been considered by the committee.  Where matters such as this have been considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges they are important matters and it is for that reason that I have put down this amendment that the report be referred back. What does a breach of privilege involve?  It may involve very serious punishment on an individual or a newspaper; in other words, it may involve sanctions by a law of which they are not aware, sanctions which may be enforced against a newspaper for publishing what they think may be published or against a Deputy for information he may give believing there is nothing wrong in the giving of it.</P>
      <P>The report states at page 5, paragraph 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Select Committee on judicial salaries, expenses, allowances and pensions, whose report was stated to have been prematurely disclosed was set up by order of the Dáil on the 9th December, 1952.  The Select Committee, which sat in private, formally presented their report to the Dáil on the 24th April, 1953, on which date an Order was made by the House&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want Deputies to listen to this in particular:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;on which date an Order was made by the House for the report to lie upon the Table and for the report and proceedings to be printed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the House decided.  Now I want to refer the House to Standing <Col N="876" /> Orders.  In particular I want to refer the House to Standing Order No. 135:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Papers Laid on the Table of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>All papers and documents laid on the Table shall be considered public.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to consider these two points: firstly, the report was laid upon the Table of the Dáil; secondly, all papers and documents laid on the Table shall be considered public. Now, why should our committee say it was a breach of privilege to publish the contents of a document which was laid on the Table of the House, and the contents of which, under Standing Orders, are public?  Deputy Corish says he is a member of this committee. Deputy Sweetman is a member of the committee.  I think it is only fair to say that in considering this matter the committee had not before them the authorities which I have quoted.  They had not before them, because they did not refer to it in the report, the two points that I have mentioned, namely, that the report was laid upon the Table of the House and, secondly, that, having been laid on the Table of the House, it was a public document.  I am very anxious that this matter, being so important, should be fully considered.  I did not put down a motion to reject this; I put it down for the purpose of having it reconsidered, and I think the Parliamentary Secretary ought to agree with me that this is a matter that could go back to the Committee on Privileges to be reconsidered by that body in the light of the arguments I have now advanced. I think that is a fair request.</P>
    <P>As to what that committee considered, it is laid down definitely here. There is only one other point to which I wish to refer.  It is a presumption that is set out in paragraph 6 of the report.  It says that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If such an order is made it is presumed that the proceedings are private until a report is made to the House.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report was made to the House in this instance by the chairman of the committee, Deputy Lynch, the Parliamentary <Col N="877" /> Secretary.  He made the report to the House.  Therefore, it ceased, even within what has been laid down here in the report, to be private. A breach of privilege may involve a citizen of this State or a member of this House in punishment.  For that reason every effort should be made and every step should be taken to ensure that there is in fact a breach of privilege before any committee of this House declares that there is.</P>
    <P>Let us look at this matter from a broad general point of view.  Under the Constitution of this State, Article 15 (10) deals with the authority of this House in regard to privilege.  I think this is a matter that ought to be considered by this House.  In dealing with the British position I have referred to the &ldquo;custom of Parliament&rdquo;.  The custom of Parliament in England is a custom that is recognised by the law of England and by its Constitution.  It is known as the High Court of Parliament and its powers are not laid down in any statute or in any written Constitution. We here as a Parliament have no right to create authority on the custom of Parliament.  No such right is given to us by the Constitution. In attempting to establish rights we are doing something that is not given to us by the Constitution.  That is why, when I was referring to the position in Britain, I referred so often to the custom of Parliament.  It is a very interesting study.</P>
    <P>I must frankly admit that I have not made a complete study of the matter.  I do not think any Deputy here has made a complete study of it but it is well worth studying, particularly by those young Deputies on whose shoulders will devolve the burden and responsibility of maintaining rights in the future.  In Britain, the position is that Parliament is supreme and the custom of Parliament is higher than the law.</P>
    <P>Article 15 (10) of our Constitution states&mdash;remember this is the only Article in the Constitution that I can find which deals with the matter:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Each House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders with power to attach penalties for their infringement.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> Let me stop there.  We can make our own rules and our own Standing Orders and we have power to attach penalties for their infringement.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It shall have power to ensure freedom of debate, to protect its official documents and the private papers of its members and to protect itself and its members against any person or persons interfering with, molesting or attempting to corrupt its members in the exercise of their duties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The powers that are given to Dáil Éireann under the Constitution are powers that are very limited and they do not correspond in any way to the powers of the British Parliament as established by the custom of Parliament and by their traditions.  All that this Parliament can do is to make rules and Standing Orders.  That is the first thing it can do.  It has power then to ensure freedom of debate.  It has power to protect its official documents and the private papers of its members.  As to what that means, there ought to be some clarification.  But, having dealt with these three points, its only other power is to protect itself and its members against any person or persons&mdash; I want to point out the three things &mdash;interfering with, molesting or attempting to corrupt its members. We have the power to protect the Dáil and its members against any person or persons interfering with, molesting or attempting to corrupt its members in the exercise of their duties.</P>
    <P>These are the powers of Parliament as set out in the Constitution and the powers of Parliament as set out in that Constitution, in my view, do not give to this House the right to declare that what occurred in this case was a breach of privilege.  We cannot go outside the law or the rules or the Constitution.  We are not entitled to do it.</P>
    <P>This same question, I understand, has been considered by other Parliaments than this.  I understand that the members of Parliaments in the British Dominions which are set up in one way or another felt they could not invoke the custom of the British Parliament <Col N="879" /> and that their powers to deal with individuals, whether they were in Parliament or elsewhere, derive from laws that were passed by their Houses of Parliament.  Similarly, it would be my submission for consideration that, before any person, newspaperman, newspaper proprietor, newspaper reporter, newspaper editor, member of the Dáil or any other citizen can be adjudged guilty of a breach of privilege in this House, the privilege must be set out clearly in a law passed by the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas consists of the two Houses and the President.</P>
    <P>I understand that that is the position in the British Dominions and I understand, further, that this matter was considered by our Government many years ago.  I do not think it was the present Government when they were previously in office or the last Government, but I do understand&mdash;in this I am subject to correction&mdash;that the matter was, in fact, considered and that a draft of the Bill that should be adopted to provide for the privileges of Parliament was, in fact, made.</P>
    <P>I think I have said sufficient on this important matter to justify this House in requesting the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to reconsider the matter in the light of the arguments that have been adduced.  Privilege is a very important matter.  Breach of privilege is a very important matter. It is not a matter that can be lightly dealt with, as this has been dealt with, without reference to authorities, without reference to the provisions of our own Standing Orders, without reference to the provisions of our own Constitution and without reference to the fact that the report, the publication of which was objected to, was in fact laid on the Table of the House and was a public document before its publication, because it was laid on the Table of the House on the 24th April, 1953, and the publication complained of appeared on the 3rd May, 1953.</P>
    <P>This is not a Party matter.  A matter of privilege cannot be a matter of Party.  It can only be a matter in which each individual member must <Col N="880" /> take a very serious, a very deep and a very grave interest.  I ask the House, for the reasons I have stated, to refer the matter back to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that they may consider it in the light of the arguments I have advanced.</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  The committee deliberated and I shall certainly not be guilty of a breach of confidence and say what took place at these deliberations because it would be a breach of confidence to my colleagues on the committee.  I can, however, say, without any such breach of confidence, that when I agreed to the Report of the Committee I was fully aware of the fact that the report was on the Table of the House and I was fully aware of the contents of the Standing Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowan, in making his case, gave us a long dissertation and quoted excerpts from Erskine May, which <Col N="881" /> some of us who were interested in the matter had already read long before we considered this report.  They were all based on the common and correct assumption that the British Constitution is an unwritten one and that our Constitution is a written Constitution and, therefore, anything that is based on the build-up of custom over the years on an unwritten Constitution can be, but is not necessarily, a binding force.  When the matter is one that is dealt with by a written Constitution and by a phrase in that written Constitution the position is different.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how anybody can understand the meaning of Article 15 (10) except to cover a case such as this. &ldquo;Each House... shall have power to protect its official documents.&rdquo; Surely that gives this House power to determine what protection it wants for its official documents and whether it can direct that its official documents shall be published in one way or another.  I cannot see, otherwise, what the proper and the full significance of that phrase in that Article is.  I do not think that we need for one second consider parliamentary procedure in regard to this.  Let us consider ordinary common practice, ordinary common behaviour in any business transaction.  If any of us appoints any person to be an agent to do a job for us, to carry out a certain transaction&mdash; say I, in Dublin, ask somebody in Cork to carry out a transaction for me in Cork, that person is my agent, and surely it is common ground amongst all of us that that agent has no right to disclose to anyone else what he has done until he has first disclosed it to me.  Cork is one day's post away from Dublin, and supposing I ask somebody in Cork to carry out a transaction for me and he does it down there and posts me a letter this evening in Cork which I will not get until to-morrow, is he free there and then to say that the letter has been posted and that therefore it is open to the public, and because it has been put in the letter-box they are free to discuss it and it is to be treated in exactly the same way as if I had already received the letter?  Of course not.</P>
    <P>The sending of this document in this <Col N="882" /> case by us to be printed is exactly the same as putting a letter in the letter box.  The letter is not received until the time it is delivered, and in just the same way reports are not received by the Deputies in the House until the printing has been completed and they are delivered.  A committee of the House that is set up is entrusted with the duties that are given to it by the House.  The committee on judicial salaries was entrusted with certain duties, to make those investigations and so forth.  The committees have the right to determine whether they are going to be in public or in private. That committee determined that it was to be in private, and having determined that it was to be in private it seems to me clear that the members of the House as a whole are entitled to get, each of us at the same time, the formal report of that committee, rather than that any one of us should be entitled to disclose publicly to the public as a whole what the contents of that are.</P>
    <P>In the same way this House, as a matter of custom and habit, if you like, hands to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges the right to investigate and look after detailed matters of this sort, and I think that the House should accept the position that the committee did its job carefully and well and considered all the aspects of the situation which were relevant and open to it.</P>
    <P>While I am quite satisfied that it was quite wrong and would be quite wrong for anyone to disclose publicly a report of a committee before it was circulated to all the members of the Dáil, and while I am quite satisfied with the report which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have put before us, I do think that I must in fairness say that I accept the statement of the editor of this newspaper that the disclosure in this case by him was entirely innocent and that he did not appreciate that it was in fact wrong to do it in the way he did, possibly because under the unwritten British Constitution it might not be wrong.  That may have been his reason; I do not know; but I am quite satisfied that there were circumstances here of a special character.</P>
    <P>We have only to consider for one <Col N="883" /> second what would be the position if the finding of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges were not correct. It would be perfectly obvious that if this was not the correct way to deal with reports of committees, every time a committee concluded every member of that committee would be badgered up and down and round the place to say what was in it and we would get our first impressions of the reports of the committee from the newspapers rather than from official documents.  Some members of the House would get them from one newspaper, others would get them from another, and they would all be somewhat coloured according to whichever side one read them on.  It is far better, obviously, to get them in an official report.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the committee, when they were discussing this matter, had all the relevant information before those members of it, at any rate, who were interested in it; some of them were not available.  I am quite satisfied that under the power in the Constitution and of the Article mentioned there is ample power for the House to decide that this is the proper way of protecting its official documents, and if we did not protect them in that way we would have complete chaos.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the House should be grateful to Deputy Cowan for raising this matter.  If Deputies of this House coming to a common-sense decision were going to be governed entirely by legal arguments carried out in England I fear we would not do any common-sense business.  It all sounds very well for legal gentlemen to stand up here and quote for us the rulings of the Speaker of the House of Commons, but we, too, have some body of common sense here in the conduct of our own business, and I think it is a breach of privilege for any member of this House to attempt to create a position that this House would not be zealous in guarding the rights of its Committee on Procedure and Privileges, because the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, as a committee <Col N="884" /> with members of all our different political parties, must be regarded as something almost sacred because it is the one committee of this House that does not know party affiliations in coming to a decision on a matter of privilege.</P>
      <P>We have several times in this House listened to arguments being put forward as to why we should not follow the procedure adopted in the British Houses of Parliament.  Now we have a report here from our own Committee on Procedure and Privileges which carefully examined this matter, examined it very seriously and gave their time on four different occasions to examining it and did not come to any hasty decision, and who are empowered to make a report to the Dáil and who made that report entirely for the protection of their official documents as set out in paragraph 6 here.  It was perfectly open to that committee, after making their decision, to ask the Dáil to implement their decision by having it printed and laid on the Table of the House.  Surely having gone to that trouble and having debated it from every point of view, not having the Press present, no member here now at this stage or at any stage in my opinion can give the reasons which led to the committee coming to that unanimous decision.  While the case made by Deputy Cowan may be interesting from the point of view of making that committee consider on a different line further reports that they may make, for their education if you like, still I think that this House can do nothing else except to stand by this Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I think it is unusual, in this Parliament at any rate, to have such a matter brought up in this manner.  Whatever about the legal position, I do not think it is showing great common sense&mdash; certainly it is not showing great common sense from our point of view &mdash;to insist that we should be entirely guided here by any decision reached in the British Parliament.  For that reason, I think that we should definitely stand by this Report which was made by our Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>This report was prepared, drafted and presented to the House after very careful and mature consideration of this whole problem.  Deputy Cowan has displayed admirable industry and energy in amassing proofs of the arguments which he put before the House this evening.  He has done a public service in putting his point of view so strongly, cogently and effectively.</P>
      <P>I think it will be generally agreed that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is one of the most important committees in the Dáil.  Its work has been very valuable in preserving the rights of private Deputies and in making things plain that were not plain before.  Many serious matters have been referred to the committee &mdash;some of them matters which were much more serious than this question of a breach of privilege that we are discussing now.  There may have been a few occasions on which there were complete differences of opinion but in practically every case the approach of the committee was dispassionate and careful and the problems were suitably resolved to the satisfaction of everybody concerned and that of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to admit for a moment that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in their consideration of this matter, dealt with it lightly or dealt with it in a careless manner or in a manner which was not desirable <Col N="886" /> in view of its gravity.  We discussed this matter at four different meetings of the committee and we went into all aspects of it.  The fact that there has not been any reference in the report to certain aspects of the case to which Deputy Cowan referred does not mean that these aspects were not carefully considered by the committee. The committee presented their report to the House after the most mature and careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I think that this is the first case of its kind that has come before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges since the establishment of this Dáil in 1919.  We felt that we must not always be guided by precedents that are created in other countries&mdash;in England and elsewhere.  We felt that, on occasions, we have to make our own precedents.  I think that that was the feeling of the committee in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>It is not a fair argument that we should be governed in our decision by what was considered to be privileged in one case or not privileged in another case so far as a breach of privilege, or otherwise, is concerned.  This was the first case of the kind that arose with regard to a breach of privilege by a newspaper.  I think the committee were cognisant of the fact that they were coming to a decision that might have an influence and bearing on any future case of this kind that might arise. Nevertheless, they came unanimously to their decision and they decided to put this report before the Dáil and to ask the Dáil to adopt it.</P>
    <P>I do not see that there is any reason to refer back this report.  I do not see that there is any basis on which the committee could reconsider the matter.  I believe that all the aspects which were mentioned by Deputy Cowan were carefully considered by the committee before they came to their decision.  Therefore, I respectfully ask the Dáil to agree to adopt the report as it has been presented by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <P>I just want to ask one question.  In view of paragraph 135 of Standing Orders, which states that all papers and documents laid on <Col N="887" /> the Table shall be considered public, how did the Committee on Procedure and Privileges consider that a document laid on the Table of this House was not a public document?</P>

      <NameTxt>Donnchadh Ó Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>The opinion of the committee was that the contents of the document were not published until it was effectively available to the members of the House and they felt that it should not be published until it was effectively available to the members of the House.  It is all a question of interpretation.  Deputy Cowan has <Col N="888" /> one interpretation and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges have another interpretation.  The interpretation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is the common interpretation of a body of Deputies that was appointed by this House to act on that committee.  They may be wise or they may be unwise: they may be wrong and Deputy Cowan may be right, or they may be right in their approach to this matter and Deputy Cowan may be wrong but, in any case, this is their report and I do not think that any reconsideration that might be embarked upon by that committee would change them in the view they have adopted.  I think that that is only a reasonable interpretation of the attitude that the committee adopted in coming to the decision which they came to, after weighing the whole matter very carefully from every aspect and giving it every consideration.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to speak on this Estimate at this stage but I must confess that I was rather surprised to hear the Minister underlining the desirability of an expansion in the export of manufactured goods. I do not think any sensible man in this country believes that it is humanly possible for our manufacturers, after a very brief experience and with limited mechanical equipment, to compete in a free competitive world market to-day. I was equally surprised to hear Deputy Cosgrave follow the same trend of thought.  What I think our manufacturers should aim at, in order to promote economic recovery is to provide, as far as is humanly possible, for our own requirements here first in every sphere.  I do not deny for a moment that it might be possible to develop an Irish export trade in specialised lines.  In that connection if we can cultivate, or get the American people to cultivate, a taste for Irish whiskey it would be a big step forward. I think that that, too, will require time. People do not develop a taste for whiskey overnight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inform Deputy Corry that what I state is quite true.  I speak from experience, though he may not believe it.  If the American people have been accustomed to drinking Scotch whiskey for a number of years, it is not at all likely that they will immediately switch over to Irish whiskey, but I do believe it would be possible, over a long space of time, to get them to develop a taste for Irish whiskey.  As Deputy McQuillan has stated in connection with the motion which he intends to move, from every point of view that would be an industry that would be well worth developing.  From the point of view of the Irish producer, the barley growers, from the point of view of the employment, although it might not be on a very large scale, and from the point of view of dollar earnings, the export of Irish whiskey could not be estimated too highly.</P>
      <P>I think that the first step towards that very desirable achievement would be to try to ascertain what particular brand of whiskey we manufacture here the Americans would find most palatable.  To a man who is accustomed to drinking Irish whiskey, Scotch whiskey is not palatable at all. I must say that at the time I drank whiskey it never occurred to me to drink Scotch whiskey if I could get Irish whiskey.  First of all, if I am rightly informed Irish whiskey is very much stronger.  It is 25 or 24 u.p. and Scotch whiskey is 30 u.p.  Therefore the strength of Irish whiskey is very much greater than that of Scotch whiskey.  Perhaps the American people are not fond of strong whiskey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that on a very well remembered occasion, when the merits of Irish and Scotch whiskey came up for consideration and discussion outside <Col N="891" /> this House and when people on the Continent of Europe got an opportunity of sampling Irish whiskey through the generosity of some of the Irish distillers, frankly they were afraid to take more than half a glass.  They felt that they would not be able to take it, and these people could consume a reasonable amount of Scotch whiskey.</P>
    <P>The point I am trying to make is that we must try to find out, or somebody on behalf of our export trade must find out, how we can make Irish whiskey palatable to the American people and then try to turn out that whiskey in the largest possible quantity.  I know that this would be of the utmost importance to many of my constituents.  In the extreme end of the county, for some reason which I cannot explain, we can grow excellent crops of barley and, peculiarly enough, even with the best process of rotation and manurial treatment, we cannot produce good crops of wheat in the same area. The people in that area were very seriously affected last year when they were notified that their contracts were cut by 50 per cent.  That is my main reason for entering on that point.  But I do say that, while it may be possible to develop our export trade in specialist lines such as whiskey, I do not think it is fair to expect Irish manufacturers to be able to compete with countries which have generations of experience behind them, have the most up-to-date machinery and the best available technicians.  We can, however, develop our manufacturing industry here if we try to cater for our own requirements. Anybody who looks at the list of imports furnished month after month must be struck by the enormous amount of money which we pay out for commodities which we could produce ourselves.</P>
    <P>In the development of Irish industry I have always believed and stated that we should concentrate on the manufacture of those commodities of which we have the raw material here.  To my mind, the only way we can really bring about full employment is if we keep <Col N="892" /> those employed on the land producing the raw material, the raw material being transported to the factories, turned into the finished article and retailed over the counter.</P>
    <P>I think the finest example of a native industry which ought to succeed in this country is the beet industry, where you have farmers' sons employed on the land producing the beet and, in the off-season, where you have other farmers' sons, or perhaps the same farmers' sons, employed in the factory converting that beet into sugar, with your home market to use the finished article.  That is one example of an industry which can develop well.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to the Government and whatever Government may come into existence in this country that we should concentrate on the home market, on the development of those industries of which we have the raw material in the country, before we think of capturing an export market in the world as it is to-day.  I hope it is possible to achieve it, and I should like to see it a success, but I must confess that I am very sceptical on that point.</P>
    <P>It must be very disheartening for the Minister and the Government to realise that the cost of living here is much higher than in practically all countries on the Continent.  Out of a list of 14 countries, even with recent adjustments in price index, we are still eight points ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is understandable and I am sure the Minister will not deny that the withdrawal of the subsidies contributed largely <Col N="893" /> towards that position.  In fact I think that in reply to a parliamentary question, it was stated that the withdrawal of the subsidies alone accounted for a rise of ten points in the cost of living index.  But I do not consider that a high cost of living is in itself a disaster.  I would not view it in that way provided the citizens had the ability to pay the high prices.  For instance, I would not suggest that it would be highly desirable to see in the windows of Dublin shops a loaf of bread at 4d. if a man had only 2d. in his pocket; he is still going to remain hungry, whereas, if a loaf of bread was 1/- and if he had 2/6 in his pocket, he would be far better off.  It is the ability to buy the commodity and the facility with which the citizen can purchase it that matters, not the price.  But when you have a country with a remarkably high cost of living figure and in that country you have an abnormally high list of unemployed, you always have hardship, because it is bad enough if the pay envelope is not able to purchase the week's requirements, but it is infinitely worse if there is no pay envelope at all or if the State, in an effort to help a citizen to carry on a very unenviable existence has to come to his assistance by way of relief and doles.  I do not say that the Government are responsible.  I am only mentioning the point so that I might focus attention on it and so that it may be remedied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a situation in this country whereby we have able-bodied men remaining idle daily and weekly when they should be employed on productive work and I emphasise productive work.  I do not regard full employment, so popularly referred to now, as the real end.  I always think of full productive employment.  If it is not productive it is not nationally desirable. You could have men employed digging holes in the road.  That was the way they were employed after the Famine of 1847 but that was not going to do this nation any good.  If we employ the men on productive work, producing something that the nation requires, then the nation is prosperous. Hand in hand with the development of our own national resources, there <Col N="894" /> should be development of State industries that would cater for our needs.</P>

      <P>They would produce wealth.  If they work they must produce wealth.  I know it is quite a common thing to suggest that building is not very productive work but it provides amenities by which the man or the woman who lives in a comfortable house is better able to do a day's work. They are more inclined to do a day's work and they see some reason for doing a day's work.  But if they live in a hovel, as many of our citizens do in the cities and in the country even in 1953, notwithstanding the wonderful work that has been done by successive Governments over a long period, that incentive is absent.</P>
      <P>Our housing conditions are not yet what they ought to be.  We cannot blame ourselves for it.  We must not forget, when thinking of national development, that this country was oppressed for 700 years by an alien Government.  No attempt was made to develop our resources.  In this very city, if the national financial resources were available, we could put every man to work on very necessary work and provide a tunnel for the people to get through in safety by an underground railway, which must come some time.</P>
      <P>The traffic in this city is really perilous for the people who have to travel through it.  At some time, some Government must face up to the fact that we want an underground railway in this city.  If we had the financial resources we could engage our people on that project and thus save valuable human lives.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hickey will not draw me into that eternal problem of credit because I am not able to deal with the problem of credit.  I wish I was or that somebody in the country was.  Let me say this much to Deputy Hickey&mdash;that paper money, credit or anything else he can think of is no <Col N="895" /> substitute for production, and without production you have no wealth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could sympathise with any Government that has been in existence or that will come into existence here, because I am sure that any sensible Government will naturally, during its term of office, do everything it possibly can to popularise itself. That is human.  The more popular they make themselves the better chance they have of remaining in power term after term.</P>
      <P>As I was saying, when I was interrupted, we have a very great leeway to make up.  For years and years very little national development took place here.  Our country was depressed economically and financially.  But even if it were not, there was no goodwill or desire to develop the country along national lines.  For that reason, we should concentrate on using, as Deputy Hickey put it, man-power in every possible direction.</P>
      <P>Naturally, agriculture offers the best field, but for some reason or another our people are not inclined to remain on the land.  You could advance many reasons for that and you might not be right in any of them. I have often asked myself what is the cause of that, because I regard life on the land as a very nice life and a healthy one.  Rightly or wrongly, there is an impression in the minds of many that the man on the land has to maintain every other stratum of society in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think a very good argument can be put forward for the boys and particularly for the girls not wanting to live on the land.  I think it is in connection with the female that the real problem lies.  When she will not remain on the land, all the young farmer can do is to get off the land himself.  You will find it very difficult &mdash;and Deputy Corry knows this well enough, although he is smiling-to get a girl to marry a farmer to-day.  That is true.  Perhaps, rural electrification and the development of other social <Col N="896" /> amenities may lighten the drudgery for the farmer's wife.  Modern science may brighten the outlook for those people, but until it does, I am afraid we have got to become accustomed to the idea of the drift from the land.</P>
    <P>When they leave the land they do not want to leave the country if they can help it.  The first thing they do is to drift into the towns and cities. When I hear people saying that agricultral production is not what it ought to be, I wonder do they realise that year after year the very best manhood of the country is leaving the land and leaving production.  Those who remain&mdash;and their numbers are diminishing considerably&mdash;must work harder to keep production up.  It stands to reason that if you have 1,000 people producing a certain amount of stuff and if you reduce that number by 300 the remaining 700 must work much harder than the 1,000 to produce the same.</P>

      <P>There will be snags in it, I know.  It will not be possible, with the present drift from the land, to maintain the level of production which would be required to keep a reasonable standard of living and provide an exportable surplus without intensive mechanisation.  I want to say, as I said in the other House, that I do not rejoice in the fact that the horse is disappearing from the Irish countryside because I realise the national dangers involved in that.  I can visualise the time, either during another emergency or another war, when we will have to produce enormous quantities of food here for our people, and when we might not be able to get the fuel to work mechanised transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember that we can always get the fuel for the horse.  We could provide the grass, the oats and the hay.  If we have to depend on a foreign Power to provide the fuel we require to drive the machinery that is to produce our food in an emergency, which everyone knows will come sooner or later, then I think the enemy at the door might be in a position to dictate his terms.</P>
      <P>These are things that we cannot close our eyes to.  They may be foolish things to say because I know that you cannot put back the hands of the clock and that you cannot stop progress.  In my honest opinion, the worst thing that ever came into this country was the motor car, the petrol to drive it, the tyres to put on it and the spare parts, all of which have to be imported. Every penny spent on these things goes out of the country.  The position is there now, and I suppose there is no use in talking about it.  If one could calculate the amount of money that left the shores of Ireland since the introduction of the motor car, and the sums that have since been spent on spare parts, on oil and rubber for motor cars, I am sure that the total sum would be sufficient to solve all our economic problems here.  We should remember these points when talking about mechanised farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies may think that I am just talking to fill in time.  At any rate, I commend these points to the House, not in any political spirit because I know that the difficulties which confront the present Government would confront a Government composed of people over here if it were formed to-morrow.  I do not think there is any great difference at all amongst us here.  There is no real difference.  There cannot be any political difference.  We may differ on economic issues, but when dealing with the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce, I do not thing there is any necessity for carping or for scoring political points.  If we try to represent our views in the best way we can, then that may be of help to whatever Government is in power in examining the situation and in trying to remedy whatever evils exist.  I will now give <Col N="898" /> way to some other Deputy who perhaps may air his point of view better.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful indeed to the Deputy.  He spoke of agricultural production and bewailed the loss of the horse and the flight from the land.  There are a couple of matters that I intend to bring to the notice of the Deputies opposite.  The first is that no Government in this country, from any side of this House, so far as I can see, is prepared to pay the man on the land the wage essential to keep him there.  We might as well get clear on that issue once and for all.  That is one reason why we have farmers bothering their brains every other day looking for mechanised methods of doing the work that is required to be done on the land. At every by-election, you have Deputies of this House shouting about the price of bread, the price of butter and the price of this and that at a time when the wage of agricultural labourers is still roughly only about £4 5s. a week, while men in industry are getting from £7 10s. to £8 a week, and in many cases up to £10 and £11 a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to relate a number of things to the Vote within the next couple of hours.  I should like to deal with the question of whiskey.  As far as the members of the agricultural community are concerned, they have very little to thank the distillers for.  The distilling industry came out this year with a definite programme which, in my opinion, was a move at sabotage.  They reduced their acreage requirements of malting barley by 50 per cent. on a crop the produce of which they will not be putting on the market for another seven years.  They do not <Col N="899" /> deserve any assistance from any Government, and the House should get clear on that.</P>
      <P>The distillers of this country this year deliberately reduced their contract acreage by 50 per cent. in the full knowledge that the whiskey to be produced from this year's barley crop would not be put on the market for another seven years.  Then we wonder, what is the cause of some of the unemployment that we have.  I do not know what political Party was responsible for that or what moves behind the scenes were responsible for that, but the fact is that it happened.  I would like to bring that matter to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance if he were here.</P>

      <P>These are the facts and they are undeniable&mdash;that there was a deliberate attempt at sabotage this year on the part of the distillers in this country.  I do not mind the brewers.  They put their product on the market in the following year.  I am speaking of the people who will not be putting their product on the market for another seven years.  They are the people that we are being asked to break our necks for and to look for a market abroad for them.  There are enough Irish people in America to drink all the Irish whiskey that goes in there.  They have not developed a taste for Scotch whiskey.  I met many of them when they came back here, and they were shouting for &ldquo;Paddy Flaherty&rdquo; the moment they landed.  They could drink it, too.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is already very familiar with the terms of the sections of the Bill that have been tabled by members of <Col N="900" /> the Fine Gael Party.  The Bill is: &ldquo;An Act to amend the Valuation Acts so as to provide certain reliefs in respect of increased valuations resulting from improvements to business premises and to certain farm buildings and outhouses and also to amend the law relating to revision of valuations generally.&rdquo;  I respectfully submit to the House that the principle in the very last sentence of that, that is, &ldquo;to amend the law relating to revision of valuations generally&rdquo;, is included very fully if this Bill becomes an Act.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out in this House on more than one occasion, the changing of the law in connection with the administration of the Office of the Commissioners of Valuation is long overdue.  I think it was Deputy Davin who referred last week to the existing laws relating to valuations as 101 years old.  One would imagine that an Irish Government would be only too eager and only too anxious to avail of the first opportunity of amending legislation by an alien Government if they considered that it imposed hardships upon our people.  As other speakers who are supporting this Bill have said, there is no doubt that as the law relating to valuations stands it is defective and should be scrapped.</P>
      <P>The whole system of levying valuations is wrong and it is wrong from the very start.  As the law stands the first advice relating to valuation comes from the local rate collector and if the local collector makes a report to the secretary of his county council and if he states that a ratepayer in his area has carried out certain improvements on his out-offices, on his farm buildings or on his dwelling-house, that rate collector's report will be submitted to the secretary of the county council and transmitted from the county council secretary to the office of the Commissioners of Valuation.  Then an inquiry as to the extent of the improvements is undertaken by an officer of the Valuation Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how competent or how fully qualified these officers are to estimate the extent of improvements but I say from my experience in my own constituency and from the references <Col N="901" /> that have been made by other Deputies&mdash;and from their references we understand that similar conditions prevail in those areas&mdash;those inspectors who value the improvements or who estimate benefits to come from the improvements, are very much inclined to exaggerate grossly in favour of the Valuation Office.  I think it is entirely wrong that it should be left, in the first instance, to the local rate collector to make the report to the county council because it has been proved without doubt in many areas where a rate collector may have a political axe to grind or political prejudice against his neighbour, he avails of the first opportunity to give his neighbour what is commonly described in the country as &ldquo;a stab in the back.&rdquo;  Even where a pier has been erected on which to hang a gate, the local rate collector, if he is loyal to the Party that appointed him as a rate collector, will lose no time if he sees he has a political point to score and will report his neighbour as having carried out improvements. If instead of a gate hanging on an ordinary timber pole planted into the ground, the gate is swinging from concrete posts, no matter how cheap those posts may be to manufacture or erect, the rate collector will immediately say that in his opinion the holding has considerably improved as a result of the erection of the piers. He looks upon it as an improvement in the holding.  How many cases have we, particularly in the County of Galway where on every possible occasion a rate collector loses no time in submitting a detailed report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He will submit his report and he will make quite sure, as many rate collectors have done, that his own friends and colleagues can carry out what improvements they like without the knowledge of the local authority or the Commissioners of Valuation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I say the Valuation Office should be administered from a more impartial angle as far as the reports of revaluations are concerned.  I respectfully submit that this Bill before the House is to amend the law relating to revision of valuations generally.  We have seen that in our towns and in the cities improvements have been carried out, as was pointed out by the mover of the Bill, in accordance with the regulations laid down by the Department of Health.  In these cases where the Department of Health recommended or insisted that certain regulations be complied with under the direction of the county medical officer of health, I feel that it is most unfair and it is legalised robbery to compel those people to carry out improvements on their buildings in order to comply with the law whether they may be running a hotel business or a restaurant or whether it is a café establishment or whatever line of business they follow.</P>
      <P>If the corporation, the county council or other local authority make them carry out improvements I think it is very wrong that these people should be made spend their money in improving their buildings in order that they may carry on their business or in order that they may secure a livelihood. Many of these people, owing to the present day difficulties, are put to the pin of their collar to eke out a miserable existence from the amount of business being done in their various lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Valuations have been increased to such an extent recently that we are inclined to have sooner or later an uprising by the people.  Every local authority in the country has protested and every Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party must have received protests in the same manner and imbued with the same determination and with the same view in mind as those which we Deputies of the Opposition have received.  One is inclined to give serious thought to the manner in which Fianna Fáil Deputies ignore and turn a deaf ear to the seriousness of the situation in relation to the very grave injustices imposed without any regard whatever for the amount of <Col N="903" /> benefit that will flow from the improvements carried out.</P>
    <P>In the town of Tullamore, I have known a certain revision of valuation in the case of a licensed premises to have been carried out because either a new window was put in or a new counter erected.  I have known of a case in that town in which a publican decided that, instead of having the water-taps in his bottling store, he would have them under the counter in his shop, in accordance with health regulations, and there and then it was reported to the council.  At present, he has an appeal submitted against what he rightly describes as the effort of the Valuation Office to put him out of business.</P>
    <P>Instead of giving these people who are going through difficult times a helping hand, instead of giving them some encouragement to undertake the difficult task of holding on to their businesses or building up stronger and better businesses, we find the Government devoting all their energies, availing of a law 101 years old, to drive these people out of business, to increase the cost of their tobacco licences, the cost of the licence in respect of their licensed premises and their E.S.B. charges, because, if valuations go up, these charges are increased.  Be that as it is, every urban district council and every corporation to-day has the experience of increasing rates upon these people, apart entirely from increases brought about by revaluation.</P>
    <P>We see occupiers of premises faced year after year with substantial increases in rates, whether it is a business house of any grade or class or the humble dwelling of the worker, whether he be a tenant of a town council house or a cottage tenant. Month after month, it has been the policy of the Government to place more burdens on the shoulders of local authorities, which, in turn, places a more severe strain on the pockets of all these ratepayers.  We know that that situation is a very unhappy one for the ratepayers, but, in addition to that unhappy burden, <Col N="904" /> ruthlessly and without consideration imposed by the Government on these local authorities which are compelled to increase these rates, we find the Valuation Office let loose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for the purpose of increasing valuations on everybody they can find.  The case cannot be made by the Minister for Finance that this Bill will cover only business premises.  This Bill is designed to revise the system of valuation generally, and, if it becomes an Act, it will be of outstanding benefit not alone to the business community but to all sections of the people, and particularly the agricultural community about whom we hear so much at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not well known that there are cases of farmers who are anxious to improve their holdings, who are more than anxious to avail of the land reclamation scheme and of the grants available under farm building schemes?  We know that certain farmers, from a sense of civic decency and pride are anxious to make their holdings model holdings, holdings which are respectable, tidy and worthy of the tradition of the good Irish farm homestead.  The improvements they may wish to carry out may be in the nature of the removal of the old thatched roof, which every medical authority in the country to-day declares is a handsome dwelling for all sorts and sizes of microbes and germ-carriers injurious to the health of those who live under it&mdash; and there are people who are anxious, at their own expense without availing of any grants, to replace these thatched roofs by tiles or slates&mdash;but the Valuation Office has no regard whatever for the financial circumstances of the industrious men who are anxious to carry out these improvements. Bad as it is that these men should be taxed in respect of the repair of their own houses, it is worse that they should be taxed out of all proportion to the value of the improvements by the Valuation Office in respect of improvements carried out <Col N="905" /> on their piggeries, their stables, their barns, their grain-stores and their machinery-houses.</P>
    <P>As the system of valuation is framed at present, it is a hindrance to the agricultural community in the carrying out of improvements not alone to their own homes but to their out-offices. Deputies know many cases&mdash;the cases indeed are not few&mdash;in which constituents tell them that they are anxious to carry out improvements, but are afraid to carry them out because the dead hand of the Commissioners of Valuation is likely to fall very heavily on them, if they do.  Is it not an extraordinary state of affairs that our people to-day are afraid to improve their dwelling-houses, their business premises, their piggeries or their stables because of the existing valuation system which imposes unjust, cruel, brutal and uncalled for increases in their valuations?  Is it not high time that some Government dealt with this matter as it should be dealt with?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance tells us that the Government has legislation in mind to deal with the grievances of those who have been unjustly treated by the Valuation Office.  During the Galway by-election the Taoiseach loudly proclaimed that the Government had a Valuation Bill in mind.  Despite the fact that the Taoiseach promised this legislation at that time his Minister for Finance last week never once referred to it He went through this Bill section by section.  He criticised it and he criticised the promoters of the Bill. He tried to make the case that this Bill would confer no benefit of any kind on the community.  Never once did he tell the House what he had in mind. Never once did he ask the promoters of this measure to withdraw it so that he might introduce a similar, or even a better Bill.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government to introduce legislation to remedy the grievances that exist.  A Bill of this type is long overdue.  If accepted, it is one which will bring great benefits to the community as a whole.  If it is enacted, it will have the effect of putting a stop to increasing valuations. Surely that is not too much to ask.  What objection has the Minister <Col N="906" /> to giving instructions to the Valuation Office to the effect that there must be no further increases in valuations? Surely such a message would not choke the Minister for Finance.  Surely the Minister will not be put under any undue physical strain in delivering such a message to the Valuation Office.  If he has not the courage, the energy or the physical strength to give such an instruction to the Valuation Office he has in his Department a staff that can do it for him with a stroke of the pen.</P>
    <P>That is all this Bill asks.  What opposition can any Fianna Fáil Deputy have to that?  The Minister did not say this was a bad Bill.  No Fianna Fáil Deputy can say it is a bad Bill. Never once did the Minister say that this Bill was not demanded by the public generally.  The various chambers of commerce throughout the country have made repeated requests both to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government for legislation of this kind.  So far it has not been forthcoming.  Never once did the Minister refer to the numerous deputations he has received in connection with this matter.  Never once did he refer to the many complaints from his own constituents who have been unfairly treated because of increasing valuations.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House. It is one which should have the approval of the House.  Apparently the Government is not prepared to accept this Bill.  They might at least tell us what legislation they have in mind so that we may allay the growing public uneasiness that prevails throughout the country because of the manner in which valuations are increasing. People to-day are selling their homes because they are overvalued and too highly rated.  No attention is paid to the capacity of a person to pay increased valuation when any improvements are carried out.  That section of this Bill which puts an end to that practice should have a whole-hearted welcome.  If this Bill passes into law it will have the effect of providing more employment.  Farmers will improve homesteads and out-offices.  More material will be purchased.  More will <Col N="907" /> be paid out in wages for services rendered.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that people are afraid to carry out improvements at the present time?  This is a good Bill. If it needs amendment, Deputies have the opportunity now of amending it. Section 3 meets the wishes of the majority of our people to-day.  I regret the Government has not seen fit to take steps to alleviate the position long before this.  Why do they hesitate? Why do they delay?  They know that any such measure will have the full support of every Deputy in this House.  This Opposition will give the Minister who introduces it every encouragement and co-operation.  The Taoiseach prophesied in Galway.  Unfortunately, that prophecy has not come to pass.  He said the Government was anxious to meet the grievances of the people.  The situation must be remedied.  This measure has not been introduced just for the fun of it. Deputies are not anxious to draft Bills or take up the time of this House unless they know that there is need for such measures.  The general public is calling loudly and angrily for legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>Let us hope and trust that the terms of this Bill will be accepted so that those who are suffering as a result of the existing valuation laws may know that they can carry out improvements and extensions to dwelling-houses, farm out-offices or buildings without the threat of a substantial increase in valuation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a case to be made in defence of this Bill we certainly have not heard it from the Deputy who has just spoken.  He has attempted to palaver the House and possibly he may palaver the country into believing that this Bill provides a solution for what at the very least is a highly technical and highly complex situation.  In the same way as the Minister for Finance is responsible for seeing that the necessary finances are made available for carrying on the annual State services, he has taken upon himself the responsibility, <Col N="908" /> in partnership with the Minister for Local Government for seeing that the valuation laws are carried out. If you change the system of valuation piecemeal in this fashion because some particular interest or interests can organise themselves and secure a following in this House, where will it stop?  Obviously, every section of the ratepayers, if organised, can contend and make a case that they are suffering unduly from the present system.</P>
      <P>It seems clear, therefore, that if there are serious anomalies or even injustices, the proper course would be to go back to what was in mind before the war, that is, to have a general revaluation of the whole country where the whole question of valuations could be dealt with in a scientific, progressive and objective way.</P>
      <P>To try to deal with matters of valuation by picking out particular sections of the community which may feel that they have grievances and attempting to deal with these in this manner is bound to fail because there is the other side of the picture, emphasised quite rightly by the Minister for Finance in his speech, that the general body of ratepayers must suffer to the extent to which special bodies or special interests among the ratepayers get relief.  No matter what amendments are made in the valuation code in this Bill or any other Bill the same amount of rates will have to be paid.  If A, B and C pay less, D, E, F, G and the rest of the alphabet will pay more. Is that not quite clear?  Therefore, in order that A, B and C should persuade the remainder of the ratepayers to bear an additional burden in order to relieve them, those who represent A, B and C must tell the Dáil and the country what exactly the case for relief is and why it is that the injustices in the case of A, B and C are so grave that D, E, F and so on must pay additional rates in order that A, B and C should be relieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan spoke as if there were some inquisitors going around scourging those people who were improving their premises, business or otherwise.  Of course, that is not the position.  Under the existing law, where revision of valuation takes place <Col N="909" /> only about 10 per cent. of the cases in which revisions of valuation were made appealed to the commissioners, and only one-half per cent. appealed to the courts.</P>
    <P>The sponsors of this Bill have forgotten to state to the House and to the country that the aggrieved ratepayer can go to the courts if he considers that the revision of valuation is unjust.  It must be taken from the round figures I have just given that most of the valuations, revaluations or revisions that take place annually are considered satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In the case of dwelling-houses, for example, the erection and improvement of dwelling-houses, as Deputies know, is already provided for in the Local Government (Remission of Rates) Acts, that is, where no grants have been paid.  Where grants are paid in respect of new houses, as the House is also aware, the Housing Acts provide two-thirds remission for seven years.</P>
    <P>In regard to farm buildings, as the Minister for Finance pointed out, a section in the 1852 Valuation Act provides for seven years exemption from rates in respect of any increase in value arising from the erection of farm outhouses or office buildings.  For many years it has been the practice of the Valuation Office to apply the relief laid down in the section to improvements to farm outhouses or office buildings. In fact, the increases in value are not entered in the valuation list until seven years after the erection or improvement has been carried out.  So that, that part of the Bill which purports to deal with the matter of farm buildings and outhouses is unnecessary because the position is that these improvements are not entered into the valuation list for seven years.</P>
    <P>As regards the burden of rates on industry, according to the Census of Industrial Production for 1950, rates constitute three-fifths of one penny per £ of the total value of production, so that they are not a very considerable burden.  In fact, it seems to me that if we intend to maintain, improve and extend our local services and if we have regard to the increases in costs and in services, which all members of local <Col N="910" /> authorities know very well have taken place since the war, it is not really a case of attempting, in piecemeal fashion, to apply a little ointment here and there to relieve certain interests but rather of re-examining the whole position fundamentally in its relation to production, as is being done in connection with income-tax at the present time.  The House knows that a committee has been set up to examine the burden of State taxation in relation to production in so far as the replacement, maintenance and modernisation of industrial machinery are concerned.</P>
    <P>The revisions which take place yearly in respect of rates only amount to about 3 per cent. of the total number of rateable hereditaments.  I think it is an important point in favour of the existing law that no revision of valuation can take place anywhere except at the request of the local authority.  No amount of abuse of rate collectors in Laois-Offaly or Galway or anywhere else can blind us to the fact that the law is that the revision of valuation can only take place on the request of the local authority.  What other system is suggested? Why should the rate collector, who is going about and who sees the situation, sees the property and how it is valued and has a general idea of the conditions, not exercise the power which the law gives him at present of asking for a revision?</P>

      <P>In any case the rate collectors are generally fairly sensible men.  When there is a rate collectorship vacant there is generally a considerable amount of commotion in the area as to who is going to get the post, and we must assume that the local authorities who are entrusted with filling these vacancies give them to responsible persons; but according to Deputy Flanagan rate collecting in this country must have got into the hands of a rather peculiar body of personages who, as I said, can only be compared to inquisitors going around with scourges.  That is not the situation. The fact is that if we do not carry out the existing law with regard to revision of valuation it is quite clear, as the Minister for Finance stressed, that the poundage rates generally throughout the area in which the clauses of this Bill would operate if it became law would have to be increased.  There is no way out of that situation and, therefore, the general body of the community would, as I said in the beginning, have to make up for any deficiency. They would be prevented from getting the benefits of the existing law in so far as the rate collector or otherwise secures revision of valuation, which while it may increase the amount to be paid by certain ratepayers means that other large numbers of ratepayers do not have to pay.  If we are going to be just and fair in this matter I suggest that we have to have regard to the fact that if the Bill became law the general poundage rates would increase and the general body of ratepayers would have to meet whatever additional charges might be required to be borne by them by reason of the fact that they would not be getting the benefits which the law might bring them at present through the revision <Col N="912" /> of valuation on certain rateable properties.</P>
      <P>Rates, also, although paid by business men in respect of their premises can, I take it&mdash;at least a good many economists believe so&mdash;in due course be passed on like other overhead expenses to the consumer or the producer of the goods which the industrialist manufactures, or the business man, the wholesaler or retailer, may distribute.  In any case it is fairly generally believed that business people are in a position to pass on those overhead expenses.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not, as I have suggested, deal with private houses. It deals with business premises and it purports to prevent increases in valuations on business premises unless improvements have taken place. Might I point out to the House that even in respect of the five-fourths valuation at present business premises are entitled to set off the rates paid on their business premises as a charge against their profit, thus meaning that they are saved from income-tax in that respect.  Payers of rates on private residences have to pay income-tax.  Some of us may feel that there is a certain anomaly there.  At any rate, a certain amount has been done to meet the circumstances of business people, who certainly have to improve their premises if they are to maintain their commercial existence.  Very often they have to undertake very heavy substantial expenditure, and the income-tax code has made provision for allowances in that regard.  The full increased valuation, including the five-fourths, of business premises is allowed as a deduction in computing the income-tax liability on the profit under Schedule D of the income-tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It could be pointed out also that in fact all valuations on which rates are paid at the present time are in fact themselves improvements from the historical point of view.  Buildings fall into desuetude, they become ramshackle, they fall down or their owners replace them, and in the course of a generation or two you may have entirely new buildings. Where are you going to draw the line in respect of this relief that you are <Col N="913" /> going to give for improvements?  It is a very, very difficult matter.  The Government has endeavoured to deal with it from rather a different angle, and that is from the point of view of trying to help employment.</P>
    <P>If the amount of employment that we are going to get is not going to bear a substantial and genuine relation to the amount of remission of rates, or taxes for that matter, that you are going to give, the game is not worth the candle.  If, on the other hand, there is an inequitable burden on business people, let the case be examined.</P>
    <P>On the second point, if employment can be given where there is unemployment at the present time by making a concession, the Government is prepared and is having legislation prepared to give rates remission in these cases.  It is a new departure and I hope it will be fully justified by the results.  I hope that we shall have a new look on Dublin City and that when the next Tóstal or the Tóstal immediately following it arrives, our business premises will have been greatly improved and greatly altered as a result of the legislation which the Government hope to bring shortly before this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak in favour of this Bill although I think that, perhaps, I should require certain modifications.  The question of valuation is not as simple as a number of Deputies seem to think.  There is undoubtedly the fact that, on the one hand, if you increase the valuation immediately an improvement is carried out you penalise the man who improves his property whether it be commercial, private or agricultural. On the other hand, you have the Valuation Office&mdash;who are carrying out the wishes of the Government and, indeed, presumably, of successive Governments&mdash;saying that people who erect new premises must not expect to get away with the same old valuation. I think that that sums up the two schools of thought in connection with valuation and the dice has been loaded entirely against the individual who improves his property.  I have seen that from a private point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="914" /> We all have met people who told us that they put up, in the suburbs, perhaps, a very small garage or some sort of a shed to hold a motor car.  The majority of motor cars at the present day are necessary to people.  They are not all by any means luxuries.  Many people have to have motor cars for their business and, anyway, even if they have them as a luxury there is a very great industry there which it is the policy of the Government to encourage.  We all have had experience of hearing people who put up garages in the suburbs complain bitterly of the increase in their valuation. That is the type of action we have had on the part of the Valuation Office which, in my opinion, has not been in the public interest.  When I say &ldquo;Valuation Office&rdquo; I do not say so in any personal sense so far as the officials or the men who are carrying out their work are concerned.  I use the term to describe that part of the Government which carries out governmental policy in relation to valuation.  That is what the Valuation Office are doing and it is their duty to do it but, as a result of successive legislation in this matter, we have now arrived at a situation where initiative is stifled.</P>
    <P>On the industrial and commercial side, every business person has to think very carefully what type of building he will put up and what improvements he will carry out.  In many cases, business people have to consider the matter so carefully from the point of view of increase in valuation that they hinder business in what they eventually do&mdash;and that is something which is not to the benefit, in the main, of the people of this country nor does it help industrial or commercial policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands referred to the poundage.  He seems to think that the poundage would increase if legislation somewhat on the lines of this Bill were passed.  I do not quite follow him on that because, actually, this Bill does not propose a reduction in the valuations: it proposes a freezing of increases in valuations for seven years. Personally, I am inclined to think that that might be too long a period unless you had a much more subtle definition of what really constitutes &ldquo;increase&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> I think the seven years might be too long but, at any rate, it is a step in the right direction because it enshrines in legislation the principle that you are going to give the individual who has carried out improvements, at some cost to himself, time to get over the cost of the improvements before you make him pay an increased rate and an increased income-tax on his improvements.  The difficulty is that the individual who carries out these improvements, by virtue of the increase in valuation, is immediately hit.  I can think straightaway of three different ways in which he is hit.  His rates go up.  He pays income-tax on five-fourths of his valuation immediately.  That means that, for income-tax purposes, for every £1 increase in valuation, income-tax is levied on 25/-.  The third immediate increase is in regard to his basic rate payable to the E.S.B.&mdash;that is, if he is a private individual.  Therefore, there are three different things which hit him straightaway in addition to the cost of putting up the buildings themselves.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that one of the ills which we suffer from in this country is that we have not got enough forms of employment. This House tries to encourage building and industry generally in every way it can and yet the results flowing from our valuation laws are completely at variance with the policy which is enshrined from time to time in the various Bills which come before this House.  That is the most serious aspect of our valuation policy. It is not at all in keeping with our general industrial policy in these respects.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands referred to income-tax on improvements being allowed.  I think he is looking at the problem through rose-coloured spectacles, because that is not at all the experience of commercial people, or of the ordinary individual.  You are not allowed to set off your expenses on improvements in matters like that. The question of capital expenditure on repairs and improvements is a very difficult and complicated one and <Col N="916" /> it has to be gone into by skilled persons.  Again, as a result of the governmental policy in that respect, I am afraid you do not find what the Minister for Land says, so the individual is hit when he carries out the improvements.</P>
    <P>There is another matter in connection with valuations and I am sorry to see that it is not mentioned in this Bill, but perhaps it will be done in the Bill which apparently the Government contemplates bringing in.  The valuations of premises all over the City of Dublin and the suburbs in many cases do not bear any real relation to the present value of the house.  I know buildings which were valued 70 or 80 years ago when there was an idea that people had to pay a very big price for, I suppose, what they thought was the &ldquo;snob&rdquo; appeal of a district.  If a district was what was then considered a high-class district, owing to the low rates which were then paid it did not much matter if the valuation of the house was set very high.  You had these small little local councils which abounded in South County Dublin at that time.  Every time a new building was put up in the area, they practically hung out a flag in the local town hall and said: &ldquo;Here, boys, is another chance to get in £70 or £80 valuation.&rdquo; If the house was put up in a good district, a very high valuation went on it.</P>
    <P>We now live in a period when rates, in the main, are round about 30/- in the £, or very nearly that in most cases, and there is this income-tax on five-fourths; so that a high valuation on a house hits the occupant of that house very heavily indeed now, whereas 70 or 80 years ago the rates did not matter so much.</P>
    <P>There is the further point that in the intervening period what was a high-class district has now become, perhaps, a very different type of district. As a result of the high valuations in many cases the decay of certain districts is accelerated.  You find big houses which have become nowadays difficult to maintain, difficult, in fact almost impossible, to staff.  People have not the money for them and they are houses that were generally somewhat difficult to sell and expensive to <Col N="917" /> live in.  Instead of a reduction of valuation taking place, there is the same high level of valuation levied on those houses.  That again accelerates the decay of a neighbourhood.  The more difficult houses are to sell, the more quickly the neighbourhood decays.</P>
    <P>In that respect our policy on valuation is not used as an instrument of our general policy in respect of houses. I am sure there is no Party or individual in this House who feels that the building up of slums is something that is in the public interest.  I do not think any of us wants to see the decay of property down to the level which some properties reached in the City of Dublin.  If we can do anything to maintain the life of a number of our houses, I think we ought to do it.  One of the ways of helping to maintain these larger and more awkward and expensive houses to run is to see that the valuation is not kept at the level it was when those houses were occupied by people of wealth.  It only means that you are accelerating the decay of those houses and ensuring that they will be turned into tenements.</P>
    <P>There are numbers of other matters in connection with valuations and general policy that I would like to touch on, but they are very complicated and it is difficult to see how a clear policy can be formulated on them.  One of the matters arising from what I said at the beginning of my speech refers to the allowing of improvements. What we would like to see is improvements encouraged and at the same time radical changes also encouraged but paid for in increased valuations where such increased valuation is a fair and equitable thing.  I am not asking that all improvements on buildings should be let off scot-free.  I think that that would be something that we could not stand over because a firm might put up something that really would be a genuine extension to its property.  That would be an addition on which firms would expect to pay a certain, though not a harsh, increase.</P>
    <P>However, there are those highly debatable and, in fact, unjust increases of the type to which Deputy Flanagan has referred.  I did not quite follow Deputy Flanagan in all he said but <Col N="918" /> there are these internal improvements in various business premises in regard to which an increase in valuation is not always merited.  If a publican is charged on an increased valuation for a new counter, that to my mind is something that is very foolish and wrong especially where such improvements have been carried out in compliance with the Health Act or by virtue of other Acts which were passed here insisting on improvements in shops.  I think that an increased valuation in respect of such improvements is something that seems to cut across our general industrial policy.</P>
    <P>This is a very complicated problem, and up to the present I do not think our legislation has at all mirrored the complexity of it.  I do not think our legislation has given any line to the Valuation Office in respect of such improvements.  I should like if it were more generally known amongst the public and commercial people just what they could do without incurring increased valuations because very often they do something which they consider is in the same category as putting in a new pane of glass&mdash;I do not say it happens in the case of putting in a new pane of glass, but it may happen in the case of improvements that they regard as being akin to that &mdash;and then to their horror they find that their valuations are increased. The Valuation Office in these matters are doing their duty, I think, but a clearer policy should be laid down for them.  The archaic principles underlying Valuation Acts of the past have been carried on to this day with very chaotic results.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill, and I think it can be said for it that it has gingered up the Government to the extent that, apparently, it is going to bring in a Valuation Bill of its own.  I am not very clear as to what the Minister for Lands said in regard to firms being allowed some reduction&mdash;I think he said a reduction in rates, but I did not catch it very clearly&mdash;for cleaning up premises in the City of Dublin.  I should certainly be glad of that concession, and I think it is one that, if it were applied all over the country, would go a long way towards assist <Col N="919" /> ing employment and, secondly, would conduce towards the brightening up of our cities and towns.  I am glad that this Bill has been introduced inasmuch as it has ventilated a very real problem which exists in relation to valuation. In conclusion I would say that we must have a valuation policy in keeping with modern conditions and which does not cut across other types of legislation enacted in this House.</P>

      <P>This question of valuation law presents many problems.  I do not suppose that there is a Deputy on any side of the House who has any knowledge or experience of it, who can say that he is happy about it.  I do not think, however, that the type of contribution which we had from Deputy Flanagan can assist us to find a solution for the problem.  He attacked everybody who is in any way connected with the operation of the valuation laws.  He attacked fiercely the rate collectors who are put under a penalty to report, as part of their duty, premises for valuation.  He attacked the valuers for putting on, as he alleged, excessive valuations though they are all trained men.  Under the valuation law, if a person is dissatisfied with the valuation put on his property by a particular valuer, he has one free appeal on which a different valuer always acts.  If he is not then satisfied, he can go to the court and employ any valuer he likes to prove his case.  In that respect, I think there is not much to be said against the valuation laws though Deputy Flanagan thought fit to attack everybody who was in any way connected with it.  This Bill does not propose to alter it by one iota.</P>

    <P>I take very strong exception to Section 2 of the Bill.  We have been hearing all about the grievances of people whose valuation has been increased in recent years, but if we were to accept Section 2 of this Bill we would just stabilise that position indefinitely. As things stand at the moment, the greatest grievance I find amongst people is the fact that because they carry out some improvements or because, for some other reason, their valuations come up for revision, these <Col N="920" /> valuations are increased whilst neighbouring houses will remain at the old figure.</P>
    <P>Several times it has been stated to me that if there were a general revaluation there would be no grievance because then, with valuations as between neighbours and competitors in business equalised, the rates would probably come down and be adjusted as between them.  In the course of time those other premises would naturally have to come up for revision.  Something will have to be done about them, and while it might take a long time it would ultimately work itself out.  But under Section 2 it could never happen.</P>
    <P>Then there have been cases where houses have been let in so-called flats without any alterations being made, and as much as six or eight times the previous rent is being got for them. Under Section 2, they could not be revalued.  Houses also have been turned into business offices without any alterations being made, and very largely increased rents got.  They could not be revalued under this section.  I do not think it would be fair to the rest of the community that because of a section like this other people should have to pay an excessive share of the charges which are based on valuation, while under the present code people who do such things as I have mentioned would have to pay their full share.  Therefore I think that the cure suggested in this section would be certainly worse than the disease.</P>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy with Section 3, but I do not think it would be wise to remit the complete increase of rates for seven years.  I think the proposal of the Government to remit two-thirds of the increase for seven years would be better, because I feel that as long as we have the present basis of valuation it is better that people should know that they will have to pay increases, and if you remitted the total increase for seven years they would have exactly the same grievance when the full increase was imposed after the carrying out of alternations. From the point of view of carrying out the valuation law I think that that would be unwise.</P>
    <P>My other objection to this section is <Col N="921" /> that it applies to business premises only.  Deputy Morrissey the other day referred to the fact that Deputy Norton had raised that question.  As reported in column 527 of the Official Report of the 23rd October, Deputy Morrissey said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy Norton, speaking on Wednesday night, said that the only thing in the Bill with which he found fault was that it had not a section in it to cover ordinary dwelling-houses where there was an addition to or an improvement in an ordinary dwelling-house.  That is not necessary because that case is already covered under the Remission of Rates Act and we are dealing here only with premises which are not covered and which are suffering.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not so.  If a man living in a dwelling-house which was built 30 years ago before we had grants and remission of rates built a garage or made any addition to it, under this Bill he would immediately become liable for rates on the additional valuation. Therefore, dwelling-houses are not covered.  Deputy Morrissey is in error in what he said in regard to that. Even in the case of a grant house, if a man built an addition to it he would have to pay the full rates on that addition under this Bill as it stands.  I do not think it would be right to ask the ordinary householder to pay the excess rates which would be levied on him as the result of giving this concession to business premises.  I think that if anything like what is suggested in Section 3 were adopted it should apply to houses as well as to business premises.  That is a serious defect in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is plain from the speeches I have listened to here that those who favour <Col N="922" /> this Bill are attacking the whole basic structure of the valuation law, but they have not offered us an alternative. Some years ago I felt very much that way myself, and I tried to find an alternative, but anything I could find as an alternative would work out worse than the present valuation law, and as far as I am concerned I feel it is much the best of a bad lot, if you like to put it that way.  I am not at all satisfied with it but I cannot find anything better.  The framers of this Bill did not find anything better apparently or they would have put it into this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is easy enough to attack the valuation law when you only look at one side of the question, but when you come to examine it in its entirety you will find that the idea behind it is quite fair.  The carrying of it out, owing to the period it takes to rectify things makes it very unpopular, but I would prefer to have the present valuation law rather than the law as it would be if this Bill were passed.  We would have far more grievances as the result of it instead of its being a help. That is my attitude to it at any rate. As one who would like to make some amendments in the present valuation law, I think it would be well for the framers of this Bill to reconsider the matter and withdraw it and try to get something to which we could all subscribe. I am sure they would find a great deal of sympathy for any honest effort to try to improve the valuation law.</P>
