    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Emigration from Donegal Gaeltacht.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of the unprecedented flow of emigration from the Donegal Gaeltacht due to unemployment in that area; and, if so, what immediate steps he proposes to take to stop this emigration flow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (for the Taoiseach) Donnchadh Ó Briain">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Donnchadh Ó Briain) (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information at my disposal does not confirm the suggestion that the flow of emigration from the Donegal Gaeltacht can be described as unprecedented.  In fact I understand that emigration from that area mainly takes the form of migratory workers going to Britain for seasonal work, as has been the custom for many years, and is no greater now than in previous years. The apparent increase in unemployment in the area is due almost entirely to the effect of the Social Welfare Act, 1952, in increasing the numbers on the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Donegal Gaeltacht, as elsewhere, the Government are endeavouring to promote conditions favourable to employment.  As the Deputy will observe from a reply to another question on to-day's Order Paper, it is proposed to proceed, in the coming year, with the development of the Clady River hydro-electric scheme. In addition, one of the proposed four turf-fired electricity generating stations will be situated in the Donegal Gaeltacht.  Six new industrial projects in that area are under consideration <Col N="840" /> and in two of these cases applications for grants have been approved by An Foras Tionscal.</P>
    <P>The industrial employment given in the area by Gaeltarra Éireann is greater this year than in any of the last four years and steps are being taken to expand still further the division's activities.</P>
    <P>Two new forestry centres have been established in the last 12 months and it is hoped to open a further centre shortly.  The Land Commission plans to carry out a bog development scheme next year while the Department of Agriculture is carrying out experiments with heated glasshouses with the object of expanding the uses to which the existing tomato glasshouses may be put.</P>
    <P>The number of houses erected and improved in the area in the financial year 1952-53 under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts was substantially greater than in the preceding year. Of the special allocation of £400,000 from voted moneys this year for the improvement of roads of tourist value, £50,000 has been allotted to County Donegal, most of which will be spent in or near the Gaeltacht and Breac-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>It is evident, therefore, that State-aided activities in the Donegal Gaeltacht are greater than 12 months ago and that there will be further expansion in the year ahead.</P>

      <P>A holding comprising 222 acres in County Meath (P.L.V. £237 10s. land and £40 5s. buildings) was allotted to a Mayo migrant under purchase agreement dated 27th March, 1951.  The price paid by the Land Commission for these lands was £16,000 in addition to which repairs to buildings cost £426 and removal expenses £200.</P>
      <P>This holding was allotted to him in exchange for a holding of 272 acres (P.L.V. £161 5s. land and £11 buildings). The resale price of the Meath lands was £6,800 from which was deducted £2,181 occupation interest allowed him in respect of his old holding. Discounting the occupation interest, the net loss on resale was therefore £9,200, to which must be added the redemption value (£646) of the annuity on the Meath lands which ceased when they were acquired by the Land Commission, together with the cost of repairs to buildings and removal expenses given above.</P>
      <P>The annuity on £3,000 of the net resale price of £4,619 on the new holding is subject to revision as also will be the annuity on the £2,181 occupation interest recoverable on the resale of the migrant's old holding.</P>

      <P>The particulars sought by the Deputy are not available. Various attempts have been made to estimate the capital value of the State forest property as a whole but such estimation cannot be effected on a reliable basis because of the difficulties associated with the volumetric assessment of large areas of growing plantations on the one hand and the impossibility of reliable adjustment of actual immediate value of young plantations by reference to their ultimate potential value many years later.  The alternative theoretic method of assuming actual expenditure with allowance for hypothetical interest rates to represent capital values does not provide reliable information.</P>

      <P>Fuel has never been a free issue to the occupants of soldiers' married quarters.  When the present charge of 10/6 a week to a soldier for married quarters, furniture, fuel, light and water was fixed in 1929, it represented the cost to the State of these facilities at the time.  Because of increased costs in the meantime, however, the figure of 10/6 a week no longer recoups the State for these services.  The revised procedure, under which the issue of fuel will be discontinued and the rate of charge for the other items fixed at 5/- a week as from the 1st September next, will, it is estimated, reduce the State's loss by £7,636 during the present financial year and by £9,468 in a full financial year.</P>

If that committee owns property on which it intended to develop a vocational school and if that property has been taken from the committee by another body, I take it the committee has the same rights as any ordinary citizen or group of citizens. In the event of the committee being unable to secure what it regards as fair and equitable from the county council, the committee I imagine has available to it the means of exercising its rights.  To suggest that the Minister for Local Government could come along and instruct the county council or its manager to pay compensation to this particular interest would be extending the Minister's power very considerably indeed.</P>

There is no question of my Department refusing or failing to ensure that the law is observed, but the taking of action by me under Section 39 of the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1935, would, in my opinion, be appropriate only if the firm should fail to implement a recommendation by the court.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> In 1924, a district justice was considered worth a salary of £1,000 per annum.  Do the members of the Labour Party assert now, what was not asserted then, that the district justices were not entitled to that amount? Apparently, they do not.  Why, then, do they suggest that £1,700 is too much in 1953, in view of the fact that the value of money has certainly been more than halved in the intervening years? Let us, for the sake of argument, take the position of the manual worker.  In 1924, he was working for something not more than £1 a week.  Nowadays, he gets £5 or £6.  I am not suggesting for a moment that he is getting one penny more than he is entitled to.  Indeed, I am not suggesting that he is getting enough, but at any rate he is getting, roughly, six times what he was getting in 1924.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McAuliffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the county council worker who 15 years ago was getting something in the region of 30/- a week.  Now he is getting something over £4 a week.  I think it is £4 5s., which is roughly three times what he was getting 15 years ago.  Here, again, I am not saying that he is getting one penny too much.  I am not saying he is getting enough.  All I am saying is that he is getting roughly three times what he was getting 15 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happen to know Deputy Corish.  He is a young man like myself.  Does he seriously suggest that the changes which have taken place over those years, and which made an improvement in the wages of the workers necessary and will make it more necessary as time goes on, should have no effect whatever on judges and district justices?  Would he like to argue that they are not entitled to one penny more nowadays than they were entitled to in 1924?  We are the custodians of the rights of the poor people, of the manual worker, the agricultural labourer and the unemployed. That was an argument which, I am afraid, Deputy Everett tried to misrepresent, but it was an argument <Col N="860" /> that was quite properly made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government last night.</P>

      <P>Curiously enough, the Labour Party do not seem to be taking Deputy Everett's line last night. Anyway, they do not seem to be consistent in their attitude on this measure.  Deputy Everett took the line that he was opposing the matter on principle because some provision or other was not being made quickly enough for the workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>He went on to say that they objected to the Bill on principle. I take it that anyone who objects to something on principle is objecting to it from a fundamental aspect.  I do not care what Deputy Cowan says, but I do believe that, when a person says he is objecting to something on principle, he feels rather strongly about it.  Deputy Everett appeared to me to contradict himself in the line that he took.  He said that he did not believe for one moment that the members of the judiciary would become any less honest or trustworthy if they did not get this increase and, at the same time, when he was arguing about Section 12, he thought it was completely wrong to take away from the citizen the right to have his case transferred on the grounds that he did not like a particular judge.  If this House can add up the logic of that then they must be better at it than I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that I mention Section 12, I may say that to some extent I agree with Deputy Cowan.  In fact, all the speakers who mentioned Section 12 appeared to be against the change proposed in it.  I suppose, in so far as we should not try to take away any right from the ordinary citizen, I oppose it too.  In fact, it is a right which was never given to them by the law of the country; it is a right that <Col N="861" /> he thinks he has because a certain practice has grown up.  I am perfectly satisfied that abuses have crept in and that there is some justification for the view that the person in applying for these transfers is abusing the rights which he was given under previous legislation in this State.</P>

      <P>The State abuses it.  In view of the unanimity of opinion on all sides of the House, I think the Minister will be prepared to reconsider Section 12 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have already said that in my opinion this Bill is good, but does not go far enough.  It does not increase the jurisdiction of the District and Circuit Courts as much as I would like and as much as my colleagues in the solicitors' profession would like to have the jurisdiction increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that.  I think they are not going nearly far enough as far as the District Court is concerned.  The District Court was established to be a poor man's court, a court of rough justice for the man with a small grievance, but the small grievance is every bit as important, particularly in the country, to a man as the big grievance or the big action for £3,000 or £4,000, or an action between companies is to the man in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hard fact is that one of the reasons why rearrangement is overdue was mentioned by the Minister in his opening speech, that some district justices have not enough work to do. They would be the first to admit that. They would be far better pleased if they had a lot more to do.  All they can do is to come to their court, get through their cases and go home.  One of the reasons that so few cases are taken by district justices now is the simple economic fact that money has changed in value, that a man who would take a breach of warranty <Col N="862" /> action in the District Court 20 years ago cannot take it now for the simple reason that any stock he would buy under £25 could be only a calf, and I never heard of a warranty being given for a calf.  Even in a case involving a dispute about an animal he is forced to go through the rigmarole of going through the entire Circuit Court procedure. The affidavits are lodged. There is a defence entered.  He has to have his briefs prepared for counsel. He has to have counsel in court on the occasion of the hearing, and his veterinary surgeon and other witnesses to prove that a warranty was in fact given.  There are witnesses on the other side to say that the warranty was not given.  There are veterinary surgeons on the other side to prove that there was no breach of warranty. The result is that if the poor fellow loses at the end of it all he has lost his animal and £100 to £150 as well.</P>
    <P>The object of this Parliament should be to make it possible for the poor man to have his grievance adjusted one way or the other in open court at as small a cost to himself as is possible and, therefore, I think there is no answer to the argument that the jurisdiction of the District Court should be increased in contract and in tort to £100 and that the jurisdiction of the court in title cases should be established.</P>
    <P>Here again a man may find himself in court and he may have already incurred his costs between one thing and another and the solicitor bringing witnesses in and when he is three-fourths of the way through the case some question about title arises and the next thing is that he is informed from the Bench that the case cannot be proceeded with.  It does seem unfair to that man and, considering the wonderful record that the District Court has in this country since its establishment in 1934, I feel that we in this House should have no qualms whatever about giving them jurisdiction in title, up to a small amount, at any rate.</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction of the District Court in criminal matters has been progressively increased over the years.  That is evidence of the faith of this House and <Col N="863" /> the people as a whole in the ability of the District Court to decide on matters of any kind but what has been happening recently is that more and more of the cases on the civil side are disappearing from the District Court and are being forced into the Circuit Court.  I think we should right that before this Bill finds its way on to the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>In addition, I believe that what are called Section 52 cases should be capable of being heard before the District Court rather than the Circuit Court.  They are simple applications upon affidavit which take up unnecessary amounts of time in a Circuit Court and which could be quite easily dealt with by a district justice.  Whether he has been a solicitor or a barrister, his previous experience will have given him plenty of knowledge of the requirements of Section 52 applications.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that, in my view, the Circuit Court jurisdiction should be increased, not to £600, as proposed in the Bill, but to £1,000, and that, thereby, the enormous volume of work which is in arrears in the High Court would be somewhat reduced and, thereby, with the addition of another High Court judge, work in the High Court could be proceeded with fairly rapidly.</P>
    <P>It is, I must confess, very difficult for a member of the legal profession to explain to a layman who is taking an action in the High Court that his case is not likely to be heard for 12 or 18 months or maybe two years.  It is hardly fair in certain cases that the worry and mental strain of a High Court action should be hanging, like a sword of Damocles, over the head of a litigant for a period of, say, two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcAuliffe" hpid="Mr. McAuliffe Mr. McAuliffe">

      <P>No.  I do not think it is at all fair to say that.  I hope that when Deputy Corish speaks he will not take the line that a judge works only three and a half hours a day.  He works a lot more than three and a half hours although he might sit on the bench for only three and a half hours a day. <Col N="864" /> How would you like to have the responsibility of deciding whether an ordinary citizen is to be a bankrupt for the rest of his life or is going to win an action?  If a High Court case goes to the Supreme Court, the judges have to listen to the arguments from both sides.  If there are two judges of one view and two judges of another, the remaining judge has the responsibility of that person's future in his hands.  It is all very well to talk about what a workingman does.  I do not decry that, but I would not be a judge of the meanest kind for all the tea in China.</P>

Many of them work, not three and a half hours, but sometimes 23½ hours per day for a period of a week if an important case is being heard.  I am not standing up for them at all.  They have their job to do and they are well paid for doing it.  But they are paid, not so much for the number of hours they work, but for the great responsibility they have to undertake.</P>

      <P>I have tried for the past 20 minutes to make a speech and I have done my best to keep <Col N="866" /> going despite the continuous barrage of interruptions from the Labour Party.  I hope that I have made my case; I certainly tried to make it honestly.  I am surprised that Deputy Costello, who led off in the debate for the other side of the House, should have availed of the opportunity to doubt the motives of the Minister in introducing this legislation.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy Lynch, mentioned the establishment of a High Court in Cork.  I remember when Deputy Lynch made that case in the House two years ago and built it up layer by layer in what seemed to be a very sensible and sound speech. Deputy McGilligan when speaking afterwards dismissed it in one sentence. I did not bring the reference with me, but anyone who cares can look it up.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Let me tell Deputy Lynch that there is no case for the establishment of a High Court in Cork.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is all he said about it.  I do not think that an argument like that should be dismissed in just one sentence. As I said, our object is to try to make litigation as cheap as possible for litigants, and if the establishment of a High Court in Cork were to have the effect of decreasing the cost of High Court jurisdiction for a portion of the country, I think that proposal ought to be seriously considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I come back to the question as to whether the increases, which I did not refer to very much, should be given.  I believe they should.  I should like to wind up my speech by telling a perfectly true story of a case in court in which I was involved myself when three defendants were before a district justice on a certain charge.  They pleaded that the reason why they should not be sent to jail was because they would be losing the benefit of jobs worth up to £25 per week.  I remember the justice making the remark at the time: &ldquo;I appear to be on the wrong side of the Bench&rdquo;.  The fact is that he should not appear to be on the wrong side of the Bench; he should be placed in an actual position of independence <Col N="867" /> as well as being in a theoretical position of independence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to amend the Courts of Justice Acts, 1924 to 1929.  I think the principal and main proposal is the increasing of the salaries of judges and justices and their pensions and sustenance allowances referred to by Deputy Flanagan.  The Labour Party was brought into this debate in a rather forcible way by the previous speaker. He was endeavouring at one time to dictate to us what our policy should be. Every member of the Labour Party is well aware of that policy.  We take cognisance of all sections of the community and have done so throughout the years.  We realise that every man in this country is entitled to a fair and square deal and we endeavour to see that he gets it, if it is at all possible.</P>
      <P>I should like to say at the outset that we realise fully that the judiciary should be a very independent body, and that they should be held in respect by the citizens of the State. If that position did not obtain, I know very well it would be a bad day for the community.  However, Deputy Flanagan made the point that in opposing these increases the Labour Party are not consistent.  It has been stated that other people in the State, workers in different classes of employment, have had their rates of remuneration increased well beyond the percentage increase that is now being sought for the members of the judiciary.  I believe there is no comparison, good, bad or indifferent. Take the ordinary worker earning £3 or £4 a week.  If he has got an increase of 100 per cent. in his wages within the last ten or 15 years, it only gives him a wage of £6 or £7 per week.  But take 50 per cent. of £1,000, and it is an increase of £500.  You cannot compare the ordinary working man with these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I oppose this measure wholeheartedly. I am convinced, beyond a shadow of doubt, that if it is to be passed by this House it will create a spirit of disquiet and uneasiness <Col N="868" /> throughout the country.  I am perfectly satisfied that if there was a referendum of the people of this country on this particular measure, 95 per cent. of them would oppose it strenuously. There are very valid reasons why that opposition should be forthcoming.  We have had here, during the past two or three years, many discussions on problems that confront our people, on the unemployment problem, the emigration problem, on social welfare legislation and measures to improve the health of our citizens.</P>
    <P>We have had discussions on how to provide for the aged people of the country, for the widows and orphans and so on.  Despite all those discussions, and despite all the sympathetic points made by some members both of the Government Party and of the Fine Gael Party, we find that the only select Committee this House has set up since I became a member of it, to go into any question deeply, was this select Committee set up consisting of 15 members of the Government Party and the principal Opposition Party, Fine Gael, with powers to send for persons, papers and documents, to consider and report whether the salaries and expenses, allowances and pensions of the judges and justices require to be increased and if so, by what amount.</P>
    <P>I consider that that Committee should never have been set up.  We had no Committee set up to inquire into how to deal with our 80,000 unemployed or to consider how the aged people of the country have to exist on a mere pittance of £1 1s. 6d. week after week, or how the unemployed man is to live on 12/- dole weekly, or to inquire how the widows and orphans, uneconomic holders, the small business people throughout the length and breadth of the country from Donegal to Cork are to live at the present time.  We have no select Committee to inquire how they are to get along or whether they are being fairly treated by the State or not.  I do not want to comment adversely on the judiciary.  I have the greatest respect for them but I think that taking all those other factors into account, there is no justification for setting up a <Col N="869" /> select Committee of this House to consider by how much the salary of one of our citizens in receipt of £80 a week for his work, together with travelling expenses and subsistence allowance should be increased so that he would be treated with justice and fair play. I maintain he is now being treated with justice and fair play and that his remuneration of £80 a week with travelling and subsistence allowance is quite adequate.  I also maintain that the other people referred to in this measure, High Court judges with £60 a week, are being well looked after and I also maintain that Circuit Court judges with remuneration similar to a Minister of State, are being very well looked after.  Similarly, I maintain that district justices have very little to grieve about so far as their rate of pay is concerned.  I consider that the proposal to increase their remuneration by £5 to £10 per week is most inopportune at the present time.</P>
    <P>We all know very well that there has been a marked increase in the cost of living.  We all know that it is difficult for people to provide for their families at the present time and that naturally affects the judiciary just as well as any other section, but surely to heavens, it was entirely wrong for the Government to start with a better paid section of the community. If we compare these salaries &mdash;and I put it to any sane, thinking Deputy&mdash;with the rate of pay provided for the Taoiseach, what do we find? We find that despite the big portion of work that is thrown on his shoulders, considering the major responsibilities he has to face at the present time and despite the fact that he is the man responsible for the enactment of legislation, his pay would not compare with the pay of these gentlemen. Surely he has a much more responsible job than any of these judges.  He has to make the case for the Government in the House and throughout the length and breadth of the country, for Government policy and so on.  Similarly, a Minister of State, having a remuneration of £2,125 &mdash; a similar amount to that of the Circuit Court Judge&mdash;has to bear very heavy responsibilities. I maintain without fear of <Col N="870" /> contradiction that the Minister has five times the responsibility of any Circuit Court judge in this country. Therefore, there is no justification for the increase no matter from what angle we view it.</P>

      <P>There will be a time for the Deputies.  We will deal with that later.  In opposing as vehemently as I possibly can this measure, I want to make it clear as I have already mentioned that I take cognisance of all sections of the people but if I were to support this measure, I would not be upholding the viewpoint of my constituents in West Cork.  I have not the slightest doubt that 99.9 per cent. of the people I represent here and a similar percentage of the people represented by my colleagues, Deputies Collins and O'Sullivan, if they had a say in this measure, would say, justifiably, that there was no case whatever for increasing these people's allowances.  We are not taking a narrow or a sectional view on this matter at all.  It is not because they are small in number that we oppose it but because, as Deputy Everett said, of the principle.  We believe it is entirely unfair and entirely unjust to bring in such a measure having regard to the conditions that are obtaining in this country at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is our clear-cut case and I cannot see for the life of me how the Government will get out of the predicament in which they will place themselves if this measure is to become law. If we were to read in the morning papers that people enjoying rates of remuneration from £35 to £80 a week were getting increases of from £5 to £10 a week, what would be the ordinary reaction?  Every man throughout the length and breadth of the country would say: If these people are entitled to those increases, surely to heaven, whether I am working for wages or whether I am self-employed, I am entitled to some figure of an increase on whatever my present remuneration is.  That would be a reasonable attitude <Col N="871" /> for any thinking man in the country to adopt.</P>
    <P>How are we going to face up to the situation?  I think that if the Government, as a result of this, find themselves confronted with wage increases and demands from all sections of the community&mdash;and, indeed, they will be very justifiable so far as many sections are concerned&mdash;they can only blame themselves.  They are setting up a bad precedent and establishing a very bad principle.  Coming here as a representative of the people of West Cork&mdash; mainly workers and small farmers, many of them living on uneconomic holdings, and also small business people whose business as a result of Government policy is declining from day to day&mdash;surely, I could not support this measure.  We have had several claims locally from people whose rate of remuneration did not exceed £3 or £4 a week and we thought ourselves very lucky if we could get an increase of 5/- a week for these people.  In the case of the county council, since the cost of living increased in the last few years the only increase they gave their employees was 5/- a week.  In many other cases and many other types of employment, similar figures obtain.  We are asked to be complacent about the condition of these people, that they are quite all right, and in the next breath we are asked to give these increases to the judiciary.</P>
    <P>I think that it was wholly out of place for some professional Deputies who contributed to this debate to assert that if salaries were not increased there would be a possibility of corruption creeping in amongst the judiciary.  Even Deputy Flanagan supported that viewpoint.  Now, I am not a professional man at all, and I am satisfied beyond doubt that we have in the legal profession in this country a goodly number of men of undisputed integrity who, if they are at any time appointed to the bench, would not betray their trust.  Indeed, we have people already on the bench, existing judges, and there can be no question that they would be liable to corruption even if the present allowances, which I count as very adequate, <Col N="872" /> remain as they are.  I think that is a grave reflection to make on members of the legal profession generally, and I am surprised to hear members of the profession themselves making that assertion here in this House.  No lay member of this House attempted to make that assertion, but at least three or four Deputies attached to the profession of law did assert that there was a possibility of corruption if salaries were not increased.</P>

      <P>I do not want to hold up the House unduly.  I regret very much that the Minister for Justice should deem it fit to bring in such a piece of legislation at this time.  I suppose, in order to camouflage it a little bit, other proposals were included in this Bill.  I welcome some of these proposals, such as that to give the Circuit Courts and the District Courts extended powers. I cannot for the life of me see why our District Courts cannot deal with some of the cases that have to go before the Circuit Courts at present and thus obviate much of the costs incurred by litigants.  I know it is a very dangerous practice, if it could be avoided at all, to have any recourse to law and I think the same applies in other countries.  It is a very costly practice as many of our people know to their grief.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I am very glad to see that petty disputes amongst our countrymen are dying out. However, it is a marked advantage to the people that the jurisdiction of the District Courts and the Circuit Courts has been extended in civil actions.  Up to the present, if the amount of damages claimed exceeded £300, the Circuit Court had no jurisdiction.  You had many people who on occasions felt that they should claim £400 damages but they had to reduce their claim to £300 in order to bring it within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  I think that that was very unfair to these people.  I am glad to see that the jurisdiction has been extended in these cases.</P>

    <P>I think when this Select Committee was set up, one of its terms of reference should have been the question of legal fees, particularly the legal fees charged by senior counsel in this country.

      <P>This measure mainly deals with the pensions and allowances of members of the judiciary which indeed are very liberal. A judge after 15 years' service will get two-thirds of his remuneration as pension. That obviates the necessity of his making provision for old age. Similarly if he is retired before that time and in any case after five years' service, he will be provided with a reasonable pension by way of one-sixth of his existing salary plus one-twentieth for each year of service so that, unlike most of our employed and self-employed people, this particular class will not have to provide for their old age.  People down the country when they retire at 70 after a lifetime of work have to submit themselves to a rigid means test in order to get £1 1s. 6d. per week.  No matter from what angle one looks at it one cannot but find fault with the Government and the Minister for this piece of legislation. I am entirely opposed to it on principle and I appeal to the Minister, though I feel there is little use in doing so, to withdraw this measure in the interests of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that this debate has more or less tended to go off the <Col N="875" /> rails in dealing with the question of the remuneration of the judiciary while the sections of the Bill which are of supreme importance as a whole seem to have been ignored; and, as one who has advocated some of the reforms suggested in this measure over the past 15 years, I welcome the Bill so far as it goes in that direction.  But I do not think the Bill goes far enough.</P>
      <P>I agree that the judiciary must remain independent.  I think Deputy Costello, however, rather overstated the case last night when he referred to that hierarchy.  I will not put any haloes on any heads because they might get titled sideways.  The members of the judiciary are very important public servants.  The State has been very lucky in its judiciary but the members of it remain public servants paid by the taxpayers and it is quite in order, therefore, for members of this House to give their views as to how they should be paid.  This Bill gives effect to the findings of the Select Committee set up by this House. That Committee went into the matter fully and made certain recommendations. I know that district justices are grossly underpaid.  Beyond that, I have nothing further to say.  I was rather surprised at Deputy Everett discussing a question of principle because it was Deputy Everett who, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, was a party to the giving of an increase of £1,000 per year to a poor man who was trying to keep the wolf from the door on £2,500 per year.  That is all I shall say on the question of principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are sections of this Bill which are of supreme importance to the community. There is the question of cheapening litigation and providing justice irrespective of the length of a person's purse.  I assert&mdash;Deputy Costello and other legal men know this just as well as I do&mdash;that justice is purchased by the big corporations and the insurance companies in a position to buy expert legal and medical advice as against the small man without resources.  There is no question of our judiciary not being above reproach, <Col N="876" /> but everybody knows that what I say is true.  Our entire legal system is unsuitable and the quicker this House realises that the better it will be.</P>
    <P>Deputies have ignored the most important sections of this Bill.  The quicker we get the reforms for which our people are crying out the better it will be for the country.  Because of the vested interests involved we will possibly find ourselves unable to go as far as we would like to go.  This country is too small to afford two branches of the legal profession.  We should have a system akin to that in the United States where there is only the one branch of the profession and the people have not to pay for duplication of lawyers.  That system is all right in England where there are vast resources and Sir John Blank gets £25,000 to successfully sue for divorce for Lady So-and-so from some husband of whom she has grown tired.  We have not got these resources here.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been connected with the legal profession have seen people beggared as a result of litigation. The sooner the two branches of the profession are amalgamated the more satisfactory the position will be and the easier it will be for our people to obtain justice.  That will not necessarily mean the wiping out of one branch of the legal profession, as some people seem to fear.  As happens under the American system, different men will specialise in different branches of the profession.  The securing of justice is limited now by the size of a man's bank balance.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputies to give more consideration to the more important implications of the Bill than to the hares being raised in connection with judicial salaries.  Deputy Costello seemed to think that there should be no mention of salaries at all in this measure.  I do not know in what other way the matter could have been dealt with.  The suggestion seemed to be that it was demeaning to the judiciary to discuss the question of their salaries here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to the fact that he was making the case that lawyers could not be done without.  I believe they are a necessary evil, if <Col N="877" /> one considers them an evil.  Deputy Costello made the case that that branch of the profession goes back to antiquity.  It occurred to me that in suggesting the salaries of the judiciary should not be mentioned in the Bill he was thinking of part of his own professional judicial attire.  There is a pocket on the back of a barrister's gown.  In the old days barristers evidently considered it undignified to take money from a client and the result was that when a barrister walked away the client followed him and slipped the fee into this little pocket.  That pocket survives to the present day as part of the regalia, but one does not have to chase a barrister around to-day in order to pay him his fee.  Some progress has been made in that respect.  I see nothing wrong in discussing judicial salaries here.  They must be dealt with by legislation, and I do not know any more appropriate measure for that purpose than the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of the decentralisation of the law, I consider the Minister has not gone nearly far enough.  I think there should be an overall aim in the Minister's Department as to what the future of our legal structure is to be.  In my opinion, there should be complete abolition of the High Court except as a Court of Appeal.  Every action that is now tried by the High Court should be tried in the local venue by the Circuit Court judge.  The position at the moment is that any case of over £300 jurisdiction has to go to the High Court.  If a farm labourer is knocked down by a car in the West of Ireland and brings his case to Dublin he is faced by the wealthy insurance corporations which insure motorists.  He is dragged up here and may have to hang around for a week or ten days.  When the case comes on it is not a question only of lawyers but of medical experts, engineers, actuaries and other witnesses.  The insurance companies have already bought and secured the services of practically every expert that can be brought into the case.  While that is the position, you cannot, I suggest, have justice. Justice could not be secured for that <Col N="878" /> poor unfortunate man because he could not possibly have the resources to enable him to employ a lot of experts. If the case were tried on his own native heath he could bring forward all his witnesses, witnesses that he could not afford to bring to Dublin. In that case, the wealthy insurance corporations would be obliged to bring their experts and their expensive lawyers for the hearing of the case to the local venue.  In that event the scale of justice would again start to swing more steadily.</P>
    <P>In order to achieve that end, I suggest to the Minister that the Circuit Court jurisdiction should at least be brought up to £1,000 in contract and in tort.  I suggest that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be brought up to £3,000 in equity suits and in the administration of estates.  In other cases, its jurisdiction should be at least £1,000.  In that way, I hope at all events to provide for a large number of people who are unable to seek justice under the system as we know it. They have not the money to enable them to employ expert witnesses.</P>
    <P>As far as the District Court is concerned, I should say that it has given the most satisfaction of any court set up under our present system.  It has been suggested by some Deputies that the district justices have not enough work to do.  I propose to provide plenty of work for them.  In order to cheapen litigation, I am proposing to the Minister that, in contract and tort, the jurisdiction of the District Court should be increased to £100; in ejectment cases, that it should be increased to a rent of £100 or £25 poor law valuation and that its jurisdiction in slander and libel cases where the damages sought are nominal, the figure should be £100.  It should have title jurisdiction up to £25, and power for the fixing of basic rents up to £100.</P>
    <P>Again, perhaps with more hesitation, I would give it jurisdiction under Section 52 of the Local Registration of Title Act.  I would give the District Courts all licensing jurisdiction.  For the life of me, I cannot understand how the Minister's backroom boys arrived at the figures in contract and tort that <Col N="879" /> are set out in the Bill.  I cannot understand why a differentiation should be made as to a district justice's ability to try a contract action for £50 and suggest that he cannot try a tort action for £25.  Everyone connected with the legal profession whether he be old or young knows that questions of contract are far more difficult and complex than questions of tort.  I am sure that every student would admit that he found far more difficulty in trying to master Anson on contract than he did Underhill on tort.  In contract actions, you are dealing largely with questions of fact.  There can be some posers in regard to the law of contract because there is a complex legal code to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I do not know why there should be such a distinction made between these two figures which I have mentioned. I am suggesting the figure of £100. Formerly, the position was that the District Court had jurisdiction only up to £10 on questions of tort.  They propose now to give it jurisdiction up to £25.  In 1924, you could get a pretty good pig at the fair for £25.  If a motorist hits a farmer's sow on the road now, she is going to cost more than £25.  The result is that the farmer has to set off for the Circuit Court with an engineer, a vet, a barrister and a solicitor to be faced by the insurance company with an engineer, two vets, a barrister and a solicitor.  If the case goes against the insurance company, it goes off on appeal to the High Court on circuit, with possibly two senior counsel on each side so that the sow is going to be a very expensive one by the time the case in finished.  It is beyond me why the district justice could not deal with the farmer's sow.  I see no reason why the district justices cannot and should not be able to try these ordinary cases in tort up to £100.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I want to deal with which is of immense importance to country Deputies, and that is the question of conferring title jurisdiction on the District Court.  It was the intention in the first instance, under the 1924 Act to confer title jurisdiction on the District Court up to, I <Col N="880" /> think, £10.  But again, that was ruled out.  I leave it to the imagination of Deputies as to why that was done.  The intention, however, that was there to confer that jurisdiction on the District Court was stultified.  I think that the least jurisdiction you should give to the District Court in title is in cases up to £25.  Let me give an example. Suppose Mary Brown's hen trespasses on Pat Murphy's garden.  He goes into the local solicitor to have a summons for trespass issued.  The question is raised at once as to who owns the fence.  Immediately, there is a question of title involved.  They are both off to the Circuit Court, complete with engineers, maps and barristers, so that in order to have this woman's hen kept at bay a tremendous amount of expense is put on these unfortunate people.  I have seen them beggared for all time over matters of this kind simply because there is a question of title raised in the District Court.  The district justice has to throw it out and off they go with all the pomp and panoply of the law and the professional witnesses to the Circuit Court.  If there is a dispute about a boreen and who has the right to use it there is the very same thing.  Often, the litigants and their families are beggared for years afterwards as a result. Always remember that once any of these things must start in the Circuit Court, the ultimate end is the High Court on circuit with senior and junior counsel in these small cases.  I often thought it was a tragedy but there it is.  We have the opportunity to put it right.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with this matter and I want the Minister to deal with it. 99.9 per cent. of title cases are questions solely of fact.  Unless you have a common-sense parish priest who is active enough or some local good neighbour who will try to knock some sense into these people, they proceed on this disastrous way.  I want to provide sufficient jurisdiction in the District Court to enable Pat Murphy to keep his neighbour's hen at bay without proceeding to the Circuit Court and High Court.  I hope the Minister and all sides of the House will see the fundamental logic of this, and provide for it in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> It has been suggested that questions of slander or libel should not be dealt with in the District Court.  I do not know why they should not be.  I would say that in 90 per cent. of these cases all that the plaintiff wants is a declaration to clear his character.  In 90 per cent. of the cases that is what the case is brought for.  You will get an odd one who is looking for heart balm or damages and these, I suppose, would be started in the High Court in any case.  Cases of this kind often occur particularly with country people.  For instance, there may be some row about trespass, or something like that, and things are said, possibly in the heat of the moment, that get around.  The result often is that instead of the matter ending with a District Court summons the parties concerned embark on the long trail up through the Circuit and High Court, when in reality, all that is required by the plaintiff is a declaration that the words spoken were defamatory and that there was no truth in them in substance or in fact.  I would give the District Court that power.  It would be the cheapest and most expeditious way of dealing with matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House too long on the question of basic rents and ejectments.  Suffice it to say that with the decrease in the value of money the former jurisdiction is rather absurd.  It simply does not exist.  I am sure there are very few houses let at 10/- a week now.  From the point of view of expedition and of cheapening litigation for the litigants, I again say that basic rents up to £100 and ejectment cases up to rents of £100 or valuations not exceeding £25 should be dealt with in the District Court.</P>
    <P>If these matters are considered seriously by the Minister and by the House, the Minister may find that it will be unnecessary to appoint an extra High Court judge.  Whether it is necessary or unnecessary, the principles that I am talking about are far more important to the public.  The provision of quick and cheap litigation for the public, where it is essential, is far more important to the people than the question of whether <Col N="882" /> you have to appoint another judge or not.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the overall aim should be to turn the High Court into a Court of Appeal from the decisions of the Circuit Court where these are found to be unsatisfactory by either party and that ultimately we should be striving at the goal where the administration of justice as far as the courts are concerned would be completely decentralised and where the smallest man, the poorest labourer in the parish to the highest in the land will have equal opportunities and equal rights before the Bar of Justice.</P>
    <P>If Deputies&mdash;I am referring particularly to Deputies on the other side of the House&mdash;agree with the suggestions that I have put forward on this Bill, we can make a good Bill of this Bill.  We can provide greater reliefs and do greater good to the people than was done in any Bill that has come before this House as long as I have been here.  I am not overestimating the importance of the provisions I have suggested to the House. I would suggest to the Minister&mdash;I feel very strongly in this matter&mdash;that he should accept the figures I have suggested.  I would go much further in this line were it not that I am hoping, if I can get a consensus of opinion behind me in this House for the suggestions I have made in regard to this Bill, that it will just be the start towards achieving the goal I want to reach.</P>
    <P>May I say also that I have given not only my own views here?  I have consulted Bar associations in the West of Ireland who agree with the figures I have suggested in the House.  The vast majority of these men are opposed politically to me but they realise the logic of my propositions.  I appeal to the men on all sides of the House to realise that we have an opportunity now of doing a tremendous service to the poorer sections of this community. We have an opportunity now to improve tremendously our judicial system. I hope that I and the Minister will get the co-operation of thinking men on all sides of the House on the Committee Stage of this Bill to bring the Bill at <Col N="883" /> least to the stage to which I want it brought.</P>

      <P>And long overdue. There is one thing which strikes me about this Bill and will really corroborate what Deputy Moran has said. There appears to be general agreement in this House that district justices have too little to do and that there are not sufficient High Court judges to do the work.  All that Deputy Moran suggests is that we should level matters up.  If the district justices have nothing to do, it is because money has lost its value, and by raising the jurisdiction of the District Courts we will give the district justices something to do, probably more than they want to do.  We will possibly avoid the necessity for doing away with the existing number of justices and there may even be no necessity for an additional High Court judge, because there will not be the same accumulation of work in the High Court if we increase the jurisdiction of the District Courts and the Circuit Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago this House set up a Select Committee to inquire into the various sections of this Bill.  I am very sorry that the Labour Party was not represented on that Committee.  I am very sorry that, through their own fault, they had not an opportunity of putting their views before the members of that Committee.  I am also sorry, that Committee having gone to the trouble of going into this matter in detail, that the Minister has been unable to accept the unanimous opinion of that Committee.  If the Committee decided to increase the salaries of district justices, Circuit Court judges and High Court judges and to make that increase retrospective <Col N="884" /> from a certain date, I am sorry the Minister did not see his way to accept that unanimous recommendation.</P>
    <P>I think, however, that the Minister set a very good precedent by setting up that Select Committee.  I think he could go further and do a considerable amount of good to the judiciary by setting up a Select Committee of the House, with the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the Chair, for the appointment of personnel to our judiciary and not make purely political appointments to the judicial benches.  We are now giving these gentlemen who preside over our courts a very good salary, a salary on which they can live, and we should see that they are men, as they have been in the past, who are impartial; and we should get the very best men procurable for these appointments.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that a Committee be set up, that applications be invited for the various vacancies when they occur, and that that Committee should make representations to the Minister with regard to the appointment of the various justices, Circuit Court judges and High Court judges.  That is a suggestion which he should consider.</P>

      <P>I would be surprised if over the years we had 100 per cent. monopoly of one particular Party on the Bench.  I would be disappointed to hear that they had 100 per cent.  On the question of the appointment of district justices, there is another point which I would put to the Minister.  If we appoint a district justice to preside over a District Court in rural Ireland, let us appoint someone who knows something about rural Ireland.  I am not criticising the justices who preside over the District Courts, but it is unfair to ask a solicitor or barrister practising in the city to go down into a rural district and adjudicate in cases about bridges and drains and bullocks and heifers, something he knows absolutely nothing about.  It is really a laughing-stock at times to the countryman to hear such a justice decide some of these cases, all through no fault of his own.</P>

Unfortunately, they never can see it themselves; it is only the people on the ditch who can see it.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the litigants who are going before the district justices.  I would ask him also to consider the question of the Irish language. The late District Justice Walsh was responsible for endeavouring to encourage the Irish language.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, there are not.  He was responsible for the introduction of a scheme whereby Irish-speaking Guards were transferred to Irish-speaking districts and the courts were presided over by Irish-speaking district justices.  The Gardaí were paid additional salaries for being stationed in these areas and I understand district justices got certain privileges&mdash;the privilege, for instance, of remaining on until they were 70 years of age for presiding over courts in Gaeltacht areas.  I had the privilege of practising in those courts and I had the privilege of practising in the District Courts where 100 per cent. of the litigation was done through the medium of Irish.  The district justice gave his decision in the Irish language, and heard the evidence of litigants in Irish; solicitors cross-examined in Irish, but I am very sorry to say that that is a thing of the past.  Two per cent. of the litigation is no longer done through the medium of Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. It is due to the district justices not understanding the dialect of the people in that particular locality; that is the trouble.  They do not understand a witness who is speaking in the vernacular and neither does the litigant understand the district justice who is speaking in a different dialect.  In any of the Gaeltacht areas in the West, either the north or south&mdash;Deputies on all sides of the House who live in the Gaeltacht know&mdash;Gaelic in the courts is a thing of the past.  Let it be no longer a pretext for an appointment. But it could be revived and could be of some assistance, if the Irish language is worth reviving, and God knows, that is debatable at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Deputy Moran in asking the Minister to increase the jurisdiction of the district court and to put <Col N="888" /> tort on a par with contract.  If there are Deputies in this House who do not understand the meaning of tort and contract, let me try to put it in very simple language.  When this Bill comes into law, take the case of a man going to the fair with two heifers worth, say, £26 apiece.  He gives a warranty with one of the animals on the fair and eventually is sued on that warranty.  When this Bill becomes law he may be sued in the District Court, because the price of the animal is under £50.  He may be sued in the District Court because it is on a breach of contract he will be sued.  But take the second animal valued at the same price of £26, and say on the way home from the fair a motor collides with the animal which is injured and has to be destroyed. If the owner decides to sue the owner of the motor car, he cannot do it in the came court, because it exceeds the jurisdiction of the court, because the value of the animal is £26.  Unless he wishes to sue for a lesser value, he must sue in the Circuit Court and to sue in the Circuit Court it is usual to employ a counsel not merely on the hearing, but to draft the proceedings, and, as we all know in running-down actions, there is always an insurance company to hold that big stick over the head of the plaintiff&mdash;the threat of an appeal.</P>
    <P>I know of a case in the Circuit Court where an animal valued at £11 10s. was injured as a result of which it had to be destroyed, and the plaintiff obtained a decree in the Circuit Court.  From that decree, the insurance company appealed to the High Court on circuit and the plaintiff succeeded, but I am going to tell this House that the costs and expenses amounted to £45 on a decree for £11 10s.  The thing is outrageous.</P>
    <P>I shall not repeat arguments made by Deputy Moran in this House but they were correct and I would ask the Minister to pay attention to every one of them.  Put tort on a par with contract.  Increase jurisdiction.  By doing so, you will avoid the necessity of appointing an additional High Court judge and you will give plenty of work to the district <Col N="889" /> justices who are presiding over these District Courts to-day.</P>
    <P>I also agree that there should be some jurisdiction given to the District Courts on the question of slander.  All over the country, we Irish unfortunately are very prone to slander.  One thing we cannot do is keep our tongues quiet about our neighbour.  We are prone to slander and there is no person who knows that better than the country solicitor.  Take the case of Mary Brown calling Mary Black out of her name&mdash;I will put it mildly.  She goes to her solicitor.  Now, it is but right that Mary Black should have her character cleared, but if she wants to do so she can only do it in the Circuit Court, a most expensive procedure.  A solicitor usually issues a summons for threatening and abusive language to have Mary Brown bound to the peace and if there is a very astute solicitor for the defence he can raise so many hares that eventually the case is thrown out and poor Mary Brown is in a worse state than ever she was because it is then thought locally that the district justice confirmed or affirmed what was said about her.  For goodness' sake, give us jurisdiction even for £10 on the question of slander and it will stop the tongues from wagging.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have only one at the moment.  We may have another very shortly.  A solicitor appearing in court is only wasting his time; he has enough chamber work to do.  Country solicitors do not want this cheap litigation but they must placate their clients.  There are solicitors in Dublin who will not appear in court and most country solicitors do not want to appear in court.  They are much better employed in their own offices attending to their chamber business.  It does not pay the solicitor to appear in the District Court and do not think it is for the purpose of increasing litigation that these suggestions are being made. But we do know the problems, and I say it without fear of contradiction, that the solicitors and clergymen know more of the problems of the people of rural Ireland than anybody else.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to pay heed to it.  We are not advocating this for any financial gain of our own.  It is only when a solicitor has to explain to an unfortunate client that as the law stands he has no redress, that we realise the wrong the Legislature is doing to the people of rural Ireland. Knowing that, we make this appeal to the Minister and, if he does accept it, it will cost less than the Labour Party think it will cost by way of increased salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with Deputy O'Donnell that the people of Ireland are more prone to slander than the people of any other country.  We are prone to many things, I will admit, <Col N="891" /> but I do not think that we are more prone to slander than any other people. In regard to the Bill itself, I support very strongly the points made by Deputy Moran.  I was pleased to hear a member of the Government Party and a member of the legal profession advocate the reforms which he suggested.  I would go further and suggest that district justices should be given jurisdiction even to a higher amount than he mentioned.  Men who are appointed as district justices are generally men with a good knowledge of law and I cannot understand why the poor people of this country, and, indeed, the people generally, should be deprived of a chance of getting justice in the cheapest way possible.  So far as the Circuit Court is concerned, I am in entire agreement with the suggestion that the jurisdiction should be raised to £1,000.  I have been before the High Court on many occasions in connection with certain claims, particularly workmen's compensation claims, and I think it is a tragedy to see the amount of money that is spent sometimes on legal expenses in an effort to get justice for these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I happened to be called as a witness in an action at one time.  We were called to Dublin the night before the case was heard and we had an interview with a member of the legal profession which, of course, involved added expense for the person who was seeking justice.  The widow of the man &mdash;he had unfortunately been killed&mdash; and six witnesses had to come to Dublin and on the following day we went to court.  There was a leading counsel, a junior counsel, and a solicitor involved on each side.  There were Civic Guards and a surveyor also.  It took two days to hear the case and the woman was awarded £900 compensation. The insurance company appealed the case.  I do not know what system was in operation then, but none of the witnesses was called before the Appeal Court.  The result of the appeal was that the claim was dismissed and the widow got nothing at all because of some technicality.  I am satisfied that it is unfair to ordinary people to be brought up to Dublin in that way and to have to stay three <Col N="892" /> nights in the city because of the mere fact that the High Court cannot travel to Cork, Limerick, Galway or Sligo to hear cases there.  I think that is a matter of which the Minister should take very serious notice.  If the judges are there to dispense justice there is no reason at all why they should not travel to Cork, Limerick or anywhere else when there is business in these districts.  That is another reason why I think the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be increased up to claims of £1,000.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to pay some heed to the representations made by Deputy Moran who has considerable knowledge and experience of the conditions which obtain in County Mayo.  I speak with some knowledge and experience also of cases with which I have had to deal from time to time in Cork.  I think the time has arrived, even if it necessitates the setting up of a special Committee of the Dáil, to arrive at some arrangement whereby the administration of justice will be made less costly for ordinary people.  I endorse everything that Deputy Moran has said.  I hope the Minister will not alone take due notice of that but will implement most of the reforms he has advocated.  I am 100 per cent. with him in the statement he has made.</P>
    <P>I listened to some of the speeches in regard to the increased salaries for judges and I was rather surprised to hear some of the points made by Deputy Flanagan in justification of that proposal.  We do not object to our district justices and judges being paid properly but the implication in some of the statements made here was that our judges or district justices cannot be trusted to observe honesty in their decisions, to deal in an honest way with the people or to display integrity in the discharge of their duties unless we pay them a very big salary. I am not at all convinced that is a decent way to approach the matter.  A man should, of course, be paid a salary to keep him above the temptations of life but I think our judges are being paid that salary at the moment.  A man could have £10,000 a year and still live beyond it, <Col N="893" /> similarly a man may have £3,000 and live beyond it but we must have some regard for the people who are seeking to get justice.  Are we to accept it that the people, whom I would call the unprivileged classes, are expected to have all the virtues and all the honesty notwithstanding the economic pressure on them from day to day and that there is to be no question of tempting them while the man on the bench, who is expected to administer justice, must get anything over £3,000 a year before he can be trusted to give justice to the people who have recourse to the courts?</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the statements of certain Deputies about the danger of corruption.  Deputy Flanagan quoted some cases in England and referred to the danger of democratic institutions breaking down because of corruption in the administration of justice.  His argument did not convince me at all. Where corruption crept in, it arose from something other than the mere fact of insufficient remuneration or salaries.  Do we not all know that corruption takes place even in countries where judges have salaries of £20,000 a year just as well as in countries where they are at the bottom of the scale?  We, in the Labour Party, are not inclined to deal with this question in any petty way but we feel that our judges are sufficiently paid in the present circumstances of the country.  We are not averse to giving these people a status that will remove them from any temptation or danger of corruption but I detest the idea of anybody telling us that, if we do not pay these men £3,000 or £4,000 each as salary per year, there is a danger of corruption creeping into the judiciary.  I cannot forget the temptations and the economic pressure to which thousands and thousands of our people who have to go into court very often are subjected but there is no talk about lifting that economic pressure from them.  A man subjected to economic pressure may sometimes be driven to steal and I would appeal to both sides of the House to get down to the problem of doing something to prevent such people from having recourse to crime.  It is not by giving a <Col N="894" /> judge who is already getting £3,000 a year an increase on top of that that you will solve that problem.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what has been said already by Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Moran.  Deputy Moran covered most of the points in relation to the cost incurred by people seeking justice in our courts.  Deputy Moran mentioned rights-of-way.  I have often sat in the body of the court while cases in connection with rights-of-way were being heard.  Many times I have seen cases stopped because it was discovered that the District Court had not jurisdiction to adjudicate in the particular matter, and the case had to be transferred to the Circuit Court.  I appeal to the Minister to consider seriously the suggestion made by both Deputy Moran and Deputy O'Donnell in relation to increasing the jurisdiction of both the District Court and the Circuit Court.  The Minister should ensure, too, that the High Court would travel to areas like Cork for the purpose of hearing cases and avoid the necessity of bringing litigants and witnesses to Dublin in order to procure justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go minutely into the provisions of this Bill because I think the legal profession is sufficiently well represented here to do that.  I join in the appeal made to the Minister by Deputies to take notice of the suggestions made by Deputy Moran.  I think those suggestions would help to reduce the cost of litigation. The principal reason why I intervene is to support the proposition put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, Deputy Lynch, for the establishment of the High Court in Cork.  This Bill provides for the appointment of an additional High Court judge.  I understand the case has been made that arrears of work exist at the moment in the High Court because there are not sufficient judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal profession in Cork is under the impression that the Minister is in favour of establishing a High Court in Cork as soon as this Bill goes through. I understand the legal profession in Dublin invited a deputation from the Southern Law Association before this <Col N="895" /> Bill was introduced to support them in their demand for an extra High Court judge.  I believe they gave the Southern Law Association the impression that they were in favour of establishing a High Court in Cork.  There is plenty of accommodation in Cork Courthouse. There are two court rooms as big as any in Dublin in which the High Court and Circuit Court could conveniently sit and the Bankruptcy Court in Cork could, as it has been in the past, be availed of by the District Court.</P>
    <P>We hear a good deal about decentralisation and I think the establishment of a High Court in Cork would be a step in the right direction.  It would save a good deal of unnecessary expense.  It would save witnesses being brought up to Dublin and remaining there for several days, returning home to Cork for the week-end and coming back to Dublin again the following week.  That sort of thing discourages anyone of moderate means from trying to get justice.  There is no reason why these cases should not be heard in Cork.  Possibly some of the lawyers in this House who practise in the Four Courts would object to that because they could not conveniently attend the Dáil after their day's work.  Deputy McGilligan, as Deputy S. Flanagan pointed out, simply dismissed the idea of a High Court in Cork and said it could not materialise.  I see no reason why it should not.</P>
    <P>There is a reasonably well equipped law library in the courthouse in Cork. I am informed that a minor amendment of the High Court Rules and a simple extension of the Jurors Act is all that is required.  I appeal to the Minister finally to make up his mind and establish a High Court in Cork.  I would like the Minister when replying to tell us if there is any reason for not establishing a High Court in Cork.  The fact that members of this House practise in the Four Courts and can conveniently attend the Dáil is not sufficient reason in my estimation for compelling people to come up to Dublin from Munster in order to procure justice.  The Minister should seriously consider extending the jurisdiction of both the Circuit and District Courts.  That would ease the <Col N="896" /> burden on those compelled to go into court and save a lot of unnecessary expense.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to take part in the discussion on this measure because I think that when a member of a profession or occupation takes an active part in a discussion that concerns his profession or occupation the position is always invidious since he is open to the imputation that he has an axe to grind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, one section in this Bill that I would ask the Minister to reconsider.  I refer to the provision relating to the transfer of trials from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court.  I appreciate the arguments that can be put forward in support of the provision contained in the Bill.  I am quite prepared to admit that in a number of cases that right has probably been abused but I think the number of cases in which it has been abused is not very high and it is always rather dangerous to deprive an accused person of a right.  In some cases that can perpetrate an injustice against the accused person.  For that reason I appeal to the Minister to reconsider Section 12 and the amendments of the original Act.  In a great many cases it is an advantage for an accused person to have the right to have his trial transferred to Dublin to the Central Criminal Court.  If there has been an increase in the number of applications made for the transfer of trials from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court, I think that is in large part due to the fact that sufficient consideration is not paid by the Chief State Solicitor's Office or those in charge of prosecutions to the convenience of the accused person.  I do not say that by way of criticism of the Chief State Solicitor's Office or the officers in charge of prosecutions. Naturally, in dealing with the question of work, they very often are inclined to overlook the convenience of the accused person.  I think that the Minister should be slow to alter the position that has existed.  I am prepared, immediately, to grant to him that, undoubtedly, from time to time that provision will be used unnecessarily.  Yet, I think it is a valuable right for the accused person, <Col N="897" /> and I would ask the Minister not to interfere with the position that has existed in that regard.</P>
    <P>A great many points have been made by Deputies and on these I should like to put forward one or two considerations.  There is the feeling, very often, that judges in court do not work hard enough and that their hours of sitting are not long enough.  I think that view is usually put forward by people who do not appreciate the actual difficulties and the working of the courts.  Most courts sit from 11 o'clock&mdash;sometimes from 10.30&mdash;until 4 o'clock.  That sounds very short. It is, of course, a short day if you were to take it that that was the working day of the average judge or average lawyer.  Their working days are indeed far longer.  The working day of the average lawyer is far in excess of the working day of a member of any other profession; but these are not the really material considerations. These hours of sittings were fixed largely to suit the convenience of litigants, of witnesses and of jury men.</P>
    <P>Take the position which obtains in the country, for instance.  Take the position that obtains in the case of appeals to the High Court on circuit in the country.  Deputy Moran is here and will bear me out on this.  You have the High Court sitting in Castlebar to hear appeals from all over the County Mayo.  The litigants and the witnesses have to travel maybe 40 or 50 miles to the court.  When they reach the town they must have an opportunity of seeing their counsel and solicitor to discuss the case.  As matters stand at the moment they have to leave their homes at an early hour to rach the place where the court is being held by at least 10 o'clock in the morning.  That very often means that they have to leave home at 7 or 8 o'clock in the morning.</P>
    <P>Likewise, these hours of sittings were fixed also to suit the convenience of jury men.  Take Dublin for example. The Jury men are mainly business people.  They at least are in the position that they are able to go to their place of business in the morning before going to court and can go back to it <Col N="898" /> after four o'clock.  In that way, they are able to attend to some of their private business while serving on a jury.  If you lengthen the hours of sittings you are going to make it very difficult for them to do that.</P>
    <P>As far as the judges are concerned, it would be quite erroneous to have the impression that their work finishes at four o'clock or begins at 11 o'clock.  I think anyone who has any knowledge of the work of the High Court will know that there are many judgments held up owing to the fact that the judges have not the time to write them.  The court work is only, if you like, the result of the ancillary work that has been done.  I think that allowance has to be made.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGrath made an appeal for a special High Court in Cork.  I would not like to have that whole question examined on the basis of the requirements of Cork by itself.  I think there is a strong case to be made, a case which might not be very popular, but a case which I think is worth examining, that original jurisdiction should be given to the High Court right through the country.  If you are going to have original jurisdiction given to the High Court outside of Dublin, then I do not see why it should be limited to Cork.  Some means should be devised whereby it would apply to the whole country.  Obviously, if there is going to be a High Court sitting in Cork, then Galway, Limerick and other places will put forward a claim that they should have High Court sittings as well.  I think it is a case worth examining, the question whether or not the High Court on circuit and the Circuit Court should be given original jurisdiction.  It does not arise on this Bill and I mention it merely in passing.</P>
    <P>On the question of the independence of the judges, I think there is one matter that has been overlooked by some Deputies who spoke.  One of the important things, I think, in regard to the judiciary is to ensure that they will be independent, independent not merely in the sense of being independent of debt, but that they should be placed in a position where they will not have to come in contact with the <Col N="899" /> public in the area in which they operate.  I think that is important, because justice must not only be fair but must appear to be fair.  If you were to find a judge having his meals with litigants or with lawyers in a public hotel, though they may never discuss the case and may never refer to any law case at all, nothing will eradicate the suspicion from the minds of the people who see them sitting there that they have done so.  You would have the same suspicion if judges were seen having a drink with litigants or lawyers in the lounge of a hotel.  It would be suspected that they were selling the pass.  We are rather suspicious minded in that way and it is important to ensure that, whatever provision we make for the judiciary, they should be left in a position of complete independence where they will be above suspicion from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Several references have been made to increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the District Court. I think there is a strong case for increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  I would ask the Minister, however, not to do it too rapidly or too radically, for this reason, that it is virtually unheard of to have a jury action in the Circuit Court.  Jury actions are determined by the High Court.  I know that a litigant has the right to insist on having a jury in the Circuit Court, but that in practice it is never availed of.  I think there would be many practical difficulties in the way of securing juries in the Circuit Court. Accordingly, if its jurisdiction is raised to a high level, it means that litigants and mainly poor litigants will be deprived of the opportunity of having a jury to determine their cases. I think that is the strongest argument against increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to be slow in yielding to any demands that the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court should be raised to a very high level. I admit, of course, that it has to be raised by reason of the changes in the value of money.  There are many alluring arguments which can be put forward by Deputies in suggesting a <Col N="900" /> higher figure, but I think the Minister should bear in mind that, when he does that, he is, in effect, depriving the smaller litigants of the opportunity of having a jury.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that inevitably on a Bill of this kind, which is not a controversial Bill, there should be different approaches and a difference of opinion as to the provisions contained in it.  I certainly find myself in disagreement with some of the views expressed by my colleagues here on certain details in the Bill.</P>
      <P>As I see it, the problem which faces the Minister at the moment in relation to the new Courts of Justice Bill is the problem created by the large cost of litigation in certain respects.  It is true that many actions at present tried in the High Court are very costly for one side or the other.  They are costly either for an unsuccessful plaintiff or for a defendant who may have to pay damages.  It has become the habit of ignorant people, and, I regret to say, many members of this House, to regard the cost of litigation as being merely the professional charges paid to solicitor and fees paid to counsel.  In fact those particular charges are strictly controlled on a scale laid down many, many years ago and they by no means represent the real cost of litigation nowadays.  The cost of litigation is measured often by the expenditure necessary to bring to the High Court in Dublin a great number of witnesses and to maintain them during the period a trial may be proceeding or during whatever waiting period circumstances may make necessary. The position at the moment in relation to High Court actions is that the costs of bringing a case to trial in Dublin represented by travelling and other incidental expenses in the city, have made litigation a very burdensome business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Minister proposes to deal with that problem on the same basis and following the same policy as was behind the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, I find myself in complete agreement with him.  The idea of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the parent Act, was to give the people, not a pale shadow of a <Col N="901" /> former British court but a real local court in which they could have their claims and grievances tried by a local judge.  In 1924, almost 30 years ago, it was thought necessary that the jurisdiction of the local Circuit Court should be a jurisdiction limited by the sum of £300 and that the jurisdiction of the District Court in contract should be £25 and in tort £10.  It does not appal me now, nearly 30 years later, that the Government should propose substantially to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and the jurisdiction of the District Court. It seems to me inevitable that a substantial increase should be made in the jurisdiction of both those courts if we are merely to maintain the idea behind the parent Act.</P>
    <P>If I find, as I do, that in increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court the Minister is to a certain extent helping to solve the problem created by present day costs of litigation, I find myself in agreement with him.  It has always seemed wrong to me that the smaller kinds of actions, either in contract or in tort, that 30 years ago would have been regarded as substantial actions in the Circuit Court should, by reason of the fall in the value of money, be driven for trial into the High Court, with the consequences of expense and matters of that kind.  I always regarded that as wrong and I welcome the fact that many of those actions now can be tried in the very same court as they would have been tried in after the passing of the parent Act in 1924.</P>
    <P>In proposing that increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court the Minister is doing the correct thing. There might be a difference of opinion as to whether the new jurisdiction should be, as proposed, £600 or something slightly smaller but it does seem clear that the jurisdiction should be substantially increased.  By increasing that jurisdiction and taking away a number of cases that are not really High Court actions the Minister will be reducing to that extent the costs of litigation.  To that extent I find myself in agreement with the policy behind the Bill.  There are, however, other matters which arise in connection with <Col N="902" /> the Bill that I would like to mention. Broadly speaking, the main features of this Bill, so far as the structure of our courts is concerned, are: an increase in the jurisdiction of two local courts and an increase in the number of judges in the High Court and a reduction in the number of judges in the Circuit Court. Those appear to be the four major aspects of this short Bill&mdash;increase the work to be done in the District Court; increase the work to be done in the Circuit Court; reduce the work to be done in the High Court; increase the number of judges in the High Court; reduce the number of judges in the Circuit Court and in the District Court.</P>
    <P>To me, <i>prima facie</i>, this appears to be a most illogical course of conduct. When this Bill passes into law the amount of work to be done in the High Court will be to a certain extent reduced, but there will be an extra High Court judge.  I can see reason for that and I certainly do not oppose it but when I come to the Circuit Court and find that in every circuit town in the country&mdash;there can be no doubt about this&mdash;the number of actions to be tried will increase substantially and, in addition, that the work of the District Court, particularly in rural areas, will be substantially increased, I cannot see on what basis it is proposed that the number of circuits and, incidentally, circuit judges and the number of districts should be reduced.  If a reduction in the circuits is carried out as proposed, in a very short space of time, a year or two, it will be the responsibility of the Minister for Justice of the day to seek sanction from the Dáil again to increase the number of circuit judges, perhaps indeed, by more than one.  I am afraid that, with regard to that matter, I must express disagreement with the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that in relation to some circuits a certain <Col N="903" /> amount of reorganisation may be necessary, but I cannot think of any group of three counties, when this Bill becomes law, that will get what we ought always to aim at, a situation in which there will be a speedy hearing for litigation.  You will not get that under this Bill if you reduce the number of Circuit Court judges.  Imagination bogs at what will happen in the Dublin Circuit Court if this Bill becomes law.  Even at the moment, with completely inadequate jurisdiction, the arrears in civil actions, in my opinion, are a scandal.</P>
      <P>At the moment in the Dublin Circuit Court, if notice of trial is served to-day, the litigant will be extremely lucky if he gets a trial in 12 months' time.  That situation will be made considerably worse because the number of cases to be tried in the Circuit Court will be substantially increased.  Do not let the Minister think that will be offset by the fact that the smaller cases will henceforth be tried in the District Courts, cases of tort up to £25 and contract up to £50.  In fact, the number of substantial cases, which ordinarily take longer than smaller ones, and cases of some importance to litigants will begin to accumulate in the different Circuit Courts.</P>
      <P>I do not think that at a time like this, when it is proposed to increase the jurisdiction of both these local courts, it is wise to experiment in the way now proposed, to experiment by radically altering circuits and District Court areas and reducing the number of Circuit Court judges and district justices.  If an experiment of that kind were to be made, it might be wiser to defer it for the moment and to see what effect this increase in jurisdiction is likely to have on circuits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am on the matter, may I also refer to another question which arises from the alteration in circuits? In Section 15 it is proposed to give the Government power themselves to alter the existing circuits and there is a similar power with regard to the District Court areas.  I hope it will be realised by the Government that <Col N="904" /> over the years a number of barristers have built up a livelihood on existing circuits, men who have during their years of practice at the Bar consistently practised in a particular group of counties and have followed consecutively the Circuit Court judges in different towns.  If an alteration in these circuits takes place of a drastic kind, they may find that, while heretofore they practised extensively in, say, the towns of Portlaoise and Tullamore, these towns are in different circuits and it is quite impossible to pursue the practice they have built up. That would be a very serious harm to them.  While I hope it may be possible by amendment to safeguard their position later, I should like to suggest to the Minister that no action should be taken with regard to that alteration in circuits without consultation with the interests affected&mdash;by that I mean the members of the Circuit Court Bar who may be affected&mdash;and without a real effort to ensure that Circuit Court sittings in the different towns will not clash, if that can be avoided.</P>
    <P>I should also like to join with the Deputies who have questioned the wisdom of Section 12.  I should like to hear what sound reason can be advanced for depriving accused persons of the right they now have to a transfer of their trial to the Central Criminal Court.  I do not mean this offensively, but Section 12 is a section that could well have been drafted in the Attorney-General's office, that could well have gone there from the Chief State Solicitor's office, and could well have gone there from the offices of the prosecuting superintendents, because it is an Attorney-General's section.  I do not think we should quietly pass a section of that kind without very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>Mention has also been made of giving the District Court jurisdiction in title.  I must say that I have an open mind on that.  I do not think it would matter very much whether or not that court was given a small jurisdiction in title.  There is one other suggestion I should like to make to the Minister with regard to the Circuit <Col N="905" /> Court.  I concede that the jurisdiction of that court must be increased and I concede also that we should all endeavour to make it a court which will cater for as many cases as possible in the different Circuit Court areas.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £58,500 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1954, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first of these two Supplementary Estimates relates to payments to Mianraí Teoranta for prospecting. It is, perhaps, necessary to explain how the need for the Supplementary Estimate arose.  In May of last year the Government decided to increase the expenditure authorised upon mineral investigation work at Avoca, County Wicklow, to £289,000.  When the Estimate for the Department was being prepared it was understood that the actual expenditure to the end of the financial year&mdash;that is to 31st March last&mdash;would be £262,500, leaving an amount available for the current financial year in accordance with the Government's decision, of £26,500 and that is the amount which appeared in the Book of Estimates.  It was clear, however, that the exploration of the <Col N="906" /> minerals at Avoca would not be brought to a satisfactory stage without further expenditure beyond the original provision, and the Minister for Finance indicated in his Budget statement that additional expenditure was foreseen and that a Supplementary Estimate would be required.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, Mianraí Teoranta submitted proposals for the completion of the mineral exploration scheme at Avoca involving the expenditure of an additional £100,000 and based mainly on the utilisation of diamond drilling. The Government decided that the exploration work should proceed but that the scheme of exploration prepared by Mianraí Teoranta should be amended so as to ensure the retention in employment of the maximum number of men with mining experience, as it was appreciated that the availability in the area of men with mining experience would facilitate the commercial development of the minerals later.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision was that, if and when expenditure reached the limit of £100,000, a further report on the progress of the investigation should be submitted to it.  It may be asked, however, why, if the Government has decided on the recommendation of Mianraí Teoranta that additional expenditure amounting to £100,000 be undertaken on the exploration work at Avoca, this Estimate only provides for a total of £85,000 for that work.  The answer is that the Minerals Company Act of 1947&mdash;the Act which set this whole investigation in progress &mdash;provided for an overriding limit on expenditure on minerals exploration work of £85,000 a year.  That Act is due to expire on the 31st March next, in any event, and between this and then, consideration is to be given as to the question of whether its renewal is necessary.  It is not clear that it is necessary to continue the Act to enable this work to proceed.  That legal position is being examined.  As the position stands, however, with the Act in operation, there is a limit to expenditure of £85,000 and if expenditure should run up to the £100,000 of which the Government has approved then a further Supplementary Estimate may <Col N="907" /> be required during the present financial year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But I thought you could only spend £85,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear whether that Act would have to be amended or whether the authority of the Appropriations Act should be sufficient for the expenditure.  The total expenditure which was incurred on this scheme at Avoca up to the 31st March last was £262,500 and another £100,000 is now to be provided bringing the total cost of the exploration work to £362,500.</P>
      <P>The House will naturally ask: What are the prospects of recovering that money?  All I can say is that we are advised by the experts who are employed by Mianraí Teoranta to help them in this work that if the exploration establishes the existence in Avoca of ores to the extent of approximately 12,000,000 tons, then commercial working of these ores will be feasible and the repayment of the cost of exploration may confidently be expected. Investigations to date have proved the existence of approximately half the quantity of ore, the existence of which it is necessary to establish before commercial working can be contemplated, and the consulting geologists whose services are available to Mianraí Teoranta have recommended that the results of the work to date make it clear that the area is well worthy of further investigation.  In their view the speculative element has largely been removed and there is confidence that further exploration which will be partly by additional tunnelling and partly by diamond drilling will establish the existence of the total tonnage necessary to make the project a commercial prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should make it clear that the actual expenditure to the end of the exploration stage may in fact run beyond the £100,000 that was the estimate of the cost of the completion of this scheme prepared by Mianraí Teoranta and based mainly upon the diamond drilling.  The modification of that scheme consequent on the Government's decision may raise the cost <Col N="908" /> beyond that limit, but, in fact, expenditure as I explained, will not be incurred beyond that limit unless the Government is satisfied that it is justified on the basis of reports then made by the company and its consulting geologists on the results achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not quite get the beginning of the Minister's speech as a result.  I want to be quite clear as to the exact proposition being put before us.  As I understand it, the Minister has told us that there is now an expert's report before him which has been considered by the Government. It says that certain further work of exploration can usefully be done, and that that work in terms of volume, if you like, is fixed partly so far as the cost is concerned.  While it is believed it may be £100,000, the Minister cannot specify for certain that it is not going to exceed that sum, nor that it is going to come completely up to that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understand the Minister correctly he is telling the House that the experts concerned have indicated that certain work has to be done, and it is that work, and that work alone, which is necessary for the purpose of arriving at a decision whether there is sufficient volume of mineral available to make commercial working and efficient working possible.  The Minister mentioned a figure of 12,000,000 tons and a sum of £362,000.  If my arithmetic is not altogether awry, that would represent a royalty of about 9d. per ton.  I do not know how that would compare with the sale price of the ore or the mineral produced, but if there was a 12,000,000 ton deposit, I should like the Minister to say what <Col N="909" /> is the world market price of such mineral and whether the 9d. per ton is a small royalty or a large royalty in comparison with the price.  I think the Minister might usefully give us that information.  In other circumstances, we might have chaffed the Minister somewhat about the fact that about the time the Book of Estimates was prepared this work was not going to be done, but then, rather coincident with certain events in Wicklow, it came to the forefront again.  Having, however, been victorious in that campaign, we can afford to let the Minister off any adverse comment on that line.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate is one that will not be vouched to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  It provides for a grant, I understand, to the company, and it is paid if and when the company requires funds, and the actual detailed expenditure will not be subject to audit.  That again brings me to the general question of the necessity for some type of control by this House over these subsidiary bodies and companies that are set up with State funds.  They were set up with State funds because it was thought&mdash;and there is an argument in favour of it&mdash;that day-to-day detailed Civil Service control was undesirable over the work of such companies, but I think there should be some scheme brought forward, and agreed to by the House, by virtue of which you would have something in the nature of or the equivalent of an annual general meeting for these State companies from which rather more information would be obtained than would be available by question in the House and which would be more appropriately obtained at a meeting like that rather than by question.  As it is, the only way in which information can be got about this type of company is by the form of question, which quite frankly I do not think is the right way because I accept the principle that the Minister has no responsibility for the day-to-day detailed working of the company.  The Minister merely lays down general policy for the company.  As matters stand there is no method of eliciting information except by form of question <Col N="910" /> or on the general Vote.  We must appreciate, however, that this is taxpayers' money, that we are here as representatives of the people and that there should be some method by which information can be obtained for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>So far as the exact estimate is concerned, I want the Minister to be quite clear and quite specific as to the value of the work that is to be done.  I am not asking him to express how many areas or miles of tunnels have been explored, but I want to know is this the final work which it is deemed desirable by the experts to do, to decide whether the minerals are worth working on a commercial basis or not.  I am not so much interested in whether or not the work is going to cost £85,000 or £150,000.  If this is successful as an exploration basis, then, obviously, one moves on to something permanent.  I want to be clear as to what the experts have to say, if they think there is nothing more we can do by exploration or whether there is anything else we can proceed to consider.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing I should like the Minister to remember is that this form of exploration is speculative and we have to be prepared in any attempted development, to speculate and to take plenty of risks.  This is one scheme in which we have to take risks.  I think we should be prepared to withstand many failures and we should appreciate that we have to sink a good deal of money in these ventures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty in answering Deputy Sweetman's question as to whether this represents the final stage of the work is that there is still, to some degree, an element of uncertainty and while that element of uncertainty has been considerably reduced by the work to date it cannot be eliminated altogether.  When the Act was passed in 1947, I instructed Mianraí Teoranta to prepare a scheme for the exploration of the Avoca deposits.  That scheme was submitted and was then estimated to cost, to completion, £250,000.  Their scheme was in fact approved by the Government of the day early in 1948. Later there was a reconsideration of the desirability of authorising that expenditure on the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> There was a period in which the succeeding Government were doubtful whether they should go on with the scheme at all.  Ultimately, there was the decision to go ahead upon a limited basis at a total cost which was not to exceed £120,000.  It was thought then that that expenditure would give sufficient information to enable a decision upon commercial working to be taken. Mianraí Teoranta then ran into some difficulties.  The de-watering of the old workings proved a particularly difficult and expensive operation mainly because of the wastage of plant due to the presence of sulphur in the water.</P>
    <P>A further expenditure of £70,000 was therefore approved by my predecessor in March, 1951.  When I resumed office as Minister for Industry and Commerce the company came to me and said that to speed up this work, which I was anxious to have done, the tunnelling on which they were proceeding was going rather slowly and should be augmented by a diamond drilling programme and a further expenditure of £99,000 was approved for that purpose.  At that time I was given to understand that that expenditure, when completed, would have brought this exploration to the stage at which enough knowledge would be available to start trying to sell the idea of the commercial development of minerals to firms that might be interested.  That did not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Did it not happen because the cost of the work was greater than anticipated or because it was found there was other work to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was partly due to the fact that the diamond drilling revealed that the best prospects lay in another direction.  Let me put it this way: the company said they had proven enough to put almost beyond doubt that the balance of the ore required for commercial working was there, but that was not good enough to go to anybody that one was trying to interest in the commercial exploitation of the minerals and they, therefore, proposed to complete this work in the direction <Col N="912" /> of the existing tunnel by a diamond drilling programme and it is on the work in hands on the tunnel and the diamond drilling programme that this expenditure of £100,000 is involved.  At that stage the Government, while anxious to get an early completion of the exploration work and approving of the idea of completing it by diamond drilling, recognised it was also desirable to keep the tunnelling operations in progress for the time being, firstly, because the tunnel itself would be an asset to anybody who might be thinking of carrying out mining operations and, secondly, because of the retention of the experienced miners which the company employed.  Therefore we said: &ldquo;O.K., we will give you the £100,000 you say will complete this work, but we want you to modify your programme so as to retain these experienced miners in your service to whatever extent is practicable and we will recognise that your estimate of the cost may no longer be accurate.  It may involve an expenditure of more than £100,000, but when you have reached the £100,000 you have got to come back and tell us if it is worth while going on.&rdquo;  That is how it stands at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is a fact that when this physical volume of work is done, that is all the work that remains to be done for exploration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Deputy will appreciate that if the diamond drilling at an early stage should show that the ore has petered out, it will stop then.  The exploration goes on only so long as the ore continues to be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If this physical volume of work shows a good return there is no other exploration work to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position.  On the recovery of cost, the question I put to the officers of the board was this: &ldquo;This means that ultimately we are going to put £400,000 into the exploration of these minerals; when we have established the existence of 12,000,000 tons of ore of this analysis, is it worth anyone's while to pay us £400,000 cash <Col N="913" /> for the privilege of working the minerals?&rdquo; and they said that beyond doubt at the prevailing prices for these minerals it would be worth that outlay to any company anxious to undertake commercial development.  It is on that basis that I am justifying to the Dáil the provision of the additional money required.  It is also a fact, of course, that the actual expenditure now contemplated is relatively not very much greater than the estimate prepared in 1947 by the board having regard to the changes in values since.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £145,250 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1954, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has two parts in it.  The first is consequential on the passing of the Turf Development Act, 1953, which provided for increased grants to Bord na Móna for the building of houses.  As I explained, when the Act was introduced the 1950 Act provided for much lower grants to Bord na Móna for houses on the assumption that Bord na Móna would qualify for advances out of the Transition Development Fund as well as for grants provided under the Act.  In fact that fund was wound up before Bord na Móna got building the houses and so they were unable to draw from it.  I told them to go ahead and that retrospectively the amount they expected they would get would be provided for them.  There is due to the board.  Therefore money on the basis of grants at the rate of £570 per house for 464 houses built.  They built some other houses with shops and so forth that are let at economic rents, but the number that qualify for grants is 464.  That represents a total of <Col N="914" /> £264,480 due to them against which they got on the basis of the old Act £84,680 leaving a balance due of £179,880.  There was provided in the Estimate £85,500 leaving £94,380 still due to them which is being rounded up by this Estimate to £95,000.  That is the amount which is due to them and payment of that sum now will enable their housing activities to be maintained without a further payment for this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are going to dispose of the Estimate for Bord na Móna now, I want to make a few remarks on it.  The situation in regard to Bord na Móna housing in my constituency is far from satisfactory.  The Minister has given figures to show that a grant of £570 per house has been made available out of State funds.  Notwithstanding <Col N="915" /> that there is a very strong feeling in Kildare that the rents which are being charged by Bord na Móna for these houses are out of all proportion to the tenants' income.  I do not know how the Minister gets the figure of one-eighth of earnings.  Is that to be taken in regard to all the money going into a house, or all the money coming from Bord na Móna employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one-eighth of the earnings of the tenant of the house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that many of the ordinary people down there working on the bog earn up to £7 a week.  You might come across the case of a man who was able to earn up to £7 a week in view of the fact that he was particularly skilled or very strong.  I have heard complaints from around that area.  I have no way of knowing whether they are true or not. I have heard the complaint that the average rent which the people working on the bog have to pay is £1 per week. These people are certainly not earning £8 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The average which the board is getting is 14/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On that basis a man's average wage would be £5 12s. a week.  The figures quoted locally in regard to rents are substantially in excess of that mentioned by the Minister. I am not in a position to say whether the rent which Bord na Móna is getting includes the rates, and I am not quite sure as to whether, in the case of houses such as these, there is any relief in rates.  I do not think so.  That might explain the difference as between the Minister's figures and mine. Be that as it may, the fact is that you have in Timahoe and Blackwood a very great number of houses of which only about onethird are occupied.  They have been built now for some time&mdash;a matter of some months.  I was in the neighbourhood five or six weeks ago, and I was told that not more than 60 out of 160 houses were occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="916" />
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the people consider that the rents which they are asked to pay are too high.  There is also the system under which people go into occupation of these houses.  If a person goes into one of them, and then ceases to work for Bord na Móna, he is put out the following week.  That system does not enable people to build up a home for themselves.  I referred to that when the Bill was going through the Dáil.  Bord na Móna are not going to get any local people, who want to build up a home for themselves, to go into any of these tied houses.  We all grumble no matter what walk of life we are in, in regard to the rents which we have to pay. There are objections on that score, but I believe that the real objection and reason why these houses are not occupied is that the local people will not go into them as long as they feel that they must leave them if, after a period, they cease to work for Bord na Móna.  That is why so many of those people are coming to the local members of the county council, and to the county council itself, pleading that it is essential for them to have houses in which they can reside without the feeling that if they cease to work for any particular employer their home, as well as their employment, is going to be disturbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago a commission reported on cottage tenancies and strongly advised against the tied house.  In these circumstances, it is a pity that a State body should have introduced it here.  I know that the reason why it has been introduced is not from the point of view of trying to have a clamp on the men concerned, but rather to have a labour force in the area.  I think that the board and the Minister would be better advised to try to get their labour force by making the conditions worth while for the workers rather than having forced labour of this type.  If a man happens to be working for Bord na Móna, and is not satisfied with his work, he knows that in order to keep a roof over his head he must go on working for the board.  He cannot go to any other job because if he does he must leave their house.  I suggest that you are not going to get the best out of <Col N="917" /> any man under those conditions.  The position is not going to be satisfactory, and in the long run Bord na Móna are not going to get efficient work.  It would be far better if men were induced to take up work because of its attractiveness.</P>
    <P>As I have said, about 60 out of 160 houses are unoccupied.  These houses are in an area where there are very great housing needs.  We, on the country council, certainly need to build more houses there.  At the moment we are looking for suitable sites in the area to build more local authority houses.  It is not easy to get suitable sites because of bog foundations.  It is a matter worthy of consideration whether it is wise for the local authority, on the one hand, to have to go out and get houses for local people while on the other hand you have Bord na Móna houses idle, because the local people will not go into them.  The reason they give is that, while they want to build a home for themselves in their own neighbourhood, if they go into a Bord no Móna house and if they cease to work for the board they will have to give up the house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these houses long unoccupied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them, I think, for five or six months.  The scheme, I think, was finished in the spring of this year.  Whether the contractor handed over the houses which had been built earlier, before the whole scheme was finished, I do not know.  To the ordinary person they would appear to have been finished for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention one matter which, perhaps, is not relevant to this Estimate except from the point of view of the tenants.  Last week, in the course of the discussion on the Vote on Account, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare said that men who were unemployed should go down and work for Bord na Móna. On Friday last, having seen that in the newspapers, a man who is a fit man in every respect, cycled from Celbridge to the Bord na Móna camps at Timahoe, a distance of about 16 miles.  He <Col N="918" /> carried his kit on his bicycle.  When he got there he was told that there was no work for him, that they were letting people go and not taking on any.  If they are letting people go because of the end of the season, and if, at the same time, they have empty houses, it seems to me almost certain that, as long as the existing restriction in regard to these tied houses operates these empty houses will continue to be empty for the whole of the winter.  If they are empty for the whole of the winter the houses will not be in the condition that new houses should be in when next year's work on the bog comes round.  The matter is one that requires immediate attention.  That man was sent home and told there was no work for him, that far from taking on additional men, they had now reached the point at which they would be reducing.  That rather belies the information that was given to the House last week.  The man concerned considered it so extraordinary that he came on his bicycle the further few miles the following day to see me and tell me that that was so.  It could naturally be, perhaps, the time of the year in which the peak period of production would have passed but it is worth consideration when it is tied into the position that there are empty houses in the village of Blackwood at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of housing, I think we should get our minds clear as to what is the purpose of Bord na Móna.  They would not have built houses at all if the local authority was prepared to build houses for them but the local authority claimed that as the financing of their housing activities was based on the assumption that the rent would be payable on the houses over a longer period than the life of the bog, when worked by Bord na Móna, they would not undertake that job.  Bord na Móna decided to build houses for their workers and to have always a surplus of houses available so that when men were attracted to their service and were prepared to take permanent employment with them they would not be deterred from taking it by reason <Col N="919" /> of the absence of housing accommodation. These houses are for the board's permanent workers, not for their seasonal employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>But, of course, people usually become permanent employees there by going in for a season and being permanently absorbed later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  What the board was anxious to avoid was good workers who liked the job being prevented from taking employment with them by reason of the absence of housing accommodation.  Another point of view of the board is that they have not got an obligation to provide houses for local workers.  Deputy Sweetman spoke about local workers in this connection. In the case of the Lanesboro bog, the Longford County Council asked Bord na Móna to agree to the transfer from county council cottages to the Bord na Móna cottages of workers employed by Bord na Móna and Bord na Móna said no, that the county council had built these cottages for Longford workers employed in that locality and they were rightly and properly in them, that the board had not got a job to provide houses as a contribution to the housing programme, that their job was to have houses so that they could attract to their work in Lanesboro, County Longford, men from all over Ireland who might be prepared to take that work.</P>
      <P>There is another point.  Bord na Móna have applications for these houses from people not employed with them far in excess of the number of houses and, if they have been hesitant in letting the houses in some cases or if workers have been hesitant in taking them, it is because both sides want to feel that this will be a permanent contract between them.  It is obviously better that the contract should be permanent and that both sides should recognise it to be permanent before the house is let.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While Bord na Móna get this subsidy from State funds towards the cost of these houses, they are not letting <Col N="920" /> them at an economic rent.  A further contribution from Bord na Móna's own general funds is required to enable the houses to be let at the rents at which they are available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Can you not give us the figure of the cost of, say, the Blackwood or the Lanesboro scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I cannot do that. They are not in a position to give that figure yet.  They can only give them in respect of a past period.  The system is simple.  With a minimum of 12/- and a maximum of 27/6, the worker pays 12½ per cent. of what he earns in any week.  He is not paying a fixed rent per week&mdash;an eighth of his earnings every week.  Consequently, the board only after a period of time will be able to see how that works out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the capital cost of the houses in the board's schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can get the information but it averages £1,500, I understand, for them all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>£1,500?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for them all.  The fact that the board is itself subsidising the rent of these houses is surely another argument against the board being expected to rent these houses at these rents to persons who are not employed by it and to whom it has no obligation whatever.</P>
      <P>One further point in connection with employment: I do not know that the board ever said specifically that they had vacancies in County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The houses are empty.  I have seen them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean vacancies for workers in camps.  They had their recruiting staff going around the country seeking to recruit an additional 1,000 workers, or so, after the campaign had started, but I do not think it was for the Kildare camps they wanted them specifically. Their main problems arose in some of the other camps, like that at Lanesboro, to which I have referred.  It is also true, of course, that they are coming to the turn of the year now <Col N="921" /> and, from this on, seasonal employment will tend to diminish although the season goes on for some weeks yet. Roughly about half the board's employees are permanent, 52 weeks of the year, and the other half are seasonal.</P>
      <P>May I say also that the experience of the board is that when they get a man into their employment he either gets so fond of the work that he will stick to their employment even as against attractive offers from other employers or else he gets so to hate the work that he will never go near a bog again?  Everybody reacts one way or the other to bog work.  Some become enthusiasts.  Some find it completely obnoxious and will not take it.  Their experience is that every year there come in as seasonal workers some who get so fond of the work that they stay and some who will not stay more than two days; a third wet day on the bog and they are off.  If they are going slow in allocating their houses it is because they want to make sure that the people getting them are people who have decided to make turf development work their life's career and to settle down in the locality of the bog and to rear their families there.  If they go slow and confine their tenancies to people of that character, there will be less trouble.  The board are wise in taking that course.</P>

      <P>The second part of the Estimate refers to the Grass Meal Production Act.  Two hundred and fifty pounds of the sum is to defray the preliminary expenses for the incorporation of the company and £50,000 is the grant to the company towards the initial capital cost that will be incurred.  The Dáil knows that the purpose of this Act is the cultivation of bogland in undeveloped areas and the utilisation of hitherto undeveloped natural resources by cultivating the bogland for the production of grass, and possibly for crops.</P>
      <P>The scheme is only in the nature of an experiment, and it is expected that it will probably take two or three years before the grass is produced to such a stage that the processing for grass meal production can be commenced.  In the meantime, other methods will have to be found for the disposal of the grass, possibly by the grazing of animals.  It is not expected that even the most successful outcome of the experiment will solve the unemployment problem in these most remote western areas.  The purpose is to demonstrate the commercial possibilities of the successful cultivation of bogland, and it is the intention that expenditure by Mianraí Teoranta during the experimental period should be limited to the amount necessary for that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The capital expenditure on the project as a whole is estimated to be about <Col N="923" /> £165,000.  Originally it was estimated to be £150,000, but as a result of adjustments, the best estimate now is about £165,000.  Initially, that money will be made available out of voted moneys, but it will be recalled that on the 5th June, 1952, the Minister for External Affairs announced the proposals for the utilisation of moneys out of the Grant Counterpart Special Account. Of these moneys, £150,000 was to be provided for the purposes of this grass meal project.  The utilisation of the funds is still, in fact, a matter of consultation with the United States authorities.  The directors of the company were appointed by warrant on the 29th June this year for a period of 12 months from that date.  The names and addresses of the directors were published, and they are: Mr. Thomas Scanlon (Chairman), Mr. Richard Barrett, Mr. Thos. Flanagan, Mr. Wm. Gahan and Aindriú Mac Giolla Phádraigh, Uas.  The appointments, including that of the chairman, are of a temporary nature.  The remuneration for the chairman is £250 per annum and for the other directors £150.</P>

That is the job of the Minister for Agriculture, and his advisers are the people who should advise on that.  It seems to me extraordinary that the Department of Agriculture should be elbowed out of this whole scheme in the way they have been by the Department of Industry and Commerce.

      <P>He may want to have the alibi, but seriously I want to say this to the Parliamentary Secretary: it is a situation in which he should avail of the facilities and advice of the Department of Agriculture.  I appreciate, and I am prepared to pay tribute to the Sugar Company's work at Gowla.  That work is of great value, and presumably the Sugar Company's employee who is being put on this board has experience of great value in the utilisation of bog for production, as production has taken place at Gowla, but it is not from that aspect of it, we should consider it.  We all know you could bring the bog to cultivation in a way that would be entirely satisfactory but that what you are putting on it in the end might not be any good.  There is good grass and bad grass, just as there are good Ministers and bad Ministers and good Deputies and bad Deputies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ensure that when the grass grows on the bog that it is good, and I do not see why the Parliamentary Secretary should be setting up this company as a sort of a rival to the Department of Agriculture to decide what is the best type of grass to grow for the purpose of making grass meal.  I think the facilities of the Department of Agriculture should be brought into it and that there should be far more advice from the technical end than apparently is being obtained. The Parliamentary Secretary has been bitten with the success of Gowla as an experiment and I am prepared to pay tribute to the success as an experiment, but I am not prepared to subscribe to the view that the Department of Agriculture is not the best State agency to advise on the type of product that should be put on the bog for the purpose of getting the highest protein content meal, for example.  I do not think much consideration can have been given to that from the right angle, and while the Parliamentary Secretary speaks of getting a satisfactory manager, I do not think you are going to pick up a grass meal manager, with experience as such.  I would be <Col N="927" /> very surprised if you did.  The number of such factories all over the world would not be sufficiently large to pick up somebody like that, but the Parliamentary Secretary when getting his manager will want to bear in mind that this cannot be considered as an industrial operation.  It must be considered as an industrial operation that is part and parcel of an agricultural one and it is on the success of the agricultural product that will depend the success of the industrial product at the end of it.</P>
      <P>It is a very simple matter, indeed, to make meal out of anything that grows of a leafy nature like grass, but it is a very different story to ensure that the meal that is produced at the end of it is made out of such grasses that the result in the end is a satisfactory meal. I am afraid consideration is only being given, first, to the problem of drainage of the bog and secondly, to the problem of cultivation, and thirdly, to the matter of getting the cultivated product into meal.  You want to ensure that the meal is of the right protein content; that it is sufficiently economical, and that can only be achieved by ensuring that the right grass is used for it.  I do not think it is feasible to have it cut every year, for instance, as I am sure it will have to be strip grazed.  I feel that the Department of Agriculture and only the Department should provide the knowledge to make this scheme a success.</P>

      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on being bold enough to put an experiment of this kind into operation.  I was sorry that anybody in this House should try to find fault with a scheme of this type which is of such great interest to the people of the western seaboard and to those of us who come from areas where the success of that experiment would mean so much.  I have no doubt that the best technical advice in this country will be available to the directors who are by no means men of straw as Deputy Sweetman suggested, knowing nothing about the growing of grass or anything relating to it.  They are men to whom I would freely entrust any important task but <Col N="928" /> particularly the one entrusted to them as directors of this particular company.</P>
      <P>I would have the utmost confidence in them.</P>
      <P>As regards advice I am perfectly satisfied that the best technical advice in this country will be available to them.  The important thing is that this scheme should not be sabotaged at the outset and that everybody should co-operate to ensure its success. I think £165,000 is not an exorbitant figure when one considers the possibilities and the potentialities behind the experiment which is being undertaken. One of the great problems which we have confronting us to-day is that of doing something for the areas which are becoming depopulated. We hope that what is a success in Mayo to-day will mean an improvement of things in Donegal to-morrow. Any money spent in the undeveloped areas will be welcomed by us, and the Minister who is introducing an ambitious scheme of this kind deserves the congratulation of the House.  I congratulate him, and I hope that this scheme will not be like the tomato scheme.  I hope no effort will be made to sabotage or hold it up to ridicule, or make it appear either unwanted or unnecessary.  It is an experiment, and I believe that in the hands of capable people it will eventually prove to be the success which we of the western seaboard want it to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views of the last speaker.  I think it is a good experiment, and the Minister deserves the commendation of the House on the matter.  I think the Minister and the Government can rest assured there will be no attempt on the part of anybody to sabotage this scheme.  I am sure I am speaking for every member of our Party on this question and that they wish it every success.  It could confer immense benefit on the people living in the areas where such things are necessary.  Undoubtedly people in those areas have not an opportunity of getting suitable employment at home and this will, in part at any rate, help to solve their problem.  I can assure the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary that any assistance or encouragement that can be <Col N="929" /> given will be forthcoming from members of my Party at any rate.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I do agree with Deputy Sweetman that it would appear, on the first look at any rate, that the Minister for Agriculture would be the appropriate person to deal with it, but I do not think it is really of importance who it is, provided the scheme is a success.  I think what is going to make the scheme a success or a failure is whether the produce, when available, will be produced at an economic figure.</P>
      <P>Grass meal has become popular where it has been used and, at the original price at which it was offered, it was a profitable business to the community, but I am afraid that latterly the price has jumped so considerably that it is doubtful if people can afford to pay it.  If it can be made available at an economic price, at a price which the people will think worth while, I have no doubt that the scheme will be a success but if they have to pay a prohibitive price, it will not be a success.  The economic development of the whole scheme should receive the constant attention of the Minister and his Department.  Where technical advice is necessary, I would suggest that if that advice is not available in the country it should be sought from outside, particularly if it would appear that production costs are tending to go higher.  I wish to conclude by giving my blessing to the scheme, and I wish it every success.</P>

      <P>Every Deputy welcomes any measure that would be helpful to the people along the southern and western seaboards.  We have again and again commented on the hardships under which these people live and have frequently tried to put up some schemes that would be helpful to them.  Unfortunately, some members of the present Government, including our friend, the Minister for Agriculture, are not very favourably disposed towards the implementation of those schemes.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary, however, to take cognisance of West Cork.  I think that it is no harm to discuss questions of this character in a rather parochial fashion because we are only just trying to ascertain what areas are most suitable. From what I can learn from the Parliamentary Secretary's statement and the contributions of other Deputies, I have no doubt that portions of West Cork would be quite suitable for a scheme of this kind.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that if he extends the scheme to that area we shall welcome it wholeheartedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome the scheme and to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his courage in embarking on a scheme which, as he said, is largely experimental.  I have often regretted that Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries were so shy in <Col N="931" /> attempting experiments of this kind. Naturally, men in their position are rather slow to try such experiments because they are afraid of the use that would be made politically in this House and outside it of the results of such experiments if they were failures.  In this particular case, I disagree with Deputy Sweetman and other Deputies as to the particular Department which should be dealing with this matter.  I would plump for placing it under the Minister for Education because if this experiment is a success it will be an education for all the people living on the bogs and in the congested districts of Ireland.  It will provide for them a new method of earning their living at home.  From what I have read about this project, if it is successful it can have just as revolutionary an effect on the whole of our economy as the development of the bogs had in recent years. I am sure that if many people, say 20 years ago, were told that electricity would be developed from the bogs they would have regarded it as a fairy tale but electricity in quantity is now being produced in remote bog areas.</P>
      <P>So far as the board to administer this scheme is concerned, I believe it has been well chosen.  I do not know where in this country outside the Sugar Company one could get experts in this particular line.  Apart from the experiments that have been carried on by Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, I do not know where industrial grass meal has been produced if it has been produced at all.  Taking the composition of the board, outside the people attached to the Sugar Company I happen to know only Mr. Scanlon who is an extremely successful and energetic businessman in the town of Ballina.  I know of course also our county surveyor whom we can very badly spare from the Mayo County Council.  No doubt the reason for putting him on the board is that the board will have the benefit of his knowledge and practical experience in draining bogs acquired during the time when a tremendous amount of turf was produced by the county council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable amount of the work attached to this project will involve the drainage of bogs and the laying <Col N="932" /> out and making of roads.  It was felt, no doubt, that the county surveyor could give valuable advice in these directions although, as I say, the time he will have at his disposal, except in the matter of giving advice, will be rather limited.  I cannot conceive any individual in that part of the country more necessary to put on that board to give the assistance which the board will undoubtedly require in embarking on its operations.  I would like to see the Parliamentary Secretary trying more experiments of this kind in these areas.  He should not be afraid of making mistakes.  If one does nothing one will never make a mistake.  Any mistake made in connection with this project will be a mistake made in the right direction, because something will be learned that will enable us to make the bogs in these isolated areas more valuable to the people living on and around them.  From that point of view any mistake will be worth-while. On behalf of County Mayo, I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and wish the scheme success.  I confidently believe that with the goodwill of both sides of the House it will be a success.</P>

Surely we are entitled to ask what the qualifications of the driving personnel are so that we may have some appreciation of the seriousness, or otherwise, of the project.  It is consoling to know that there is one engineer of considerable competence on the board.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary professes to have no experience <Col N="933" /> and no knowledge.  Anybody who knows anything about the bogs, irrespective of technical training, knows that one does not start draining operations in September.  My knowledge of drainage is limited to my service on the bog during the period when I was in the Army.  The preparation was commenced in the late spring and work continued right on into June and the beginning of July.  Surely the beginning of the winter season is not the time to start draining bogs.</P>
      <P>Deputies like Deputy Murphy and myself, who are intimately interested in country life, are alive to the possibilities of this type of development not only in the isolated areas of the West but also in the isolated areas on the south western seaboard.  We are entitled to ask when a not inconsiderable sum of public money is about to be expended what is the potentiality of success?  It can hardly be described as sabotage if we ask why the resources and knowledge available in the Department of Agriculture are not incorporated into the board.  The Parliamentary Secretary did not advert in his statement to the fact that there is expert advice available to him in the Department of Agriculture.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is sincere in relation to the success of this experiment, even though it may not be possible to get a highly qualified grass meal producer as such, surely it should be possible to enlist the help of people with avocations germane to the ultimate design of this whole business, which is the production of economic grass meal.</P>

    <P>I did not in any way try to damp this project when it was first mooted. Neither did I try to damp the ardour and the effort put into it.  The project has now gone beyond the embryo stage and more information should be available to the House as to the technical side of the project in view of the fact that none of the directors, with the possible exception of the county engineer, has any peculiar qualifications other than general business qualifications. I think the Parliamentary Secretary should have let us know what the <Col N="934" /> technical build-up is on the administrative side in the development of this project.</P>
    <P>I will not argue the pros and cons of the site chosen for this development. It may well develop into an area of considerable importance when the grass has gone through the experimental period and one can arrive at a good protein quality grass.  I do not subscribe to the view that one cannot grow grass in such an area.  It is possible that suitably reclaimed bog land may produce absolutely superlative grass.  When the Parliamentary Secretary ceases being, if one may say so, precocious in his provocativeness he will realise that we want to ensure that this experimental project is founded on the soundest possible basis.  I suggest that that basis has not been found in this instance because, in relation to bog drainage and bog development, there are infinitely better sources of technical skill from which to draw than the ones that have been chosen by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us an indication of how soon it is hoped to get this bogland ready for seeding and production.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the matter raised by Deputies Moran, O'Donnell and MacBride in regard to a possible increase in the jurisdiction of the District Court not provided for in this Bill.  As I understand it, it has been suggested that the District Court should have jurisdiction in title.  That is a proposition that has been suggested for a number of years, and as I said before, I have no very definite views one way or the other.  If it were done, it would be necessary to make the District Court a court of record, and certain consequences might follow from that.  Speaking about the Circuit Courts in the country areas, I do not think that the costs of title cases are <Col N="935" /> extreme.  I can see, of course, that if arrears now accumulate, as a result of a reduction in the number of Circuit Court judges, that, possibly, the position may be different, but at the moment I cannot see any sound reason why the jurisdiction of the District Court in relation to title should be changed.</P>
      <P>There is only one other suggestion that I would like to make with regard to the Bill itself.  I think Deputy MacBride, in questioning the extent of the increase in jurisdiction proposed for the Circuit Court, mentioned the fact that, by increasing the jurisdiction of that court to £600, that, in effect, the poorer litigant who had a claim for damages over £300 and under £600, would be deprived of his right to a trial by jury.  I think that is so, but I do not see any reason why that difficulty should not now be tackled.  I would like to see the trial by jury of civil actions in the Circuit Court given some realism.  At the moment, as Deputy MacBride has said, civil juries are not availed of by many litigants in the Circuit Court because, when their case is decided by a jury, there is an appeal, which is a rehearing, to the High Court judge who happens to come down as the High Court on circuit to that particular town.  That judge rehears the entire evidence that has been tendered before the jury and then gives his own decision on that evidence.</P>
      <P>For that reason, since the Courts of Justice Act of 1936, litigants have more or less discontinued the practice of having their cases tried by a jury in the Circuit Court.  In the 12 years prior to 1936, it was quite a common thing to see jury actions tried by the Circuit Court&mdash;that is claims for damages tried by a civil jury.  Up to 1936, the finding of the Circuit Court judge and jury was a final finding unless, in fact, the trial had been a mis-trial, or if the Circuit Court judge had gone wrong on some question of law.  Then there was an appeal to the High Court, not on the evidence but on the conduct of the trial or some question of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="936" /> Personally, I would suggest to the Minister that now that we are endeavouring to give the Circuit Court more or less the same jurisdiction that it had in 1924, we should seriously consider providing that, where a case in the Circuit Court is tried by a civil jury, there should be no rehearing on appeal to the High Court&mdash;that the only appeal from the jury's findings in the Circuit Court should be an appeal with regard to a mis-trial or on some question of law.  If that were done litigants who desire to have their cases tried by a jury in the Circuit Court would have available to them, in their own area, a jury in their own court able to try the case.  I appreciate that the question of giving jury actions that reality in the Circuit Court might involve serious consequences.</P>
    <P>I am conscious, with regard to juries, that it is an irksome burden that people have to bear in relation to their service as jurors.  I have no doubt that is a matter that may be dealt with in the near future.  I do think it is not right substantially to increase the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, and still maintain the absurd situation whereby the jury's verdict in the Circuit Court can be set aside on appeal on a rehearing of the same evidence by a judge of the High Court on circuit.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to the suggestion made by Deputy McGrath with regard to the High Court having original jurisdiction sitting in Cork.  It is true to say that for some years back the suggestion of a High Court in Cork has been mooted by the Cork Bar, by Cork business people and by Cork Deputies.  Deputy Lynch, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Government, who suggested it here in this discussion has, for the last two years, been in a position to influence the Minister.  I understand that, when this Bill was originally drafted, it contained a provision for a High Court in Cork.  I do not know what the difficulty has been, or whether, in fact, those who have been suggesting this provision have changed their minds; but, with Deputy MacBride, I agree that if there is to be a High Court, apart from one sitting <Col N="937" /> in Dublin, it should not be confined to the City of Cork.  If we are going to concede the idea of having a permanent High Court judge assigned to areas outside the capital, I cannot see why it should be confined to the City of Cork.  Galway, Limerick and Sligo command a very large area of litigation in their immediate surroundings. It is a matter that should be considered not in relation to any particular city but in relation to the country generally.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to mention one particular case, the facts of which I have already brought to the notice of the Minister. The Bill provides for an increase in salaries for judges and district justices. It does not contain any provision with regard to salary, pay and allowances of county registrars or Circuit Court and District Court officials, who will have to meet much of the extra work occasioned by this Bill.  I am not sure what the present position of Circuit Court officials is, but for many years they were not established civil servants and were more or less the forgotten children.  Possibly it may not be necessary to do it by statute, but I do not know why some provision is not made in this Bill for an improvement in their establishment and their salary.  The same applies to country registrars and District Court clerks.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on that.</P>
    <P>I also brought to the Minister the case of a particular former county registrar who served as State solicitor for a number of years in County Laois, who was then appointed county registrar and who served six years in that position.  On reaching the retiring age his service as county registrar was not continued.  He was retired under the age limit.  This particular solicitor's service as county registrar for slightly more than six years failed to qualify him for a pension.  He is now in his eighty-fourth year and has continued to practise as a solicitor, meeting great difficulties by reason of his age.  I suggest to the Minister that the case of this former officer of the courts who, in fact, had nine years in the public service, if his services as State solicitor <Col N="938" /> be included, should be covered by some provision in this Bill so as to provide him with a pension which he undoubtedly has earned.</P>
    <P>These, Sir, are the only matters I want to raise on the Bill.  As I said in the beginning, we all on this side of the House, particularly those of us who, as lawyers, are interested in social reform and social questions of that kind, naturally have different views with regard to this Bill.  Many of the points of detail that I should like to mention can be covered by amendments on the Committee Stage.  I know that the Minister brings to the discussion of the Bill a measure of goodwill.  I am certain that he is anxious to meet reasonable suggestions made from any side of the House.  On Committee Stage, suggestions can be made in more detail but, certainly, from my point of view, I agree with the principle contained in the Bill while I differ from the Minister in certain matters of detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having a very limited legal knowledge and very little association with the courts, my contribution to this debate will be necessarily brief. I am not in a position to give an analytical contribution as to the merits or demerits of the Bill but I am opposed to Part II which deals with the question of remuneration.  I do not see that those servants of the State are being dealt with in any niggardly way. In fact I think it is correct to say that many other servants of the State would have a far more just cause or reason to look for increased remuneration.  It is very improper for any member of this House to suggest that those gentlemen who are administering the laws of this country, or any other State servant, would be liable to act corruptly because of the standard of their remuneration.  That is something that should not be said.  It is unfair to the servants of the State in the first place and it might create the very thought in minds where it did not previously exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any member of the judiciary feels that the State is not dealing generously enough with him, he has a very ready alternative.  The number of applicants for his post, should he decide to <Col N="939" /> withdraw his services, would clearly indicate that there is a very big number of people in the country who feel that these people are sufficiently remunerated at the present standard.</P>
    <P>It is time that we came to realise that the cost of administration in every section of the State needs to be checked.  I do not know what demands were made on the Government for the increases which are being granted here.</P>
    <P>As far as the public are concerned, they do not think that the members of the judiciary were dealt with niggardly, whether they be High Court judges or district justices.  In many cases, members of the judiciary&mdash;I am not now referring to the district justiues but to the higher ones&mdash;have a very short day's work.  They usually begin about 11 o'clock and adjourn for lunch before 1 o'clock.  They return from lunch about 3 o'clock and they adjourn for the day at 5 o'clock.  I think that these will be found to be the aggregate hours of employment they put in.  Anybody who suggests that their present standard of pay does not compensate for the time that they spend at their job must place a very high value on the services of the judiciary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">

      <P>We know that county councils are often reprimanded for the condition of courthouses.  There is one type of person engaged in the courts who is not mentioned in this Bill, and he is the man with whom I have the utmost sympathy, and that is the juryman. He must give his services free; he must neglect his own work and, in some cases, has to spend up to a week away from his home without any remuneration.  I think that the Minister would have found no opposition from any Deputy if he made some provision for the jurors.  I have often thought that it was grossly unfair to take a man away from his job, as happens regularly in the City of Dublin in criminal cases, and keep him away from his work for practically a week.  Of course, he gets free accommodation, but he is kept away from contact with the public.  He is <Col N="940" /> sometimes granted the privilege of reading a newspaper, but he gets no compensation or remuneration.  It is suggested that an increase of £250 in some cases and £400 in others should be granted.  I do not agree with that and I would not support it.  I do not feel that they are inadequately paid at the present time.  If there was a commission set up to examine expenditure generally with a determined effort to reduce expenditure.  I think the first section they would deal with under the existing circumstances is the judiciary.</P>
      <P>At a time when we have a Budget of over £100,000,000 and when the Minister for Finance asserted recently that there should be a determined effort made to reduce taxation and hopes to effect a reduction of approximately £3,500,000 this year, I fail to see the consistency of these proposals. Peculiarly enough, when there was a suggestion made to effect economies, the section that was selected, tentatively at any rate, was the agricultural community, as there was a recent suggestion to change the scheme for the relief of rates on agricultural land and to effect a saving of £500,000.  There is a demand for economy, and I would support any move the Government would make towards effecting economy, but I would like them to act consistently in the matter and not to increase the salaries and allowances of men whom I consider are sufficiently remunerated at present.</P>
      <P>There is another point I should like to mention.  The ordinary individual in this country usually has to work about 40 or 45 years in his position before he establishes a right to a pension.  A judge need only work 15 years, and these years are worked out on a four-or five-hour day.</P>

      <P>I say in all seriousness that the people who have been marching through Dublin during the last couple of weeks are encouraged in the illegal manner in which they are acting by legislation of this type.  That is the truth, and those who mislead those people, and who are availing of the conditions which exist in the country have only to point to this kind of legislation to incite them.  If I went <Col N="941" /> down to Middle Abbey Street to-night I have no doubt that, with my limited powers of oratory, I could work up a fever of excitement amongst the unemployed people in the City of Dublin without referring to anything except this piece of legislation.</P>
      <P>There are servants of the State who are very poorly paid.  We have the unfortunate rural postman trudging round the country on 365 days of the year practically, in summer heat and winter snow, for £3 or £4 a week.  We have the policemen on duty for practically 24 hours a day for a few pounds a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other members of my profession, I look upon this Bill as, in principle, a very useful and effective Bill.  There are details to which I take exception, not in any spirit of animus, but rather in the spirit of trying to place whatever limited knowledge I may have of the working of the Circuit Courts and the District Courts at the disposal of the Minister.  I was rather taken aback by the vehemence of Deputy Finan's condemnation of Part II of the Bill.  I must confess that I do not find myself very sympathetic so far as the High Court judges are concerned.  I do feel, however, that any of us who have occasion to be associated with the District Courts and the Circuit Courts in Dublin, could not in fairness, taking into consideration the present value of money as given to us yesterday by the Taoiseach, deny increases to the district justices and Circuit Court judges, particularly the district justices.  Personally, I feel that their increase of remuneration is long overdue and, in view of the proposed alterations made in this Bill, that undoubtedly they will have a substantial increase in their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> I think it was unwise to take the Bill as it is being taken at present.  I think it might have been less contentious and less distorted if the Minister had found it possible to bring in a small amending Bill applicable only to remuneration and pensions without putting in a section with regard to the jurisdiction, etc., of the various courts. To that, all I say is, I feel the Minister should, if possible, honour the undertakings we know were given to certain sections who are going to be affected under this Bill.  I am not going to press it any further than that.  The Minister knows full well that the undertakings were given and that certain commitments were entered into on foot of those undertakings.  I feel in particular where the junior step&mdash;as I call them&mdash;of the judiciary are concerned, the increases in remuneration now granted to them are indeed long overdue.</P>
    <P>I am not going to enter into arguments or discussions on the merits or demerits of what happened at discussions between certain people and the Minister.  Suffice it to say, it is incontrovertible that undertakings were given and that as a result of these undertakings, people were committed in a way they would not have been committed except that these undertakings were given.  In those circumstances, I would urge the Minister not in any spirit of animus but rather in the spirit of trying to do what I feel the Minister himself would like to do&mdash; the essentially just and right thing&mdash; to reconsider the date of payment of these proposed increases to the district justices.  As I said, I am not going to enter into acrimony on that point.  It should suffice to make the plea to the Minister, not in any spirit of anything other than pressing him to do what I feel he, in his own true spirit, would be desirous of doing himself.</P>
    <P>We have had much discussion over many years on alterations of the jurisdiction of both the District Courts and the Circuit Courts.  I personally take the view&mdash;and have taken it for a long time&mdash;that with the present value of money, and the present standards, <Col N="943" /> laid down when money was of different value, this alteration is long overdue. We want to argue logically on the issue as suggested by the Bill.  My colleague, Deputy O'Higgins, when he was arguing to-day very wisely took the line, I think, that this Bill, in the main, proposes four or five different principles of issue.  The first is increased jurisdiction for the District Courts with a reduced number of district justices and rearrangement of district areas.  There is to be considerably increased jurisdiction for the Circuit Court and a reduced number of Circuit Court judges.  The natural consequence of that is that there will inevitably be less work for the High Court, but the extraordinary position arises of having more judges for the High Court.  I feel, myself, that the appointment of an extra High Court judge, with the present clutter up of litigation in the High Court, is essential, but I do not like the feature that seems to be appearing on the scene, of increasing District Court areas and increasing jurisdiction but reducing the number of district justices.  I am inclined to question the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government's approach when I remember in the very recent past there was another district justice appointed.</P>

And is it in a situation of an increased volume of work that we should start reducing the number of district justices?  Is that going to make for efficiency?  Is it going to make for ease of litigation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is, because my own personal view is that with the increased jurisdiction that is going to <Col N="944" /> be given to the District Court, it will become a court of more considerable argument than it is at present and there may be a tendency with the increase of contract and tort jurisdiction to have what you might describe as a miniature Circuit Court in the District Court in the future and most probably we will have the District Court afflicted with more persons of my profession.</P>

      <P>If you can find one occasion when I did anything to the detriment of either of those sections I will keep quiet for the rest of the time. Projecting the unemployment question on to this Bill is one of the causes of irritation which puts it into a contentious situation in which I do not think it should be.  That is why I said that the Minister might have been wiser to deal with the question of remuneration in a separate Bill and let us get down to a discussion on the merits of what the jurisdiction should be in the various courts.</P>
      <P>Let us go a step higher, into the Circuit Courts and, taking them by and large in a comparison of the present situation with the future, there is a likelihood of an increase of at least 40 per cent., I would say, in the work of the Circuit Courts in the immediate future when this Bill becomes operative as law.</P>
      <P>It is suggested here now that we should cut down the number of Circuit Court judges while we increase by 100 per cent. their jurisdiction.  I do not think that is going to make for efficiency, apart from the fact that it might entail hardship in the rearrangement of circuits for members of the legal profession who have built up a circuit practice.  It goes deeper than that.  It means that with this increased jurisdiction and the increased volume of work on the circuit, there will be, I respectfully suggest, more and more work and more time spent in the Circuit Court than hitherto has been the case.  There will possibly be more detailed argument and more detail in proof and evidence than heretofore, with the increase in the type of litigation to be decided by the Circuit Court.  I feel quite seriously that it would be infinitely wiser for the Minister and his Department to experiment on the increased jurisdiction and on the tightening up of districts and circuits before they embarked on possible reductions in the number of district justices or circuit judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister would require to have a picture of what the effect of the increased jurisdiction might be in relation to the volume of work in the courts before he could readily evolve the plan that might be <Col N="946" /> necessary in regard to the number of justices or Circuit Court judges.  I am not a believer in jobs that are sinecures and I do not believe in paying a person an enhanced salary if the work is not there for him to do but I do suggest earnestly to the Minister that, whatever the situation may have been in the past, once the increased jurisdiction becomes effective there will certainly be no tendency to a reduction of work for these people.  The whole tendency must be towards an increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in that spirit of analysis that I question the wisdom of envisaging too readily a possible reduction of personnel.  The district justices in the main have given very admirable service to the State.  We have had the position undoubtedly that some districts were overworked and we had scattered around the country districts in which it would be possible to say that there had not been a sufficient volume of work to keep a man fully occupied but, taking it by and large, reasonable adjustments would have made it possible to give sufficient work to all and not overwork anyone.  I think that in the increased jurisdiction that is now envisaged, there is a distinct possibility of a tremendous overloading of work, particularly in the District Court in Dublin City and County and, possibly, in the District Court in Cork City and County.  I would urge on the Minister that he should sit back for a while, watch that picture take shape and have his Department assess the effect of the change before he would eliminate, for all time, any of the districts.  He may have to enlarge a district or to reduce another district here and there to get equilibrium of work, but I would earnestly suggest that a reduction in the number of districts should not be contemplated until a comprehensive picture can be obtained from 18 months' or two years' operation of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Circuit Court, I do not think that Deputy Finan was <Col N="947" /> fair in his observations about the hours served by judges.  Some of the Circuit Court judges, in my experience as a circuit practitioner, have sat much longer hours than the normal court sittings for the purpose of accommodating litigants and for the purpose of assisting people to get litigation completed. The layman is too apt to look upon a day from 11 o'clock, with an hour's interval for lunch, to half-past four or five in the evening, as a short day without any realisation of what is entailed for the staff of the court, whether it be the official stenographers or the officials of the court itself, by way of additional work in records, etc., apropos of a normal five hours' discussion in court.  I conceive the judiciary in our democratic institution as one of the protecting arms of our civil rights and liberties.  Having designed them as such and having accepted them as something above the normal democratic institutions, something as an ultimate protector with certain limiting powers to assess what might be an erroneous view of even Parliament itself, once we put them in that position, it ill-behoves us, either by cynicism or unfair comparison, to try in some way to degrade them.  I feel it ill-becomes members of this House to be churlish or cynical to the occupants of these high offices for the purposes of either the popular Press or just mere vociferousness.</P>
    <P>In the main, it can truly be said that since the establishment of this State we have been given an impartial, loyal and dutiful service by our judiciary. They have discharged their functions within the framework of our democratic institutions in a manner worthy of the best traditions of legal training and principle in this country.  We have been projected into a discussion on this Bill which lacks realism.  We have been projected into it, in the main, by the unfortunate exigencies of our time. It does seem ironical&mdash;I agree with my Labour colleagues in this&mdash;that we are discussing a Bill in relation to a privileged class in circumstances of political and economic exigency.  I think it is unfair to these people, since they have no redress, that we should irrationally <Col N="948" /> and unreasonably project that unfortunate circumstance into what should be an impersonal and practical discussion on the functions of our courts, their jurisdiction and remuneration.</P>
    <P>I hope the preparation of this measure has focussed the Minister's attention and that of his Department on the many inadequacies and difficulties of establishment that exist in relation to the various officers of the various courts.  It is a matter of supreme cynicism if, having tried to remedy the difficulties in relation to the personnel of the District Court, the Circuit Court and the High Court so far as remuneration is concerned we do not accept the corollary of ensuring that the people who carry out the greater part of the burden, be they clerks, registrars, county registrars or officials, get a consequential increase that will equally ameliorate the economic circumstances of their lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He has not ruled in relation to county registrars.  County registrars have certain judicial functions. They make certain decisions.  I cannot understand why a passing reference should raise such a storm of protest.  I think the Minister has done a worthwhile job so far as this Bill is concerned.  Many of the reforms are long overdue.  The Minister deserves the thanks of the House for the suggested increases in jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan raised the question of Section 12 last night.  I think the section must be radically altered or omitted from the Bill altogether.  We should safeguard to the utmost of our powers the rights of prisoners.  If an accused person for any reason feels it is prejudicial to his interests to be tried in the Circuit Court it is unwise to take away from him the right he hitherto had of applying for transfer to the Central Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>That is a matter on which there will be divided opinions.  Where prisoners are concerned, I subscribe to the view that it is better to err on the side of being over-considerate than to lean in any way in the other direction.  It might well be that, even with the proposed change, the trial might be transferred from one circuit district to another without improving materially in any way the situation from the prisoner's point of view.  It is reasonable to suggest that, in certain areas where interconnection is as strong as it can be in rural Ireland, it would be of benefit to the prisoner himself that the previous method should operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that this section is drafted as <Col N="951" /> a convenient one for State personnel dealing with prosecutions, whether they be superintendents, chief superintendents, State solicitors or the Attorney-General.  I think myself that this is an unwise departure.  Whatever limited abuses may be suggested, I think that the principle underlying the present arrangement&mdash;with its safeguards and the lack of prejudice that operates against accused people under the present system&mdash;is one that should not be lightly changed.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that I would need very strong convincing in regard to the need of this section, before I could support it.  However, the matter is one that can be dealt with more fully on the Committee Stage.  On Second Reading, we deal, in the main, with the principles of a Bill.  I suppose that, outside that type of departure, the Bill, in the main, can be described as a good Bill.  It is one that will need amendment.  With the goodwill that we generally get from the Minister for Justice, I feel that this Bill will emerge from the Committee Stage as a substantially improved Bill.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the main feature of the Bill.  I would urge on him that he should not contemplate any drastic reduction in the number of Circuit Court judges or of district justices until he has had an opportunity of viewing the picture in operation under the new jurisdiction. I suggest he will then find that the complaints which have been suggested of district justices not having enough work to do will disappear.</P>
    <P>I think, in conclusion, that this Bill serves a worthwhile advance.  I think it will be welcomed by all who are interested in the functioning and development of our courts as a valuable contribution to the ultimate settlement of the jurisdiction of all types of courts, and so I trust it will get a speedy Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just listened to a long speech from Deputy Collins.  I am not surprised that the lawyers, from their point of view, should make a case for the judges.  I am here representing the rank and file of the working classes.  Yesterday, we had a Bill before us dealing with workmen's <Col N="952" /> compensation.  I should like Deputy Collins to pay attention to this, that if a young man meets with an accident in his employment and is disabled for life all he gets is 50/- a week.  There is no provision of an increase for him.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Government and the Minister should come in and ask for £16,000 after all the wailing that we have had from the Minister for Finance, the Government and Fianna Fáil Deputies that the country was bankrupt, and that the inter-Party Government had spent all the money that was there.  We have thousands of people unemployed trying to exist on 50/- a week.</P>
      <P>We, on the Labour Benches, are being asked by some of the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael solicitors to support this Bill.  I know that in the constituency which I have the honour to represent this Bill has been discussed by all sections, rich and poor. The Government are asking the House to increase the salaries of certain people by £450, at a time when our people are struggling under the high cost of living, many of them unable to get work.  It is at such a time that the Minister for Justice comes in with this Bill after all the talk that we have had here since the Budget of 1952 was introduced.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins spoke about prisoners. I have put down questions to the Minister in regard to the conveyance of prisoners.  As a member of a local authority, we have to provide £200 out of the rates for the conveyance of some unfortunate prisoners to Mountjoy. How are they conveyed?  Not in a State car.  No, but exposed to the country in a bus by the cheapest method of transport.  At the same time, we are being asked to vote increases of £7 a week to some people under this Bill while we have skilled workers in our factories trying to exist on a wage of £7 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government were very unwise when they allowed this Bill to be introduced, in view of the present state of the country.  The Taoiseach says that taxation has reached its limit.  Here we are being asked to vote money to people who are in very snug <Col N="953" /> positions and are well protected by pensions after short years of service. We, on the local authorities, have to provide electric fires and paint the courthouses at the expense of the rate-payers for these gentlemen who sit in these courthouses for a few hours in the week.  The solicitors and the barristers here have spoken in support of this claim, while the old people have to live on £1 1s. 6d. a week.  I did not hear much from either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael members about increasing their allowances.  We have had every solicitor and barrister in the House getting up and telling us how hard-worked the judges and justices are going to be.  The people of the country have their ears to hear and their eyes to see that there is too much playacting with regard to all this.  This country is supposed to be staggering under taxation.  Therefore, this House should not vote for these increases. There is no need for them.  If there were lowly-paid officials, as a trade unionist, I would be the last man to oppose increases for them.  I notice in the Book of Estimates that there is an increase of £2,000 for the Secret Service.</P>

      <P>A few weeks after the by-elections and all the talk on political platforms about the economic position of the country, it is unwise of the Minister to ask the House to pass this Bill.  There is a section of our people who are more deserving of the sympathy of this House than the persons provided for in this Bill.  The members of this House who have been advocating the cause of the judges should fight for the plain people and get something done for them by the Government.  Then we would not have the unemployed marching to Leinster House and on the streets of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> While that is going on, Deputy Moran, Deputy Seán Flanagan, Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Seán Collins are crying out about the hard work that judges have to do.  It is wasting the time of this House.  The Minister should not have brought in this Bill. There is more important work for us to do than to provide extra remuneration for persons who are already well provided for.  Lawyers on each side of the House are all for the judges.  There was not one lawyer who got up and spoke on behalf of workmen's compensation.</P>

      <P>They did not stress it as much as they stressed the case of the judges.  I cannot understand that. There is no need to worry about the judges.  They are all in protected positions. If there is money to throw about, there is a more deserving case than the case of these people.  The whole matter is out of proportion.  It is against the wishes of the Irish people.  We have heard all the moaning and wailing since the 1952 Budget was brought in about the high cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>You did a lot of moaning when you were in opposition.  On every platform you said that the Coalition had not left a penny in the till, that all the Marshall Aid dollars had been spent, that taxation had reached its peak, that if the Coalition Government were not thrown out, the country would sink.  After all that propaganda, the Minister for Justice wants to give more concessions to the well-to-do people.  I would not be representing my constituency if I did not condemn it as uncalled for.  There is no demand from the trade unions for it. Did the judges look for it?  No, they did not look for it at all.  We are told that if we do not give them a higher salary there will be corruption and that they will not work.  That is rather far-fetched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that the Government should take more notice of the things that are <Col N="955" /> at their very door and try to deal with them in a constructive manner.  If there is any district justice that the Minister thinks is not getting enough, he can give him an increase without bringing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I protest in the strongest manner on behalf of the constituency that I represent, on behalf of the farming community, on behalf of the unemployed, on behalf of the business people, against this proposal to increase the salaries of judges at the expense of the taxpayer and the ratepayer.  The Minister is unwise to ask some of the members of his own Party to vote for this Bill.  There are some honest men in the Fianna Fáil Party who do not agree with everything that the Fianna Fáil Government are doing.  This is one of the matters with which they do not agree.  The head of the Government was unwise to send the Minister in here to ask the House to vote for increases in salaries for people who are already well sheltered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to say in this debate has already been said and I intend to be very brief.  I cannot agree with the views expressed by Deputy O'Leary on Part II of this Bill, principally because I regard the position of the judiciary as being of great importance and I regard the safeguards which we have to grant to them through the Dáil as being also of great importance.  It is correct for this House to give expression to its approval of the advice given by the Select Committee of this House on judges' salaries which is contained in Part II of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other parts of this Bill, however, contain matters of a much more contentious kind and differences of opinion on both sides of the House, and I think in the legal profession itself, will be found on the matters contained in this Bill relating to the increase in jurisdiction in the courts and the extra High Court judge who is to be appointed under the Bill.  I do not agree that the Circuit Courts should have jurisdiction up to £600.  I do not think it is correct that the rule-of-thumb method which has been <Col N="956" /> applied in this case should be applied when dealing with such an important matter as a man's right to claim damages for a sum up to £600.  I do not think it is a correct view to state that just because the first Courts of Justice Act created a limit of £300 for Circuit Court jurisdiction, and just because the value of money has doubled since, that we should automatically increase the jurisdiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The value of money is halved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because the value of money is halved, I do not think that we should automatically double the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  The figure of £600 is still a big sum whether the value of money is halved or not.  We are in effect taking away the right of trial by a jury to a man who believes that he is entitled to recover £600 from a defendent in an action.  Under the present Circuit Court rules, it is possible for a plaintiff to serve notice of trial with a jury.</P>
      <P>It is very rarely availed of.  At present it is only in very rare cases that a person has a trial in the Circuit Court with a jury in a civil action.  To my mind, the result of increasing the jurisdiction to £600 will be that it is very likely that where a person is claiming a sum up to the maximum of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court he will wish to have his case tried by a jury as well as by a judge and, whereas he will be entitled under the Circuit Court rules, as they exist at present, to a trial by a jury in the Circuit Court, an appeal from any such trial to the High Court will be, under the rules, an appeal to a judge without a jury.</P>
      <P>We have, therefore, a situation which I would deplore where a man who claims that he is entitled to a jury to hear his claim for £600 may win his action in the Circuit Court and may get a verdict from a jury, and he may have to face an appeal by the defendant before a judge without a jury, where all the issues and all the questions of fact are retried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer that the Circuit Court should not have jurisdiction up to £600.  I think the jurisdiction should be increased to £400.  I think a citizen's right to go to the High Court on an action should not be taken away in this fashion.  I agree that the value of money has declined and that the jurisdiction should be increased, but I do not think it should be automatically doubled, and I would suggest a figure of £400 as a very proper figure for Circuit Court jurisdiction. If the section remains in the Bill, there should be some provision by which, if there is a trial by a jury in the Circuit Court, and if there is an appeal from the findings of the judge and jury in the Circuit Court, there should be an automatic appeal on a question of law, not on fact, to the Supreme Court, similar to the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  There should be some rule under the rules of court by which, if there has been a trial by a judge and jury in the Circuit Court, there should not be an appeal to the High Court on all issues as there is at present, but only an appeal on a point of law to the Supreme Court, as there is in the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also disagree with the obvious compromise that has been reached in this Bill between the Department of Finance and the Department of Justice.  It is quite clear that the Department of Finance objected to the extra payments that the Department of Justice demanded and found a way of meeting the demands of the Department of Justice by cutting down on other aspects of the judiciary.  We are now in the almost paradoxical position of giving the Circuit Courts more work to do and reducing the number of Circuit Court judges.  In theory at any rate, we are taking away work from the High Court by increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and putting an extra judge in the High Court.  That is quite obviously the result of interference by the <Col N="958" /> Department of Finance in what I would consider to be a properly drafted Courts of Justice Bill.  I do not think this House should allow it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the circuits should not be reduced in the fashion that is intended in this Bill.  I am not qualified to speak about the District Courts in the country.  It may be that in some districts in the country there is not sufficient work for the District Court divisions as they exist at present, and there may be a case for the rationalisation of these.  I am convinced, however, that it is wrong to reduce the number of circuits and the number of Circuit Court judges just at the time we are increasing the work they have to do.</P>

      <P>The general experience throughout the country has been that in the Circuit Courts, as in the High Court, the delay has been in getting litigation heard, and it should be the desire of this House, as I know it is the desire of both branches of the legal profession, to see that cases get a speedy trial.  I do not think we will help litigants to get their cases heard if we increase the work which judges have to do and at the same time reduce the number of judges.  At the most, I think only one Circuit Court judge may not have what can be regarded as a full complement of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, but I have no doubt that the effect of this Bill will be to increase the work in the Circuit Courts.  For example, there is nothing in this Bill, or that I know of in the rules of court or the Courts of Justice Act for the remittal of cases from the Circuit Court to the District Court.  After all, £50 is a substantial sum of money, and I think we will find that a lot of cases will not be tried in the District Court, but that litigants will like to have them heard in the <Col N="959" /> Circuit Court from which they will have an appeal to the High Court.  We have got to safeguard the right of people to go to the High Court in this country, and if people start cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But I do not think the Deputy's experience will blind him to the right of everybody to have an appeal tried before the High Court, and under present circumstances an appeal from the District Court to the High Court is a final appeal, and the less cases we have in that category the better, I think.  The desire of the legislature would, I think, be to bring in Courts of Justice Acts which would facilitate the hearing of cases as quickly as possible.  I do not think we are doing it under this Bill.  I would say by greatly increasing the amount of work the courts are doing at the moment you are going to increase the delay that litigants have already.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion.  I would have liked to have seen the Minister pay some regard to the suggestions which were contained in a recent report published a couple of weeks ago from a committee <Col N="960" /> of the British House of Commons on the question of procedure in the High Court and Supreme Court in Great Britain.  To my mind one very valuable suggestion in that report was the increased power which it was suggested should be given to the Master of the High Court in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is clear he is in a quasi-judicial capacity.  I see nothing wrong with that.  I think there are a number of interlocutory matters which could be fixed before the Master of the High Court which at present are not so fixed and which would greatly lessen the work of the High Court. This, I think, would speed up trials and cheapen litigation.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, because the Master's jurisdication is determined by the Courts of Justice Acts.  The rules of court cannot give him any greater jurisdication than he has at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>

      <P>I think it has been questioned correctly.  I think in practice that all cases that could be submitted to the Supreme Court are not, and are put in the judges' list itself. It is a very simple matter which would lessen the work in the court and speed up litigation.  That is one instance of what could be done, if we had examined properly, the giving of greater powers to the Master of the High Court.  As I see it, there are matters&mdash;one of which, the question of the jurisdiction of the Master, is not in this Bill, but the others with which <Col N="961" /> I disagree are in this Bill and I think this Bill will have to be amended if not in Committee then by subsequent Courts of Justice Acts.</P>

      <P>As far as the Labour Party is concerned&mdash;I think I could safely say this&mdash;with regard to the bigger portion of this Bill, that is from Part III onwards, we would be pretty well unanimous in our approval of it.</P>
      <P>I would like to say in respect of one of the Fianna Fáil speakers, Deputy Moran, that the Deputy to my mind usually makes a very good speech, but I think his contribution on this particular Bill was one of the best he has made in the House and I can say, for myself in any case, as did Deputy O'Donnell, that I would agree with practically everything he said inasmuch as that, from Part III onwards, there are a number of what I might describe as politically contentious things on which the Minister ought to take his advice on this occasion.  I am not advocating entirely that there be free votes of the House on the different amendments that might come up on the Committee Stage, but in view of the very valuable information we got from solicitors and barristers, both yesterday and to-day, I think this would be one of the very few occasions on which the House could help the Minister in framing a better Bill than that which he introduced.</P>
      <P>The usual experience, so far as Oppositions are concerned&mdash;and I do not say it is peculiar to this particular Dáil&mdash;is that the Minister brings in a particular Bill and steamrolls it through the House.  That is not peculiar to the Minister for Justice.  It has been happening since the State was established.  There may have been valuable suggestions, and inasmuch as all of us agree on most of the principles involved in the Bill, there could be something akin to, or there could be free votes on the different amendments that might be proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the position of the solicitor members and barrister members of the House I would not deny the right of a lawyer, solicitor or barrister to speak in the House on a measure such <Col N="962" /> as this.  I would not take any exception to the fact that we have had a predominance of legal Deputies speaking on it and I do not think they should be accused of any ulterior motive when they speak on a measure such as this.  If that were to be the case, farmers should not speak on agricultural matters and labour members on questions of employment, or doctors on medical matters.  That is a brief comment of my own because I protested here before against slights on members because of the particular profession they followed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>It has lingered in this House for quite a long time.</P>
      <P>On this particular part to which we take exception, we do not feel any embarrassment in opposing it, nor have we any pretence about our opposition to this.  We are, in fact, laying ourselves open to the accusation that it is so much political propaganda. Some Deputies said it was obvious that we tried to make a propaganda use of it, and one Deputy said he could not understand why the Labour Party would oppose these increases; that as trade unionists we should be pleased to support any increases that might be suggested in respect of salaries, no matter what the salaries or who the individuals were.  I have listened to the debate in this House for the past two days barring, say, a half an hour or an hour.  I have heard every single Deputy get up and make reference to the proposal to increase the salaries of the particular gentlemen catered for in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant thing was that whilst they said that it was a good thing to increase the salaries of District Justices, they did not wax enthusiastic about it.  We did not hear much eloquence about the district justices. The strange part of it also was that there was not one Deputy to applaud the Minister for his proposal to increase the salaries of the High Court judges and the judges of the Supreme Court.  One Deputy merely threw in the Circuit Court judges <Col N="963" /> when he mentioned the district justices' case for an increase.</P>
    <P>I have read the report of the Select Committee.  I might say in passing, because there has been some criticism of our not agreeing to become members of the committee, that we did not become members because we believed and I still believe, that the only reason the Government invited the setting up of that committee was that they were not prepared themselves to take full responsibility for introducing a measure such as they have introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall agree to differ on that.  I do not agree with some of the arguments which have been put up by various Deputies.  The emphasis last night was on the desire <Col N="964" /> to preserve and protect the independence of the judiciary.  I would be all for that.  I think none of us has cast a slur, or there has been no intention of casting a slur on the judiciary but the emphasis last night and to-day has been on the necessity to pay them sufficiently to preserve their independence. I do not understand that line of argument, because that immediately gives rise to the question of how much is it going to cost the State to preserve the independence of any of these gentlemen, whether they be Supreme Court judges, High Court judges, circuit judges, or district justices.  How do we measure the independence of the judiciary?  I am not against paying a man a decent salary but I would resent the suggestion&mdash;I shall not say the allegation&mdash;that has been put forward by some Deputies that if we do not give them a certain amount of money as salary or a certain increase, there is liable to be corruption on the Bench.  I do not think that is so.  I am certain that this Government and Governments in the past have picked their men so that they would be in all circumstances free from any suggestion of corruption.</P>
      <P>A case has been made by these gentlemen themselves and the Select Committee have subscribed to the submissions that have been made.  I have noticed in respect of the Circuit Court judges and the High Court judges that they have based their case on certain facts.  It seems to me, because they mention it first, that they regard this as one of the most important arguments in their favour&mdash;that agricultural wages since 1938 have increased by 170 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a lovely comparison.  Everybody in this House has agreed, and still agrees, that the agricultural wage was so abnormally low in 1938, that it had been so for many years and still is, that the efforts of all members of this House should be directed to bringing it up to a proper standard and to provide for a suitable increase when the cost of living goes up.  The argument used in favour of an increase for the Supreme Court and High Court judges is a comparison of the salaries of certain higher civil servants in the <Col N="965" /> year 1924 as compared with 1952.  I think it should be remembered as well, that an increase was given to the judges and justices in the year 1947. On that occasion a High Court judge got a 20 per cent. increase, a Supreme Court judge got a 15 per cent, increase, a Circuit Court judge got a 25 per cent. increase and district justices got an increase of 30 per cent.  I am not saying that it was not due to them, in view of the fact that they had not got an increase since 1924, which possibly was the year in which their salaries were originally fixed.  It is now proposed to give district justices an increase of 34 per cent. which would mean that on his original salary, a district justice would get 75 per cent. Yet the submission here is that the average increase in the case of top civil servants from 1924 to 1952 was 50 per cent.  I am not prepared to take strong exception to increasing the salaries of district justice.  Possibly a case could be made for it, but I am questioning the justice of giving them a 34 per cent. increase now when a 30 per cent. increase was given in 1947.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies here have also spoken about the congestion in the courts.  I think the Select Committee made a very admirable suggestion to try to eliminate that problem.  I think the public should take notice of this and I am sure the Minister is taking notice of it.  Whilst many of us have not any great experience of the courts, we know that in many District Courts in this country justice is administered in a slot-machine-like fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good description.  I do not suggest that people do not get justice.  The people who attend the District Court do not see justice administered.  They do not hear justice administered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Brendán Mac Fheórais Brendán Mac Fheórais">
      <NameTxt>Brendán Mac Fheórais</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the justice should take more time.  The ordinary man in the street who commits a trivial offence, such as having no lights on his bicycle, does not <Col N="966" /> have a chance.  It is quicker for the court and for him to pay his 5/- fine and get out.  Whether that is good or bad I do not know.  I think it is an appropriate description to say that in some of the District Courts justice is administered in a slot-machine fashion.  Since this Select Committee has suggested longer working days, longer sittings and shorter vacations the people may get a proper appreciation of the courts and feel that, when summoned, they are getting a fair chance and their case is fully heard.</P>
      <P>The only reason why I intervened in the debate was because of the reference to what I said on this particular issue in the Wicklow by-election.  If the Ceann Comhairle will allow me, I will repeat what I said and I will prove in three minutes that it was the Fianna Fáil vote that elected the Fine Gael candidate and not the Labour vote.</P>

      <P>One of my objections to this Bill is because of the submission made that the £ now in terms of 1938 values is worth only 8/11. It is pretty rough on certain people to have that put forward as an argument for giving an increase of £450 a year to a particular individual.  Whoever was responsible for the commission of that gaffe has a lot to answer for.  If that argument is to be advanced in favour of a gentleman who has £4,600 per year, it ought to be used too with regard to other sections of the community to whom the Government has direct responsibility.  Because the £ to-day compared with 1938 is only worth 8/11, the man with £4,600 has to get an increase of £250, or £5 per week. Obviously, we will have to pay heavily for responsibility.  I will not be allowed to go into the matter here, but what would that argument mean to the man with 21/6 per week?</P>

      <P>We might be <Col N="967" /> accused of inciting the unemployed and making political propaganda out of their marches.  These people can read the papers for themselves.  There is a time and a place for everything.  Is it right to use that particular argument in favour of granting an increase to men who have from £1,300 per year up to £4,600 when there are people whose case demands that they should be treated on the same basis but who have not been so treated?  That is what I said in Wicklow.  I repeat it here now.  Because we believe in the arguments that have been adduced by our speakers, we are opposing this Bill.  We are not opposing it for Parts III, IV and V.  We are opposing it because of the provisions contained in Part II.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Labour Party has taken up that attitude.  I would have liked to have had them on the Select Committee but evidently they know their own business better.  I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that civil servants have had four increases in salary as between the time the judiciary received its last increase and to-day.  When everybody else in the State has got an increase, and when the £ has deteriorated in value, surely the judges are entitled to be considered just as well as everybody else.  I think they are entitled to be restored to the position they were in when the courts were first established.  But we are not doing that.  We are giving them a smaller percentage increase than some civil servants have got.  I have here a list of civil servants.  They have received four increases since 1946.  A man with £1,000 a year in 1924, has got an increase of 58 per cent. and he has been enjoying that for some time; the man with £1,100 has got an increase of 56 per cent.; a man with £1,200, has got an increase of 78 per cent. and a man with £1,700 has got an increase of 68 per cent.  The Labour Party is not satisfied with that.  They want to give the civil servants more.</P>

I am not ashamed of introducing this Bill. I know the position I will have to meet in my own constituency and I am prepared to stand or fall if necessary, in order to do justice to a section of the community that has not got fair play. The Labour Party and the little Party opposite are quite at liberty to make all they can out of that.  These increases in salary are long overdue.</P>
      <P>I have been taken to task by Deputy Morrissey for not implementing in full the recommendations of the Select Committee; that is, to make the increases retrospective to 1st April, 1952.  The Government considered the matter and they were satisfied that on the whole since the provision made now for increases both for district justices and Circuit Court judges is more favourable than originally suggested, the judiciary was being treated fairly well, by making the increases retrospective to 1st April of this year.  I hope that Deputy Morrissey will not adhere to his statement that in future he will not serve on any more Select Committees because we turned down that recommendation.  In the main, I think we have given effect to the recommendations of the Committee, and I would be sorry if Deputy Morrissey withheld his services in the future because he gave excellent service on this particular Committee.  Deputy Costello said that this was apparently a device of the Minister for Finance; he would not agree to these increases unless he got his <i>quid pro quo.</i>  There is no truth whatever in that.  The Opposition must be aware that the proposal to extend the jurisdiction of both the District Court and the Circuit Court was under consideration before I resumed office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to reducing the strength of the District Court and the Circuit Court, there are five Circuit Courts in which there is less than 100 days' work <Col N="969" /> in the year.  Even if there is an increase in business as a result of increasing the jurisdiction, I do not think the Circuit Court judges will be overworked.  We are simply reverting to the number that was there prior to 1936; there were only eight circuits then, and that is the number we shall have after this Bill becomes law. Deputy Costello objected very strongly to Section 12, and so did almost every Deputy who spoke on the Bill.  It deals with the transfer of cases from the Circuit Court to the Central Criminal Court.  I am satisfied as I said when moving the Second Reading of the Bill that the position as it is has been abused&mdash;that at least half the cases heard in the Central Criminal Court in Dublin are cases that have been transferred from the Circuit Court in Dublin.  That tendency is increasing, the result being that almost the whole of the time of a High Court judge is taken up with work which should properly be done by the Circuit Court.  That was my main reason for asking the House to accept the proposal in the Bill.  Strong exception has been taken to the section on all sides of the House, and I will not persist with it.  If amendments are introduced I am prepared to consider them though I still think that there is a good deal of abuse in connection with the present practice. After all a person gets a fair trial in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to see about that.  On the question of having an extra High Court judge I had to be convinced about that before agreeing to it.  Deputy Costello, Senior, said <Col N="970" /> that we did not consult certain interests before we drafted the Bill.  That is not correct.  I saw the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society. The Taoiseach and myself met the President of the High Court and the Chief Justice.  All of them urged the necessity of appointing an extra High Court judge due to the congestion of work in the High Court.  There has been a large increase in the number of cases and they convinced us that there was a good deal of congestion.  For the present at any rate the appointment of an extra High Court judge is necessary.  I know that previously when I was Minister for Justice we had authority to appoint more High Court judges than actually we had functioning.  When the arrears are cleared off and as a result of the increased jurisdiction the time may come when whatever Government is in power need not appoint the full complement of High Court judges.  On the question of the increased power being given to the Master I intend to bring in an amendment to deal with that.  We discussed that matter with the representatives of the Supreme and High Courts.  They did not think it would make an appreciable difference.  In any event I propose to move an amendment to provide for the giving of more power to the Master to deal with certain matters.</P>
      <P>The question of the long vacation has been discussed.  I think that the judges are prepared to do what they can in that regard.  After hearing their point of view on that and the case made by the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council one is led to form a different impression from that held by a number of people as to what the long vacation means.  It is not quite as bad as it looks.  At any rate the judges promised to consider curtailing it so as to knock out some of the vacation period in the hope of getting more work done.</P>

      <P>That was dealt with too, but it does not seem to be <Col N="971" /> practicable.  The point has been made by a number of Deputies who have spoken on the Bill that people who are engaged in litigation find it necessary to see their solicitors and counsel before the court opens.  The solicitors themselves have to go to their offices.  In jury cases it was pointed out that jurors who are business men have to call to their places of business in the morning before the Court opens.  I have gone thoroughly into the whole of this and I am satisfied that the judges are going to do what they can to expedite the work.  If another High Court judge is appointed the appointment need not be continued when the present congestion has been relieved and there is a vacancy.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary dealt with the question of a High Court in Cork.  As far as I am concerned I am quite anxious to see that.  I quite agree that if there is a case for having a High Court in Cork there may also be a case for other parts of the country.  We can start with Cork.</P>

      <P>There is.  If the proposals which have been made here by different Deputies who want to increase the jurisdiction still further are to be considered I am afraid they will take a lot of consideration.  In fact I would not see much hope of getting this Bill through in a hurry.  Deputy D. Costello does not think there is a case for increasing the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court beyond £400.  I do not see how he could make his case for that.  As I have said there has been a drop in the value of money.  Take a motor car that was worth £270 in 1939. It is now worth about £600.  If there was an action about it it would have to be tried in the High Court whereas in 1939 it could have been tried in the Circuit Court.</P>

      <P>If Deputies want to put down amendments about the increased <Col N="973" /> jurisdiction I will consider what can be done about them.  I think we have increased the jurisdiction fairly well as it is.  Apparently Deputy O'Donnell wants Donegal solicitors appointed for Donegal.  I suppose the people in Connemara would say the same so that they will be able to understand the Irish of their clients.  It may not be always easy to do that.</P>

Now, apparently, the case is being made for <Col N="974" /> reversion to the position that existed prior to that.</P>

      <P>In page 4, Section 9, to delete lines 40 to 47 and substitute as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> (a)  that institutional services shall be given in the institution to persons of a class specified by reference to their condition of health, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that institutional services shall not be given in the institution to persons of a class specified by reference to their condition of health.</P>
    <P>When this particular section was being discussed in Committee some Deputies expressed doubt as to the exact meaning of it.  Some Deputies thought it might give an opportunity to us of directing people of a particular class into any institution.  I think on consultation with the draftsman it could hardly be interpreted in that way, but to make doubly sure, I think it is now drafted in such a way that that interpretation could not be given to it, and that the patient can only be classified in accordance with his condition of health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know what we are agreeing to.  The section as amended would now read:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">&ldquo;SECTION 9.</P>
      <P>The Minister may, by Order made in respect of a specified health institution, direct&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  that institutional services shall be given in the institution to persons of a class specified by reference to their condition of health, or</P>
      <P>(b) that institutional services shall not be given in the institution to persons of a class specified by reference to their condition of health.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has introduced an amendment for the purpose of showing that he is not proceeding on a class basis.  But the Minister is taking power in this section to decide that certain classes of work shall not be done by surgeons, that certain classes of work will not be carried out by a physician in particular health institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister take power to <Col N="978" /> interfere with the working of a county surgeon in a county surgical hospital or to interfere with some particular class of work that the hospital is doing?  Can he then, say, prevent appendices being taken out in a particular institution?  Can he decide that a gall-bladder or a heart operation, instead of being carried out in the county hospitals in Clare, say, or Kerry, will be carried out, say, in Limerick?  He would have power under this section to list certain classes of operation, or to see that they were regionalised. Generally, our county surgeons are up to a very high standard now and I do not know that the Minister should require power to limit the type of work done by any particular surgeon.  He would appear to be taking power to do that.  From another point of view the Minister is taking power to decide that in certain county hospitals certain classes of medical treatment will not be given.  I think we would require some explanation from the Minister as to why he proposes to interfere in that particular kind of way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 6, Section 15, to insert the following sub-section before sub-section (9):&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(9) Where a decision taken in pursuance of paragraph (b) of sub-section (2) of this section is a decision that the yearly means of the adult person are not less than £600, an appeal shall lie from the decision to <Col N="979" /> a person appointed by the Minister, and regulations may make provision with respect to the making and determination of appeals under this sub-section.</P>
    <P>On Section 15 a discussion arose on this matter, and the amendment is put in arising from this long discussion which took place in regard to appeals. First of all, I should say there are two questions on which an appeal might be acceptable: number one is whether a person is entitled to services or not, and number two whether they are getting that service or not having been pronounced as being entitled to it.  I think it was agreed generally at the end that an appeal was not necessary on the second question&mdash; whether a person was getting a service or not&mdash;because it was pointed out that the Minister has ample power to deal with any complaint that may be made to him in regard to any question of neglect or refusal of service.  The Minister has power to inquire into that and to deal with the persons concerned if they are not carrying out their duties.  On the other point&mdash; whether a person is entitled to services or not&mdash;various suggestions were made and in particular in two directions: (1) whether that appeal should lie to the courts or (2) to the Minister.  It was generally agreed by the Dáil, I think, that the Minister personally could not hear these appeals and then it was suggested that there might be a person appointed by the Minister. I have decided on the whole that that is a better alternative than the courts and I am submitting this amendment for the agreement of the Dáil.  I do not think there can be any dispute on the means of farmers because it is very definitely laid down that if his valuation is £50 or less he and his family are entitled to certain benefits. Neither can there be any dispute as to whether a person is insured or not because if necessary a certificate will be issued by the Department.  The only possibility of a dispute is on the £600 means test and what might lead to trouble there is that it is family income that is concerned, not personal income.  I think, therefore, it is <Col N="980" /> advisable to have an appeal not only in the interest of a person that might have a grievance but also in order to try to get uniformity among the health authorities, because if we have one person deciding appeals the tendency will be to get this uniformity generally and therefore I am submitting this amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputies might like to know what I have in mind.  What I have in mind is an appeals officer very much on the same lines as we have under the Social Welfare legislation.  It will be done by regulations and the procedure will follow rather closely on the lines we have in Social Welfare.  I think that will work fairly satisfactorily.  I think that the amendment as submitted would satisfy most of the Deputies who spoke on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Frankly, I am somewhat surprised at the nature of the amendment that the Minister has put down and not with any sense of opposition but rather considering the background of the debate we had on the Committee Stage.  As I recall the debate on the amendment put down by the Labour Party, very strong stress was laid on the difficulties which arise in regard to the exercise of the right of appeal to the Minister where that would arise in respect of the determination of means.  It will be recalled that I emphasised that we were more concerned with the question of a person's right to particular services and that we were not anxious to raise difficulties in regard to the transference of appeals in respect of means to the Minister.  Now in the amendment emphasis is laid, in fact, on the right of appeal to an appeals officer in respect to one type of question which will arise in regard to the determination of means.  It is well that we should know at the same time that the question of the limitation, or in fact the taking away of the Minister's power as set out in the Bill originally, has <Col N="981" /> now been dropped so that the Minister still retains the power which he had under the 1947 Health Act in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the case now put by the Minister in support of the amendment, he points out that the one question of the determination of means which might give rise to difficulties is in respect to the class of persons with an income of under £600 a year, mainly because what has to enter into the calculation is the question of the family means.  I think there will be general agreement that there should be such a method of appeal, but there is another equally and probably more important class, the class dealt with in Section 14, namely, the lower income group who are defined as those persons who are &ldquo;unable to provide by their own industry or other lawful means the medical, surgical, ophthalmic or dental treatment or medicines or medical, surgical or dental appliances necessary for themselves or their dependents.&rdquo;  Here we have got a fairly difficult problem because it is somewhat difficult to determine the means of a person in receipt of unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  The means they have got has to be related, not to the question of the maintenance of the individual or his family, but to the capacity of these means to provide medical, surgical, ophthalmic or dental treatment and the appliances necessary for themselves and their dependents.  That is a matter on which there could be very wide differences of opinion between the official responsible for dealing with the people and the individual applicant. Everybody is aware that there are all kinds of opinions as to what should be the cost of medical treatment. That difference of opinion can equally show itself in relation to the question of determining whether an applicant's means are such as to enable him to provide for this treatment or services by reason of his own industry or other lawful means, or whether that is outside his capacity. As the amendment stands, it appears that that particular person would not be able to take advantage of this machinery of appeal, whereas the person <Col N="982" /> whose claim to the benefits of the Act would be dependent on whether or not he fell within the group with less than £600 a year, could utilise this machinery.  The Minister has dealt with the grounds on which he has provided this machinery of appeal in respect to persons who would fall within the £600 category, but he has not touched upon the category of persons indicated in Section 14.  Perhaps he might like to make some comment on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>There were three separate and distinct points involved in regard to the question of the right of appeal.  There was, first of all, the question whether or not there should be any appeal from the determination of the local health authority or the county manager.  I am very glad that in that respect the Minister has met the views which were put forward by the Labour Party and ourselves as to the necessity for the right of appeal. The next question that was involved was to whom the appeal should lie. I think conflicting points of view have been expressed on whether the appeal should lie to an official or whether it should lie to the district justice.  I am dealing now only with the question of the limited right of appeal which is embodied in the Minister's amendment as distinct from the more general right of appeal to which Deputy Larkin has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I take the view that there is danger in constantly vesting more and more powers in the hands of officials whose determination is reached behind closed doors and whose determination may be reached without hearing the person who is involved or without giving such person any information as to the basis on which the appeal may be turned down.  I think there is a growing tendency to vest semi-judicial powers of that nature in officials.  I would much prefer to have an appeal of this kind determined in accordance with set rules of procedure which enabled the person involved to know at least the case he or she had to meet.  An appeal in this type of case will be determined by an officer of the Department who will, no doubt, be largely influenced by whatever <Col N="983" /> reports he has in front of him, reports from some other official.  He may also be influenced largely by the general policy of the Department at the time. In turn, that policy will, no doubt, be largely influenced by the policy of the Department of Finance.  I am not saying that that is confined to the Department of Finance of this Government or any other Government, but inevitably the Department of Finance will want to economise.  That is their function and inevitably they will, from time to time, ask the Department of Social Welfare, or the Department of Health or other Departments, to apply measures of stringency.  It would be inconceivable that officers of this Department in dealing with claims of this nature would avoid being influenced by such general considerations.</P>
    <P>I think for all these reasons it would be much wiser to let the person who claims that he is entitled to services to prosecute his appeal before the District Court without any formality and let the district justice determine the merits of that appeal.  I do not suppose that at this stage I can persuade the Minister to change the course he has adopted, but quite apart from the provisions of this particular Bill, I think that the tendency to vest more and more power in officials and to delegate more and more authority to officials of the Department to determine the rights of the public, in a semi-secret fashion is becoming more common, and I think the House should be alive to that danger and try to protect both itself and the public generally from that in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 is worked on the basis that our population can be divided into three sections: 1,000,000 people fall within the public assistance group; the next 1,000,000 fall within the middle income group and the third in the higher income group.  That division conceives two border lines or partition lines running through the population.  Power is given to the county manager, a single individual, to decide as to the particular class in which any individual is to be placed and he then becomes entitled to the benefits and services provided <Col N="984" /> under the Bill according to the county manager's decision.  The Minister realises that on the border line between the public assistance group and the middle income group there will be cases of doubt.  Decisions will be given. Grievances will be expressed.  In the case of the people on the border line between the middle income group and the higher income group where the family income is around the £600 level decisions made by the county manager may give rise to complaint and grievance.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his amendment proposes to appoint an appeals officer in his own Department to hear appeals on behalf of the people on the partition line dividing the £600 group from those above them.  But he proposes to deny to the members of the population around the lower line&mdash;that is, the line dividing the home assistance group from the middle income group&mdash;any right of appeal.  Deputy Larkin pointed out the absurdity of putting an appeals officer in in reference to one line of division but denying the right of appeal to an appeals officer in the case of those who have grievances in regard to the first division line.</P>
      <P>What type of problem will arise at the division line between the £600 individual and the person above which will be different, from the point of view of assessment and decision and, therefore, from the point of view of complaint, from that which will arise between the public assistance group and the lower level of the middle income group?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Apropos what Deputy Larkin has said, I do not see any particular virtue in confining the right of appeal to the interpretation of a person's means.  It is possible that a number of other disputes will arise as to a person's entitlement to certain types of treatment.  That is most likely to arise in the lower income group, and I think it is unwise of the Minister to keep out the right of appeal there.  It would be much more satisfactory to allow the appeals officer to deal with any kind of appeal and I see no reason why the Minister should shut the door against appeals except in respect of <Col N="985" /> means.  If the Minister pleads that he does not anticipate any such case arising, well and good.  The time of the appeals officer then will not be taken up.  If, however, such cases do arise there should be some method of having the appeal heard by someone other than the body which came to the decision in the first instance.  I suggest the Minister should have a look at the matter again to see whether in fact any good purpose is served by limiting the appeal to means only.  It would be better to give the appeals officer an opportunity of considering any appeal.</P>
      <P>As to who should decide appeals quite frankly I think the civil servant can be relied upon to discharge his duties conscientiously with due regard to the public well-being, and from that point of view I think the civil servant would be the most suitable appointment. Those who have had experience of appeals officers under our social welfare code will acknowledge that not only were they painstaking and helpful but they went to considerable trouble in order to establish the right of individuals to the benefits provided by legislation.  On the whole, I think an appeals officer appointed by the Minister is as suitable a piece of appeals machinery as can be devised. I would like to ask the Minister, however, whether the appeals officer he has in mind is a kind of statutory officer to whom an appeal will be submitted and whose decision will be final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be final, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Or will the appeal be subject to confirmation by the Minister or an official higher than the appeals officer?  If we set up an appeals officer, we should give him absolute power to decide for or against rather than leave his decision open to ratification by other persons who will not have access to the information the appeals officer had in the first instance. I would like from the Minister some indication as to what he has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended that the decision of the appeals officer will be final.  There is no change so far as the lower income group is concerned. <Col N="986" /> They were the public assistance group up to this.  In fact, there was no change even when county managers were appointed.  These people have always had the same rights, namely, the right of getting a ticket from the warden.  That right remains and I do not think there is any necessity for an appeal there.  It might be argued that a warden would refuse to give a ticket.  At the moment that would be a very difficult question to deal with and I think we had better let it stand until we see how this scheme will work out.  I do not think there is any danger the lower income group will be badly treated or worse treated than they are at the moment; they are in the same position as they have been in for the last 60 or 70 years.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the middle income group is a new departure and for some time there may be some confusion about this £600 family income. I think the one appeals officer is a better idea because it may eventually bring uniformity of practice.  I want to correct a misapprehension that Deputy Larkin appears to have.  I have divested myself of the appeals that lay in the 1947 Act.  Appeal in relation to infectious diseases maintenance applications is gone and I do not think Deputies need worry about that. Every county manager knows now exactly what the policy is and there is not likely to be any dispute from this on.  In the beginning the fact that the Minister could hear appeals had the effect of making the provision fairly uniform all over the country.  It is working smoothly now.  I am referring to the appeal which is in the Schedule of repeals, sub-section (4), Section 44, of the 1947 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister care to examine the question as to whether at this stage he would not provide for widening the scope of the Bill?  Suppose a local county manager or a medical officer says a patient requires particular treatment, and that treatment is either very expensive or very difficult, and suggests alternative treatment, in that case the patient might say he did not want the alternative treatment and hold that he was entitled under the Act to get the other <Col N="987" /> treatment, and say that if that treatment would not be given to him he should have the right of appeal to the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time to-day, I addressed a question to the Taoiseach asking: &ldquo;If he were aware of the unprecedented flow of emigration from the Donegal Gaeltacht, due to unemployment in that area, and, if so, what immediate steps he proposed to take to stop this emigration flow.&rdquo; The Taoiseach, in the course of his reply through the Parliamentary Secretary, denied the fact that there was an unprecedented flow of emigration from the Donegal Gaeltacht.  When, in the course of a supplementary question, I said that there was an unprecedented flow, the Taoiseach interrupted me to say: &ldquo;Of course that is not true.  It does not matter who said it, it is not true.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary who replied, stated <i>inter alia</i>, that: &ldquo;Of the special allocation of £400,000 from moneys voted this year for the improvement of roads of tourist value, £50,000 is being allocated to County Donegal, and that most of it will be spent in or near the Gaeltacht and the Breac-Ghaeltacht.&rdquo;  If my recollection serves me rightly, those moneys were voted at the end of last year for expenditure on tourist roads in the Gaeltacht and in the Breac-Ghaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like now to tell the Taoiseach that there is an unprecedented flow from this cradle of the Irish <Col N="988" /> language, and further, I should like to tell him what the Donegal County Council, which have the administration of this allocation of £50,000, think of the allocation and of the manner in which it is proposed to spend it. I propose to quote from the <i>People's Press</i> of Saturday the 4th July, last. At a meeting of the Donegal County Council this was said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do those people in Dublin&mdash;referring to the Government&mdash;think we are imbeciles?  Despite all the talk that is going on in Dublin about our young men, women and children leaving the country, they hold up this scheme for four months. I think the thing is outrageous.  I think there is a Government inspector gallivanting around the country, and he considers that the county organisation cannot carry out the work.  Are they blind?  Have they seen all the machinery that is in the country?  In the Rosses, there was an allocation of £30,000, but, as yet, not one penny has been sanctioned by the Department or spent.  Any works that have been carried out are by way of taking from one fund and putting it into another.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The statement goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do these people see thousands of our finest young men and women leaving the country?  Surely, during the last three months they could have sanctioned the work and employed the men who are leaving. The letter states that the council's machinery is working at 50 per cent. capacity in the Rosses.  The Deputies should ask the Department for an explanation of this delay.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are the words of Councillor Seán Ó Cinnéide, a Fianna Fáil county councillor, and an official Fianna Fáil candidate at the last general election. There you have his indictment against the Government for denuding the Gaeltacht of its manhood and womanhood. Mark his words: &ldquo;Do these people in Dublin think we are imbeciles?  Do these people see thousands of our finest young men and women leaving the country?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To-day we had the Parliamentary Secretary and the Taoiseach himself <Col N="989" /> telling us that there is no unprecedented flow from the Gaeltacht.  On Saturday last, the 25th inst., the <i>Derry People</i> contained a report of a meeting that was held in the heart of the Gaeltacht at Derrybeg, Gweedore. The meeting was held under the auspices of a protest committee organised in Belfast.  This committee organised in Belfast, drew attention to the neglect of the Irish speaking areas by successive Irish Governments.  This was a meeting of a committee formed in Belfast to bring to the notice of the public generally, and particularly to the notice of the Government, how our Gaeltacht is being treated.  I propose to quote from a speech made by the chairman, Mr. Cathal McChrystal of Belfast, as reported in the <i>Derry People.</i>  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The object of the protest committee was to draw attention to the gross neglect of the Gaeltacht areas by national Governments.  It was not their intention or aim to tell the people of the Gaeltacht what they should do in regard to the Gaeltacht, but it was their intention to put the Irish Government to shame because of the manner in which the Gaeltacht had been neglected.  To see the way in which the Gaeltacht areas were being rapidly depopulated, one would think there was another famine in the country.  To-day, just as in 1846-47 the best of our Irish stock were leaving the country, carrying with them their country's most precious possession&mdash;the national language.  In regard to the mistreatment of the Irish speaking areas, there was no difference between the British Government they had known in the old days and the Irish Governments they knew to-day.  If the language died so too the nation died.  Something could yet be done to arrest the appalling neglect of the Gaeltacht which had contributed to the present ominous decline in the Irish speaking areas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the face of that statement, the Parliamentary Secretary stands up, backed by the Taoiseach, and tells us that our Gaeltacht has not been depopulated. We are told of the various schemes that it is proposed to put into <Col N="990" /> operation for the purpose of giving employment in the Gaeltacht.  We have been hearing that for the past 25 years, of schemes which it is proposed to put into operation to try and keep our people employed at home.</P>
    <P>I have been reading about the new hospital which is to be erected in the town of Dungloe.  I remember, as a member of this House attending a conference, accompanied by my fellow Deputies, with the then Minister for Health, in an endeavour to iron out the difficulties which had arisen between the Department and the local council.  I remember some three years ago being assured by the Department that all difficulties had been smoothed out, and that the erection of the hospital would proceed.</P>
    <P>I know that the Parliamentary Secretary, in his reply to-night, will tell me that they are about to build the hospital. We have been hearing that for years back.  We have been hearing, since 1936, that they are about to build the hospital.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Government.  Deputy Lynch, told us to-day that they propose proceeding with the Clady scheme which would give considerable employment in the Gaeltacht.  We have been hearing of that for the past six years. We have been told, and read some months ago in the <i>Sunday Press</i> that a turf-producing plant was about to be erected in Dungloe.  To-day, in reply to a question by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Tánaiste informed us that the exact location of that plant had not yet been decided.</P>

Is the Tánaiste aware that there is no such place as the townland of Gweedore.  Gweedore is a parish approximately nine miles in length and eight miles in width.  Whereabouts will this plant that is going to <Col N="991" /> employ the people of the Gaeltacht be situated?  To-day we heard the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I congratulate him on it&mdash;introducing an Estimate for a grass meal experiment. I merely asked one question: &ldquo;Is this grass meal experiment to be carried out in the Gaeltacht?&rdquo; The reply I got was: &ldquo;No, it would be in the Breac-Ghaeltacht.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Very good&mdash;the Gaeltacht.  Here we have the largest Gaeltacht in Ireland, the most thickly-populated Gaeltacht in Ireland and, I defy contradiction on it, a Gaeltacht well known to both Parliamentary Secretaries here present, a Gaeltacht visited by the Taoiseach two years ago, a Gaeltacht in which there were more Irish speakers than in any other Gaeltacht in Ireland and here we have a Fianna Fáil county councillor, a Fianna Fáil candidate at the last election, making this statement, and I agree with every word he said, about the Gaeltacht being denuded day after day.  Why was no effort made by the Parliamentary Secretary to have such an experiment carried out in the heart of Donegal?  I cannot understand it.</P>
      <P>I made an appeal here two years ago to the Tánaiste to help us to keep our people at home.  The first thing we require is electricity and power.  I asked him to extend into the Gaeltacht the E.S.B. network.  What do we find? It comes to the very fringe of the Gaeltacht, practically to Gweebarra Bridge, but there it stops.  We have these grand schemes on paper but no effort is being made to put them into practice. While that is the position we have people from the City of Belfast coming down to try to shame the Government into doing something for this cradle which will soon be vacant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot blame the present Government, and I do not wish to suggest that the present Government are completely to blame for depopulating <Col N="992" /> the area.

      <P>Of course, but cannot we get raw materials and industries in the Gaeltacht which could be developed, for instance, fishing, tomatoes. We are told this tomato scheme is a success.  I am a believer in it but not as it stands.  We require heat in every glasshouse and I am glad that the Minister accepted my advice and experimented with heat.  I want to see that scheme extended in the county. I want to see electricity there and I want to see these tomatoes canned.  I want to see the Dillon scheme of day-old chicks progressing from day to day. I want to see these chicks eventually put into cans in the area.  That can only be done with electricity.  We have some of the finest cockle strands in the coast.  We may laugh and sneer at them, but I have seen cockles in glass jars sold in the shops in England which were bottled in Boston, Massachusetts. <Col N="993" /> Is there any reason why our cockle strands could not have a labour content in the collection of cockles and the bottling of them?  I know of none.</P>
      <P>In the old days of the Congested Districts Board there was net making, barrel making, substantial loans to fishermen to purchase boats and gear. Deputies from the area now know the reply which these unfortunate fishermen receive from An Bord Iascaigh Mara.  We know the deposit which is required from them if they wish to secure gear for whatever craft they may have for fishing.</P>
      <P>I know that these plans may be difficult to put into operation but there is nothing to prevent it and there is nothing to prevent the Minister for Local Government sanctioning the expenditure of this £50,000 allocated to the county.  What is holding it up?  I am not a member of Donegal County Council but there is the indictment. The money was sanctioned; the plans were submitted, but they have never yet been sanctioned.  It is the Minister's fault and nobody else's and he cannot pass the buck.  There is the indictment by a Fianna Fáil county councillor.  I would appeal now to the Parliamentary Secretary to see that sanction is given for the expenditure of money on these plans forthwith.</P>

      <P>I do not understand why Deputy O'Donnell raised this question on the Adjournment at all.  He had nothing to tell us except quotations from a local paper about a county council meeting that dealt specifically with one subject and on subject only, the new scheme of this Government providing grants from voted moneys for the improvement and the repair of tourist roads, particularly in Gaeltacht areas all over the country.</P>
      <P>Under that scheme a sum of £50,000 was allocated for these roads in County Donegal.  That is something new and additional to all the other moneys allocated, and there was a general increase in road allocations by the Department of Local Government this year to Donegal and all other counties. But this £50,000 was in addition to all that other money which has been made available.  The row at the county council and all the talk of my friend, Councillor Seán Ó Cinnéide, whom I have known very well for many years, arose because of his dissatisfaction with the distribution of that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ó Domhnaill has stated that unemployment is rampant in Donegal and that there is an unprecedented flow of emigration from the Donegal Gaeltacht.  The information available to the Government would not bear out that statement.  The position is no worse this year than it was during the year there was another Government in office.  As a matter of fact, all the indications would go to show that it is <Col N="996" /> not even as bad.  Of course I agree that, while there is emigration of that nature and while there is any unemployment, there is a challenge to the Government, and this Government have accepted the challenge and are doing their best to meet it.  The reply which I gave on behalf of the Taoiseach to Deputy Ó Domhnaill's question to-day is an indication of the efforts that the Government are making to try to deal with that very serious problem, not alone in Donegal but in other Gaeltacht areas and all over the country, efforts which I hope will in due course meet with the success they deserve.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Domhnaill referred to the Clady hydro-electric scheme and the turf-fired station which will be situated in the Donegal Gaeltacht.  The history of the Clady hydro-electric scheme is rather interesting.  For the three and a quarter years the Coalition were in office Deputy Cormac O Breisleáin, now Leas-Cheann Comhairle, put down many questions to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I have one sample of a reply given on the 13th March, 1951:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am informed by the E.S.B. that their investigations regarding the rural electrification of the areas in West Donegal mentioned by the Deputy have shown that an extension of the scheme to these areas would be uneconomic, due principally to the high cost of a transmission line into this region.  The matter is being kept under continuous review by the board in the light of the extension of the board's networks in the county.  It is not, however, possible at this stage to give any indication as to when it may be feasible to give supply to West Donegal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other replies from 1948 down were couched in similar language.  Now we are getting somewhere.  Not alone have we launched the hydro-electric scheme, but we were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day that he hopes to have the contract for that advertised at the end of the year so that work could commence in the spring of 1953.  That is definite progress. <Col N="997" /> When that scheme is in operation it will give a large amount of employment to the residents in the Donegal Gaeltacht.  That is definite information.  There is also to be a turf-fired station, so that progress is being made because there is drive and enthusiasm behind it now which there was not before.</P>
    <P>I should like to go back again to the discussion which took place at the Donegal County Council on the 4th July, in connection with this Gaeltacht road scheme.  I have seen the report of the speech made by Councillor O Cinnéide, and Deputy O Domhnaill and Councillor O Cinnéide are natives of the same locality.</P>

      <P>The suggestion about unemployment and emigration cannot be sustained, according to the figures.  As a matter of fact, the figures go to show that any increase there has been in the numbers on the unemployment register is due practically solely to the effects of the new Social Welfare Act which came into operation in January last.</P>
      <P>I have said already that any information available would indicate that in fact there is no basis for the statement made, no matter from what source it came.  Councillor Ó Cinnéide was making a case for his own area and with a certain effect too, because I see that £15,000 of that £50,000 is being spent in the Kilmacrennan-Creeslough area and another £15,000 in the Gweebarra-Dungloe area, according to the letter from the Department of Local Government read at the county council meeting which gave rise to the discussion.</P>

      <P>A sum of £400,000 is provided.  It is only now that the scheme is getting into operation. Of course there were members of the Donegal County Council, Fianna Fáil members as well as others, who were dissatisfied with the allocation of the money.  They all wanted to be in on the ground floor, but that is not possible.  We must remember that it will take eight years to give effect to this proposal.  There will be £400,000 provided every year for eight years, unless, of course, another Coalition comes in and drops it, like they dropped a scheme of a similar nature before and decimated the population of Donegal and other Gaeltacht areas in the years 1948 and 1949.  That scheme is there now.  It is only in its infancy.  Next year the areas not provided for this year, both in Donegal and everywhere else, will have their chance so that all these roads, particularly in the tourist areas in the Gaeltacht, will be provided for and put in a state of repair.  That will be of immense value to the whole community in these localities from the tourist point of view.</P>
